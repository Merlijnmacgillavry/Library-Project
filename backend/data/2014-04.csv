Since drivers depend on these transport means to perform their activities, it is important to investigate how they behave inside the vehicles in order to facilitate their task and avoid any undesired consequences (e.g. congestion, accidents). Different components of the driving environment have an influence on the driving behavior and the main objective of this thesis is to identify the points where the driving behavior changes due to these driving factors. From the driving conditions the traffic flow and its composition, the road geometry, the traffic signs and the traffic lights are selected and are analyzed through the use of vehicle-based systems. The actual situation that occurs in the road is determined from cameras mounted on the vehicle. For the identification of the driving behavior a simple car-following model is used, the Helly model. The first part of this study consists of the estimation of the parameters of the car-following model, while the second part consists of the identification of the points where these parameters change due to the exogenous driving factors. The estimation of the parameters is achieved through an optimization procedure which uses a moving estimation window and searches for constant sets of parameters in that time window. The estimation model performs well only under car-following situations. When the car-following task is achieved, the change of lanes, the traffic lights and the changes in the traffic conditions are found to have an influence in the parameters of the Helly model. In contrast, the composition of traffic and the existence of on-ramps and off-ramps in the road do not influence the driving behavior. The proposed system captures the intra-heterogeneity in driver's behavior when performing the same action under the same circumstances. A future real-time application which would identify the driving behavior and the action points would be a valuable tool for the traffic management operations because the traffic flow phenomena could be recognized and predicted directly and more accurately. Another useful application could be found in traffic safety operations where the automated vehicles would be able to provide the right information in the appropriate phase.","longitudinal driving behavior; Helly car-following model; vehicle-based signals","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-05","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Albayrak, A. (mentor); Kraan, G. (mentor)","2014","During the last decade the procedure of hip arthroscopy became rapidly more popular in orthopedic surgery. Hip arthroscopy is a minimal invasive procedure that require only small incisions to perform the surgery. It is a relative difficult procedure with a long learning curve. This is because the anatomy of the hip joint is complex compared to other joints in the body. The hip joint is a ball and socketed joint surrounded by a capsule of ligaments. Although traction is applied on the patient’s leg there is still not much space available for surgery inside the joint. The instruments that are used during the procedure do not fit well with the complex anatomy. Due to the limited space that is available, soft tissue of the hip joints capsules must be removed to create better access and sight for surgery. To provide better access to the hip joint during the procedure of hip arthroscopy, the SpaceCrea is developed as part of this graduation project. It is a minimal invasive instrument that provides better accessibility in the hip joint during CAM removal by lifting the capsule with an inflatable device. An ellipse shaped balloon is inserted through a portal and by pressurizing it with saline the balloon will exert forces on the capsule and lift it to provide more space. This idea is developed by using a design process consisting of three phases, the analysis-, the concept development- and the embodiment-phase. To proof the feasibility of the idea, model calculations are made to understand the hip joint capsule behavior under external loads. Based on these calculations lifting the capsule by using an inflatable device is deemed to be feasible.","hip arthroscopy; minimal invasive surgery; balloon; inflating device; creating workspace; accessibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master specialisation Medisign","",""

(mentor); Ferreira, J.A. (mentor); Ramirez-Elizondo, L.M. (mentor)","2014","The transfer of energy between systems that are not connected by physical contact between them can be accomplished by wireless power transfer methods, through electromagnetic field or radiation between a primary-transmitter and a secondary-receiver section. In the particular field of e-mobility, inductive power transfer systems have been extensively studied and implemented over the last years, proving their effectiveness of powering the drivetrain of electric vehicles, by a magnetic field between a set of loosely coupled coils. The power is generated by a concentrated primary in the form of a pad, or a distributed coil on a roadway track and transferred to the secondary, mounted on the electric vehicle. The operating principles of inductive power transfer include the analysis of the generated magnetic field through the basic electromagnetic equations. Capacitive components are introduced on both sides of the layout, to compensate for the large leakage inductance due to the increased air-gap, indicated by the required clearance between the vehicle and the road. Further studies are conducted on the design of distributed systems, to investigate variations of single and multiphase layouts. Several topologies are introduced and categorized, according to the direction of the field generating current and the single or multiple phase generation of the primary flux. The design variations are analyzed through finite element simulations and the output performance is assessed using equivalent circuit representation. In the particular case of multiphase primary section designs, the interphase mutual inductance can cause power circulation between the primary loops of adjacent phases. The problem is addressed by introducing an adequately designed terminal correction setup, inversing the power circulation between the affected phases. Additionally, an optimization algorithm is introduced, to calculate the optimum parameter values of selected designs, according to limitations and conditions imposed by the application, based on finite element simulation results. The relations between the design parameters and the operation variables are estimated, by analytical calculations and experimental measurements. The accuracy of the generated values is increased by a multiple iteration process and examples of the implementation are calculated for both single and three phase topologies. The output performance of the optimized designs is estimated and compared in terms of efficiency and power delivery for different operating conditions and alignment positions.","inductive power transfer; interphase mutual inductance; optimization algorithm; quadrature pick-up","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","","",""

(mentor); Tuijthof, G.J.M. (mentor)","2014","Background: An ablation catheter with integrated high-frequency single element ultrasound transducers has been developed by Philips Research, which makes it possible to assess tissue-depth and lesion formation in real-time. The interpretation of the acquired ultrasound M-mode images is difficult due to a combination of cardiac motion and motion of the catheter itself. Objective The aim of this study is to develop and validate a simulation model that includes catheter and tissue motion and use this as a tool to gain insights in the effects of catheter motion on M-mode images and corresponding velocity profiles. Method A 2D simulation model, of a moving catheter with three integrated ultrasound transducers that observe contracting tissue, was developed. Comparison of simulated data with real ultrasound data was performed, among other tests, to validate the 2D simulation model. Validation criteria were based on predefined requirements. The validated simulation model was used to generate seventeen different output datasets varying with the frequency and amplitude of the cardiac \& catheter motion input signals. These datasets were used to analyse the effect of catheter motion on M-mode images and corresponding velocity profiles. Results The validation tests imply that the simulated data can serve as reliable replacements for real ultrasound data. Findings from the analysis of the simulated data suggest that cardiac velocity is underestimated when the catheter angle deviates from its perpendicular state in relation to the tissue and is overestimated when the catheter angle moves back to its perpendicular state. Moreover, when catheter motion dominates over cardiac motion the cardiac velocity may be estimated in the opposite direction as the actual direction of cardiac motion. Conclusion The validation tests insinuate that the simulation model meets the predefined requirements. The simulation increases understanding of the relation between catheter \& cardiac motion in M-mode images. The information that can be derived from an M-mode image can be used to estimate if catheter motion is dominating over cardiac motion. Furthermore, the findings obtained within this study can be used to evaluate if the estimated direction of the velocity of cardiac motion is correct and if the cardiac velocity is under- or overestimated.","catheter ablation; ultrasound; catheter motion; M-mode interpretation; velocity profile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-04-29","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

The thesis has the aim to compare the design of a foundation for an oil tank according to the European code and the American standard by pre-dimensioning the structural section. The thesis starts with a description of the methodologies used by the norms, in particular of the difference between each other in term of the method used. The API 650 uses the “old design method” called Allowable Stress Design (ASD) while the Eurocode uses the Limit State Design (LSD) method. Wind, seismic and dead loads acting on the foundations have been calculated. Regarding the earthquake and wind load, they have been calculated using the methods in the Eurocode and API 650 and comparing the results according to a case studied. The number of combination loads are also presented, because, in terms of number typology are different. Moreover three approaches of Limit State Design method considered have been evaluated. The possibility of the designer to picking one of them rather than the other, require discussing the results and making conclusions. The comparison has been done in according to the following structural parts: pre-dimension of the foundation section and longitudinal steel bars (for twisting and hoop stress only).","Tank Foundation; ASD; LSD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""

(mentor)","2014","The need to reduce harmful emissions to the environment is been addressed on different fronts. Diesel engines, as one of the prime movers in transport industry, has become an active research focus for several years in order to improve their efficiency while keeping the harmful emissions the lowest possible. The inclusion of more stringent regulations and emission control areas such as NECA in the north sea demands for a better understanding of the combustion process in the cylinder in order to reduce emissions. To study such problem an approach is to regard the cylinder as a perfectly mixed volume. This concept is very simple and allows for fast calculations but it lacks the physics and the resolution necessary to study pollutants formation. The main objective of this thesis is to propose a model where the cylinder volume is divided into a few volumes, so the cylinder process can be studied in more detail and some resolution is included to calculate NO emissions. A model with three control volumes, called zones, is introduced. One zone represents the liquid fuel in the cylinder and two zones represent the gas mixture. In one of the gaseous zones the mixture preparation and combustion reaction occur; the second gaseous zone provides the oxidant to the previous zone and the combustion products are further mixed with air. The detailed model and the equations necessary to simulate the process are introduced. The required sub-models are proposed and the implementation of the complete model is done in different steps. First the liquid volume is treated and tested under a set of different conditions. In a second step the gas phase is simulated by neglecting the existence of liquid fuel in the cylinder. Finally, the complete model is assembled and NO formation mechanism is coupled with the model, testing is done allowing to evaluate the concept.","diesel engines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","MSI","",""

Door een beleidswijziging in de frequentie van de binnenkomst van de treinen, zijn de taken behorende tot het KCO verdeeld over twaalf onderhoudsbeurten per jaar, waar deze voorheen in 4 jaarlijkse onderhoudsbeurten uitgevoerd werden. Hierbij is het productieconcept veranderd. Waar de trein voorheen drie dagen lang binnen stond voor onderhoud, vinden alle huidige onderhoudsbeurten buiten de spits plaats. Hiervoor zijn er 8 beurten in de nacht en 4 in het weekend ingericht. Dit onderzoek is gebaseerd op de volgende onderzoeksvraag: “Hoe moet het onderhoudsprogramma (her)ontworpen worden opdat deze binnen de vastgestelde tijd, met de vereiste kwaliteit en met de geplande middelen uitgevoerd kan worden?” Gedurende de analyse is er gebruik gemaakt van een framework van literatuuronderzoek dat toepasbaar is op het onderhouden van complexe systemen. Voor de aansturing van het onderhoudsproces is er gebruik gemaakt van een systeemkundige benadering van de Delftse Systeemkunde (Veeke, Ottjes, & Lodewijks, 2008). Hiermee is de systeemgrens van het onderzoeksgebied gedefinieerd. Deze ligt bij het beheersen en uitvoeren van het huidige productieproces van het onderhouden van de VIRM-1 IV treinen. De kwantitatieve analyse van het productieconcept is gedaan op aspecten van Lean. Hierdoor zijn drie Lean verspillingen blootgelegd. Dit zijn mura (onbalans), overtollige beweging en overproductie.

(mentor); Calabretta, G. (mentor); Cardoso, C. (mentor)","2014","This report provides an analysis and concept development of “Profiler”, a new team building software tool for multi-disciplinary teams. This is commissioned by TNO and developed by EagleScience. Multi-disciplinary team members are put together because of their capability to deal with a joint issue. Because they are from different disciplines, they tend to miss certain knowledge about each other’s disciplines and expertise. The Dutch Ministry of Defense has noticed this can be an issue that leads to unsatisfactory performances of tasks. Therefore, TNO has been asked to develop a software tool to minimize this issue. There are many social media which would appear to have a solution for this issue. However, current social media cannot provide the customizability and / or manage classified information required by the Dutch Ministry of Defense. The key factor in the success of Profiler is that it must be actively used by all team members. To achieve this, the team members must be motivated to use Profiler. Therefore, defining ways of motivating people is the most important part of this report. Results of the research on motivation show that the interface and content of Profiler should ideally reflect the three fields of theory; Humanistic (Maslow’s (1943) hierarchy of needs), Economic (satisfier / dissatisfier theory of Herzberg (1986)) and Cognitive (expectancy value of Vroom (1964)) theories. A concept of Profiler is presented in which these theories have been incorporated (see Figure 0.1). Throughout the project, users were presented with different variations of the concept and given a scenario in which they have to find the most optimal team members to fulfill a certain task. The users not only worked through a scenario in Profiler, but also were interviewed about their experiences. From this, a final concept proposal has been designed for future research. This concept is based on the version of Profiler which has shown the best results among the users. Users who tested this version were matched with team members who had similar attributes as well as team members who had complementary attributes users lacked to perform their tasks. As this has been a qualitative research, the results are indicative and must be further explored to conclusively prove which version would work best and how it should be implemented. This should be done by testing Profiler with actual participants of the multi-disciplinary teams it has been designed for.","Social Media; Multi-Disciplinary Teams; Teams; Profiling; Profile; TNO; Ministry of Defense","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2014","Usually, no particular framework is used in the analysis of standards battles. Such an approach is good for the discovery of new knowledge, but it cannot reliably lead to a comprehensive analysis of a standards battle. The comprehensiveness of an analysis of a standards battle is currently very dependent on the knowledge and expertise of the researcher. In this thesis we propose to use integrative frameworks for standards battles in the analysis of standards battles. By performing an analysis of the VCR standards battle with a model where we integrate the main aspects of current integrative frameworks for standards battle we showed that this approach can provide valuable new insights that have previously been overlooked. A deductive content analysis of the literature on the VCR standards battle showed that some factors of our model were rarely or not at all mentioned in previous publications on the VCR standards battle. This indicated that an integrative framework could discover new aspects of the VCR standards battle that have previously been overlooked. Through interviews we tried to verify whether or not these “missing” factors were indications of actual gaps in the knowledge on the VCR standards battle. We found that three factors were completely overlooked and the relevance of two factors was underestimated in previous analyses of the VCR standards battle. Moreover, we found that design philosophy was also relevant in the VCR standards battle. This factor was previously not mentioned in any publications on the VCR standards battle nor in any of the integrative frameworks. To analyze this new factor in more depth we borrowed concepts from the field of moral philosophy, more specifically the field of human values. This resulted in a first illustration of the integration of ethics in the analysis of standards battles. The final result of our analysis provides a more comprehensive explanation of the emergence of VHS as a dominant standard and also explains the demise of the competing standards, Betamax and V2000, in more detail than previous publications.","standards; dominance; technology; frameworks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Values, Technology and Innovation","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Hauff, C. (mentor)","2014","Typically, video retrieval systems apply a text based search approach to find videos that match a search query. This approach is based on textual metadata attached to the videos, such as the video title, a short textual description and tags. Although this approach has been proven to be effective, a textual search can not always be applied since textual metadata that describes what happens in the video may not be always available. An alternative approach to the text based search is a concept based video search approach, which is based on annotating the videos with concepts that can be recognized by detectors built using computer vision techniques. Examples of recognizable concepts are entities, such as a person, a face, a building, and some types of actions, such as walking. However, only a limited number of concepts can be actually recognized, compared to the potentially unlimited number of concepts that a user can use to express his query. Therefore, the concepts given by the user in his query have to be decomposed into those (fewer) concepts that can be visually recognized in the videos. The main contribution of this work is a pipeline that can be used in a concept based video retrieval setting. This pipeline is implemented following an approach that uses a knowledge base for semantic interpretation and decomposition of concepts in a user query. Particularly, the pipeline takes a user query as input and this query is parsed in such a way that concepts are detected from it. A semantic interpretation is added to the concepts by mapping them to a knowledge base. Decomposition strategies are addressed and evaluated that decompose concepts for which there are not detectors into concepts for which there are detectors. Two knowledge bases are used as sources for semantic interpretation and concept decomposition, namely YAGO2s and ConceptNet. YAGO2 contains 10 million concepts and 120 million relations extracted from several sources, such as Wikipedia, WordNet and GeoNames. ConceptNet contains concepts and semantic relations constructed by combining multiple sources, such as WordNet, DBpedia and the English Wikitionary. This work is evaluated against relevant work carried out in the context of TRECVID, the catalyst conference in the field of video retrieval, in which teams from all over the world contribute in several video retrieval related tasks.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Web Information Systems","",""

This investigation resulted in the finding of the AE-model and AE-method which are be both extensively explained in the masters thesis Main Report. The AE-model, which is the abbreviation of Architect and Engineering model, is created by chaining the latest parametric computation software. The AE-model is designed to give rapid insight in the structural behaviour of architectural glass designs and gives feedback about stiffness, strength, stability and costs. In this manner the feasibility of a concept can be tested and, if necessary, improved towards a more balanced, affordable and feasible design. To avoid the inefficient use of the model the AE-method is introduced. The AE-method sums up the non-technical know-how around the AE-model. The AE-method proposes a workflow for the AE-model and addresses the impact which the model has on the building industry. The AE-methodology is tested during this thesis on two virtual projects and on three projects in real life. The virtual projects concern a dome and an ellipsoid. The projects in real life are: 'the new Fifth Avenue Apple cube' in New York, 'The Globe' in Kuwait and 'The Canakkale antenna tower' in Turkey. This thesis investigation resulted in various technical as well as non-technical conclusions. The AE-model and AE-method reveal that it is possible to improve the speed and quality of the engineering advise given in the design process of glass structures. Although the quality of the engineering advise given throughout the whole construction process might not be influenced, the latest computational power can significantly improve the speed at which engineering advise can be given. As a consequence a new work flow need to be introduced. The model and method together can bring the quality of engineering advise given during the design phase quickly to a high level.","Glass; Geometries; Parametric; Model; Method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Design","",""

In recent years, different governmental and private organizations have published their data through open data platforms to accelerate knowledge and information sharing. They are open data platforms, which are not particularly developed by any public or private organization. These universal open data platforms facilitate combining data various data types from different data resources. The aim of this study is to create integrated user interfaces for different groups of users, which stimulate services for users Open Data (OD), including the processes of importing, curating, processing and visualizing OD. The process of Open Data consists of following steps; Data production, publish data, Look for data, use data, feedback. The process focuses on providing data that are not accessible, to be published. For this research, various research methods were used: literature research has been conducted. Next we followed requirements engineering approach to elicit and analyze requirements by using scenario and use case techniques. We have created prototypes by visualizing use case flows in BPMN diagram. Finally, we have conducted an evaluation by user testing in the scenario-based environment, and walk-through technique. In this research, we focus on technological barrier of open data. Many technological impediments restrict users to have easy access to open data. The most significant impediments are Data deposit, Data access and Data use, impediments. Also, different requirements are identified for open data platforms. These requirements are categorized in five subcategories. Namely, Standardization, API, Materialization, Policies and integration. Data publishers usually only make data available and often do not consider the user perspective. One aspect of the user perspective that has received very little attention is the user interface of open data platforms. We have performed requirements analysis by using scenario and use case techniques. We have designed 6 scenarios that cover all steps of open data process. Next, we have created BPMN diagram to represent the flow of use cases. Finally, we have created UI mockups for Open Data platform. This research contributes in adding more benefits from open data by designing the user interface to increase the user’s contribution, as well as contributing into studies in the field of open data. This research involved a usability test in scenario-based environment as well as inspection. A total of 16 usability tests was conducted. The usability test was intended to verify the proposed UI. Participants were selected from different age ranges, countries, and study fields.

(mentor)","2014","Infrastructural projects such as roads and railway tracks are usually built on an embankment of sand or granular material. When building on soft soils, the prevention of differential settlements and resulting damage is traditionally done by including a long consolidation period in the construction process. One method to decrease construction time is to use a pile foundation beneath the embankment. If a geosynthetic reinforcement layer (GR) is used in the base of the embankment, the construction is called a basal reinforced piled embankment. Because of the friction within the fill, the piles do not only carry the weight of the soil directly on top of them, but also part of the load above the field between the piles. This effect, called arching, is increased by the use of a GR. Furthermore, the GR itself transfers additional load to the pile. Only the residual load is now carried by the soft subsoil. Thus three load parts can be defined: arching A, GR load B and subsoil support C. The better the amount of arching can be determined, the more economically can the embankment and GR be designed. This thesis uses numerical analysis to validate a new arching model, the concentric arches model by Van Eekelen et al. (2013). First, a numerical model is designed and validated using measurements done in a scaled laboratory test and measurements done in a full-scale field situation. Then, parameters in the validated numerical model are varied and the results are compared to predictions of the concentric arches model as well as two other models that are currently in use, the Hewlett and Randolph (1988) model and the Zaeske (2001) model The numerical calculations and the predictions of the concentric arches method show strong similarities, especially for higher top loads and when the influence of the fill’s friction angle is of importance. The concentric arches model performs better in this respect than the Hewlett and Randolph model and qualitatively similar to the Zaeske model. Special consideration is given to the design of low embankment, in which full arches cannot develop. This occurrence of partial arching is mainly of importance during construction. The numerical model shows that the shape of the arches changes in these cases compared to higher embankments. This is not what is assumed in the concentric arches model, which models arches of the same shape, but limited to a smaller surface than in higher embankments. Both these phenomena however have similar effect on the amount of arching, which means the concentric arches model gives very satisfactory results for low embankment heights as well.","Arching; Piled embankment; Geosynthetic reinforcement; 3D Numerical modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Engineering","","Section Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor); Valencia Cardona, A.M. (mentor)","2014","What makes you happy? This question forms the basis of Make if Happy (MiH), a company that aims to use happiness as a medium to create social change in the world. In two years time, this simple question grew out into a foundation with a large grassroots movement. Now, the organization is ready to take the next step and wants to become more sustainable by developing the commercial side of the organization. In this light, MiH recently decided to partner with the marketing firm LeadDog Marketing Group and to make the transition from a foundation to a social enterprise. For MiH to succeed as a social enterprise, they need to find a way to materialize happiness into a commercial service. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to design a service for MiH that complements the company’s perspective on happiness while it (1) fits the brand seamlessly and (2) gives the company the foundation to function as a professional social enterprise. To identify the most important characteristics that impact the service development of a starting social enterprise, the first part of the thesis is an elaborate literature study that forms the theoretical background of the service development. From academic studies about social enterprises, service development and business development for start-ups, four key characteristics were identified: a clear strategic mission, brand development, create a positive brand reputation, and differentiate. In the exploration, the second phase of the thesis, these characteristics were tested with MiH by means of an internal and external analysis. It became clear that as a result of the fast organic growth of the organization, there was no formalized strategy for the development of commercial services. Although the company is highly original and innovative, the absence of a clear strategy and identity hinders the advancement of (commercial) service development and also trust with (potential) clients. With this in mind, the findings of the literature study and exploration were combined. As a result, a business strategy was formulated that strengthens the organization’s core business first. From which in the creation phase, a new commercial identity was created to achieve this goal. An important part of the identity creation is the establishment of four main drivers of happiness: connectivity, autonomy, mastery, and purpose (CAMP). Hereafter, the four main drivers of happiness were incorporated into a framework for the development of commercial services based on the principle of learning by doing. The goal of this framework is to gain trust of potential clients and to give MiH a structured basis from which they can develop new services themselves. To enhance client trust, the first steps of the framework are specified into more detail. The last steps are left more open to make sure that there is still enough flexibility for MiH to use their own unique methods and ideas. In conclusion, the proposed happiness approach and service design framework enables MiH to take the step to become a professional social enterprise. Both the approach and framework are based on the meaning of happiness and the current skills of the organization, which enables MiH to use them, and to deliver brand fit services.","service design; new service development; happiness; framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Van Keulen, A. (mentor)","2014","In order to provide further improvements in thermal efficiency, engine designers are trying to optimise one of the components of the engine that has to endure the most severe conditions: the High Pressure Turbine. Furthermore, from a cost perspective, turbine designers are constantly trying to reduce the number of blades in the turbine which leads to stronger secondary flow features. Since secondary flow features are one of the main contributors to losses in the turbine, there is a potential for improvements when the development of secondary flow in the stage can be controlled and reduced. The non-axisymmetric profiling of end-walls has shown to be a powerful method to reduce loss and secondary flows. However, the development of consistent measures for the assessment of profiled end-wall designs is still in progress and the loss mechanisms of secondary flows are not yet fully understood. Therefore, the achievement of optimal end-wall design is still challenging. The main obstacle remains the complexity of the three-dimensional flows involved and the difficulty to visualise and accurately evaluate their flow structures. The aim of this thesis is to show that applying profiled end-walls and making use of optimisation algorithms can lead to a reduction of losses in the High Pressure Turbine. A parametric optimisation study has been performed to determine the regions of the hub profiled end-wall in the High Pressure rotor that are having the largest impact on performance. The objective has set to increase component efficiency while constraints have been set in terms of the reaction and inlet capacity of the High Pressure stage. A high efficiency improvement is obtained by the profiled end-wall created near the leading edge, while the profiled end-wall close to the trailing edge of the blade loses most of its efficiency improvement due to its strong violation of the constraints. Analysis of the flow field has revealed that the profiled end-wall near the leading edge is affecting the interaction of inlet boundary layer flow and purge flow emerging from the rim seal. By creating an effective flow passage, the profiled end-wall forces the purge flow to emerge from the rim seal closer to the suction surface of the blade. In this way, the profiled end-wall is influencing the development of the hub passage vortex. A new post-processing method has been developed based on the generation of entropy in order to gain a deeper understanding of the flow mechanisms taking place. The specific entropy generation has shown to be a powerful tool to identify loss sources and compare designs. It has been determined that the reduction in work losses due to shear stresses between adjacent cells in the numerical domain has the largest contribution to the reported efficiency improvements. Two loss reduction mechanisms have been identified. By forcing the purge flow to stay close to the suction surface, shear stress work losses that were first being generated by flow that was entrained between the hub passage vortex and suction side of the blade have been eliminated. The second loss reduction mechanism has been identified to be the weakening of the vortical character of the hub passage vortex. The flow of the hub passage vortex has shown to be aligned with the main flow direction and shear stress work losses initially generated by interaction with main and hub end-wall boundary layer flow are absent in the profiled end-wall design.","Numerical Study; Optimised Profiled End-Wall Design; High Pressure Turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-04-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

The model offers guidelines on how other visual support tools could be designed and therefore offers procedural power. Additionally the model offers explanations why such a design could aid visual analysis and thereby shows descriptive power. The proof of concept allows analysts to not only confirm or reject their hypotheses on frauds but it also gives the options for exploring alternative hypotheses.

(mentor)","2014","This thesis studies the safety effects of section control systems on Dutch motorways. Section control is a speed enforcement method that measures the mean speed of vehicles passing a specific road section. When this mean speed is, after measurement correction, above the lower ticket threshold, the driver receives a fine. The detection probability of speed offenders at section control is nearly 100%. Therefore, section control is a very effective measure to prevent speeding and therefore reduce the mean speed and speed variance of traffic. Both mean speed and speed variance are important factors in the occurrence of crashes. The risk a crash risk increases with a higher speed or a larger speed variance. Traffic safety is generally expressed in the number of occurring crashes on the road. Foreign studies already showed promising results concerning the traffic safety effects of a section control system. However, well designed studies are scarce. A well-designed study into the safety effects of section control in the Netherlands has not yet been carried out. The study design for this research is a pre-post study design with a matched comparison group. The section control systems within the scope of this research were statistically tested for significant changes in relation to their matched comparison groups, between the pre- and post-study period on the mean speed, speed variance, crash severity and the sum of these crash severities. The statistical tests included a repeated measures ANOVA for the speed data analysis and the chi-square or Fischer’s exact test and the advanced chi-square test for the crash data analysis. A crash analysis was also done for the proportional distribution of crashes within the treatment group, to test the influence of section control on the surrounding road sections. Section control systems with a peak-hour lane and/or with a variable speed limit were excluded from this research, because these systems pose large difficulties for obtaining comparable road statistical road data. Furthermore, section control systems implemented after the summer of 2012 were excluded from this research too, because both pre- and post-period preferable need a minimal length of one year. As a result, there were seven section control systems on fourteen different road sections within the scope of this research. On eleven of these road sections, section control systems were implemented together with a speed limit reduction. Because a speed limit reduction also influences the traffic safety of a road, an effort has been made to predict the expected number of crashes in the post-period situation with a section control system but without a speed limit reduction. Firstly a speed analysis, based on minute speed data from the MoniCa database, was done to test whether section control is able to reduce the mean speed and speed variance of the traffic significantly. This analysis showed section control decreased the mean speed and the speed variance significantly on roads where section control was activated simultaneously with a speed limit reduction. Compared to their matched comparison groups, the mean speed decreased on average by ±16% and the speed variance decreased on average by ±41%. The section control systems implemented in the existing road design did not reduce the mean speed and speed variance significantly compared to their matched comparison groups. Compared to their matched comparison groups, the mean speed decreased on average by ±3% and the speed variance decreased on average by ±17%. After the speed analysis it was decided to also perform an crash analysis to study whether the decreased mean speeds and speed variances also provided significant reductions on the number of crashes. This analysis was done with the available registered casualties and property damage only crashes from the BRON database. On roads where section control was activated simultaneously with a speed limit reduction, all crash severities and the sum of these crash severities showed significant reductions. Compared to their matched comparison groups, the number of serious injuries decreased by 37%, the number of slight injuries by 13% and the number of property damage only crashes by 11%. The total number of casualties decreased, compared to their matched comparison groups, by 15% and the total number of casualties plus the property damage only crashes by 12%. The proportional distribution of casualties and crashes on the upstream and downstream road section of section control slightly increased over time, compared to the road sections with section control. On the section control systems implemented in the existing road design, only serious injuries did not obtained a significant reduction. Compared to their matched comparison groups, the number of slight injuries decreased by 34% and the number of property damage only crashes by 4%. The total number of casualties decreased, compared to their matched comparison groups, by 15% and the total number of casualties plus property damage only crashes by 18%. The proportional distribution of casualties and crashes on the upstream and downstream road section of section control changed only slightly and on a different way for every crash severity. After the section control systems with speed limit reduction were corrected for the safety effects of a speed limit reduction, the number of serious injuries decreased, compared to their matched comparison groups, by 15%. The number of slight injuries and the number of property damage only crashes increased instead of decreased. The total number of casualties and the total number of casualties plus property damage only crashes, also show an increase compared to their matched comparison groups. Based on the research question ‘What are the safety effects of section control systems, installed before summer 2012, on motorways in the Netherlands?’ and on the available data and section control systems within the scope of this research, the conclusion can be drawn that section control together with a speed limit reduction of 20 [km/h] improves the traffic safety on the road sections with section control. Based on this research it can also be concluded that only a section control system can improve traffic safety but only based on crash rates and not on mean speed and speed variance. The last conclusion that can be drawn based on this research, is that section control does not influence the traffic safety on the adjacent upstream and downstream road section of section control.","traffic safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport and Planning","",""

The Delft University of Technology acquired an experimental multi-burner furnace for further research on flameless combustion to do so, in 2007. Prior research focussed on the effect of several parameters (e.g. cycle time, burner configuration and firing mode) on the performance of the furnace. Further investigation into the formation of a near burner zone gave rise to the construction of a new measurement probe, in order to investigate the species concentrations inside the furnace. Experiments have been conducted with the new measurement probe for a range of different furnace settings. Profiles have been made from the collected data, to show the species concentration along a line in the furnace perpendicular to the wall and along the symmetry axis of the burner. Three cases of CFD simulations have been compared with the experimental results, with moderate success due to differences between the setup and the CFD model. An introduction into the field of Design of Experiments was made. The technique is suggested to be used for improvement of the design generation for the experimental campaigns. This should be done using dedicated software programs. Lastly, several adaptations have been suggested to be made for the furnace and peripheral equipment e.g. installation of a static mixer for biogas fuel experiments and a new gas analyzer for increasing measurement accuracy.","flameless combustion; multi-burner; flameless oxidation; species probe; energy efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

Deepwind is a wind turbine model and prototype development project under the umbrella of the 7th European Framework Programme. The safety system is one of the aspects of this project and it is dealt within this Thesis work. Safety is one of the most important features that modern wind turbines should include. Statistics and industrial experience have indicated to the regulation organizations (e.g. IEC,DNV) to add safety systems in the complex electromechanical system of a wind turbine. The most crucial safety feature is the over-speeding control. Usually the controller functions alleviate this problem but an additional safety level is more than necessary to avoid irreparable incidents. This safety feature has been developed within the scope of this Thesis. Therefore, the major task is the definition and design of the safety system functions. This task was conducted in the context of the Conceptual Design method. Several possibilities were investigated. This search led to systems using the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic principles of operation. Many aspects were taken into account concerning the functionality and compatibility of these safety systems. These aspects were addressed from literature review and generation of engineering models in MATLAB. Finally, through multi-criteria analysis, which is one of the tools of Conceptual Design, all the systems were compared and a solution was formulated with the initial design configurations for further development. The proposal of this Master Thesis is to sink the wind turbine system inside the sea, by adding seawater into the spar buoy in an effective time response. Consequently, the blades of the wind turbine hit the seawater and thus create enough drag forces to reduce effectively the rotational speed. The particular wind turbine characteristics make this solution the most promising, as presented through the whole process. This report proposes the initial design characteristics but also suggests further steps on the design process of the safety system.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor)","2014","In industrial heat transfer processes, natural convection enters in various forms. One form of natural convection is thermo-magnetic convection. Besides gravitational force, magnetic force causes warmer fluid to rise or fall dependent on the fluids magnetic susceptibility and direction of magnetic field gradient. Magnetic susceptibility is a material property which indicates a degree of magnetization in a material. For paramagnetic fluids magnetic susceptibility depends on temperature, is positive and therefore attracted by magnetic field. Magnetic susceptibility of diamagnetic materials is independent on temperature, is negative and hence repelled by magnetic field. Magnetic force can be used to enhance or suppress gravity. This phenomena is widely investigated for many materials, magnetic field strengths and set-up geometries. In this research thermo-magnetic convection and the effect it has on internal heat transfer is experimentally investigated for para- diamagnetic fluids. Making use of a 10 Tesla superconducting magnet, which can generate field gradients up to 870 T2/m, steady, oscillating and turbulent flow regimes can be observed. I performed the experiments at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow, Poland. A small cubical enclosure filled with para- or diamagnetic fluid is placed at different positions in the magnet to get enhancement or suppression of internal heat transfer. Enclosure is heated from below and top is kept at constant temperature. Temperature of the fluid is measured with thermocouples at six different positions inside the enclosure. From these temperature-time measurements a power spectrumis obtained to determine the characteristic flow regime. Internal heat transfer is investigated by measuring different variables and calculate thermo-magnetic Rayleigh and Nusselt numbers. As paramagnetic fluid a 40% water-glycerol solution is used and gadoliniumnitrate is added to create a higher magnetic susceptibility. Enclosure was placed above the magnet centre which should give a magnetic force that enhances gravitational buoyancy. Temperature difference between the hot and cold plate of the enclosure is 5 and 11±C, respectively case G5A and G11A. Case G5A shows transition in the flow regime from steady to oscillating to turbulent with increasing of magnetic field. Case G11A shows turbulent regime for each measurement. Nusselt number calculations for glycerol solution measurements show an increase, up to 2.5 times, in internal heat transfer. Turbulence causes better mixing and hence better heat transfer. Relation between RaTM and Nu are compared with previous (experimental) relations and show good agreement. Pure water is used as diamagnetic fluid. First enclosure is placed below magnet centre and temperature difference is 5 and 1 ±C, respectively case W5B and W1B. Here magnetic force should enhance internal heat transfer. Case W5A and W3A are measured above the magnet centre and have respectively a temperature difference of 5 and 3 ±C. Case W5B and W5A both show turbulent flow regime for all measurements. Internal heat transfer is about the same for both cases but show a slight increase for W5B and decrease for W5A. There can be concluded that for turbulent flow regimes magnetic force direction has no significant influence on internal heat transfer. For smaller temperature differences, case W1B and W3A, magnetic force does influence measurements. CaseW1B shows steady flow regime first and for higher magnetic field strengths fluid plumes start to rise and sink due to magnetic force. Case W3A shows a very clear transition from turbulence to oscillating flow. Small temperature differences cause large measurement errors and internal heat transfer is assumed to be constant. Recommendations for further research is to get a better impression of fluid structures and temperatures in the enclosure. Fluid behaviour can be visualized with liquid crystals and velocity fields can be determined by using PIV on these visualizations. The velocities can be compared to simulations. To get realistic simulations, fluid properties need to be measured for different temperatures and if necessary differentmagnetic field strengths.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Chemical Engineering","","Transport Phenomena","",""

(mentor); Molenaar, W.F. (mentor); Van Spengen, J. (mentor); De Vos, P. (mentor)","2014","The degradation of infrastructure and sea level rise cause the existing discharge capacity of the Stevin and Lorentz sluices at the Afsluitdijk to be insufficient. This thesis focuses on the design of a new discharge facility at the Afsluitdijk with the possibility to anticipate on the changing conditions at both the IJsselmeer and Wadden Sea. The system is schematised as a closed-off estuary system within a water storage model, based on the water balance equation and a wind model from SOBEK. In contrast to previous studies, this study takes extreme conditions into account instead of only the daily conditions. The water storage system depends on the following governing parameters: the wind setup, tidal movement, target water level, sea level rise, in- and outflow conditions, in which the sea level rise is used as the function parameter. Within this schematisation three normative design conditions are considered for the acceptable water level prolongation at the inner basin: (I) the maximum acceptable height, (II) an acceptable duration of the high water level event and (III) the target water level boundaries. By means of a general sea level rise computation, the analyses showed that during daily conditions the need for pumps is inevitable from a sea level rise of +0.25m or more, because the daily discharge driven by gravity becomes limited. However, during extreme conditions discharge driven by gravity remains beneficial up to a sea level rise of +1.00m. Pumping is the only option beyond this point. Two design options are considered to be feasible for the combination of discharge driven by pumps and gravity: the open discharge sluice and the venturi culvert. The open discharge sluice is capable of discharging large volumes via gravity. In combination with the four pumps within a vertical door, the complete tidal cycle is utilised to discharge water, resulting in the most economical design option. On the other hand, there is the discharge facility made up of venturi culverts equipped with large pumps, capable of pumping large volumes during negative head differences. In addition, this option is capable of pumping water during small positive head difference, resulting in a very efficient option to pump large volumes. However, this concept is more expensive compared to the open discharge sluice. Within this thesis the discharge facility is designed for the +0.85m sea level rise scenario, based on the financial optimum composition. This optimal composition consists of twenty seven venturi culverts and twelve open discharge sluices. The total available pump capacity of the discharge facility is 1,250m3/s, with a maximum discharge capacity by gravity of 4,000 m3/s. Consequently, the maximum energy consumption is 32MW, equivalent to 32,000 households and requires an investment of 1.4 billion. As a consequence of combining both design options, the discharge facility is capable of anticipating on small sea level rise variations without exceeding the tolerable limits. An insurmountable consequence of the design methodology is the overcapacity during daily circumstances. Only twelve of the twenty-seven pumps are required during daily conditions, the residual pumps are only required for the more extreme condition. The sensitivity analysis showed a possible reduction in pump capacity, due to small changes in the design conditions. These changes consist of: (I) an increase in acceptable water level duration, (II) an increase in summer target water level and (III) the possibility to allow temporary reduction of the target water level prior to the start of high inflow. The required discharge capacity by pumps decreases to 950 m3/s, a 25\% reduction compared to the initial design. Feasibility of a discharge facility, designed on the extreme conditions, is confirmed by means of the sensitivity analysis and endorses the strong relation between the required discharge capacity and the governing parameters of the water storage system.","discharge facility; pump; target water level; IJsselmeer; Afsluitdijk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Potters, M. (mentor)","2014","The life-time performance of chemical processes is limited due to changes in the plant dynamics and disturbance characteristics over time. Such systems often make use of model-based controllers. When a dynamic change arises over time, a difference occurs between the dynamic models contained in the controller and the true system dynamics. The difference in dynamics could deteriorate the performance of a model-based control system. Monitoring the performance on-line is therefore of importance. Detection of a dynamic plant or disturbance change occurs by a classical performance monitoring method, which estimates the variance of the controlled outputs. A change is detected at the moment that a maximum performance bound is violated. An important step is to distinguish between control-relevant plant changes and variations in disturbance characteristics due to different solutions strategies. With an existing performance diagnosis method which makes use of closed-loop prediction error identification the true plant dynamics are identified. Then it is verified whether a performance drop is caused by a change in control-relevant plant dynamics by making use of hypothesis testing. A set is considered that contains all plant dynamics which achieve a satisfactory performance and it is verified whether the identified model is located in or outside the set to make a decision. With an alternative second decision rule, a heuristic method is used where models are constructed around the estimated model by making use of a normal distribution. It is verified which percentage of these models are located outside the set to make a decision. A third decision rule is used which is a combination of the first and second decision rules and the confidence is compared between all considered decision rules. In a simulation case study of a binary distillation column, the performance monitoring method detects a performance drop satisfactory without creating many false alarms. Furthermore, it is shown that with the heuristic method a significant increase in confidence is achieved compared to the first decision rule and only a minor difference with respect to the third decision rule.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Spoel, W.H. (mentor); Schipper, H.R. (mentor)","2014","In the last decades, there is a lot of discussion about climate change and energy shortage. In building industry great amounts of energy are spent for heating and cooling which in return produce large quantities of CO2 emissions. Therefore, it is self-understandable that efforts towards more effective and sustainable solutions have to be made. This thesis deals with Thermally Activated Building Systems (TABS), which refer to temperature - controlled surfaces that heat and cool indoor temperatures by adding or removing sensible heat and where more than half of heat transfer occurs through thermal radiation. Aim of this research is to describe, analyze and evaluate the performance of this system with the help of Building Energy Modelling Programs (BEMPs). This report consists of two main parts. TABS are modelled with the help of Building Energy Modelling Programs (BEMPs) and specifically EnergyPlus and TRNSYS. The first part of the report is focused on comparisons of the results between EnergyPlus and TRNSYS. Several models have been tested in the two programs, initially simple growing progressively more complicated to determine the accuracy of the results in several cases. In the final step, models equipped with TABS are designed in EnergyPlus and TRNSYS and their results, regarding inside temperature, are compared. The study has shown that EnergyPlus and TRNSYS lead to significantly different results for building simulations under the given conditions. Additionally, possible causes of these differences have been found in the modelling processes of the programs. In the second part of the thesis a combination of two radiant systems for heating and cooling is introduced as shown in the figure below. The first system is concrete core activation (CCA), meaning that heating and cooling is provided by means of circulating water running in tubes embedded in the floor slabs. CCA which is slow response system is coupled with a fast delivery system which is radiative panels. The systems operate in a change-over configuration - CCA operates during night-time and radiative panels during occupation. Additionally, a 2-pipe distribution system is used which is cheaper but may lead to thermal discomfort. This part also provides a guideline or framework on the optimization this system's performance by lowering the energy consumption while maintaining the provisional thermal comfort in acceptable range. The parameters which influence the performance of the system are analyzed and a way to optimize them is provided. The evaluation of the system has shown that the radiative panels do not contribute significantly in the thermal comfort of a 1-zone model in contrast to CCA.","thermally activated building systems; concrete core activation; radiative panels; building energy modelling programs; control optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

There are systems that measure according to the IEC60270 standard (conventional measurement) and systems that don’t, the so called ‘’unconventional measurement systems’’. For PD measurement in power cables, measurement according to the standard has some shortcomings. Therefore development of unconventional measurement systems have taken place. Because there is no standard for these unconventional measurement systems, different manufacturers have developed different systems that use sensors with different bandwidths. Measurement with different systems could lead to different PD measurement results. Comparability of measurement results of different systems is desired in order to obtain an unambiguous result from different measurement systems for PD activity in the cable. Therefore there are investigated methods that create the possibility to compare measurement results of different systems that are used for PD measurement in power cables.","partial discharges cables","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","DC and storage","",""

(mentor); Smulders, F.E.H.M. (mentor); Van de Poll, T.H. (mentor)","2014","Unilever, a multinational consumer goods company, intends to improve its exploratory capacity in the front end of its innovation process. Many companies today make use of the Stage-Gate process, as does Unilever. The Stage-Gate process is a controlled phased innovation process which supports management to make decisions on innovation The Stage-Gate process has to deal with both the company’s exploratory and exploitative activities. Though, managing exploratory and exploitative activities simultaneously through the Stage-Gate process seems to be a challenging endeavour. A balance between exploration and exploitation is essential for organizations, however, requires different ways of management. In the case of exploration, companies seem to struggle with measuring the risks against the potential return and accordingly the value of innovations Strategic management of Unilever Research and Development in Vlaardingen (URDV) noticed that employees are confronted with certain barriers in order to perform exploratory activities. They were also confronted with difficulties in implementing exploratory projects into the main part of the Stage-Gate process. Therefore, by the end of 2011 Unilever started looking into how to improve these struggles. They found out that the designer’s way of working might add value to Unilever’s front end process. Subsequently URDV initiated the Disruptive Design Studio (DDS) which is based on a co-operation between URDV and the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at Delft University of Technology. The DDS is active since February 2012 and consists of young design students working in Unilever’s front-end process on design projects based on challenges from Unilever’s business. Every five months two new DDS teams of each six second year master students from the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering work on the whole spectrum of the product development process. Because Unilever employees interact with the DDS teams throughout their design process they are able to experience the DDS’ way of working. Therefore the DDS is seen as an introduction into a new approach for Unilever to coop with exploratory innovation. However, the added value of the DDS to Unilever’s front-end process is yet unclear. This thesis aims to investigate and determine this added value with the ultimate aim to synthesize the results into an improved DDS concept. The main question of this thesis is: What are the most viable improvements for the DDS to maximize the contribution of DDS to Unilever’s current innovation process? In order to answer this question the URDV’s current barriers to exploratory innovation are identified. Next, the potential value of the DDS approach to innovation is given. Answers to these two sub questions are the starting point for identifying the impact of six former DDS teams on URDV’s barriers to innovate exploratory.","Front End; Exploration; Intervention method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2016-04-22","Industrial Design Engineering","PIM","","","",""

(mentor); Van den Bos, J.P. (mentor)","2014","Het doel van dit bachelor eindproject is een antwoord vinden op de vraag of het mogelijk is door middel van het IH-2VOF model resultaten gevonden in een stroomgoot te simuleren. Dit moet worden uitgezocht omdat door gebruik te maken van dit model de teen van een golfbreker beter, veiliger en eenvoudiger ontworpen kan worden. Het onderzoek bestaat uit twee delen: - Bekend raken met, en kalibreren van het model. - Uitvoeren van de vergelijking met de resultaten uit de stroomgoot. Ten eerste het bekend raken met het model en het vinden van de juiste instellingen voor de modellering. Het IH-2VOF model is een numeriek model dat in staat is stroomsnelheden, drukken en vloeistof niveaus te berekenen in een virtuele 2D stroomgoot. In deze stroomgoot kan een object, in dit geval een golfbreker, geplaatst worden. Het kalibreren van het model is lastig. Dit omdat de exacte werking niet geheel bekend is vanwege de ingewikkelde numerieke structuur en het feit dat de code niet in te zien is. Als gevolg hiervan is als startpunt gekozen voor de door de literatuur bij het model gegeven uitgangspunten. Vervolgens is gekeken of het model bij deze uitgangspunten convergent is. Dit bleek erg lastig en veel tijd te kosten. Daarna is gekeken of de rekentijd van het model verkort kan worden door middel van het aanpassen van het rekenrooster (de mesh) of het verkorten van de stroomgoot. Wat betreft de mesh bleek dit slechts in de y-richting mogelijk, echter werd zo geen rekentijd bespaard. Wat betreft de lengte van de goot is het zo dat in het laboratorium een flinke lengte nodig is om de golven goed in te kunnen stellen. In het model blijkt een dergelijke lengte echter niet perse nodig. Het is waarschijnlijk belangrijk dat er meer dan 2x de golflengte aangehouden wordt als minimale lengte van de goot in het model, ongeacht de lengte van de oorspronkelijke goot. Dit is echter niet onomstotelijk bewezen. Een verkorting van de goot heeft wel rekentijdverkorting tot gevolg. Ten tweede volgt de vergelijking van de door Nammuni-Krohn [2009] gevonden waarden voor de stroomsnelheden bij de teen van een golfbreker in een stroomgoot, met de door het model gesimuleerde waarde. Als gevolg van de tijdsplanning van dit bachelor project is er helaas weinig tijd over gebleven voor deze vergelijking. Echter een korte simpele vergelijking van een aantal punten uit het rapport van Nammuni-Krohn [2009] liet zien dat het model wel degelijk goede waarde simuleert. Concluderend kan gesteld worden dat met de instellingen die in dit verslag beschreven staan het model waarschijnlijk wel in staat is de werkelijkheid te benaderen. Hiervoor moet echter wel eerst nog beter naar de convergentie en het gedrag van de golfserie gekeken worden.","IH-2VOF; breakwater; Nammuni-Krohn; stroomsnelheden; flow velocities","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2014-02-18","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Boersema, T. (mentor)","2014","This thesis describes the process and results of a graduation project for the Master’s course Design for Interaction (DfI) at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering. The project was carried out for the company Magnet.me. Magnet.me is a website that connects students with companies aiming to create a more efficient campus recruitment model. Interactions that can take place on the website are fairly standard, such as exchanging text messages and attachments. In the current state, these messaging modules do not have any added value compared to the regular channels of communication like email and chat. The goal of this project was to find and design a suitable portfolio expansion for Magnet.me that improves and optimises candidate-recruiter interaction. First, research was done regarding the recruitment process. The recruitment process can be split up into two stages, attraction and selection. Interaction primarily takes place in the selection stage. Consequently, the online communication tools that are used during selection were analysed. Of all tools, video calling presented itself as the most suitable opportunity for Magnet.me. Firstly, because it is the richest interactive online medium. Secondly, because it can turn Magnet.me into a much more integral recruitment service. Interviews with recruiters and candidates were conducted to find out what is needed for successful video calling during (pre-)selection. It was found that the product should focus on (1) the impression, (2) integration, (3) simplification & combination, and (4) lowering effort. In essence, the recruiter wants to get an impression that goes beyond the static profile. He or she wants to get a feel for, rather than read about a candidate’s life, ambitions, and interests. Ultimately aiming to find out if the candidate fits within their company culture. Given the fact that a culture fit is not easily measurable and much more about a gut feeling, which is evoked by interaction, this interaction should be leading in the design of the product. Therefore, the product should focus on impression. Focusing on impression means keeping the actual video call (in which the impression is made) free from unnecessary distractions. The design of the system flow and its interfaces, from before to after the video call, should contribute to this goal of enabling the users to properly give (candidate) and get (recruiter) this impression. The product, Magnet.me Video, integrates core tasks that are specific for selection. The design of the product is led by the main goal to provide a setting in which an impression of a person(ality) can be best prepared and given by a candidate, and received and documented by a recruiter. The product stimulates having a short and focused interaction, which makes it a very clear and accessible product. The fact that the interface is clear, guiding and sticks to the essence of recruitment video calling also adds to the accessibility and usability of the product. When not connected with the other party (before and after call) the focus is on preparation, documentation and assessment, but when connected, the focus is on each other; focused on impression. At the end of the day, it is this impression that is made (by candidate) and received (by recruiter) that is essential for judging in the selection process. Adding Magnet.me Video to the current Magnet.me website will build on the current vision and will offer users a broader range of functionalities to express themselves in a professional context. Where Magnet.me can currently be used by both candidates and companies to ‘find and follow’ each other, the addition of Magnet.me Video will turn Magnet.me into the place for candidates and recruiters to ‘find, follow and face’ each other.","video; recruitment; interface design; online communication; selection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2014","The first stages of innovation are highly uncertain. Companies often collaborate with other organizations in an attempt to combine different knowledge and expertise, and share risks. However, organizing and managing innovation in a network business environment is quite complex and challenging. The activities in the front end of the innovation process are often difficult to anticipate and perform. Still, they are seen as critical factors for having successful outcomes of the innovation process. The use of the business model concept has recently been recognized as a construct that establishes the link between an emerging technology and its potential economic value. However, little guidance is available regarding how business model concept can be used in order to manage the front end of innovation challenges when network of companies are collaborating. This study aims to identify how the use of business model concept in the front end of technology driven innovation in a networked business environment manages the challenges in the FEI. This study raises a challenging research question: How should business models be developed and evaluated in the front end of technology driven, networked R&D projects in order to manage challenges in the FEI? The main goals of this research is to identify the front end of innovation critical success factors that influence the development of the Business Model and based on what evaluation criteria the viability of such BM can be evaluated. The approach to achieve these goals had two main directions – theoretical and practical. First, based on theory, the challenges and the success factors of the front end of innovation were identified. The evaluation factors for Business Model Viability were also studied. Second, the same factors were studied during a case study, performed on two collaborative projects. The findings were analysed by the Analytic Hierarchy Process Methodology. The results of the survey reveal the most important factors for the front end of innovation and the most important factors for evaluating a Business model developed in this phase. Third, the influence of the Business model concept on the front end of innovation phase was studied by interviewing experts during the case study and by questioning experts in the survey. With regard to front end of innovation critical success factors that influence the development of the Business Model, four factors are relatively more important - Compelling Value proposition, Acceptable Profit Potential, Adaptability, and Acceptable quality of service delivery. Interesting finding is that factors related to technology were not among the most important for the early stage of the innovation process. Furthermore, there were significant differences in the ranking order among the various respondent groups, which might be caused by the specification of their work or the low respondent level. With regard to the criteria based on which a Business model can be evaluated in the FEI phase, four criteria are relatively more important – Compelling Value proposition, Acceptable Profit potential, Adaptability, and Acceptable quality of service delivery. Evaluation criteria like Novelty, Imitability, and Uniqueness are ranked as least important for evaluating such Business model. Most of the factors have very close weights, which suggests that they might be considered as equally important. Furthermore, there is a difference in the rank order of the criteria with respect to respondents’ experience with Business Model concept. Finally, it was concluded that the use of Business Model concept in the Front end of innovation, when network of companies collaborate, helps to structure the innovation and working process, to consider different aspects that might normally be out of the scope, and to communicate the gathered business and market insights with the technology developers.","Business Model; Front end of Innovation; Technology innovation; Success factors; Evaluation criteria","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","ICT","","Management of Technology","",""

The project location is the region of Bratislava, the capitol of Slovakia, which lies along the Danube just east to the border with Austria. The Danube flows from the Alps and passes the Carpathian Mountains, which lay north of Bratislava. Downstream of Bratislava the Danube flows onto the Little Hungarian Plain, covering parts of Slovakia and Hungary where the Danube slows down and splits into three different flows creating an inland delta. This inland delta contains one of the largest groundwater bodies of central Europe. Throughout time this delta was a very dynamic landscape, it was here where the river changed from a river running in a narrow valley through a mountain landscape to a river flowing freely in this large inland plain. It would often find a new path to flow through during a flood creating an interesting dynamic flood landscape with a wide floodplain full of alluvial forests and oxbow lakes (old river arms). Because of manmade interventions like dikes and dams the river has no longer a wide floodplain or the potential to diverge its course, changing the natural dynamics. In the current situation the river acts largely as a channel after it passes Bratislava.","casco; framework; landscape; flood; flood protection; bratislava; slovakia; high dynamic; low dynamic; flood forest","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-04-17","Architecture and The Built Environment","Landscape Architecture","","","","48.105384, 17.266636"

(mentor); Quist, W. (mentor)","2014","The graduation studio ‘Housing as heritage’, within the chair of Restoration, Modification, Intervention and Transformation (®MIT), deals with complex social issues and degeneration processes of post-war housing neighborhoods. This graduation project in particular aims at a strategy for phased revitalization of post-war ground bound duplex housing towards adaptive neighborhoods by means of using an innovative modification strategy called the second skin. The Western Garden Cities of Amsterdam built in the rebuilt period after the Second World War, which is one of the biggest extension plans in the Netherlands erected, faces complex social issues and degeneration. Current restructuring plans are put on hold due to the new economic situation for which corporations have generally minimalized their activities into management and maintenance. Slotermeer, as being one of these areas, erected as one of the first parts of the General Expansion Plan (AUP, Algemeen Uitbreidingsplan) is mostly retained by the urban renewal period. Plans were made to regenerate the area by means of large scale demolishment and building new housing estate, in which this could foresee in a more differentiated housing stock as one of the key arguments to solve further degeneration. One part of the stock seen as problematic by several stakeholders like the housing corporation and the municipality, is the duplex housing, which forms about twenty percent of the number of dwellings in Slotermeer. Several enclaves are conducted as duplexed ground-bound single family housing in courtyard configurations. In time of erection these were meant as a temporary solution to overcome the housing shortage. After ten years the duplex dwellings would be simplexed which until this day in general did not occur. Over time, due to the filtering down process, their position on the housing market changed. Nowadays, therefore these areas are mainly characterized by small and degenerated typologies with relatively cheap rents and inhabitants with low financial potential in which there is a high mutation rate in change of tenants. One of these neighborhoods, the case study for the graduation assignment, is the Roland Holstbuurt. It represents the typical abstract of the development of duplex housing in a post war urban setting through time. This graduation project tried to find an answer on how to deal with these areas by means of innovative architectural revitalization strategies anchored in the historical context. In the first quarter thorough research on the duplex strategy and the Roland Holstbuurt since the erection to the initial future plans, on urban, architectural and technical scale was elaborated as input for second phase of design for research. In this phase a spatial architectural strategy was developed and simulated on the case, in which the key element is the transformation towards an adaptive neighborhood. By means of the use of a second skin not only the existing housing is revitalized without comprising the existing homes and their inhabitants, it also adds the possibility to individually change and upgrade each dwelling in itself over time. In which several forms of stock management can be used or combined allowing duplex housing neighborhoods to become and maintain adaptive and attractive neighborhoods over the course of time.","social housing; housing heritage; duplex housing; post-war housing; adaptive housing; western garden cities; nieuwe bouwen; algemeen uitbreidingsplan; aup; roland holstbuurt; slotermeer; second skin; greenhouse; transformation; adaptive neighborhoods; phased revitalization; rmit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","RMIT: Housing as heritage","",""

(mentor)","2014","In electronic warfare information about radio signals is gathered. Parameters as the direction-of-arrival (DOA) and the frequency can be estimated from sampled data received on antenna arrays. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the use of circular arrays for joint angle-frequency estimation (JAFE). A 1-D (azimuth and frequency) and 2-D (azimuth, elevation and frequency) JAFE algorithm is presented. Both algorithms use phase-mode excitation and ESPRIT. The 1-D algorithm with spatial smoothing is introduced. With this algorithm it is possible to estimate signals with similar frequencies, when the elevation is the same and known for all signals of interest. Simulations demonstrate that when two signals are coherent and a spatial smoothing factor of two or higher is applied the algorithm is able to estimate the azimuth correctly. It is also demonstrated that when two signals have the same DOA a temporal smoothing factor of two is necessary and that more temporal smoothing reduces the standard deviation of the azimuth estimation. It is shown that the phase-mode excitation technique introduces a systematic error that is considerably high for few antenna elements and an even number of elements. It is demonstrated that interpolation can reduce this error in case a UCA of 5 elements, but not for a UCA of an even number of 12 elements. The sample rate used for sampling can be adjusted to the Nyquist rate or higher. Simulations demonstrate that a little bit oversampling reduces the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of the azimuth, elevation and frequency. It shows that after a certain point oversampling increases the RMSE error of the elevation and especially the frequency estimation. An ESPRIT-based algorithm for joint angle-frequency-delay estimation is introduced. For the delay estimation, using a matched filter approach with ESPRIT, it is possible to estimate the delay correctly for a SNR above 40 dB only, since it is very sensitive to imperfections in the signal separation.","JAFE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Circuits and Systems","","","","52.01, 4.22"

The research was used and tested on the World Rowing Championship that are organized in Amsterdam in August 2014. This research was used as a complementary addition to World Rowing’s efforts on sustainability policy and guidelines. For my graduation at the architecture faculty of the Delft University of Technology, I have conducted research on the potential of temporary urban interventions like outdoor sport events. Events have the opportunity to assess and enhance the urban metabolism, I therefore regard them as catalysts in this process and a platform for innovation and societal progress. As pivot in my urban design, the main building of the Bosbaan area is chosen as my graduation design. This building accommodates the functions of office space for the Dutch national rowing federation, a restaurant and meeting centre and the training facilities of the Dutch national rowing athletes. The building is situated on top of the boathouse of the national athletes and several other regional rowing clubs. The rowing venue facilitates the majority of Dutch rowing competitions and is the stage of the annual Dutch championships. To facilitate for these national events, the changing rooms and sanitary are integrated in the boathouse facilities as well. One of the main conclusions for the sustainable organization of an event is that the built environment - in the case of outdoor sport events most often an urban park - plays a crucial role in facilitating sustainability targets. These can only be achieved when (i) the venue is organized efficiently and (ii) the venue is well connected to the city fabric (by means of public transport, bikes, etc.). Under these two preconditions, a visit to an outdoor sport event is more sustainable than staying at home. Events, in this context, have the function to temporarily increase density in the urban park and increase the netto positive balance of the urban park sustainability accounting.","sustainability; rowing; Bosbaan","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Explore Lab","",""

Key dimensions for inclusive business develop during these phases: Route to Market, Customer segment, Value proposition, Venture building and Ecosystem. These phases and business dimensions are they key elements of the Inclusive Innovation Toolkit. The toolkit is characterized by the BoP Innovation Cycle, representing the process of inclusive innovation, and guidebooks with extra material to enable BoPInc to facilitate the core message of that process to small and medium enterprises. The facilitation takes place through a three day workshop. During evaluation and validation of the toolkit, the toolkit appeared to be very much alive among employees of BoPInc.

(mentor)","2014","The first part of this paper provided a brief overview of how UHPFRC is made and why it can achieve such high mechanical properties. At this moment UHPC can easily achieve compressive strengths of 200 MPa, which is about seven times higher than ordinary concrete. However the tensile strength remains normative for structural design. The flexural tensile behavior is strongly influenced by adding fibers to the mix. Flexural strength can go up to 37 MPa (Naaman and Wille, 2012), which is ten times higher than normal concrete. In some cases this means that steel reinforcement is obsolete. This opens up a whole new way of designing with concrete. Continuing with knowledge of the material some UHPFRC applications were briefly described and analyzed in the second part. Structural applications in bridges show us the potential for lightweight, high performance and durable design. The amount of architectural applications however, is very limited. Nevertheless architects can be truly inspired by some of the work of structural engineers. Some of these architectural inspirations are included in the appendix. Some designs that were inspired by the references and knowledge of the material were analyzed with GSA Oasys. The results served as a direct feedback on the designs and give an indication on how slender they could theoretically become. However these analyses are indicative only and are not officially certified calculations. The designs are also theoretical and feasibility is yet to be researched. Nonetheless the analyses do provide insight in structural behavior of UHPFRC in general and also in comparison to conventional materials. Overall conclusion for architects is that it is evident that UHPFRC can truly create certain qualities in design that is only feasible in UHPC. For example in the appearance of extremely slender arches, or in complex filigreeing façade elements. This research has provided a fundamental base for further architectural developments and the search for elegance in concrete design.","UHPC; UHPFRC; architectural design; structural design; Sports Complex; GSA Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-04-15","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Architectural Engineering","","52.3866723, 4.866501"

Mankind’s search for new building materials has produced many innovative solutions in all fields of technology. Composites are already being used in civil engineering and aerospace technology as bridge decks and aeroplane parts, but have not yet been fully integrated in the field of architecture. These fields have shown that composite material – or more specifically, fibre-reinforced polymer – offers a great potential for applications in buildings, because of their favourable material properties compared to traditional building materials. Literature and a number of case studies prove that sandwich elements, which consist out of glass-fibre-reinforced polymer with a polyurethane core, can be load carrying and be used to waterproof and thermally insulate a building simultaneously as an all-in-one skin. Furthermore, sandwich elements can also be used to design a rapidly constructed building. Because there is a lot of research still to be done on fibre-reinforced composites and their applications to building sciences, there is even more potential for the future.","architectural engineering; fibre-reinforced polymer; FRP composite; rapid building construction; future technology; material science; all-in-one skin; sandwich elements; state-of-the-art research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-04-08","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Architectural Engineering","",""

(mentor); Alvarez, L. (mentor); Gremmen, B. (mentor)","2014","Design task While 20 years ago rehabilitation centers were protected environments that secluded patients from society, recently the focus has shifted towards integration of patients in public life. The assignment for the design of the rehabilitation center fits in with this development, as the location for the project is in between the Overtoom, which is a crowded street near the city center of Amsterdam, and the Vondelpark. The site provides the opportunity to mingle disabled and non-disabled people. However, although the character of the rehabilitation center becomes more public, it still means the patient room’s environment should feel private and safe. This ambiguity makes the design of a rehabilitation center very interesting. The above raises two questions. How does the building contribute to the integration of patients in public life and how should you deal with the ambiguity of a public and private building? Generally speaking, the programme consists of ward departments, where patients live for up to a year, and the rehabilion facilities, where specialized therapists work with patients to improve their locomotor system or learn them how to talk. The main goals of rehabilitation are to become self reliant and to participate in society again. Approach Becoming self reliant and participating in society does not only require intensive therapy, but also initiative from patients. Therefore, the design offers stepping stones for a return in society. Architecture is used as a tool to create these stepping stones. By designing the building like a city, an environment is achieved that invites for movement and a stepwise transition from the protected patient room to the city. This miniature city is a preparation for the real city. Architectural spaces invite to come out of the patient room and succeed each other with an increasing level of publicness. That starts with a continuous quiet hallway that offers a view into several courtyards. Different paths lead to the center of the building – a spacious main street that connects the different levels visually by means of shifting voids and physically by a staircase on the outer parts of the street. From this street all courtyards, that vary in ‘publicness’ are visible. Some of these courtyards are covered and used as therapy spaces such as the swimming pool and the sporthall, thus making these facilities transparent. Another courtyard serves as the entrance courtyard and becomes an in between space between the building and the Overtoom. From the patient’s perspective, the sequence of architectural spaces that I incorporated in my design contribute to the fact that the border between private and public is not direct. Gradually, the level of publicness increases and the blurred transitions between these spaces invite to go one step further every time.","Rehabilitation Center; rehabilitation; healthcare; Amsterdam; architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-08-16","Delft University of Technology","Architecture","","Interiors, Buildings and Cities","",""

(mentor); Van der Maaten, L.J.P. (mentor)","2014","If a person is severely disabled, he can be stuck in a wheelchair without being able to effectively control it. One method to regain control is through a Brain Computer Interface (BCI). However, using a BCI for direct input has several drawbacks, such as a low accuracy, low bitrate (causing a delay in input) and high required mental effort. As a result, navigation in such a way is unreliable and in need of improvement. In order to reduce the limitations of a BCI used in a navigation task, the following paradigm was investigated. While navigating, the user can give direct input using a reactive BCI based on Steady-State Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSSEP). With this BCI, possible controls can be selected. To limit the required direct user input, a passive BCI has been investigated in the first part of this thesis. This BCI attempts to detect the user's intention to change course. If such an intention is detected, we can stop at the next intersection and ask the user which direction to turn. If no intention is detected, it is possible to simply move straight ahead without the need for direct input by the user. Since intention detection is not always effective, another passive BCI will be used to detect the errors made, which can then be corrected. Finally, a virtual assistant gathers knowledge about the environment in order to further automate the movement. The complete paradigm was tested in the second part of this project. Offline classification for the passive BCI for intention detection resulted in a mean accuracy of 65%, which, for some subjects, was partly based on eye movement artefacts. However, in some subjects an Event Related Potential (ERP) was observed, unrelated to the eye movement artefacts. This suggest that it may be possible to further improve the classification, even when eye movement artefacts are not present. The complete paradigm, including virtual assistant, was evaluated on effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction with a small test group (n=2). Although still not rated sufficient for use in a real world setting, the results were an improvement compared to using only a reactive BCI for navigation. Further studies with disabled people are recommended in order to find at what BCI classification accuracies the navigation would be deemed satisfactory.","EEG; BCI; virtual assistant; navigation; sCE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Interactive Intelligence","","Master Computer Science - Media and Knowledge Engineering Track","",""

(mentor); Van der Veen, C. (mentor); Blom, C.B.M. (mentor); Van Dalen, K.N. (mentor); Schutte, W.D. (mentor)","2014","Nowadays more and more slender concrete footbridges are designed. Footbridges are designed thinner to increase esthetic value, as well as incorporate sustainability and to reduce building costs, with a consequence that the eigenfrequency of the bridge can drop so low that it may fall into a range of frequencies that is susceptible to vibrations caused by human beings who move along the bridge. When the eigenfrequency of the bridge is nearly the same as the stepfrequency of a person who moves along the deck this may lead to large displacements of the bridge. In this report the consideration of comfort of short-length concrete footbridges is investigated and checked whether this forms a decisive criteria for the determination of the slenderness of the bridge. Requirements of strength and usage are not taken into account. In order to prevent discomfort of users there are demands for comfort compiled for footbridges. The guidelines being compared in this report are:  Expired standard since April 2012: ‘NEN 6723: Guidelines Concrete – Bridges – Constructive Demands and Designmethods’  National Attachment Eurocode The Netherlands: ‘EUR 23984 EN – Design of Lightweight Footbridges for Human Induced Vibrations’ o Single Degree of Freedom Method (SDOFM) o Response Spectra Method (RSM)  National Attachment Eurocode France: ‘SETRA Guide – Footbridges – Assessment of Vibrational Behaviour of Footbridges Under Pedestrian Loading’  United States Guideline: ‘AASHTO – LRFD Guide Specifications for the Design of Pedestrian Bridges’ In this comparison it is found that the design calculations according to NEN 6723 and AASHTO are based upon the relation between the eigenfrequency- and a minimum prescribed weight of the bridge, in which the NEN 6723 is based on the concrete material while the AASHTO is independent of the material being used. The requirement for comfort in standard NEN 6723 must be used when the eigenfrequency of the footbridge is below 5 Hz. Besides the rule mentioned, there must also be a load taken into consideration of 1.5 kN, which is not allowed to cause a deformation of 0.25 mm of the deck. Contrary to the AASHTO which additionally requires that the eigenfrequency of the system is at least 3 Hz. The Eurocode proposes to check comfort when the eigenfrequency of the system is below 5 Hz. Where allowable bridge deck acceleration limits are the basis for design criteria, and the calculation method is independent of the material being used. In this report only the vertical direction is considered, because the other directions do not lead to low frequencies that may cause discomfort. The National Attachment of The Netherlands recommends EUR 23984 EN guideline that determines the occurring bridge deck acceleration based upon the amount of pedestrians and also so-called joggers (running persons) present on the deck. The design calculations in EUR 23984 EN are the SDOFM and the RSM, where the SDOFM takes both pedestrians and joggers into account, while the RSM only takes pedestrians into account. The SDOFM is based upon the usage of a mass-spring system and states comfort has to be checked when one of the eigenfrequencies falls into the critical range, which is between 1.25 Hz and 4.6 Hz. In contrary, the RSM calculates the occurring acceleration with an empirical formula in case one of the eigenfrequencies is below 5 Hz (as prescribed in the Eurocode). The guideline SETRA was released earlier than the EUR 23984 EN and also uses the SDOFM. Comfort has to be checked when one of the eigenfrequencies falls in between 1 Hz and 5 Hz, in which case only pedestrians are being taken into account. No joggers are considered because of the assumption that joggers will be present on the bridge for only a short amount of time, which does not lead to discomfort of other users, and the crossing time of a jogger is less than the time required to resonate the bridge. The guidelines mentioned above are applied to the case study Hoevebrug which is an existing bridge. The Hoevebrug is a clamped slab bridge constructed in concrete class B65. The results are summarized in the table below. *A table has to be made from the text below* Guideline Slenderness [-] Percentage [%] NEN 6723 1 op 44.2 100 EUR 23984 EN – SDOFM – Pedestrians 1 op 90.3 204.3 EUR 23984 EN – SDOFM – Pedestrians and Joggers 1 op 61.4 138.9 EUR 23984 EN – RSM 1 op 42.1 95.2 SETRA 1 op 84.2 190.5 AASHTO 1 op 70.2 158.8 Subsequently a separate study of parameters is conducted for short footbridges with the aid of the SDOFM of guideline EUR 23984 EN. The lengths considered vary between 10- and 30 meters. The influence and response of the bridge are considered with parameters of density, Young’s modulus, length, imposition, and height, where the quantity of pedestrians present on the deck is taken to be 0.5 persons/m2 as the Eurocode prescribes. It is found that the second harmonic of pedestrians (the EUR 23984 EN describes this as the stepfrequency between 2.3 Hz and 4.6 Hz) does not lead to discomfort because of the small load being excited by the pedestrian. So it can be stated the second harmonic of pedestrians is not a criteria for the determination of the height of the deck. Joggers however lead in all cases to extremely high values of acceleration of the deck, because the joggers may be assumed to be placed on the deck where the displacement is expected to be the largest. To check whether the response due to joggers can be reduced, a more detailed calculation is considered. The jogger is modeled as a moving harmonic load in time on a deck that is hinged on both sides. Next the differential equation of the continuous system is established and solved. Hereby creating a relation between stepfrequency, velocity, and load of the jogger. Allowing for a more accurate estimation of bridge response, multiple situations of joggers moving along the bridge as a group are then considered and in many cases show the response of the deck is not very similar to the result obtained from SDOFM. In the case of the calculation method of the moving harmonic, the response of the deck will only be significant when the stepfrequency almost equals the eigenfrequency of the system. The conclusion requires that joggers satisfy the condition that every jogger must run with the same frequency across the deck, as well as the interval between the joggers (if present) is equal to the period of the stepfrequency. Besides this the process of an occurring acceleration in vertical direction in case of a person moving along the bridge is ‘self-limiting’. This means that a person is not able to move along the bridge when the occurring acceleration in vertical direction is too large. Because the person stops moving there will no longer be a dynamic load excited any more so that the construction will damp out.","trilling; beton; voetgangersbrug; voetgangers; joggers; EUR 23984 EN; versnelling; harmoniserende; vibration; concrete; pedestrianbridge; pedestrians; acceleration; comfort; harmonic; moving; slankheid; slenderness; footbridge","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-04-17","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Master: concrete structures","",""

(mentor)","2014","With rising energy consumption in the world and the depletion of fossil fuels in the near future, we have to make sure that energy security is guaranteed when conventional energy sources are depleted (BP, 2012). Nowadays, the energy we use is from fossil fuel sources and the generation of energy releases the greenhouse gas CO2 and energy is transported over large distances. The energy needs to be generated locally and from a sustainable source to have energy security. Buildings contribute 30% to the total energy consumption in the Netherlands (Rijksoverheid, 2011) and therefore, if buildings can generate their own energy, it will have a large impact on the total energy consumption. Currently popular sustainable energy harvesters are windmills and photovoltaic panels. These systems can sustainably generate electricity, but it cannot take up CO2 to support the goal of meeting the value of 20% below the 1990 level by 2020 (European Union, 2012). Microalgae can mitigate the CO2 and produce energy at the same time. The focus of this paper is on the use of algae as a building component that reduces the external energy demand in existing and new buildings. Especially the use of algae in façade design in closed photo bioreactors can be implemented as components in buildings. These closed photo bioreactors appears in many shapes and have to meet specific conditions for microalgae cultivation. Conditions for microalgae to survive and grow is dependent on (sun)-light, nutrients, pH, CO2 and temperature (Tampier, Alabi, & Bilbeau, 2009). Closed photo bioreactors needs to be designed with these conditions in mind. During the cultivation process, the appearance of the building will change in color and become less transparent with increasing biomass concentration. The building will have a dynamic appearance with a liquid façade that also works as an adaptive sunshade. However, microalgae cultivation on buildings is not usual. Most of the results documented about the productivity of microalgae are measured in laboratory conditions. So designing a building with the main focus on microalgae as element is quite new in the world of architecture. The results provided by this paper will give you an insight of the possibilities of algae when used in architecture in comparison to industrial applications. Algae is seen as one of the most promising sustainable way to produce energy in the future but it is still under development to increase its energy output (Wijffels & Barbosa, 2010). This paper can only provide insights of the current algae technologies. So future developments and breakthroughs can change the way we think about cultivating microalgae and application in buildings. Algae technology has yet a long way to go to reach its full potential. But the development of algae technology has just been started and the potentials are high (Wijffels & Barbosa, 2010). In comparison to fossil fuels, biofuels are not profitable yet in terms of costs and low harvesting efficiency. That’s why we search for new applications as in components in buildings to find new ways to use algae in the build environment.","Algae; Architecture; sloterdijk; amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Architectural Engineering","",""

It consists of a research design, a theoretical framework, a methodological framework, a case study, and a model for initiating participatory development. The composition of the theoretical framework by doing an extensive literature review has resulted in a clear definition of participatory development and a practical spectrum of participation. The differences in government and resident perspective have been analyzed and evaluated, resulting in a list of nine variables. The panelists have assigned appropriate levels of participation to each of the variables, according to their perspective. The results from this part of the research indicate a moderate agreement among panelists. This means that for six variables, there is a shared perspective on the desired approach to participatory development opportunities. For three variables, the conclusion has to be drawn that there is no shared perspective at this point in time. The panelists have offered suggestions for project-based recovery opportunities. These suggestions have been evaluated using the spectrum of participation, and are explained regarding their implications for tangible projects. The methodological design used in this thesis is used to construct a model capable of enabling residents & local government to form a mutual understanding about planning & implementing post-disaster redevelopments in the recovery phase, identifying essential local recovery projects accordingly. The methods used in and designed for this case study have resulted in a model that enables a community to initiate participatory developments in the recovery phase, even when the residents have been excluded from the post-disaster redevelopment process so far.","Post-disaster redevelopment; urban area development; Katrina; New Orleans; Lower Ninth Ward; participatory development; participation; community; government; redevelopment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-04-15","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Urban Area Development","",""

Renewable energy production will increasingly start to compete with other forms of land use such as recreation, nature and agriculture. Its careful integration therefore becomes detrimental. This paper discusses renewable energy systems and what determines their sustainability. It offers a set of analysis methods which can be used when designing for renewable energy production. These methods include energy potential and system mapping. This paper also presents an analysis of Amsterdam’s energy system and it’s potentials for renewable energy production using the before mentioned methods. This analyses describes the design casus and seeks to identify possibilities for an intervention. It gives a set of possibilities producing renewable energy in the Brettenzone which include: recycling nutrients from industrial waste streams to agriculturally produce food and biogas, producing electrical power using PV cells, harvesting heat for the district network using solar collectors and aquifers, as well as harvesting cold for a future district network (Teleport) using deep water source cooling (Sloterplas), absorption cooling devices, the Binnen-IJ and aquifers. The most promising proposal, an agricultural enterprise producing food and biogas, is analysed further. Such an enterprise would produce food, feed and fuel whilst maintaining a theoretically closed cycle of fertilising nutrients. This paper present research into the requirements of such a food, feed, fuel and fertiliser farm entitled, the 4F farm. The paper presents the aspects which determine the sustainability of the 4F farm with an emphasis on the bioenergy aspect. It explores possible sources of plant biomass by comparing their biogas yield rates as well as their climatic requirements in comparison to the conditions in Amsterdam. A similar analysis is made for manure as a source of biomass. The biogas production process is also discussed as well as the required systems and equipment. From this paper it can be concluded that the described food and biogas farm should seek to optimize the yield of food, feed, fuel and fertilizer in that respective order of importance. Also it offers the required data and recommendations for designing the 4F farm. The paper notes however that the 4F’s energy yields per acre are not sufficient to fulfi ll the ambition of acting as an energyscape. For this goal to be reached the 4F farm should also integrate other energy harvesting techniques such as PV cells or solar collectors. The 4F farm can be suffi cient however to sustain a small autarkic neighbourhood.","4Ffarming; closed cycle agriculture; energy potential mapping; architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-04-13","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Binnekamp, R. (mentor)","2014","Societal developments are timeless and occur at an ever increasing pace that affects demand for Corporate Real Estate (CRE). Real estate flexibility, as part of a CRE strategy, enables anticipation on those uncertain societal developments. Many studies refer to real estate flexibility, which could be grouped into physical, technical, organizational, and juridical-financial flexibility (De Jonge & Den Heijer, 2004). The focus in this article is on the latter. Juridical-financial flexibility is the management’s ability to quickly decrease real estate expenses or to quickly increase real estate benefits if the quantitative demand for space changes (De Jonge & Den Heijer, 2004). The inclusion of juridical-financial flexibility can assure that the risk of redundancy or shortage of space is minimized through short-term reconsiderations of real estate commitments. However, short-term real estate commitments are accompanied with additional costs which makes maximal flexibility unprofitable. Hence, the question is which level of juridical-financial flexibility is optimal in a specific organisation? An operational model technique is developed to determine the optimal level of juridical-financial flexibility in CRE portfolios, an operational step that is missing in the field of CRE management. The operational model is a linear programming model that formulates a strategic recommendation to CRE management by defining the portfolio compilation with an optimal juridical-financial flexibility level. At this level, the financial investment in juridical-financial flexibility weighs up against the financial implications of mismatches in supply and demand, both in the present and in the future. In literature, several models have been developed that could be used to differentiate CRE assets into peripheries, based on their envisioned future strategic role (Mather, 2006 in Bruins, 2010; Gibson & Lizieri, 1999; Mather, 2007; Weatherhead, 1997). With these existing models, four peripheries are composed with the objective to link CRE assets to an appropriate juridical format. These peripheries are: the core ownership periphery, the core leased periphery, the 1st periphery, and the 2nd periphery. Next to the quantitative demand for space, also the qualitative demand is an important asset level aspect, at present and in the future. Therefore, the peripheral approach is applied per user profile to combine the two dimensions (Van Ussel, 2010). The future demand for corporate space has an uncertain value, which is tackled with the peripheral approach. To determine the periphery proportions in the peripheral approach, three scenarios are developed that use the current demand as a starting point (based on Arkesteijn, 2005 in Volkers, 2006). To transform a current into a future desired CRE portfolio, the following main real estate strategies are available (Den Heijer & Vijverberg, 2004): disposal strategies, retaining strategies, and acquiring strategies. Next to the main strategy that is determined by the current juridical format, the operational model uses generic level variables to determine the specific asset interventions. The operational model can be used to optimise juridical-financial flexibility within a single CRE portfolio or to assess its current ability to anticipate uncertainty. In the single case study, the operational model is used to optimise the level of juridical-financial flexibility of a local member Rabobank and formulates a CRE strategy that decreases the CRE costs with 8%. In a broader perspective, CRE costs are considered to be the second largest corporate expenditure, after people (Leibson, 2007; Louko, 2004).","corporate real estate management; juridical-financial flexibility; uncertainty; operations research managment; linear programming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-04-10","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Real Estate Management","",""

Yet, characterizing the composite material properties is very expensive and time consuming. Parameters like non-linear shear and their interactions with stresses perpendicular to the fiber direction are hardly ever truly understood. The Short Beam Shear (SBS) method, combined with surface strain measurements from Digital Image Correlation (DIC), is a solution to this deficiency. The SBS specimens are subject to combined bending and shear stresses, which is used to calculate the Poisson’s ratio and the axial and non-linear shear stiffness properties. A Finite Element Model (FEM) is used to replace the surface stress estimates to improve the material parameter accuracy. By combining nodal surface stresses from FEM and corresponding strains from DIC, stress-strain curves are plotted over the surface. This spatial variability analysis calculates a field of shear stiffness parameters. Near the supports, where transverse stresses are compressive, the analysis shows increased shear stiffness in the non-linear regime. This indicates that transverse stress components influence the shear stress-strain response, which the SBS method could characterize.","short beam shear; digital image correlation; FEM updating; composites; characterization; spatial variability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Mechanics, Aerospace Structures & Materials","","Structural Integrity","",""

The beach suffers from structural erosion and earlier measures to deal with this have not succeeded. In this project, a solution is offered to reach two goals: foremost, a beach improvement to the Oasis beach sector and second, a halt to the structural erosion in the sector in order to maintain the beach improvement. These goals are strongly linked to one another and contain several research questions to be able to find suitable solutions. A vast analysis on the area has been made. It becomes clear in the project that these impacts are decisive in the erosion that takes place, as natural beach recovery is limitedly possible. An important finding during the analysis is that there is no significant sediment transport in the Oasis beach sector during normal conditions. However, the steep bathymetry and the re-occurrence of cold fronts and hurricanes induce large cross-shore transport and sediment is extracted from the system, leaving the Oasis beach sector with a structural erosion problem. The solution of the problem would have to be a combination of hard and soft measurements. Three alternatives were created, plus a base alternative. The base alternative consists of the demolition of the existing structures and a nourishment. The three alternatives are respectively a ‘Perched beach’, ‘Emerged breakwaters’ and ‘Wooden L-shaped piers’. All alternatives were simulated with the use of Delft3D and XBeach. A Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) was carried out to evaluate the alternatives. The most important criteria in this are the protection against erosion and spatial quality. The MCA, in combination with the estimated accompanying costs, resulted in a final solution proposal, being the perched beach. Although scoring high in general, a few adjustments are made to the design. An addition is made by introducing a sill to the alternative. The sill will take over the function of supporting the beach and enables a smaller beach nourishment and a better controllable beach profile, as it is build closer to shore. Furthermore, the height of the breakwater is increased in order to decrease the amount of necessary maintenance. The proposition of the solution comes with an indication of planning and costs. The construction time is estimated to be 343 days. Construction costs are calculated to be $ 6,970,175.70 CUP, including the costs for the initial nourishment and the demolition of existing structures.","beach improvement; Cuba; Delft3D; XBeach; nourishment","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Westerweel, J. (mentor); Yarusevych, S. (mentor)","2014","Step cylinders have numerous applications, for instance, radio communication towers, airport control-towers, antenna members, etc. Numerous applications motivate researchers to investigate this bluff body both numerically and experimentally. The single step cylinder model is comprised of a small-diameter cylinder (d) attached coaxially to a large-diameter cylinder (D). In this study vortex shedding from such a bluff body is investigated experimentally using Tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (TOMO PIV). Experiments are conducted in the low-speed w-tunnel of the aerospace engineering department of TU Delft. The cylinders' diameter ratio D/d is ranging from 1.14 to 2.67, and the Reynolds numbers based on the large cylinder are ranging from 2000 to 5100. The TOMO PIV system consists of six CCD cameras subtending an arc and a Nd:YAG laser. LaVision Davis 8 is used for image acquisition and processing. The use of TOMO PIV enables quantitative visualization and analysis of the intricate vortex topology and vortex dynamics. The aim of the study is the exploration of the near wake of the step cylinder, focusing on the region of stepwise discontinuity. Considering history of the investigations for this geometry, there is no study available for this range of Reynolds number, and this range of the diameter ratios. For the range of the parameters investigated, turbulent vortex shedding occurs in the single-step cylinder wake. Thus, the investigations will put more insight into the flow development in the wake of this bluff body. The results showed that distinct spanwise vortex cells form in the step cylinder wake: a single vortex shedding cell in the wake of the small cylinder, and one vortex shedding cell in the wake of the large cylinder. However, in the wake of the large cylinder wake an interaction region is also introduced. The difference in the diameters leads to a variation in the vortex shedding frequency, which introduces intricate three-dimensional vortex interactions in the wake of the step cylinder. Once in a while, the vortex shedding becomes out of phase, which introduces a dislocation at the boundary of two cells. The dislocation is exhibited by a half-loop connection, in which two vortices within the same cell connect to each other. Results showed that there is no significant Reynolds number effect on the average spanwise extent of the vortex cells and the transition region between neighboring cells. However, it was found that in such a high Reynolds number streamwise vortices are introduced into the wake which complicates the vortex dynamic, and vortex interactions.","Tomo-PIV; Step cylinder; Bluff body","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-04-12","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Mechanical Engineering","","Solid and Fluid Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Van den Berg, K. (mentor); Carette, N. (mentor); Keuning, J.A. (mentor); Visser, K. (mentor)","2014","One way of stabilizing a ship is by anti-roll tanks. There are three kinds of anti-roll tanks: the free-surface, U-tube and free-flooding tanks. Of these the free-flooding anti-roll tank is the least known and applied. The reason is that the performance of these tanks is reduced due to a momentum drag penalty incurred at forward speeds. This performance penalty does not occur for offshore installation vessels in operation, which remain stationary or sail at very low forward speeds. An advantage of free-flooding tanks over U-tube and free-surface tanks is that they are easy to retrofit, because they do not require a considerable amount of space in the center part of the vessel, but can be built into the sides where, generally, plenty of space is available due to the broad beam of such vessels. Also, they can be closed off and emptied for transits. Free-flooding tanks are thus a viable option for the stabilization of offshore installation vessels. How effective are free-flooding tanks? The modeling of this kind of tanks is complex, because of the interaction of the tank fluid with the environment. The amount of water in the tanks varies continuously due to the inflow and outflow of water through the flooding ports. In the 80s of the last century the US Navy were looking to improve the motions of their aircraft carriers, whose roll motion behavior had deteriorated as a result of upgrades over the years of service. They developed a prediction model in the frequency domain based on linearized ship motion theory and a regular wave input, which includes several non-linear effects to closer approximate the actual behavior of the water in the free-flooding tanks. In this study, this prediction model is programmed into SCILAB (a numerical solution program) and the model is evaluated for a pipelaying vessel. The input for the model is the hydrodynamic database from a 3D diffraction program, in this case AQWA. The results show that free-flooding tanks are effective at reducing the roll motions of the ship for lift operations. Tuned tanks, where the tank transfer period is tuned to the ship natural frequency, perform better than untuned tanks, because for tuned tanks the tank moment lags the ship motion 90° at resonance frequency. To support the design of free-flooding tanks the influences of different parameters in the tank model are quantified. Also, an attempt is made to transform this model to time domain simulation in AQWA. The coupling of the tank, the ship motions and the fluid pressures is of high importance for the tank moment. Due to limitations in AQWA it is impossible to integrate the tank equation directly and fully with the ship motions and the fluid domain. To check the results from the AQWA simulation a simple time domain simulation was programmed in SCILAB based on the same assumptions as for frequency domain. The results from this simulation match the results from the frequency domain, because based on the same assumptions. It is questionable whether these assumptions still hold in time domain. Also, the motions during a time interval are not influenced by the motions before this interval in this simple time domain simulation. Consequently, the results of the time domain simulation have been found to be unreliable and time domain simulation must be addressed in a different way.","anti-roll; free-flooding; stabilization; roll motion; tank; passive; damping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","Hydrodynamics","",""

(mentor); Tabeau, K.E. (mentor)","2014","Organizations can distinguish themselves from others in the market by means of new products. The new product development (NPD) process is very important for organizations. Therefore organizations keep searching for new ways to be successful in NPD. Previous empirical research on new product performance has provided considerable evidence that a wide variety of antecedent factors can influence the outcomes of NPD. Product newness is a factor that is positively associated with new product performance, and therefore companies keep trying to increase the degree of newness of products. Recently there has also been tremendous interest in involving external designers to help companies develop successful new products. However, it seems that there is a need to better understand how the collaboration with external design agencies can be used in light of improved NPD outcomes. This study examines the effects of the collaboration with external design agencies during the NPD process. Furthermore, with entering new domains and involving external companies to increase the product newness uncertainties and risks come along. Project protocols can play an important role in NPD, by helping to achieve clarity and stability in order to reduce these uncertainties and risks during the process. This is particularly important when entering unfamiliar markets. Project protocols offer a common ground for all parties involved, describe the general parameters that a new product should exhibit (i.e. target segments, base technology, pricing communication and distribution channels) and set priorities for these parameters. However, there is little empirical evidence on the influence of project protocols on product newness. Therefore, this research also focuses on this gap in literature by studying the impact of project protocols on product newness. The goal of this study is to reveal factors related to the collaboration with external designers, that impact the outcomes of innovation projects in terms of product newness and new product performance by means of a quantitative study. This study presents a conceptual framework to clarify the relationships between all variables in the study. Furthermore, expanding on the research on dyadic relations within NPD, this study focuses on the dyadic collaboration between an external designer and internal NPD project manager. The unit of analysis in this study is the innovation project in which a design consultancy firm was hired to contribute to the innovation project. The empirical data incorporated in this study stem for Dutch NPD companies and design agencies that collaborated in an innovation project. The final sample consisted of 206 respondents, of which 103 respondents are designers and 103 are managers, together forming 103 dyadic collaboration. In a large survey, the dissimilarities between designers and managers is explored. This study examines how product performance is affected by product newness, and likewise how product newness is affected by project protocol. Thereby the moderating role of the dissimilarities in cognitive style in the NPD dyads on the relationship between project protocol and product newness is examined. However, no significant association is found between product newness and new product performance. Likewise, project protocol proved not to be related to improved product newness. This study also hypothesizes that high dissimilarities between the external designer and NPD manager positively influence the outcomes of the NPD project regarding the degree of product newness. Contrary to expectations, the dissimilarities between the managers and external designers proved to have little or no influence on the degree of product newness or on the relationship between project protocol and product newness. No hypotheses were supported. In addition to these findings, the study also explores how project protocol is associated with improved new product performance and the effect of the unique cognitive styles of the external designers and NPD managers. The individual unique cognitive styles do influence the product newness and new product performance. Finally, the results provide management insights in how to arrange effective NPD dyads in light of the desired outcomes of the innovation project, e.g. a higher degree of product newness or improved new product performance. One important managerial inference from this study is that new product development managers should consider hiring designers that are not only creative, but that also have proved to be conform to rules or to pay attention to details.","NPD dyad; Cognitive style; Project protocol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

An analytical modeling code has been developed and different parameter combinations have been tested to study the best setup for this survey. Using the modeling code it has been shown that the horizontal source and vertical receiver setup would indeed be feasible, that frequencies below 1 Hz should be used for transmitting and that the offset of the receivers should be between 3 and 6 km. Due to steam injection in the reservoir the thickness of the steam layer and therefore the electric conductivity of the reservoir will change. These changes can be detected by repeated measurements over time. Parameters such as the depth of the reservoir and changes in the overburden were shown to have little influence.","CSEM; modeling; vertical electric field","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Applied Geophysics and Petrophysics","",""

(mentor)","2014","This project is in collaboration with Fly Aeolus. Fly Aeolus is a private air services that engages in the opportunities for low cost private air services on short haul destinations available within the business aviation environment. Fly Aeolus offers flexible and reliable time-efficient, door-to-door business flight travel in North-West Europe. The goal of this graduation project is to create a product and/or service that provides brand awareness for Fly Aeolus. The passenger journey and passenger experience will play an important role and will be used as a key element in this project. Touch points in the whole journey will be redesigned to create and communicate a new brand experience. The first phase of the project is the analysis phase, this will be used as an input for the idea generation phase in which one concept will be further developed into a final design. Finally the concept will be evaluated and recommendations will be drawn. A more detailed overview of the main findings in these phases is summarized below. Analysis The first phase of this project is the analysis phase existing of an internal and external analysis. The internal analysis consisting of an analysis of the company, a passenger analysis, stakeholder analysis and business model analysis is used to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of Fly Aeolus. From this we can conclude that the most important strengths are: - Time efficiency: no need to check in, no delays, landing close to destination and the passenger can decide when he or she wants to leave. - The adventure of flying: it is an experience where you have the possibility to sit next to the pilot and to experience the nice view closely. Since Fly Aeolus is missing out clients weaknesses of the company are found: - Limitations of the Cirrus planes: maximum of three passengers and they do not fly further than North-West Europe. - Weather sensitive: not all Cirrus planes can fly through bad weather (icing in the air). - Lack of brand awareness The external analysis exists of a trend analysis and a competitor analysis from this opportunities and threats are generated. The most important opportunities for Fly Aeolus are: - Mobilizing the entire passenger journey to create a seamless passenger journey. - Personalization of the service - Dynamic plans to update the client 24/7 - The use of videos, social media and photos to create a better communication to the customers. The strengths and weaknesses and the opportunities and threats are combined in a diagram called the SWOT matrix. When combining the strengths and weaknesses with matching opportunities and threats interesting insights/ideas are created. After clustering the first ideas different search fields are developed that can be used as a design direction. From the six search fields the three most promising fields are chosen namely new markets, partnerships and communication. Those three design directions serve as input for the next phase the synthesis. Synthesis In the idea generation phase first ideas are developed by brainstorms and a creative session. After analysing the ideas by different criterion and ranging them in different levels of abstraction the decision is made to combine two ideas into one concept. These ideas are focused on the leisure market namely offering informative flights (scenic flight above interesting places in North-West Europe) in combination with package flight (private flight including an interesting activity in North-West Europe). Through a small market research insights and feedback is used to develop the final design called Fly Your. Fly Your is the overall name of the design and is divided into Fly Your Business and Fly Your Dreams. Fly Your Business is focussing on the business flight Fly Aeolus is already performing. Fly Your Dreams will concentrate on the exclusive day out experiences and it worked out further in this project. During the passenger journey of Fly Your Dreams different touch points are created or redesigned to generate a special customer experience. -The touch points are: - Website: through the website customers can explore the different packages that Fly Your Dreams is offering. It is also possible to plan and book your trip directly through the website. It is important that the website radiates the experience this is done through images and a video that shows the passenger experience. - Invitation: after booking the trip the passengers receive a personal invitation at home. This invitation includes a boarding pass, a small brochure with more information about the activity and destination. And it includes an invitation to download the Fly Your Dreams app which can be done by scanning the QR code on the invitation with your phone. - Application: The application is an important touch points and is used before the flight, during the flight and after. Before the flight the app gives the passengers feedback about the day out, during the trip the passengers can get information about the cities they are passing by using the function in the air. After the passengers experienced the day out they receive a message to give feedback about the flight. Postcard: A week after the passengers experienced a great day out they receive a photo postcard that includes photos made during the trip. Around the private flight a whole experience is build to create and communicate brand awareness for Fly Your Dreams. From the different touch points prototypes are created to make it possible to evaluate the concept in the next stage. Validation In the last phase of the project the final concept is evaluated through several user tests and interviews. Different insights are gathered about the different touch points, the concept itself, partnerships and marketing. The insights are used as recommendations for further developments. The most important recommendations are: - The experience needs to be unique and exclusive including a perfect service. - To make the concept work it is necessary to find partners that can help in organizing the experiences and with promotion - Trips should be offered in different price ranges and can be made as exclusive as the customer wants. A roadmap is created to give an overview of the first steps Fly Your Dreams need to take the coming months to make the concept work. Moreover a new business model canvas is formed that shows how Fly Your Dreams can create and capture value. Additional project reflection will conclude this project.","private flights; leisure market","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

(mentor); Vollebregt, S. (mentor)","2014","This thesis has explored the possibility of using carbon nanotubes (CNT) as a novel material for through-silicon vias (TSV) in 3D-integrated circuits. With the steady downscaling trend of the semiconductor industry, a major limiting factor to the overall performance of the device is the delay from interconnects; a trend that is worsening over successive technology nodes. As a remedy to this, the industry has been exploring the possibility of fabricating three dimensional integrated circuits, with shorter interconnect lengths (hence delay). Even then, the standard interconnect (or via) material, which is copper, poses a host of physical and technological challenges that constrain the development of this technology. The carbon nanotube is considered to be a promising alternative to copper, which can alleviate most of these problems. The thesis investigated the LPCVD growth of CNT on a novel substrate, with Fe as catalyst layer and ZrN as support layer. The combination of these two materials has the potential to support the growth of ultra-long CNT vias that are ideal for TSV applications. Before the successful growth of CNT, however, the right growth recipe had to be identified. For this purpose, a design-of-experiments approach was followed and the Taguchi method was used to optimize the recipes. Using optimized recipes for the highest length, CNT growth on continuous and patterned catalyst islands were carried out, resulting in a super-growth of ~ 900 µm in the first case, and ~ 200 µm in the second. The difference in magnitude and uniformity of the growth height for the two cases was studied, and it was understood how the size and distribution of the catalyst islands played an important role in CNT growth. When fabricating CNT-based interconnects, one should also have an idea about their electrical properties. An important property is the resistivity, which needs to be lower than copper. During this work, a recipe was designed which could grow CNT with the minimum resistivity. In order to achieve this, two equivalent circuit models were studied and a simple model was developed, which could calculate the CNT resistivity from their physical parameters (quality, density, diameter etc.). To measure the values of these parameters, a series of characterization experiments were performed on the growth samples, and their resistivities were calculated. Seeing that, these values were orders of magnitude higher than copper, new recipes were designed to increase the CNT growth density and quality. Using these, it was possible to decrease the CNT resistivity. Finally, the designed recipes were put to the test, when integration of CNT as TSV was attempted in a real 3D-IC prototype. Although not entirely successful, the growth results so obtained, gave an indication of how CNT growth in deep vias could be performed, and the TSV process made successful in the future.","Carbon nanotubes; Through-silicon vias; LPCVD; Design of experiments: Taguchi; Catalyst loading effect; CNT resistivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-04-10","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","ECTM","",""

While still in its infancy, a paradigm shift is to be expected that will create a mobile cloud ecosystem with new mobile cloud concepts and service offerings that are enabled by service platforms. Research into mobile cloud computing brings to light what challenges and opportunities exist from the perspective of the mobile network operator (MNO). A business model framework for mobile services provisioning is adapted to service platforms, taking into account the characteristics of two- and multi-sided platforms. Research methods for surveys and interviews were applied based on this adapted platform business model framework. And consequently investigated the role of the MNO in future mobile cloud platform business models (MCPBMs) in terms of the value proposition that it can deliver towards platform components in MCC. It was found that a role for the MNO can be imagined in operating as a context manager and privacy & security manager to MCPBMs, and delivering several value elements towards those service platforms. Network functionalities can be unlocked as to provide location, network, and user-identity information through APIs and aid the establishing of a context manager for future mobile cloud services. In terms of privacy & security management the MNO can furthermore play a role in securing heterogeneous network access, whilst also potentially leveraging its control over the SIM-card for enhanced data-security and leveraging its existing AAA-services and infrastructure to provide privacy management for MCC end-users. In order for the MNO to deliver those value elements it must however overcome hurdles in the domains of service, technology, organisation, and finance, whilst also taking into account external factors existing of regulatory, market, and technological developments. The final outcome of this thesis research project is a preliminary direction for MCPBM design that can serve as a guide to the MNO deriving maximum value from its resources & capabilities, as the mobile cloud computing ecosystem continues to evolve.","mobile cloud computing; service platforms; business models; mobile network operators; two- and multi-sided platforms; design science research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Information and Communication Technology","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor); Gielen, M.A. (mentor)","2014","For this project the goal was to obtain user insights about the perspectives of children about rebellion in play. After conducting a literature study it was found that being rebellious is beneficial for children, because it allows them to escape from the adult world. This leads to developing multiple capabilities like self-reliance, co-operation, problem solving and interpersonal skills (Gielen and van Leeuwen, 2013). The literature review ended with two research questions about rebellion in play and multiple sub research questions. The main questions are: How do children perceive rebellion and rebellion in play? How do children perceive rules and rules within play? Research method: Co-research To obtain user insights, a novel method called co-research was used. Co-research is a method in which the user takes the role of researcher, researching his or her peers. This might lead to rich contextual insights (van Doorn, 2013). The previous described research questions were translated to interview questions for children, in order to obtain insights about rebellion in play. After, co-research was conducted with two groups of five children. During three sessions, the children were trained in conducting interviews and conducted the actual interviews with their peers. The co-research sessions also served as a case study to evaluate provisional guidelines about conducting research. This can be found at the end of the report. All the sessions and interviews were transcribed and analyzed. Interesting quotes were selected and interpreted by a group of five industrial design students. This led to the following insights about rebellion in play. The transcripts of the co-research sessions and the interviews were taken to the next phase of the project: Analysis Analysis It was found that children have clear motivations to act rebellious. The rebellious acts have certain consequences, but children tend to avoid these consequences. In general they try to seek their personal limit of acting rebellious, without having to deal with the consequences. Motivation to act rebellious Children have several motivations to act rebellious: personal reputation, competition, revenge and inner urge. Different types of rebellious children could be identified, which have different motivations to act rebellious or not (personal reputation). For instance, The little shy girl, would not act rebellious on a regular base, because she is scared of the consequences. If she acts rebellious, she would do it to experience how it feels so she can talk along with her friends. The popular guy acts rebellious, to maintain his popular reputation. He will make fun of others and pretend to be the best in everything. The bad boy wants to look tough and therefore acts rebellious openly. The second motivation is about competition: they rebel because they want to win a game. The third motivation: inner urges, is about feeling the urge to act rebellious, just because a certain act is forbidden. Sometimes children act rebellious just for fun or for example after a long time of conforming behavior. The last motivation is about revenge: you act rebellious because you are angry with someone. What is rebellion? During the co-research sessions it was found that children perceive rebellion as fun. Rebellious behavior can be divided in different categories: doing bad things secretly, bullying, cheating, demolishing and physically hurting. Rebellion was perceived as something nice, especially when they are able to avoid the consequences like punishment. Consequences of rebellious behavior While being rebellious in the attendance of some adult, you will get punished for your behavior, while in the attendance of other children; there are multiple possible reactions, depending on the character of the child. Some children get angry, some children have to cry while get cheated on, because they find it unfair and other children have to laugh when someone cheats. It seems that cheating is not a big issue, because after some minutes the game continues again. There is interplay between rebellious behavior and the consequences: avoiding the consequences of rebellious behavior. This friction field seems to be the most interesting for the children. They want to act rebellious, find their personal limit of rebellious behavior, but avoid the consequences. Limits of rebellion This leads to the limit of rebellious behavior; you should not hurt others, force others, or demolish others’ properties. There is a rule, which all the children agreed on: Treat others the way you want to be treated yourself. In general, children like to play without parents, because this enables them to do what they want. The rules of behavior are clear between peers. If there are problems, mostly they are able to solve these themselves. The research findings were represented in a research scheme (figure 2 in this report). This scheme together with the interaction vision could be used as the starting point for designing. Applying the research scheme (figure 2 in this report). Several categories of rebellious behavior were described in the scheme with corresponding rebellious actions. These actions can be used as the starting point of a brainstorm session, because those are the things that children perceive as rebellious. When an idea is born, it is important to look at the motivations in the scheme. Children have different motivations to act rebellious. These motivations could be used as user cues in your design in order to trigger the children to act rebellious. The rebellious actions lead to several consequences, which children tend to avoid. It is important to look at the consequences of your design: what are the consequences of being rebellious and which of the consequences should be removed/remained? Rebellious behavior leads to four kinds of consequences: 1. A conflict with your inner self: the dilemma to act rebellious or not. 2. A conflict with a peer - When being rebellious against a person, a conflict between those two might arise. 3. A group conflict - when being rebellious and the group results suffer from it, a group conflict might arise. 4. A conflict with the outer world - another possibility is that people who are not directly participating in your environment, get in a conflict with you about your behaviour. For example: parents, teachers or a different group of children not participating the game. When designing, it is important to question yourself what kind of conflict you want to trigger with your design. Based on this scheme, multiple ideas and three concepts were generated. The concept serve as an illustration of how to use the research scheme and as an inspiration to designers. Example of concept As an illustration of how to use this scheme, three concepts were generated. One of the concepts will shortly be described below. Moving base: Moving base is a concept based on the conventional game “hide and seek”. In hide and seek there is a base, where the seeker has to tag someone he/she found or were the hiders can set themselves free. In this concept there are five bases instead of one. During the game, the hiders can change the location of the active base. In the conventional game “hide and seek” it was perceived as cheating to hide close to the base or when the seeker was staying close to the base. By playing ‘moving base’, children are being rebellious against the rules of the conventional game. The value of this game lies in the fact that children can use certain strategies to win the game, for example by moving the base closer to them. Also they can betray their opponents by revealing their spot or ruining their strategy. Children are being rebellious against their peers, which might result in conflicts with peers or group conflicts. Evaluation of designing for rebellion in play After using the scheme to generate concepts, an evaluation of designing for rebellion in play was done. Is it possible to design rebellious games or playgrounds? Once you design something, that facilitates rebellious behaviour, it might not be rebellious anymore, because you approve it. On the other hand, when forbidding things and setting up clear rules which children might break, it becomes too obvious and becomes conforming soon enough as well. On conclusion, when designing for rebellion, try to design subtle cues that provide children with the opportunity to rebel. The value of rebellious behaviour might lie in the interaction between children, which is the result of rebellious behaviour. This interaction has to do with the four types of conflict described earlier (Confict with inner self, with a peer, group conflict and with the outer world). When designing, try to trigger these kinds of conflicts, based on the motivations named in the scheme. Use the acts of rebellious behaviour as an inspiration of what kind of rebellious things to design, but try to not literally translate them into ideas. After the research phase, it was concluded that there is a friction field for children in the scheme: seeking their personal limit of rebellious behaviour without having to deal with the consequences. At the end of this project, it can be concluded that the designer should not focus on this friction field, because when focusing on removing the consequences the rebellious feeling might vanish. Therefore, the designer should focus on the friction field: Consequences and avoiding the consequences. New vision This lead to a new vision for designing for rebel in play: “The playground should trigger conflicts by giving children options to experience the dilemma between being rebellious and conform.”","co-research; rebellion in play; children; play; child participation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

In the second stage this so-optimized plan was tested to assess its flexibility to handle climate change and additional future users.

(mentor); Remøy, H.T. (mentor)","2014","De leegstand binnen de Nederlandse kantorenmarkt is hoog en vormt een groot (maatschappelijk) probleem. De laatste jaren is de leegstand gegroeid naar meer dan 7,7 miljoen m2 dat anno 2013 leegstaat (DTZ, 2014). Één van de oorzaken van de leegstand is de afnemende en veranderende huisvestingsvraag binnen de dynamische vastgoedmarkt door conjuncturele en demografische ontwikkelingen. Een andere oorzaak is dat het kantorenaanbod niet meer voldoet aan de veranderende eisen en wensen van de gebruikers, waardoor de onbalans tussen vraag en aanbod verder dreigt te stijgen. Wanneer een gebouw niet meer kan voldoen aan de wensen en eisen van een gebruiker komt deze leeg te staan en is de functionele levensduur van dit gebouw beëindigd. Het doel van dit onderzoek draagt bij om het toekomstige aanbod (nieuwe kantoren) zo lang mogelijk de veranderende huisvestingsvraag (huidige en toekomstige vraag) te laten accomoderen (functionele levensduur) door het toepassen van flexibele gebouweigenschappen die aan de hand van bestaande gebouwen (huidige aanbod) gedefinieerd kan worden. Omdat de keuzes binnen het vastgoedtraject invloed hebben op een lange periode, is het van belang dat de keuzes gefundeerd gemaakt kunnen worden. Dit onderzoek tracht inzichtelijk te maken welke gebouweigenschappen de lengte van de functionele levensduur zouden kunnen beïnvloeden onder andere door middel van het gebruik van de gebouwlagentheorie die Brand (1994) hanteert. Het empirische gedeelte van dit onderzoek bestaat uit de uitvoering van casestudy’s die bestaan uit twee onderdelen: de fysieke analyse en de huurderbeoordeling. Dit gebeurt aan de hand van de in de theorie gevormde gebouweigenschappen. De fysieke analyse is een analyse van het kantoorgebouw gedaan door middel van documentatie en observatie op locatie. De huurderbeoordeling zijn resultaten van gesprekken die gevoerd zijn met de voormalig huurders van dezelfde kantoorgebouwen. Binnen de casestudy’s worden deze twee resultaten met elkaar vergeleken in de match. Vervolgens zijn alle resultaten uit de cases vergeleken door middel van een cross case analyse. Hierin is gekeken welke gebouweigenschappen invloed hebben op de leegstand en de daarmee samenhangende lengte van de functionele levensduur, en daarmee daadwerkelijk een bijdrage leveren aan een verlenging van de functionele levensduur. Concluderend vanuit de resultaten gevonden in het empirisch gedeelte, en tevens het antwoord op de hoofdvraag, zou de functionele levensduur kunnen worden verlengd door toepassing van bepaalde gebouweigenschappen. Deze dienen te zorgen voor zoveel mogelijk positieve scores in alle aanpasbare gebouwlagen om de lengte van de functionele levensduur positief te kunnen beïnvloeden. De resultaten binnen dit onderzoek wijzen uit dat de positieve scores in de moeilijk aanpasbare gebouwlagen de meeste invloed op de lengte van de functionele levensduur. Een verlenging van de functionele levensduur is niet terug te leiden naar één specifieke gebouweigenschap. Daarentegen kan één gebouweigenschap wel de hoofdreden zijn voor leegstand die heerst in het betreffende gebouw. Theoretisch gezien zouden de gebouweigenschappen die zich in de moeilijk aanpasbare gebouwlaag bevinden, zo flexibel mogelijk moeten worden uitgevoerd om de meest uiteenlopende huurderseisen en wensen van verschillende (potentiële) huurders te kunnen accommoderen. De resultaten van de casestudy’s binnen dit onderzoek laten zien dat dit niet altijd van toepassing is, want wanneer de gebouweigenschappen flexibel zijn toegepast blijkt ook leegstand voor te komen. Een flexibele toepassing van gebouweigenschappen in de moeilijk aanpasbare lagen is geen garantie op succes, maar vergroot het wel de concurrentiepositie van het kantoorgebouw. Naarmate het onderzoek vorderde kwam naar voren dat de prijs-kwaliteit verhouding tegenwoordig steeds belangrijker is geworden, aangezien de huurder zijn voordeel kan doen met keuzemogelijkheden doen in een vraaggestuurde markt. De leegstand binnen de onderzochte kantoren in het WFC kantorengebied is niet in alle gevallen toe te schrijven aan de slechte kwaliteit van de gebouwen. Een aantal slecht presterende kantoorgebouwen blijken kwalitatief uitstekend, marktomstandigheden en de relatie tussen huurder en verhuurder blijken hier de oorzaak. Het resultaat van dit onderzoek kan een indicatieve handleiding van fysieke gebouweigenschappen zijn voor ontwikkelende partijen, die mogelijk kunnen resulteren in een hogere en toekomstbestendige verhuurbaarheid van nieuwe kantoren in een vraaggestuurde markt.","functionele levensduur; kantoren; leegstand; gebouweigenschappen","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Real Estate Management","",""

(mentor); Van de Voort, J. (mentor); Heintz, J. (mentor)","2014","PARAISÓPOLIS To understand the history of Paraisópolis it is needed to go back to 1921. The area where the favela is located today was part of Fazenda do Morumbi which was divided in 2200 plots by União Mútua Companhia Construtora e Crédito Popular S.A. The infrastructure of the allotment has not been fully implemented and many of those which purchased plots have never taken actual possession neither paid the taxes. That is, as has been verified many times in the history of São Paulo, public or private developments which had not been completed eventually become abandoned regions. For this reason they became a call for informal occupation. Today Paraisópolis complex is considered the second largest favela in the city of São Paulo with 55,590 people and 20,832 properties (officially), plus a network of civil institutions working in social projects within the community. Paraisópolis is divided into 5 parts (Grotinho, Grotão, Brejo, Antonico and Centro) and has two other adjacent favelas (Jardim Colombo and Porto Seguro) originated around the same time as Paraisópolis. THE PROPOSAL Paraisópolis has a peculiar characteristic which distinguishes it from most of Brazilian favelas. The slum is located on a regular urban grid, which is reminiscent of the first urbanization project for the area. The idea of ??creating a regular allotment ended up creating one of the most paradoxical spatial conditions in the city, where formal and informal city layers overlap. In Paraisópolis the ""center"", not as geographic location but as the hub of specific activities, is not limited to a single point as in the traditional city, not just to the edges like most of the slums, but it is found throughout the area, specifically along the urban grid. Thus, virtually all the blocks' boundaries are ""center"". The region of Grotão due topographical reasons interrupts the continuity of the orthogonal urban fabric. That is, what should have been divided into smaller blocks turned into a super cluster of shacks located in risk areas with the largest urban, economic and social problems of the whole community. The design is concerned to reconnect the Grotão with the rest of the community. The proposal was to create a bridge that allows vertical connections that act in local level and a horizontal connection which is the continuation of the grid that performs in a higher urban level. The structure was designed so that its program can be modified easily with low cost. The project contains a school, a library, a sports zone, green areas, spaces for temporary activities (fairs, exhibitions, or any activity that does not require special infrastructure) plus a street for light vehicles. In a way, the bridge is part of the urban grid. The bridge operates in a highly urban level. The connection can be used to improve other areas of Paraisópolis besides Grotão with the least possible impact on existing buildings. In an architectural context, the interesting point of the project is it to be a very flexible open structure.","Favela Paraisópolis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Explore Lab 15","",""

In order to discover new ideas of HMD toolkit, several activities including analyzing relative information, exploring with creative brainstorm sessions and interviews etc. are conducted to discover new ideas. Four new ideas are developed, which are: 1) removable covers, 2) removable glasses, 3) multiple HMD work together and 4) connecting accessories. The marketing strategy has also been developed for Germansmedia’s HMD toolkit. The marketing strategy suggests Germansmedia to take two phases to finally introduce HMD toolkit to the market: 1) step-one phase focuses on developing services such as App design for existing HMD products and 2) step-two phase focuses on developing HMD toolkits to the complete product level and launch it to the market.","HMD; Germansmedia; Toolkit; Marketing Strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

Being long term oriented the investor is commonly considered the central actor in future urban development. However, it insight is needed in how the investor can be committed to incremental urban redevelopment projects. By performing a qualitative in-depth case study this research aimed to learn lessons from community-oriented investments strategies of two American developing investors. By means of an expert panel discussion the main opportunities and barriers for the application of American investor-led redevelopment approaches in Dutch urban development context are identified to indicate the transferability of the lessons learned. The key findings suggest that by incorporating a comprehensive community-oriented vision in the investment strategy thereby anticipating on future value increment of real estate, long term commitment to incremental urban development projects is valuable for developing investors. The studied investor-led approaches, in which the investor has a leading role in the development process, are characterized by a facilitating government and continuous alignment of public and private interests to changing market conditions within incremental urban development strategies which lack formal public-private agreements on community-scale. Although the application of the lessons learned in the Dutch urban development context is hampered by context dependency based on institutional differences related to the planning systems, and cultural and spatial-economic aspects, these lessons might become valuable in the future as the Dutch culture is subject to change as well.","urban development; strategy; investment strategy; public-private partnerships; urban development strategy; commitment; developing investor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Urban Area Development","",""

(mentor); Verlinden, J.C. (mentor)","2014","Founded in 2006, senz umbrellas bv is a company established by three Industrial Design students. In November that year, they launched their first product, the senz° storm umbrella. Upon their market introduction, the international media picked up their story resulting in a tremendous amount of publicity. High rates of success resulted in more senz° models, which nowadays consist of five designs. Over the course of time, the storm umbrellas have been developed into a mature product group. Nowadays, senz° feels the need to expand their product portfolio and wants to become a lifestyle brand in the context of commuting. Previous experiences regarding new product development inspired senz° to accelerate their product development process. senz° noticed the opportunity to implement the Lean Startup Method (LSM), a more entrepreneurial approach for new product development. Whereas the Lean Startup Method focuses on start-ups, senz° finds itself in an existing business. This graduation assignment analyses and applies the Lean Startup Method to corporate innovation. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in order to analyze senz° past experience respecting new product development. Insights showed that senz° found it hard to integrate market feedback into new product development. Besides the lack of external driven development they searched for acceleration of their process as well. senz° wanted to decline their development time. These insights were clarified with literatureconcerning organisational evolution. Subsequently, the LSM was analysed in order to validate the suitability of this method for senz°. In short, this method is a system for developing a business or product in the most efficient way possible to reduce the risk of waste. This method relies on validated learning by means of scientific experimentation. It uses fast product releases to shorten product development cycles and gain valuable feedback with the use of real customer early on the development process. In other words a method to build, measure and learn. With this method senz° wants to accelerate their new product development and expand their product portfolio. Findings of the analysis concerning the suitability if the LSM for senz° showed that the LSM focuses on validating ideas and has a lack of a creative process to generate those ideas. Whereas the Lean Startup Method focuses on start-ups, senz° finds itself in an existing business. This requires a complementary method which emphasizes a creating process and a focus on existing companies. Brand-driven Innovation (BDI) was found as complementary method. BDI integrates the internal and external company context into a brand lens. This lens provides a certain perspective to look at innovation. The lens can be used as a filter to selectively look at the innovation process. Secondly, BDI provides innovation clusters derived from a context-mapping research which is used as tool to generate ideas. Combining the LSM with BDI resulted in a new product development method is created aimed to apply to corporate innovation. The method distinguishes a BDI phase and a LSM phase. The process starts with the Brand-driven Innovation phase. The entrepreneur should shape his brand lens, combining the insights of the internal and external context of the company. This lens provides a perspective to look at innovation during the LSM process. Subsequently, one should execute a context-mapping research whereby innovation cluster are formed. With the results of the context-mapping research the LSM phase can start. With use of iterative steps the idea will be validated as fast as possible within the LSM process. By repeatedly go through a build-measure-learn feedback loop (iterations) the company will validate its business model. A case study was setup in order to test the appropriateness of this new product development method for senz°. Outcomes of the internal company context of senz° showed it is clear that innovation is key in their way of thinking. For the future products of senz° it should be really clear for the customer that it solves a problem and is perceived as innovative. Analyzing the external company context resulted into the most representative customer segment, the Urban Explorer. Based upon the outcomes of the context-mapping session two pain cluster where selected. The Bike cluster and the Moving stuff cluster are the input for future development. In order to continue with the process, solutions were created which solve the pains found in the clusters. Within the LSM phase two solutions were generated, a modular design pack and a traffic headphone. Out of the BDI phase selection criteria were defined to choose between the solutions and the traffic headphone was selected as best solution. Three iterations were conducted during the LSM phase whereby prototypes were generated and tested with real customers. These iterations give insights how to perform the LSM inside a company. When analyzing the appropriateness of the new development method for senz° , valuable additions to their current product development process came up. Getting a prototype into the hands of real customers early on the development process and quickly learning from what they do, underpins the external focus of the new development method. This ensures the integration of market feedback into the development process. The use of fast iterations in the early stage of the development cycle is an addition to the current product development method to accelerate the development process. During these iterations one should test the product with real customers which force the designer to make his ideas tangible in an early stage. To conclude, the new product development is discussed and recommendations for the applicability of the LSM to corporate innovation are made.","lean startup; innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-04-09","Industrial Design Engineering","IPD","","","",""

For the café Hills & Mills (located in Delft) a concept was created to solve the problem of getting customers at quiet times, e.g. between 3-5PM. After having done customer research it became clear that a possible solution to solve this problem is to introduce regular customers to services they do not use. Since regular customers already have a liking of Hills & Mills, they might be more willing than new customers to use another service. For example, letting lunch-customers also come for high tea. In order to convince customers to use other services, they need to be aware of the service and convinced to use it. Further Hills & Mills has an active online community, which talks and reacts to Facebook messages on the Hills & Mills page. So a concept was created to let the community of Hills & Mills inform other customers by sharing stories about their experiences with services. This way the community and Hills & Mills themselves can ‘advise’ or ‘teach’ new services and information to unaware customers. An application for a tablet (or smartphone) was created in the form of a memory game, which also collects feedback from the customers. Including an information page and relaxation page. A prototype was created for this application and tested with customers at Hills & Mills. Customers appreciated the application, because they could play with it during waiting times. Also they could learn more about the food and opinions from other, which can help them in their decision of picking food. From the user test it became clear that a lot of text during the game is not very attractive to read. In the final concept a separate information page was created to solve this issue.","design; food; interaction; cafe","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for interaction","",""

In the last years MARIN has been involved in an increasing number of projects for the offshore wind industry. The complete simulation of a full-scale free-floating wind turbine under waves and winds using viscous-flow (Unsteady-Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes URANS) CFD codes is still nowadays very costly. However, CFD methods can be used in an efficient way for aerodynamic analysis. And they can be used rather to generate 2D input for BEMT design tools or for the real complete analysis of the wind turbine. In the present work CFD URANS code ReFRESCO is used for both purposes, having in mind the design of the new MARIN Stock (not Floating) Wind Turbine (MSWT), based on the well-known 5MW NREL full-scale turbine. Only open-water constant wind, fixed platform conditions are considered here. The objectives of the work presented are threefold: 1) the NREL 5MW baseline turbine is calculated using ReFRESCO both in full-scale and model-scale (Froude-scaling) conditions and the scale-effects studied and quantified; 2) the MSWT designed for thrust/performance-scaling is analyzed using CFD and validation against available MARIN experimental data is done; 3) in order to possibly further improve the MSWT design, the aerodynamic characteristics of its sections/foils are scrutinized by means of a full numerical study using ReFRESCO.","floating; offshore; wind; turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-05-09","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","Ship Hydromechanics","",""

A vision on design research in education was developed to bring a fresh perspective on the academic character of the Productdesign. The character was reframed using the Vision in Product design approach in the domain of design, research and education. The results are a vision on design research in education and a case study of how this vision could give shape to Productdesign’s educational environment. The vision describes that meaningful design research constructs a student’s design identity: his design, the way he designs and who he is as a designer. The construction of this design identity is expressed in a model for design research. A model for design research Design students use the model for design research to make their intuition explicit. The model enables them to study how five important elements influence each other: the designer himself as a person, the outside world, his actions, his instruments and his motives. These insights then add to constructing his design identity. Case study: Snapshot How does the influence between a design student's actions and self construct design identity? The influence between two of the model’s elements was studied: between the student’s actions and self. Snapshot enables the student to construct design identity using this influence. Snapshot is a research tool that enables design students to record their design process on video. While designing, important fragments or points in the process are highlighted in the recording. Snapshot’s software then enables the student to describe in words what is seen on the images. This formulation aims to make parts of the student's intuition explicit, which ultimately adds to the construction of their design identity.","reframing; design research; vision; education","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Annema, J.A. (mentor); Hombergen, L.P.I.M. (mentor)","2014","So far, current appraisals like Cost Benefit Analyses (CBA) for new road and railway infrastructure normally address direct and social environmental impacts (for example the benefit of reduced congestion or improved accessibility that leads to more users and vehicles and cause more environmental damage). Clearly, these impacts are caused during the operation and maintenance of an infrastructure project. However, they are not the only impacts caused by infrastructure projects. In the infrastructures’ construction phase there are environmental impacts caused that, as far as we have seen, have not been examined in depth or taken into consideration in standard CBA. It can be said that the construction is a step often forgotten in the emissions/impacts calculation, because it is an occasional emission which occurs before the beginning of the operation of the project. With the present thesis an attempt has been given in examining the importance of taking environmental impacts of the construction phase of an infrastructure project into account in Cost Benefit Analyses. In order to reach the goal of the research the following methodology is followed: literature study (desk research) was realized at first and then it was applied for two case studies. Comparing the processes that take place and the materials used during the construction phase of an infrastructure (focusing on road and railway) it was noticed that, even though every project is unique, there are some processes that are almost always/for every project carried out. These processes are mostly the materials production and their transportation, (for example asphalt, concrete, steel, ballast, etc.), excavation of materials (for example gravel and sand), and the construction machines used. These processes consider are examined in the present thesis. Based on these basic processes the impacts to be examined are selected. It was identified that the most important impacts because of these processes were impacts on land use, noise and air emissions. Even though all the three of them are very important, in the present thesis there is a focus only on air emissions because at first point they have been prioritized internationally due to the negative effects in human health, in the toxicity of air and the global warming problem. Especially global warming problem is considered scourge of our era because it leads to negative changes in the environment and the earth affecting in a disastrous way the whole planet. Another very important reason for focusing in air emissions was that because of their importance data and information about them were easier to find and elaborate from previous researches. Air emissions include a big variety of different kind of pollutants that are produced from different sources. For the selected basic processes the most important pollutants, as they were indicated from previous research reports, are Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous Oxides (NOx), Particulate matters (PM). A calculation method for the emissions and emissions costs of the abovementioned basic processes is created by calculating the emissions and emissions costs for hypothetical cross sections of 1Km road and 1Km railway. They present the way of sequence of the basic processes for such hypothetical and simple samples of infrastructures. The results came out of these indicate which processes have the higher emissions costs and what the most principal pollutant from those examined is. Then, this calculation model is applied for two real infrastructure projects in the Netherlands: the highway A13/A16 and the Hanzelijn railway. These projects are both large infrastructure projects that include many construction parts (tunnels, noise barriers, bridges, etc). They give the opportunity to calculate the emissions for different kind of materials and constructions, and they follow, in their biggest part, a typical construction pattern for a highway and railway respectively. This helps in examining typical/basic processes that take place in this kind of infrastructures’ construction and use it in other similar projects. Last, their Cost Benefits Analysis reports were available so to compare and include their emissions costs under their construction costs and see their contribution to the total amount. Nevertheless, not all the necessary data for the calculations were easy to reach. Data about the specific aspects of the projects (for example quantity of materials used, working hours per day, etc.) were not publicly available. Therefore, assumptions were made based on other projects and on the experience of people related to infrastructures’ construction. Their importance and the rate to which they affect the results were examined in a sensitivity analysis chapter in the end of the thesis. The results from the emissions costs that were calculated for the two real projects show that materials’ transportation and production of steel, asphalt and concrete are the processes with the higher emissions. They also verify the results came out from the hypothetical road and railway construction that greenhouse gases are most principal pollutants. More specifically, - For the A13/A16 highway, the construction costs calculated in its Cost Benefit Analysis are 1,790,000,000. Adding the emissions costs calculated (2,745,500-13,270,200) leads to an increase of 0.15%-0.74% of this construction costs. - For the Hanzelijn railway, the construction costs calculated in its Cost Benefit Analysis range from 647.000.000 to 723.000.000. Adding the emissions costs calculated (8,317,700-36,704,300) leads to an increase of 1.2%-5.1% of this construction costs. Even though the emissions costs are millions, their contribution to the total construction costs is not that significant (the percentages are low compare to the amount of the construction costs). However, they do occur and contribute to the final emissions and emissions costs. It must be also mentioned that they are the minimum possible calculated emissions costs of the two projects because of the missing processes. Moreover, the calculated emissions costs refer only to the new constructions and not reconstructions that the projects include also. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is conducted in order to show the sensitivity rate of the parameters that affect and lead to the higher emissions costs for the calculated results. The two case studies examined here showed the abovementioned results but it is suggested that the emissions costs should be included in the Cost Benefit Analysis. However, it is recommended the same calculations to be applied also for other infrastructure projects as well with all the information available in order to verify the results and the recommendation to be included in the construction costs.","environmental impact; large infrastructure projects; CBA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2014","Large Engineering and Construction Projects (LECPs) are going to be even larger in size than ever before. The stakeholders that are involved globally in the large projects have different cultural backgrounds. However, the influence of culture on the contractual relationship is relatively unexplored. With focusing on cross-cultural perspectives, a greater understanding of how to increase cooperation among overseas project partners may be indicated. Thus, there is a need to find the influence of culture on the cooperative relationships. In addition, contracts bind contracting parties together. Therefore, in order to manage projects better in a multi-cultural environment, it would be required to realize if there would be any influential connection between culture, contract and relationship. The aim of this research is finding whether and how culture, contract, and relationship are influenced by each other. The main research question is asked as: - How would cultural characteristics influence the choice of contract form and cooperative relationship? This research was undertaken by using an exploratory approach. A conceptual model has been developed. The cases have been studied in the CB&I Oil and Gas Company. Data was collected by the interviews and project records. Based on the findings in the literature review, we investigated the influence of two national dimensions of culture, which are power distance and uncertainty avoidance. The elements of the relationship are taken as trust, common goals, commitment, long-term relationship, communication, and decision making process. The form of contract is investigated together with risk sharing scheme, schedule, and budget plan. The possible influential links between culture, contract, and relationship are investigated by using the conceptual model. As the results of this research indicated, we found that the forms of contract do not influence the success of project. Moreover, the contractual relationship can have positive impact on the project performance if the relationship governs. Otherwise, if the contract governs the contractual relationship, the project performance will be negatively influenced. This research indicates that to some degree the level of trust influences the risk sharing scheme between contractual parties. With a trusting relationship, risks are likely to be shared between the client and contractor. Moreover, the relationship’s elements are not influenced by the forms of contract. However, schedule and budget influence common goals between the contractual parties. Realistic scheduling and budget facilitate the goals to be aligned. To a certain extent, commitment is improved by aligning the goals. This results in increasing the trust. Consequently, long-term relationships will be established.\ The result of this research indicates that the cultural differences between the client and contractor do not play a major role as long as contractor adapts to the client’s culture. In order to find the cultural differences, the actual culture of client should be recognized in the early phase of project. If the project is executed based on the client’s perceived culture which is different from the client’s actual culture, the relationship will be negatively influenced. Since contractor is in the position to earn trust, the adaptation can be done by the contractor. Communication and decision making as the relationship elements can be adapted to the client’s actual culture. The factors as cultural adaptation, aligning the goals, and following the commitments reinforce the trust. However, trust is negatively influenced by the absence of one of these factors. Therefore, in order to increase the possibility of a good relationship quality, all three factors need to be fostered. To some degree, uncertainty avoidance in the client’s culture influences client’s preferences in forms of contract. Nonetheless, such other factors as law, regulation, market situation, investors’ preferences, common practices in industry are also the influential factors in deciding the forms of contract. This research recommends adapting to the client’s cultural behavior and aligning the goals in the early phase of project. Setting up an integrated team with the client can facilitate aligning the goals and the cultural adaptation. This research only focuses on two cultural dimensions (power distance, and uncertainty avoidance). Further research would be required to study the influence of other cultural dimensions (as individualism versus collectivism, masculinity versus femininity, short- and long-term orientation, and indulgence versus restraint) on the contractual relationship. Moreover, we investigated the influence of national cultures on the relationship between the parties. These dimensions of national culture affect the thinking about the organization. A further study would be required to investigate the influence of organizational culture (also known as company culture) on the contractual relationship and contract.","CCM; LECP's; contracting; cooperation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kooijman, A. (mentor)","2014","In this graduation project, the potential of a Per-sonal Wearable Computer is explored in a table tennis coaching context. The concept of the Per-sonal Wearable Computer combines the Ubiqui-tous Computing concept of Nomadic Computing with ideas about informing from Informing Sci-ence. This kind of computer takes into account the context of use to determine what information should be communicated to the user in what way, to be of maximum benefit to the user. In consider-ation with the table tennis training context, the Personal Wearable Computer is designed to assist and contribute to the learning process. This design is informed by Motor Learning theory, supporting the effective development of Generalized Motor Programs. The Motor Learning process consists of three stages: the cognitive stage, the fixation stage and the autonomous stage. The design provides real-time feedback on key technique aspects to a play-er during practice. This makes the player aware of these technique aspects during the cognitive stage of Motor Learning and influences the incorporation of good technique in the autonomous stage. A combination of tactile and aural feedback is used to provide corrective information to the player about timing and posture. To be able to provide appropriate feedback, besides table tennis knowledge, the system uses real-time tracking technologies for player tracking and ball tracking. Electromagnetic tracking is used for player tracking, by creating a changing magnetic field in the environment in combination with magnetic sensors in wearable devices on the player’s body. These same wearable devices are also used to provide the tactile feedback. The ball tracking solution involves high speed cameras combined with rotating mirrors. A prototype system is developed to demonstrate the basic concept of influencing Motor Learning process with real-time feedback. The prototype focuses on a few specific technique aspects. These aspects include the basic stance in table tennis that requires the player to bend the knees; the shot preparation, involving the turning of the up-per body; and the shot timing to hit the ball in front of the body. Player tracking and ball tracking have been simplified in the prototype compared to the design, while maintaining the essence of the concept. Acceleration sensors have been used for player tracking; a table tennis robot, has replaced the ball tracking technology. In a preliminary test, the prototype system was compared to a training situation with human coaching and without coaching. In this test, the compliance with the table tennis technique as-pects of the basic stance and the shot preparation was measured. The results show a positive effect of the system on the technique aspects, compared to both training situations with human coaching and without coaching.","Personal Wearable Computer; Informing; Computer Based Sport Coaching; Table Tennis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2014","Breakwaters under construction are prone to undesired deformation because the breakwater core is not designed to withstand severe or moderate wave loads. The reshaping mechanisms for a complete (finished) breakwater have been comprehensively studied; however, few research studies have been undertaken to analyze the deformation mechanisms of the breakwater core (or a breakwater under construction). It is imperative for the contractor to understand how the reshaping takes place because reshaping requires construction schedules to be adjusted as well as additional material and therefore, additional costs. The present study focusses on the deformation rubble mound breakwater roundheads undergo during the construction phase. Mulders (2010) performed physical model tests for breakwaters under construction exposed to wave attack. To investigate the deformation processes, twelve scaled physical model tests were performed by varying the wave height (8cm for low and 10cm for high wave heights), wave angle (0°, 30°, and 45°), and material grading (fg= 1.3 for narrow and fg=6 for wide grading). The data from Mulders’ tests was used in this study to analyze the breakwater deformation, with emphasis on the roundheads, via volumetric changes (initial and final test conditions) for a given control volume. The control volumes included the overwash, the overall breakwater, and the roundheads using radial and angular sectioning methods. The radial sections depicted the cross-shore transport while the angular sections illustrated the longshore sediment transport at the roundheads. As expected, the overwash volumes were proportional to wave load and angle of wave attack. Regarding the breakwater overall behavior, wide graded material caused a volume increase due to the transverse movement of the coarse fractions while the narrow graded material (fine fraction) decreased in volume thus, increasing the packing density. This sorting mechanism was also noticeably present in the roundheads for the radial sections. For the roundheads, distinctive percentage losses (sectors with low resistance to wave loading) were clearly present in the radial sectors; thus, transverse (radially outward) sediment transport was the dominant deformation mechanism over longshore transport. Longshore transport did contribute to roundhead deformation; however, no maximum losses were found because the volume losses were nearly equal throughout the angular sectors. As a result, the angle of wave incidence did not affect the volume losses in the angular direction. With regards to material sorting at the roundheads, wide graded material caused a volume increase at the outer radii due to the transverse movement of the coarsest fraction potentially reducing the packing density. On the other hand, grading did not influence the roundhead negative percent changes in the radial direction; thus, grading appeared to be indifferent to volume losses but relevant for volume gains.","breakwater; roundhead; core; construction; deformation; grading; wave obliquity; reshaping","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van Mourik, F. (mentor)","2014","Since the rise of the internet, the way people are searching and gathering information has changed drastically. The books in the library used to be a main source of information, but with the internet knowledge from all over the world is just a few clicks away. People now have access to so much information that the need for physical reference works is slowly disappearing, and with this, perhaps also the need for physical library buildings. With its main functions being taken over by digital alternatives, does the physical library in its current form still have public value in the years to come? What can the library offer if people find all their information online? How can the library of today use the digital transformation of the information industry to enhance the physical library experience? In this graduation assignment, done on behalf of the National Library of the Netherlands (Koninklijke Bibliotheek or KB), the value of physical libraries in the Netherlands is investigated. By identifying current trends in users and society, the change in value over the coming years can be anticipated, and it can be determined how libraries can respond to these changes. From this a new library experience will be developed for the National Library that focuses on the exploration of their many collections. The National Library serves as a deposit for all printed publications from and about the Netherlands. For some years electronic publications have been collected as well. At the moment the KB has a vast collection of over six million items containing books, medieval manuscripts, e-journals, newspapers and much more. A research on the library sector of the Netherlands was conducted to assess the current situation of libraries and to identify how libraries can innovate to maintain their importance in society, but also to individual users in the future. The research took into account three different kinds of libraries in the Netherlands; the public library, the academic library and the national library. A literature study was done to get acquainted with the library sector and the role and functions of the different libraries in the Netherlands. It also gives an overview of library values from the many recent studies that have been done. Secondly a field study was done to get an understanding of the visitors and their use of libraries. In this, the library values found in literature will be tested against the visitors’ opinion. Lastly, employees of different departments of the KB were invited to a small generative session. This session focussed on how the KB sees its own unique value and how they communicate this to their visitors. From this research the gap between visitors of the library and the library collection was identified as the most important to tackle. For the National Library this translated in creating more visibility for the collection in the reading rooms, highlighting its strengths and unique characteristics. Etcetera Etcetera is an exploration tool designed for the visitors of the National Library to discover the collection. It is designed as a digital but tangible representation of the many available publications of the KB that are currently invisible or in the reading rooms or unavailable because they are too valuable or fragile. The books you see in the reading room are only the tip of the iceberg, in Etcetera all collections of the KB are brought together and are visually presented in the reading rooms. Etcetera has three entrances to the collection which each correspond to an information need of the different user groups. By using either one of these options the user has the possibility to go through the KB collection. However, each option has a different starting point and will therefore provide the user with different results. The Explore mode lets you dive into the collection without any previous knowledge. You allow yourself to be surprised and view the unique parts of the collection that are not visible in the reading rooms or too fragile to request. Over time the categories change, some even daily, allowing the visitor to have a new exploration each time he or she visit the KB. Using the Browse option, the visitors can reveal all kinds of information about a certain topic, simply by placing a book on the table. Although the user has a predefined topic, they do not have a specific question. They want to know what more there is to find at the KB around this topic, similar to browsing the reading rooms. Lastly, for the users which do have a specific question, Etcetera facilitates a keyword search. This can be done through the entire collection, or through books, magazines or newspapers. The search results are similar to the catalogue search, with the main different that actual results are shown instead of descriptions of results. In line with their mission Etcetera will bring information and people closer together, triggering them to use both the physical and the digital collection. By creating a more tangible interaction with the collections in the reading room, the collection gains more visibility and consequently more use.","interactive table; library; explore; collections","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2014","Corrosion has a large negative effect on the service life of metallic substrates, such as cars, bikes and boats. To reduce the corrosion rate, the bare metal can be isolated from the corrosive environment by applying an organic coating (paint). As metals corrode, organic coatings degrade. Temperature, wet-dry cycles and UV-light all have an effect on the lifetime of an organic coating. Maintenance of these systems is therefore of vital importance to guarantee the coating still provides sufficient protection against corrosion. While in theory Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) can give valuable insight in the condition of a applied in situ coating system, this method is seldom used outside laboratory mainly due to the complexity of the setup. In this master thesis, a new EIS setup and interpretation method are introduced to reduce the complexity of EIS method for in situ measurements. To validate this new method, laboratory coupons with different aircraft coatings were degraded in salt-spray and UV-condensation cabinets. These coupons were frequently measured during the degradation process with a normal EIS setup and the new handheld setup. With these measurements, the interpretation methods and setups were compared. The same procedure was executed on a location outside the laboratory, the Oosterscheldekering, the measurements were compared with result values of measurements performed five years ago. The result values of the measured laboratory coupons showed comparable degradation trend with both measurement setups. The same was observed with the measurements on the Oosterscheldekering. The interpretation method exhibited an easy way to present the coating condition, although is not able to show complex physical processes occurring when the corrosion process starts. Overall, it can be concluded that the handheld sensor setup with the simplified interpretation method is very good technique for in situ organic coating assessment on metal substrates. With the condition that the measurements are performed by someone who is experienced in the use of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and who understands the discussed shortcomings of the system.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science & Engineering","","","",""
