Therefore, the contribution of vegetation modelling on the long-term morphological development of salt marshes is assessed by implementing a vegetation growth model in the morphodynamic modelling software FINEL2d. It is found that the contribution of vegetation modelling depends on the type of system under consideration. Two types of systems have been identified, one in which vegetation is leading and one in which morphology is leading. For the situation that vegetation is leading, like in the sensitivity simulations, vegetation modelling is essential. In this type of system the vegetation growth determines the tidal creek pattern. On the other hand, when the vegetation follows the morphological development, as in the 'Saeftinghe' case, the contribution is less significant. This is reflected in the fact that there are minor differences in channel and tidal creek patterns between the bio-geomorphological simulations and the purely morphological model results. Nevertheless, the Saeftinghe case study results do demonstrate that the models can reproduce the development of channels, tidal creeks and tidal flats over a 100 year period, resulting in a BSS of around 0.8. Moreover, in general the results show that the bio-geomorphological models are capable of representing salt marsh characteristic morphological and hydrodynamic phenomena, i.e. overgrown marsh platform dissected by tidal creeks, realistic flow velocities and characteristic erosion/sedimentation patterns.","bio-geomorphological model; long-term morphological development; salt marsh formation and succession; vegetation growth model; seaftinghe; modelling; interaction vegetation morphodynamics; FINEL2d; tidal creeks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","NUS-TUD Double MSc Degree Programme","",""

Pressure and temperature measurements are done at several locations in the engine. It has been shown that acoustic energy can be converted into electric power with the use of a linear alternator. It has also been shown that the double stage engine operates at a lower working temperature. It produces more electric power and thus obtains a higher power density than the single stage thermoacoustic engine. Measurements show the onset temperature of the single and double stage engine are respectively 303 °C and 267 °C.

(mentor)","2014","The conversion of a Rigid Body Parallel Manipulator to a Compliant Joint Parallel Manipulator introduces compliance in the system. The configuration of the compliant manipulator will differ from the configuration described by the rigid-body kinematics due to the off-axis compliance, and hence off-axis deflections, of the Compliant Joints. In case of significant off-axis joint deflections, the rigid-body kinematics are invalid to describe the configuration of the Compliant Joint Parallel Manipulator. In this research, the rigid body model is compared to a model in which also the off- and on-axis compliance of the joints is considered. Using the latter model, the joint deflections for an imposed actuator pose are calculated by minimizing the potential energy of the system. Comparing these deflections to the joint configuration of the Rigid Body Parallel Manipulator gives the undesired joint deflections. The goal of this paper is to enable more effective integration of Compliant Joints in a Compliant Joint Parallel Manipulator by taking these undesired deflections into account. For this end, a local and global metric for the deviation of the pose between a Compliant Joint Parallel Manipulator and a Rigid Body Parallel Manipulator is presented. Both error formulations are based on energy. Therefore, both metrics are scalar, are coordinate system independent, do not suffer from unit inconsistencies and are generally applicable. The use of the metrics is illustrated by the design of a planar 5-bar Compliant Joint Parallel Manipulator. The dimensions of the Compliant Joints are determined by an optimization with the global error formulation as an objective.","compliant; joint; mechanism; manipulator; optimizing; flexural; flexure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","mechatronica","",""

As the wind turbines are trying to fulfill these requirements, the demand for output power from each individual turbine is increasing as well. Although this is great, implementation of new technologies such as direct drive superconducting generators are required as they have a great potential for becoming a great contender for satisfying the increasing demand of individual turbine power output. The efficiency and the mass reduce by using this technology but other issues have to be checked regarding its transient performance. Due to the low sub-transient, transient and synchronous reactance, compared to a conventional machine, the transient properties such as short-circuit current, field current and electromagnetic torque is much higher. This may cause problems as high values may damage the windings and turbine properties and even cause the superconducting field windings to lose its superconducting property. The thesis report will try to model a superconducting generator for a 10 MW wind turbine and analyse its transient properties. Also several important parameter calculations will be made taking into account the saturation due to iron in the generator.

The facades are kept as much as possible, but according the created zero energy dwellings some additions are made. This design is making a unity in diversity by accommodating different types of dwelling together with different targetgroups. The transformed Van der Kunbuurt will stimulate the use of the outdoor space by the dwellers itself as well as by inhabitants of neighborhoods of the surrounding.

This diversity of target groups will create an interesting social interaction between the users due to the different lifecycles. The dwelling for the 21st century needs to accommodate more activities while the usage of the dwelling is increasing due to the flexibilisation of the labour market, increasing digital age and the developments like the process of decontextualization. Therefore the dwellings of Van der Kunbuurt creates a balance between the social activities and withdrawing.

(mentor); Veer, F.A. (mentor); Coenders, J.L. (mentor); Houtman, R. (mentor); Schönwälder, J. (mentor)","2014","At this point in time, 3D-printing techniques in general, but especially applied for the building industry, still are in a phase of early experiments. One of the experimental attempts is to print a full-scale, three-story high, house in Amsterdam, using an up scaled version of a FDM-printer that is able to print blocks of 1.8 x 1.8 x 3.0 meters using printable polymers. This thesis report focuses on answering the initial structural question that appears around this project, which is a research to the behavior of the currently applied printing material. The outcome of this research will be used to give recommendations for the structural design of printable geometries. The material research emphasis on obtaining the material properties that are most essential to be known for this particular printing material and the application of the material within this particular building project. These basically are the mechanical (strength) properties of the material and its thermal behavior. Since the FDM-printer lays down the material layer by layer, the hypothesis was that the material would show anisotropic behavior. Therefore the strength properties are researched in different orientations relative to the direction of the printed lines. Furthermore, it was expected that the strength properties would differ for the horizontal plane and vertical plane in which there can be printed, as the resolutions in both planes differ as well. As a part of this research, there is experimented with two innovative production methods for creating test specimens of complex forms, which are direct 3D-printing and laser-cutting of test specimens. It turns out that direct 3D-printing of test specimens can be a good and quick method for producing complex test specimens, in case the resolution of the applied 3D-printer is accurate enough. For the applied printer within this case study project, it turns out that laser cutting test specimens is the best option, as it leads to a higher dimensional accuracy and a more uniform specimen thickness. For the vertical printing plane, the material indeed shows clear anisotropic behavior, as the tensile, shear and flexural strength values and the failure modes parallel and perpendicular to the printing direction differ significantly. Material that is printed within the horizontal printing plane shows more isotropic behavior than material that is printed in the vertical plane, due to more and better adhesive connections between the different layers. For the compressive strength it holds that not much difference is noticed between the different orientations, especially because the tested samples are composed of multiple printed layers in both the horizontal and vertical plane. This result leads to an important recommendation to compose printable building-blocks out of 3D-elements instead of only 2D-plate elements, which so far has been the case. This actually leads to a stronger, more isotropic, more homogeneous and therefore better predictable material behavior. Throughout the research this recommendation is further confirmed by outcomes of the absorption test, geometry tests and insulation requirements. The absorption test shows that the material becomes watertight in case multiple printing layers are applied in the horizontal direction. The performed bending and pressure tests on printed geometries demonstrate that geometries, which are build up by a single layer, fail due to local effects: they either fail on local buckling or local bending of an individual member of the geometry or they fail at the location of local inaccuracies, which often occur within printed geometries. The stress level at which these failure modes take place can be significantly increased by composing individual geometry members out of multiple printed layers. Finally, to meet the requirements for heat and sound insulation, a certain wall and floor thickness is required which only can be achieved by printing multiple layers within the horizontal printing direction. The performed temperature-strength test and DSC-test show that current thermal behavior of the material is the most important point of concern regarding the applied printing material. The material is applied in the rubber phase, it softens at 60 degrees Celsius and already at a surface temperature of 40 degrees Celsius, the material has lost already about 70% of the material strength it has at room temperature. It is obvious that further research on the improvement of the temperature behavior of the building material is essential to make printable polymers suitable for structural applications. Also the comparison with general structural materials and polymers applied in the construction practice, confirms that the printing material in its current form, is not structurally applicable. Furthermore, the comparison shows that the stiffness of the material needs to be improved, as the Young’s Modulus is relatively low. Although the essence of further research should lie on the improvement of the printing material, it still can be valuable to continue the structural design process parallel to the material development. Based on the performed material research, recommendations are given for design improvements. These recommendations can be used as a starting point for a possible future study to the structural design of printable geometries, chambers and complete houses.","3D-printing; additive manufacturing; FDM-printing; polymers; printable polymers; structural polymers; housing; building engineering; structural design; material research; specimen production; 3D printed specimens; mechanical material properties; thermal properties; material behavior; canal house; 3D print house","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

Applying the unconscious work theory of incubation effects, this thesis proposes that daydreaming during idea incubation could result in more novel and useful ideas by fostering unconscious associative processes. Building on previous findings by Baird et al (2012), who had found that engaging in an undemanding task during incubation could lead to a subsequent increase in performance on a divergent thinking task, this thesis aims at investigating whether similar effects could be found when solving a more complex creative task, like a design assignment. An experiment conducted with 85 design students tested whether daydreaming induced by a cognitively undemanding task during idea incubation, as compared to engaging in a demanding task, rest or no break, could lead to subsequent increased creative performance on the design task. Creative performance was assessed based on the ideas generated to solve the design assignment, rated for creativity using objective measures as well as market acceptance evaluations by a potential consumer group. Results showed that while there were no differences between groups based on the objective measures, the potential target group rated product concepts created by participants who had engaged in the undemanding task during idea incubation to be of higher quality and to elicit less negative emotions. Participants in this condition had reported a higher frequency of daydreaming-related thoughts than participants in the demanding task condition and the no-break condition, and less task-related thoughts than participants in the rest condition. These results indicate that while there was no clear indication for a higher degree of creativity in the ideas generated after a daydreaming-incubation, the concepts must convey some sort of additional value for the target consumer. It was concluded that daydreaming during idea incubation could increase creative performance on a design task when a global definition of creative performance was applied. A post-test investigated how the effectiveness of a daydreaming-incubation period could be maximized. Building on Klinger’s findings (1990) that daydreaming episodes could be facilitated by exposure to relevant triggers, symbolic images were tested for their effectiveness in triggering daydreaming-related thoughts and emotions. Strikingly, a high positive correlation was found between the elicitation of daydreamingrelated thoughts and positive emotions. This finding indicates that the same triggers that facilitate daydreaming might also elicit positive emotions. The results therefore seem to be in contradiction with previous findings that related daydreaming to negative emotions. It was concluded that the symbols used in the test could be beneficial for creative performance in two ways: (1) by facilitating creative performance due to their ability to trigger daydreaming and (2) by supporting creativity in general through eliciting positive emotions. The thesis closes with a proposal of how to use the chosen set of symbolic images to be beneficial for creativity in the form of daydreaming triggers and mood changers and with an outlook on open issues to be addressed by further research.","daydreaming; incubation; idea generation; research; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Daamen, T.A. (mentor)","2014","While network perspectives in housing studies have gained currency over the last decade, research looking at the actor-networks of housing management is limited. This is remarkable given the recognition for actor-network theory (Latour, 2005) in the related fields of urban studies (Farías and Bender, 2010) and planning theory (De Roo et al., 2012). Accordingly, the thesis introduces and tests concepts from actor-network theory in the study of housing renewal. It describes the socio-technical controversy in the Sint-Mariastraat in the Oude-Westen Rotterdam (NL) to explore the making of the renewal project by heterogeneous means. In particular, it looks at the actors’ strategies to manage uncertainty by means of translating other—human and non-human—actors to form and stabilize the renewal network. The case study illustrates how the issues of foundations and evictions are interrelated, and how their alliances are continuously negotiated. Building on network governance, actor-network theory adds new (non-human) actors to the housing renewal network. These non-human actors are found to be significant to explain how specific actors accomplish the closure of controversies. They are also relevant to analyze the mechanisms by which housing renewal issues are made technical or political. Accordingly, ANT offers new perspectives on the democratic anchorage of housing renewal networks and introduces new forms of being political. The implications of this are worked out in a participation model based on the suggestion that contesting the issues (parts) is more important than consenting on the plan (whole).","social housing; renewal; participation; actor-network theory; network governance; translation; controversy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Housing","","51.919482, 4.468344"

Our research shows that a concentration of people, functions and jobs into high density nodes, along the major infrastructural axis that are still present around the Steel Works site, could greatly contribute to a revival of the area as well as bring back the manufacturing industry within these areas that are in dire need of jobs and amenities. The individual design part of this graduation studio, concerning a multi-modal transportation hub incorporating new ways of manufacturing forms an essential part of the proposed master plan, which is centered around infrastructure and new ways of manufacturing. The South Works station project opens up the normally ‘hidden’ manufacturing process by placing it right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the hectics within a train station. People will be able to actively follow the process, from the arrivial of individual parts, all the way down to finished projects which they can then buy, knowing the entire story behind it. In a way, both the masterplan “Made in South Works” and the individual design for South Works Station are ways to really bring all-new forms of manufacturing back to Chicago and to form an example for many other American cities in dire need of change.","station; Chicago; manufacturing; public; hybrid; multi-modal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Complex Projects","","41.74378, -87.53859"

Previous studies have coupled the toe stability directly to the wave height, which is not physically accurate. In this study the local hydraulic conditions at the point of incipient motion are considered. First the forces acting on a single stone are identified. Thereafter the moment of force about the rotation point of the stone is computed. When this moment becomes positive, the stone is expected to move. This is called the 'moment criterion'. To verify the moment criterion, a wave flume experiment was designed. In this experiment all the outfacing stones were glued together, so that no movement could occur. Seven cavities were left open on the toe, in which seven 'target stones' were place. Pressure sensors were place underneath these stones and a velocity sensor and a wave gauge above the toe. Using this arrangement the local hydraulic properties at the point of incipient motion were determined. It was found that the pressure difference over a stone is the most important local hydraulic parameter to determine the point of incipient motion. The forces and moments on the stones are computed using the measured local hydraulic conditions, thereafter the performance of the moment criterion is determined. It was found that the moment criterion does have predictive capabilities, but it cannot pinpoint the point of incipient motion. The moment criterion can be improved by including turbulent forces and incorporating a damage parameter to increase the applicability of the criterion.","breakwater toes; local hydraulic parameters; rubble mound breakwater; water pressures; forces on stones","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van Keulen, A. (mentor)","2014","Buckling is a failure mode of a structure caused by stiffness loss of compressed material. It arises primarily in slender structures, for which the bending stiffness is much lower than the axial stiffness. Slender, buckling sensitive structures occur especially in optimised designs, where an excellent strength-to-weight ratio is required. For this reason, buckling analysis of optimised designs is very important. However, buckling analysis is nowadays only performed in the post-processing phase, after the optimisation is completed. Inclusion of a buckling constraint in topology optimisation should lead to a design where failure by buckling is already excluded. In the following post-processing step, no major changes are needed on account of a buckling requirement, therefore allowing the final design to remain close to the optimal design. Ultimately this should lead to improved results. In literature, linear buckling analysis is included in topology optimisation on a couple of instances, albeit mostly in the role of an objective instead of as a constraint. In this report, an adjoint formulation for the sensitivities of the buckling load is found, resulting in much more efficient computation than other methods, such as finite differences. Furthermore, different practical aspects of inclusion of a buckling constraint are explored, with emphasis on the underlying physical problem. It is found that including a buckling constraint requires careful implementation, tailored to the specific optimisation problem at hand. An educated choice should be made on the admissibility of negative buckling loads. Allowing negative buckling loads leads to a non-convex design space, complicating the search for the globally optimal design. Furthermore, the switching of modes should be considered. While mode switching can introduce a number of issues, preventing this switching limits the design freedom the optimiser has to reach an optimal design. Even more importantly, the point is raised that a linear buckling analysis does not give any information on the post-buckling behaviour of the structure. The stability of the buckling load greatly influences the sensitivity of the structure to imperfections. For practical implementations, an optimal design that is extremely sensitive to imperfections is worthless. Therefore, ideally, an assessment is done on the stability of the structure, during optimisation, in order to enforce stable post buckling behaviour. However, current techniques for post-buckling analysis are elaborate and time-consuming in implementation and use. A method for rapid determination of the stability is required. Such a method for rapid estimation of the buckling load is found in the use of linear buckling analysis for structures that are perturbed with the mode shape of the perfect structure. This method is tested on very simple test structures and is found to be very promising for implementation in topology optimisation, because for a large part it can re-use code that is already available in the original formulation.","topology optimization; buckling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystem","","Engineering Mechanics","",""

(mentor); De Reuver, G.A. (mentor); Kroesen, M. (mentor)","2014","Management summary: Research problem Ongoing digitalization results in both threats as opportunities for the insurance sector. Increased transparency stimulates switching behavior and shifts the insurance market to a more price based competition. Together with recent developments such as the ban on intermediary commissions and the separation of banking and insurance activities, the traditional business model is put under pressure. By fully reaping the benefits of mobile technologies, such as portability, social interactivity, context sensitivity, connectivity and individuality, a variety of opportunities for innovative insurance services arises. A more differentiated product portfolio can shift the price based competition to a more quality focus which enables insurers to operate in more niche markets focusing on higher margins. In the last few years, privacy concerns associated with the consumer use of mobile technologies, have been the subject of many research papers. A number of privacy studies empirically verified the negative effect of perceived privacy concerns on the intention of use online and mobile services. As the disclosure of personal information is often necessary in obtaining online and mobile services, privacy concerns could inhibit people’s intention to use them as well. This could have major implications for the adoption of mobile insurance since privacy concerns regarding the insurance industry are already relatively high in general. Therefore, it is essential, in the development of future mobile insurance services, to understand the role of associated privacy concerns. Accordingly, this study aims to increase understanding of mobile insurance related privacy concerns, its relation on consumer’s ‘likelihood of use’ and potential compensating factors as perceived usefulness and expected monetary benefits. Therefore, the objective of this research is to further develop understanding towards the mitigating effect of perceived usefulness and monetary rewards on privacy concerns regarding the likelihood of use for mobile insurance services. In line with this objective the following main research question is developed: RQ In what way can privacy concerns, affecting the likelihood of use mobile insurance services, be mitigated by expected monetary benefits and perceived usefulness? Domain on Mobile Insurance For a clear and consistent understanding of this research question the definition of mobile insurance for this study is defined as “insurance products and services based on context sensitive mobile technologies”. Hereby insurance products and services involve all direct customer focused activities of an insurer. Thus, both the insurance policy itself and supportive services are involved. Context sensitivity of mobile technologies involves the ability to both gather and respond to real or simulated data unique to current location, environment, and time. Mobile insurance covers a broad field of insurance services. In order to get a better understanding on the scope of mobile insurance a categorization is made. This categorization is based on an explorative scan to all worldwide mobile insurance services. These worldwide mobile insurance services are subsequently categorized on its consumer functionalities and validated with insurance industry and technology experts. The final categorization, with a brief elaboration per category is listed below: 1. Usage based insurance; With a usage-based insurance premium, consumers pay only premium for actual use of their insurance. 2. Behavioral rewarding; By rewarding customers for less risky behavior, the insurer is trying to reduce the risk of accidents. 3. Up-to-date insurance package; By using personal (context sensitive) information of consumers, relevant personalized insurance products could be provided. 4. Preventative information services; Consumer context information offers insurers the opportunity to provide consumers with relevant context related preventative information. 5. Accident detection & prevention; By detecting (potential) accidents as early as possible, damages could be prevented and minimized. 6. Mobile accessibility; Mobile technologies facilitate a communication channel for sales and services. 7. Personal dashboards; By measuring individual behavior, insight could be provided in risk profiles of consumers to increase risk awareness. 8. Additional informative services; Context sensitive information offers opportunities for several semi-insurance services. Theoretical background on the concept of privacy Within literature a variety of definitions and interpretations for privacy is present, however a unified account of privacy has yet to emerge. This study interprets the definition of privacy as a tradable interest; “an interest that individuals have in sustaining a ‘personal space’ free from interference by other people and organizations”. Subsequently, this definition is operationalized to facilitate the measurement of privacy. A commonly used (reverse) operationalization of privacy in literature is the measurement of privacy concerns. Therefore, privacy is measured in this study by privacy concerns. Due to its plurality and inconsistency, a unified account for privacy is still absent in literature. Some scholars used another approach and instead of searching for an inclusive definition of privacy, they developed a typology for privacy. Recent literature defined seven types of privacy of which three are relevant for the application of (current) mobile insurance: Privacy of location and space ""The right to move about in public or semi-public space without being identified, tracked, or monitored."" Privacy of behavior and action ""The ability to behave in public, semi-public or one’s private space without having actions monitored or controlled by others."" Privacy of data and image ""Concerns about making sure that individuals’ data is not automatically available to other individuals and organizations and that people can exercise a substantial degree of control over that data and its use.” A majority of consumers considers the disclosure of personal information as essential in modern life. The disclosure of personal information is however contrary with the definition of privacy; sustaining a ‘personal space’. Consequently, numerous studies consistently concluded that people are very concerned about their online privacy. Aforementioned contradiction imply that individuals consider a utilitarian trade-off between perceived benefits and sacrifices of disclosing personal information. Hereby privacy concerns have to be considered as a sacrifice. Previous literature states that providers can mitigate the negative effect of privacy concerns on the ‘likelihood of use’ in two ways; (1) by offering privacy policies regarding the handling and use of personal information and (2) by offering benefits such as monetary rewards or convenience. These compensating are further operationalized as expected monetary benefits and perceived usefulness. No existence of a direct relation between the construct of privacy concerns, perceived usefulness and expected monetary benefits is found in literature. However, several IT adoption studies in literature suggest an indirect relation through the construct of likelihood of use. Hereby, the likelihood of use is positively affected by the perceived usefulness and expected monetary benefits and negatively affected by privacy concerns. These findings are combined in a conceptual model which is validated for the case of mobile insurance by the explorative assessment. Analysis and results In order to provide an answer on the main research question, two quantitative assessments are conducted. By means of a consumer survey and multiple regression, an explorative assessment is conducted to the relations between the constructs of likelihood of use, privacy concerns, perceived usefulness and expected monetary benefit. Hereby, the conceptual model is validated. By means of a conjoint survey, a more in-depth assessment to the buy-off value of privacy is conducted for all relevant types of privacy, for the case of Pay-As-You-Drive (PAYD) insurance. Explorative assessment The construct of perceived usefulness appears to be in general the strongest predictor for the likelihood of use mobile insurance. The relation between these two constructs is significant for all categories of mobile insurance. Mobile insurance services with a higher perceived usefulness are likely to raise more interest of consumers for future use. The relation between the construct of expected monetary benefits and the likelihood of use shows to be positive as well, however not significant for all categories of mobile insurance. Expected monetary benefits appear not to be a significant predictor for the use of mobile accessibility. Overall it can be concluded that mobile insurance services with a higher expected monetary benefit for the consumer are likely to raise more interest of consumers for future use. In contrast to previous constructs, the relationship between the construct of privacy concerns and the likelihood of use appears to be negative, however not significant for all categories of mobile insurance. Privacy concerns appear not to be a significant predictor for the use of Accident detection and prevention and Mobile accessibility. Overall it can be concluded that mobile insurance service with raised privacy concerns are likely to have a negative impact on the likelihood of use mobile insurance. Altogether, it can be concluded that the likelihood of use mobile insurance services is primarily driven by its perceived usefulness. Thereafter, consumers’ likelihood of use mobile insurance services is driven by raised expectations on accompanied monetary benefits and inhibited by increased privacy concerns. However, not for every category of mobile insurance the predictors have a significant relation with the likelihood of use, no significant contra relations are found. These findings seem to support the relations as found in literature. Conjoint assessment Although the explorative assessment shows us that monetary benefits are not the strongest predictor for consumers’ likelihood of use mobile insurance services, the conjoint assessment is used for a more in-depth analysis to the buy-off value of privacy. For this analysis, the buy-off value of privacy is determined for all individual relevant types of privacy for the case of pay-as-you-drive (PAYD) insurance. PAYD insurance is an automobile insurance whereby the premium is dependent on the actual car-use. Most common used indicators for car-use are mileages, and driving behavior. Respondents are willing to sell their privacy of location and space through continuously disclosing the GPS-location of their car for a financial compensation of 2,27 per month. Privacy of behavior and actions appears to have slightly higher buy-off value since respondents are willing to continuously provide insight in their car-acceleration, car-deceleration and steering behavior, for a financial compensation of 2,98 per month. Regarding the privacy of data and image two buy-off values are determined related to the internal and external (secondary) use of personal information. Hereby, secondary use is operationalized as the unauthorized use of personal information for personalized advertisement. Respondents are willing to sell their privacy of data image for third party advertisement for a financial compensation of 2,77 per month. In contrast to the external use of personal information, respondents are willing to pay a monthly contribution of 2,91 for internal (insurance related) personalized advertisement. However, these outcomes cannot blind be generalized to the entire population, it can be concluded that respondents derive more disutility from external use of privacy related information than internal use. Discussion and conclusion In conclusion, we can say that privacy concern are likely to rise with the use of mobile insurance services. However these concerns can be compensated by both perceived usefulness of the service and an expected monetary benefits. The compensation by the expectation for financial benefits appears to have a smaller effect than compensation by elevated perceptions on the usefulness of a mobile insurance service. However when the expectation on monetary benefits is amplified with a financial compensation, the buy-off values for different types of privacy appear to be rather small. Hereby, consumers perceive their privacy of behavior and action as more valuable than their privacy of location and space. Regarding privacy of data and image, the buy-off value seems to be dependent on the one who exploits their data; the data holder or an external party. While the use of consumers’ personal information for personalized advertisement by the data holder appears to be beneficial, personalized advertisement by third parties is perceived as adversely. This study is the first attempt in literature in which the buy-off value for different types of privacy is determined. As this study proves, is the buy-off value of privacy varying for different types of privacy, supporting its plurality. A plural approach on privacy could provide a more detailed method for future technology acceptance studies. Emerging trends, such as the ongoing digitalization, quantified-self, internet of things and big data require the disclosure of different sets of personal and contextual information. Consequently, different types of privacy may be involved affecting consumer adoption to another extent. Therefore, it is recommended to include a plural construct of privacy in future technology acceptance studies. Further research is recommended to evaluation the value of privacy for other mobile (insurance) services. A comparison between the values of privacy of these individual services may result in interesting insights for technology adoption and privacy literature. By proving the existence of multiple types of privacy dependent on the specific characteristics of concerned (mobile) services, this study validates the findings of Nikou (2012) that IT artifact should no longer be treated as ‘Black-Box’. Further, analysis methods such as factor analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) have not been applied in the explorative survey. By applying SEM in further research on the explorative dataset to examine both the effect of individual constructs per categories of mobile insurance and a generic constructs on the likelihood of use, could result in interesting insights, in line with Nikou’s (2012) findings, that IT artifact should no longer be treated as ‘Black-Box’.","Mobile Insurance; Privacy Concerns; Buy-off value; Privacy types; Insurance; Mobile technologies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-12-18","Technology, Policy and Management","ICT","","SEPAM","",""

Public-private partnerships are organized to engage strategic sites resulting in complex developments. The developments are comprised of multiple and often conflicting interest, which have to be simultaneously negotiated. The traditional tools of architecture and urban planning are simply not equipped to deal with the conditions that arise. This critical condition will be the focus of 'Complex Projects'. Shootings, crime, school dropouts, domestic- and gang violence, drug- and alcohol addiction; The South-side of Chicago today is notorious for its unsafe, empty and neglected neighbourhoods, in big contrast to the glorious days of the steel industry, once a driving force in the area. The withdrawal of the South works Steel Company in the 1970’s left the area only with the foot marks of what once was a vibrant and productive community. The area around the site is in total isolation. In social sense, because of the neighborhoods lack of proper education, healthy food, health care and safety. In physical sense the area lies isolated as well, because of borders created by infrastructure, dividing the area in different social and ethnic classes, and the lack of proper public transportation from and to the South-side. The vacancies and empty plots are a reason the area is scattered and fragmented. This asks for an intervention that can provide it with proper access to jobs, education and health care. By proposing common ground as a concept for development we are aiming to reconnect with reality. Injecting the South work sites with basic needs as schools, industry and agriculture, the neighborhood can profit from education, work, and public functions. A direct interaction on the site between the production and consumption of food, will provide an example for cities in reducing their footprint while empowering the people of Chicago South in part of their basic needs: food as binding factor. Common ground is a framework for sustainable and flexible growth, with the potential for social, economic and and environmental improvement of Chicago South. By designing a fragment of the total master plan I go deeper into the social, environmental and spatial implications of this proposition. By bringing people with different backgrounds together through food, which is something we all need, that binds us, a collective awareness for our current consumption behavior can possible be achieved. Although the building is not a solution for the structural problems in the area, social, economic and environmental isolation, it can be an urban catalyst as a start for better conditions in the neighborhood, providing work, education and social diversity. By exhibiting food production with architectural tools such as contextual, programmatic and spatial relations, light, materiality and spatial configuration food can be experienced, smelled, seen and touched. As this complex on its own will not be an answer for our current food problematics and over consumption. Rethinking how we produce and consume can create more awareness for the effort it takes to feed us with this project, I have tried to give an answer to my research and design question: Research question To what extent can a building contribute to the structural problems of the social, economic and environmental isolation of Chicago South and a state of over consumption in the city?

This is known as a fast welding technique in which in the order of seconds a joint can be created by means of fusion bonding of thermoplastics. This study has been focused on an assessment of the power and displacement feedback obtained during welding, the electro-insulating behavior of the created joints and their single lap shear strength & fracture. Both non-hybrid and hybrid joints have been welded. For hybrid welds, both steel and aluminium were used as metallic substrate. For aluminium substrates, the effect of not applying a coating has been evaluated as well. The absence of a coating was found to result in no bond between the applied thermoplastic and pretreated metallic surface. With the applied welding settings, hybrid welds with coated metallic substrates showed to dissipate the same amount of energy as non-hybrid welds, in the order of 700 Joules on average, at a welding time in the order of 0.5 seconds. The obtained power and displacement feedback during welding showed to be affected by both material choice and the type of adherend in contact with the sonotrode during welding. Welding resulted in an electro-insulating thermoplastic adhesive layer between both adherends for hybrid welds. Welding grit blasted and coated aluminium samples resulted in an average single lap shear strength (SLSS) of 11 MPa. This was 16.5 MPa with a coefficient of variation of 2.2 % for welding with a grit blasted, nitric acid etched and coated aluminium surface. This strength is up to 80 % of a tested adhesive reference. Hybrid welds with coated grit blasted steel and the used welding settings proved to result in an average SLSS of 8 MPa. For hybrid welded samples generally adhesive peel fracture on the metallic surface occurred. The findings support the application of displacement controlled ultrasonic plastic welding in the creation of hybrid joints between CFR-PA6 and thermoplastic coated metals like aluminium or steel.","Ultrasonic Welding; CFRTP; Aluminium; Steel; Composite","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-12-19","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","Structural Integrity & Composites","",""

(mentor)","2014","Automation has played a big role in the development of the industry in the last century. Despite the desire to automate the tedious and repetitive work in greenhouses by robots, the automation level in the horticulture is still far from desired. However, the last decade shows a lot of progress in the horticulture automation and more is expected due to the increasing need for automated processes in this area. Priva B.V. started the Tomation project in 2002 to automate the task of cutting off the leaves of tomato plants. Cutting off the leaves of tomato plants is one of the crop handling tasks done on a regular basis to ensure optimal growth and ripening of the tomatoes. This report presents research concerning the Tomation Project of Priva B.V., aimed at solving the problem of autonomous movement of the leaf-cutting robot in the greenhouse. The robot has to move autonomously in the path and periodically change from path to path. The focus in this report is on the path-to-path movement in the greenhouse. This is a movement where the vehicle rides off the rail, moves to the next path and finally drives back on the rail again to continue with the leaf cutting process. The robot platform is a vehicle equipped with omni-directional mecanum wheels and powered by stepper motors from Nanotec®. These mecanum wheels are omnidirectional wheels and are able to move the vehicle in a lateral direction. The vehicle will move with mecanum wheels on the concrete path and with flanged wheels on the rail. The vehicle with the mecanum wheels encountered difficulties driving sideways at a critical weight on the platform. Undesired movements occur at these weights, because the stepper motor is not performing all the steps. The scope of the project includes the autonomous path-to-path movement of the robot. The vision system for navigational purposes is not installed yet on the platform. Hence, the inputs from the system are entered manually in this project. It has to be taken into account that the vision system can only look at the front. The path-to-path movement should meet requirements on accuracy, time, speed and the payload of the vehicle. Furthermore, the vehicle has to be able to cope with cracks and obstructions on the road during the movement. Finally, it has to deal with rails that are shifted, because they are not fixed properly on the concrete path. Using the positional feedback of the encoders of the available stepper motor and inputs of a vision system a proper control system is required. To get a good starting point to develop the autonomous movement of the platform, it was important to have a good understanding of the stepper motor and a clear view on the possibilities and modes of use of the motor. The working principle of the stepper motor is explained by describing the common step modes: the full step, the half step and the micro step mode. The difference between the stepper motor and a servo motor is explained. Based on the differences between these motors, the choice on the stepper motor has been reasoned. The technical specifications and the Software Development Kit of the motors are presented. These were needed to learn the possibilities in controlling and using the motors. The mecanum wheels of the vehicle of the Tomation Project serve for omnidirectional purposes. The possibility to move in a lateral direction with these wheels was the main reason for using them. The wheels offer a way to do compact movements on the path, without obstructing the path more than necessary to avoid possible conflicts with other (moving) objects. The omnidirectional movement is realized by appropriately controlling the angular velocity of each wheel separately. Depending on each individual wheel rotation direction and velocity, the resulting combination of the wheels produces a total movement in the desired direction without changing the orientation of the wheels. The navigational purposes of the Tomation project required a proper kinematic model of the vehicle. The equations of motion are used to derive the ideal kinematic model to reach a desired position and orientation. The measured position errors are dealt with by adjusting the kinematic model with experiments. The sources of these errors were slippage, bearing friction and point contact friction. A comprehensive research on rollers of the wheels during omnidirectional movements is performed. This was needed to understand the motion of the rollers and its contribution to the omnidirectional movements. The analyses have shown that as the movement with the vehicle gets more lateral, the rollers will contribute more to the movement. This was also observed during movements of the vehicle. These observations and analyses on the rollers are used to explain the dynamics of the wheels. To understand why the lateral movement of the vehicle needs more phase current than the forward movement, the dynamics of the mecanum wheels are investigated. A misconception in the literature on the dynamic model is explained. The literature neglects the force perpendicular to the rollers without a proper reasoning. The aspect of motion in the rollers is not taken into account. Hence, it is decided to reject the theory in the literature on the dynamics of these vehicles. With observations and analyses on the wheels a new dynamic model has been developed. This model takes also the friction in the rollers into account. This friction causes the main difference between the required force for the forward and lateral movement. It is seen that as the movement gets more lateral, the rollers will have more contribution, so the movement will be more affected by friction. Hence, the lateral movement needs more force to overcome the friction compared to a forward movement. The vehicle of the Tomation project encountered practical problems related to the navigational features of the vehicle. The effects of these problems are analysed and solutions are presented when needed. To navigate properly in the greenhouse a function is developed that provides the number of steps needed per wheel for a given omnidirectional movement. Furthermore, the undesired effects, caused by rounding the target speed of the motor, are dealt with by looking for the nearest movement without these errors. Next, the asynchronous start of the motors caused by the serial connection is solved with an Arduino board that generates a signal to start all the motors simultaneously. Finally, an ultrasonic proximity sensor is used to detect the concrete path when riding off the rail backwards. The vision system could not be used here, since the cameras are facing forward. These functions and additions improve the reliability and robustness of the movement in the greenhouse. With the aforementioned functions and findings from the analyses a reliable and proper path to path movement in the greenhouse is ensured. The movement is split into three separate movements: riding off the rail, moving across to the next path and driving on the rail of the new path. After analysing alternatives for these movements, it has been decided that the vehicle will move just with two motors in the area where transition from the mecanum wheels to the flanged wheels occurs. A lateral movement with the current setup was not feasible for the required payload. If we disregard the payload of the robot, the remaining conditions did meet the requirements of the movement. The research in this project has contributed to the autonomous movement for the vehicle of the Tomation Project of Priva. The path-to-path movement of the vehicle is realized in a reliable way, provided that the motors are strong enough to deliver the required force for the movements. The results will be used for further steps in the project.","Mecanum wheels; Automation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-12-18","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Buykx, S. (mentor); Frankenmolen, S. (mentor); Karreman, W. (mentor); Bakker, K.J. (mentor); Everts, H.J. (mentor)","2014","Suction caissons are used more and more for various in the oil&gas and offshore wind industries. Although, the use of suction caissons is not new, uncertainty still exists regarding their installation, due to the varying soil profiles encountered and the absence of experience within the offshore industry. Prediction methods, regarding the suction requirement, are not always seen to provide accurate estimations, but mostly provide a range of expected values. The general theoretical understanding of the different geotechnical issues arisen during suction caisson installation is known but not defined or quantified sufficiently. The main problem discussed in the thesis is the variation in soil characteristics encountered at offshore sites. Owning to this fact standardization of installation behavior and installation related parameters is challenging. There are a number of uncertainties in the installation prediction of suction caissons. First, the state of stress and soil conditions adjacent to a suction caisson being installed differ from those around typical driven piles or drilled shafts. Dynamic changes are imposed changing the soil state. Second, the soil resistance encountered during the installation of suction caissons depends on the rate of installation, hydraulic conductivity, drainage length, as well as the shear strength properties of the foundation soil material. Finally, during installation, volume characteristics of the surrounding soil change compared to those measured in-situ initially. The existing knowledge related to the prediction of soil resistance and installation of suction caissons is found to be adequately accurate in a relatively short range (homogeneous sand and clay profiles) of soil conditions. The grey area in between permeable and impermeable soils is found to be uncharted. The objective of the present research is to assess the governing mechanisms during installation of a suction caisson in layered sand by investigating the installation behavior and how prediction methods can be modified based on a back-analysis of executed installations. The limitations of existing methods are investigated regarding the soil resistance prediction. The accuracy level associated with the suction requirement in sand and layered sand is evaluated. The monitored installation pressure is assessed in order to verify consistent patterns of installation pressure trends. Typically, in this thesis, installations of suction caissons in homogeneous dense sand profiles have been observed to meet the theoretical predictions regarding the soil resistance encountered during installation. Estimation with adequate accuracy level of the associated suction requirement was observed. Conversely, the installations of suction caissons in layered sand with varying soil characteristics (permeability and relative density) are observed to be inadequately described by the prediction methods regarding the installation suction pressure requirement. Adjustment of predictions’ input parameters was seen to be required based on experience with the particular soil material, in order to return reliable estimations. Parameters such as prediction methods’ ? P?_su^crit were seen to depend on the encountered soil material and its characteristics, determining their loosening rate. Furthermore, the ? P?_su^crit was noticed to be essentially the parameter determining the anticipated soil plug loosening rate based on the analyzed prediction methods. A refinement of the adopted loosening rate by prediction methods for various soil profile characteristics (i.e. initial relative density and permeability) was seen to be required to enhance installation pressure estimation accuracy. The analysis of layered sand profiles interbedded by layers with fine-grained material were seen to behave as virtual sand profiles rather than layered sand profiles (silty sand profiles), when permeability was remained high. Regardless, of the soil profile encountered, the installation pressure was seen to be a function of both the CPT cone resistance integral and the corresponding effective vertical stress at the c depth. DNV standard recommendations have been seen to be conservative, and without adequate specifications on k_f and k_p values, which are essential as they relate the CPT cone resistance with the estimation of the friction and tip resistance. Furthermore, a recommended suction-assisted caisson installation phase expression was seen to be required to standardize the suction caisson installation design. Further studies on the variation of the DNV k_f and k_p values in regards to the various soil characteristics are required.","suction caissons; layered conditions; offshore foundations; installation design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo engineering masterr track (GE)","",""

(mentor); Zijlema, M. (mentor); Zitman, T.J. (mentor)","2014","FLNG cooling water outfalls can be characterized as high momentum buoyant jets, relatively close to the surface. The buoyant jet trajectories, spreading rates and surface distribution very much depend on the jet outflow characteristics. A study with the CFD software OpenFOAM has been carried out into the mixing and transport processes of buoyant jets. It is shown that OpenFOAM can be used to model the three dimensional trajectories of buoyant jets and their far-field buoyant plume distribution. Two dominant mixing processes are the result of the high initial jet momentum. First, the high momentum jet results in large turbulent jet entrainment rates. Second, the relatively shallow high momentum jets result in large horizontal surface currents. These currents horizontally advect the buoyant plume into the far-field and result in steep vertical velocity gradients, which induce vertical mixing of the buoyant plume. The momentum length scale, Lm proves to be an important parameter to characterize buoyant jets. The momentum length scale represents a distance along the jet trajectory, where buoyancy effects become dominant over initial jet momentum. For these jet characteristics it is found that the dimensionless surface temperature rise follows a logistic distribution function to the momentum length scale, after the point of surface impingement. The relative surface temperature results become constant for increasing values of the momentum length scale. This is the result of increased mixing by the jet turbulent entrainment and steep vertical velocity gradient. From the logistic distribution an empirical relation is found which can accurately predict the surface temperature rise as a function of the outfall velocity, outfall diameter, outfall temperature, outfall angle and distance from the jet orifice. The outfall depth appears to have no significant influence on the surface temperature rise for the conditions used in this study. The empirical equation proves to give reliable results for distances larger than 1.5 times the value of the momentum length scale and jet submergence smaller than 7.5 times the jet diameter. The robustness of the equation is also tested for extreme value outfall scenarios. The equation overestimates the temperature rise for small outflow diameters, combined with high initial jet temperatures. For other considered extreme values, the equation proves to give reliable results. Moreover, it is also demonstrated that the standard k-epsilon turbulence closure can be successfully used to model the buoyant jet centerline velocities, jet trajectories, spreading rates and centerline dilution rates of a round turbulent buoyant jet.","OpenFOAM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-12-18","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","Glacier surge behaviour is characterized by multiyear, quasi-periodic changes in glacier geometry and ice flow. Various attempts have been done on modelling glacier surge behaviour. The focus of this research will be on land-terminating, hard-bedded, temperate glaciers (LHT-glaciers). Whereas the drainage system at the base of the glacier is thought to be the key element in the surge behaviour of those glaciers, developed models do not include a basal drainage model. The surges of LHT-glaciers are characterized by a sudden initiation and a sudden termination of the surge. This sudden on- and offset is assigned to switches in basal drainage system. Therefore, a description of the transformation of the basal drainage system during a surge cycle of LHT-glaciers is proposed. The proposed transformation is based on observations of the 1982-1983 surge of Variegated Glacier, Alaska. Despite the fact that models that are capable of simulating quasi-periodic behaviour related to basal frictional lubrication do not include a basal drainage model, building blocks of a basal drainage model for surging glaciers have been proposed for a long time. By means of translating the proposed transformation of the basal drainage system into those building blocks, a basal drainage model is constructed. The constructed basal drainage model is coupled to the ice mass continuity equation. By means of implementing the coupled model, it is shown that the model simulates the characteristic features of the surge cycle of LHT-glaciers.","surge behaviour; basal drainage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluidmechanics","",""

(mentor); De Koning, J.I.J.C. (mentor); Doan Minh, Q. (mentor)","2014","The Vietnamese middle class is growing and the agricultural sector uses pesticides and fertilizers to produce an increasing amount of food. The food quality in urban areas is low, and consumers believe that the current quality of the food is a threat to their health and especially to young children’s development. So consumers are motivated to choose more sustainable products, but the availability of sustainable products on the Vietnamese market is low and few people know where to find them. Moreover, (eco/organic) labels are not always trustworthy, or trusted and local brands are regarded as low quality. i-Nature is a company that produces and sells sustainable meat and vegetables. Sustainable farming does not only prevent harm to the environment but offers healthier working conditions for the farmers and of course healthy products for consumers. i-Nature’s ultimate goal is to teach many farmers to use their farming techniques, so they will be implemented and sustained on a big scale in Vietnam. Co-creation is the collective creativity of a company and its customers in the development of products, services or solutions. The goal of this graduation assignment is to design a digital co-creation tool for i-Nature, that enables (1) developing products and services together with customers, (2) gaining mutual insights between the company and customers, (3) gaining customers’ trust in the company, and (4) making their food consumption behaviour more sustainable. The focus on digital co-creation is based on two trends: First, the Vietnamese make extensive use of the internet for social media and comparing products. Second, researching brands is one of their main activities; the openness to brands and interaction online is the highest in all of Asia. Insights from the analysis phase showed that (1) customers have a lot of input and reaching a conceptual level with co-creation (the idea, details about the use, customer concerns and implementation) is possible. (2) The customers need to learn about sustainable farming to understand why in the first years, harvest quality will vary, and that i-Nature needs their support to have a chance to produce sustainable food of stable quality in a few years from now. i-Nature needs to know customers’ preferences when developing products and services, so the company can focus their limited time and budget on the most effective improvements and have competitive advantage. Specific for trusting i-Nature (3) is that customers want to see for themselves that the production process is indeed free from chemicals, that the animals do not get antibiotics or growth hormones, and that the water quality is controlled. Next to that, they need to be able to trust the farmers; will they stick to the sustainable techniques when i-Nature employees are not at the farm? Once the trust is gained, a lack of convenience keeps potential customers from purchasing i-Nature food, because they are currently used to buy fresh food every morning from the street markets in their neighbourhood. In the ideation phase, different forms of online co-creation have been tested. It turned out that it is very difficult to entice (potential) customers to participate in online co-creation with i-Nature; the willingness of both potential and existing customers of different backgrounds to spend time online on topics related to sustainability or food is low. In the conceptualization phase these problems have been solved by relating digital co-creation to a physical activity and by having clear benefits for the target group. The final concept has been tested and further developed into an app that enables potential customers to find out for themselves during a farm visit whether products are produced in a sustainable way, and that enables i-Nature to maintain a connection with potential customers afterwards and to gain customer insights. The potential of digital co-creation in the context of sustainable food consumption turned out to be limited, but as part of the design goal it did lead to a tool for co-creating data on the trustworthiness of a supplier, by customers, independent of subjective parties and without the need for expertise on sustainable farming. The i-Nature Sustainable Food app, and especially the Clean Food Check function can contribute to consumers’ understanding of sustainable agriculture, and it can help the truly sustainable food supplier gain trust. The app can give i-Nature the necessary customer insights to improve their offer and service to get a stronger competitive position on the Vietnamese food market.","co-creation; vietnam; sustainable; consumption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Hauptmann, D. (mentor)","2014","The general aim of this essay is to better understand the effects of globalization on architecture as well as its inherent possibilities. This research has specifically been oriented on architectural attitudes towards these processes. In order to gain an understanding of globalization processes their socio-economic consequences are first analysed. The growth of economies stands in direct relation to foreign trade. To a large extent internationally operating firms are responsible for this trade. In order to conduct cross-border business smoothly a network of globally operating firms has developed. These multinationals operate primarily in so-called ‘global cities’. This network of global cities is growing and is increasingly imbedded in all parts of the world. These economic processes instigate socio-cultural consequences on a global scale. Part of our findings is that technological and economic progress seems to prompt cultural erosion. Cultural erosion is explained as one of the consequences of the branding strategies used by globally operating companies. In applying these strategies these firms often disregard existing local cultures. Through several examples this essay demonstrates the relevance of the existing different cultural settings. The globalization issues are examined by discussing two seemingly opposite architectural attitudes: Regionalism and Deconstructivism. The former seems to advocate historical continuity, the latter seems to endorse flexibility and progress. The complexity of cultural representation is discussed through an analysis of acknowledged Regionalist examples. The pitfalls of historical abuse and generalization are also exemplified. Deconstructivism is explained through some of the subversions introduced by Rem Koolhaas. Since both attitudes have many subjective interpretations two case studies of their practitioners (OMA and Luis Barragán) clarify their workings. The final section tries to demonstrate the sensitivity of both approaches in regard to the globalizationprocesses that were described. Considering that globalized environments are not homogenous we conclude by recommending a strategy that involves analytical research of socio-cultural constructs.","Globalization; Globalisation; Culture; Regionalism; Critical Regionalism; OMA; Barragán; Socio-Economics; Architecture; Sassen; Klingmann; Frampton; Koolhaas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Delft School of Design","",""

(mentor); Ravon, A. (mentor); Maas, W. (mentor); Sobota, M. (mentor); De Ridder, A. (mentor)","2014","This project is part of a groupproject called Jajakarta, a manifesto to double the population density of Jakarta. Jabodetabek, the urban agglomeration consisting of DKI Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang and Bekasi, is the second fastest growing megacity on the planet (Robinson, 2011). Current projections show that Jabodetabek’s population will reach 38 million people in 2030 (Jakarta municipality, 2014). However, this growth will take place in a city that is facing major problems; all these issues are deeply interconnected and are seriously jeopardizing the city’s livability. (Kusno, 2010; Robinson, 2011; Silver, 2007). We believe these problems should be tackled with a radical reconsideration of Jakarta’s urban fabric. We propose the double the amount of inhabitants, going from Jakarta to Jajakarta. In 2030 Jakarta will have expended so much due to migration and population growth, and in this process overtaken many adjacent cities, that it will be called Jabodetabekasepususesuci (Jakarta municipality, 2014). An unpronounceable name for a megacity that has become so addictive to growth that it will become uncontrollable. The municipality will be left incapable in effectively managing the dramatically enlarged city. Stopping the urban sprawl will mean that the city center, known as DKI Jakarta, should increase its density; both in its inhabitants as in floor space, in order to be able to house the majority of the expected growth for all income classes. This change will require a new kind of urban fabric, in which the kampung is intensified. The re-envisioned Kampungs will have to house more people then ever while maintaining its diverse income groups. Doubling the population density will offer the opportunity to tackle some of Jakarta’s major issues while reimaging the core fabric of the city which is in grave need help. Jakarta is not the only city that faces these kinds of issues. Other cities in Indonesia such as Yogyakarta, Semarang, Surabaya and Bandung are all facing similar issues due to massive migration from the countryside to the cities. The strategies on an architectural and infrastructural scale are therefor not site specific, but could be implemented within various all of Indonesia’s kampungs and other south east Asian cities. The studio research is divided into scales ranging from XL (the entire city) to XXS (details). XL and L (Kebon Kacang, an kampung area of 2km in Jakarta) have been researched and designed by the group. The individual research focuses on 1 of 4 generic situation found within the L scale site (Kebon Kacang), which can be found throughout Jakarta. These are the M scales and are: the innercity-kampung, the kampung kota border, the riverfront and the economic and production centre. My project (from the M to XXS scale) focuses on how to increase the centre of the kampungs, also known as inner-city-kampungs and mainly looks at strategies for mid-low to high-income housing and infrastructure. This specific area is the oldest part of the kampong and is an original Batawi kampung. The current density of this area is 30.000 people per 1 km2. The goal of Jajakarta is to double this to 60.000 inhabitants per 1 km2. Kampungs are self-built by their inhabitants, and have, until the KIP program, never seen any involvement of the government. The forms of housing starts off with a simple shed, and become more and more solid and extended when people have made enough money to turn this into a brick house. This makes the kampong a very resilient urban fabric, but there is a limit tot its growth. With a density of 60.000 people per km2, the average building height would be 4 floors. This is far beyond the reach of the kampung inhabitants to build with the available building material and budgets them selves. My project aims to bridge the gap between the people’s possibility’s and the required volume as stated in the goals of Jajakarta. The project provides a set of policy’s, infrastructures and typologies, from both the kampong and the Kota sight, in the form of a new kampung improvement program: the Kampong Densification Program”.

These materials are based on piezoelectric ceramic powders or particles, which are dispersed in a polymer matrix. In most cases, piezoelectric composites use the same ceramic compositions as the ones used in piezoelectric ceramics. These compositions consist of lead zirconium titanate (PZT) with a composition close to the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). This research work focuses on exploring the performance of non-MPB compositions of PZT ceramic particles in order to obtain high voltage sensitive 0-3 PZT-Epoxy composites. The PZT ceramic compositions (PbNb0.01[ZrxTi(1-x)]O3), ranging from pure tetragonal lead titanate (x=0) to rhombohedral (x=0.80) were prepared using the mixed oxide method. These ceramic particles were characterized using XRD, SEM and particle size analyser and were used to prepare both sintered ceramics and 0-3 PZT-epoxy composites. The effect of the ceramic filler composition on the dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the PZT-Epoxy composites was investigated. Unlike PZT ceramics, the best piezoelectric properties were not observed in the MPB-based composites but in the pure tetragonal phase. It was observed that the dielectric constant of the ceramic particles had minimal influence on the effective dielectric constant (?r) and the piezoelectric charge constant (d33) of the piezoelectric composite due to the depolarization effect of the high dielectric filler materials. The experimentally determined values of the dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the piezoelectric composites were validated using analytical models. The influence of electric fatigue on the polarization of the PbTiO3 (PT) and morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) based composites were also examined. Finally, a material selection criterion was proposed in order to develop piezoelectric composites with high voltage sensitivity. This general material selection criterion is not limited to PZT based ceramics but is also applicable to lead-free ceramic filler materials. Thus, the current research work paves the way for the development of environmental friendly lead-free piezoelectric composites devices with enhanced sensory properties.","Piezoelectricity; Piezoelectric composites; Lead zirconium titanate (PZT); Morphotrophic phase boundary (MPB); PZT - Epoxy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Mechanics, Aerospace Structures & Materials","","Novel Aerospace Materials (NovAM)","",""

De Waalhaven heeft een ingangsbreedte van circa 43m en wordt ook gebruikt door Klasse Va schepen. Op grond van de Richtlijnen Vaarwegen voldoet de Waalhaven niet aan de richtlijn Klasse Va schepen van 110x11,4m, waarbij de breedte van de haveningang minimaal 4 maal de breedte van een schip (4B) dient te zijn. De haveningang heeft in verhouding met de Klasse Va schepen slechts een breedte van 3,77B. Dit heeft echter gevolgen voor veiligheid en snelheid van afwikkeling. Bij Klasse IV schepen voldoet de Waalhaven aan de richtlijnen en heeft de haveningang in verhouding een breedte van 4,57B. In de richtlijn voor binnenhavens (Richtlijnen Vaarwegen), is de vereiste minimale breedte voor de haveningang 4,0B. Deze richtlijn is in de jaren zeventig geïntroduceerd en kan nu al achterhaald zijn. In dit afstudeerwerk wordt een beoordeling gegeven van de breedte van de haveningang van de Waalhaven. De studie zal betrekking hebben op de volgende situaties:  De grootte en vormgeving van de haven ten opzichte van de nautische veiligheid.  De effecten van langsstroom over de veiligheid van de scheepvaart.  De effecten van verschillende scheeps klassen. De onderzoeksvraag is dan ook: Voldoet de verhouding havenbreedte-scheepsbreedte bij de Waalhaven aan de Richtlijnen Vaarwegen voor de breedte van de havenmond wat betreft de nautische veiligheid, en zo niet wat zou de havenmond breedte moeten zijn ? Het onderzoek wordt uitgevoerd met behulp van een simulatorstudie SHIPMA. De RVW zijn opgesteld als kader voor gebruik door en voor Rijkswaterstaat, dat wil zeggen: een verplichting, waarvan alleen is af te wijken na toestemming van Rijkswaterstaat. Hoewel de RVW specifiek verwijzen naar Rijkswaterstaat worden de richtlijnen ook door de overige vaarwegbeheerder gebruikt voor het inrichten en ontwerpen van vaarwegen, zoals de Provincie Noord-Holland. De reden is dat de veilige en vlotte afwikkeling van het scheepvaartverkeer gediend is bij uniforme toepassing van de RVW door alle vaarwegbeheerders. Een beheerder heeft echter de mogelijkheid van de RVW af te wijken, mits de alternatieve oplossing eveneens de vlotte, veilige en betrouwbare vaart garandeert. Het is van belang, dat de vaarwegbeheerder afwijkingen van de richtlijnen goed kan motiveren, documenteert en de vaarweggebruiker adequaat informeert. De RVW zijn afgebakend tot:  het verkeerskundig ontwerp, het constructieve ontwerp behoort niet tot het terrein van de RVW;  vaarwegen van de CEMT klassen I tot en met V;  vaarwegen zonder stroming of met een langsstroom tot 0,5 m/s;  vaarwegen die niet hoofdzakelijk voor zeevaart bestemd zijn;  niet toegepast voor de vaargeulen op de Noordzee of Waddenzee. Na een literatuuronderzoek naar richtlijnen en modellen voor simulatorstudies, is het eigenlijke simulatoronderzoek uitgevoerd. Dit kan onderverdeeld worden in de volgende twee fasen: Fase 1: Datacollectie en toetsing van haven Het vooronderzoek richt zich op het verzamelen van de basisgegevens die noodzakelijk zijn voor de uitvoering van het onderzoek:  Vaststelling van de lay-out van de haven;  Vaststelling van de verschillende klasse schepen met de bijbehorende karakteristieken;  Vaststelling van de maatgevende omgevingsomstandigheden zoals stroming, waterstanden en wind. Fase 2: Simulaties In Fase 2 zijn met behulp van SHIPMA 7 een aantal (fast-time) simulaties uitgevoerd. Hierbij wordt de Waalhaven getoetst op nautische veiligheid en onder welke omstandigheden de manoeuvres haalbaar zijn. Ook is een gevoeligheidsstudie worden uitgevoerd met betrekking op een aantal aspecten. Het mathematische model dat in SHIPMA wordt gebruikt is identiek aan dat van de real-time Simulator van MARIN. Echter, is een uitzondering met betrekking tot het autopilot. In de real-time simulator wordt het schip door de mens gevaren en de fast-time simulator door het autopilot. Vergeleken met andere binnenhavens in Nederland, heeft de Waalhaven de kleinste haven ingang en is de enige haven die niet voldoet aan de verhouding van RVW (4.0B). Voor de simulatie, is er een nieuwe database aangemaakt voor de Waalhaven. De lay-out en de afmetingen van de haven is geconstrueerd op basis van de bestaande Waalhaven in Nijmegen. Voor de simulaties, zijn een paar gevalideerde model schepen geselecteerd. Deze model schepen zijn in afmetingen kleiner dan in de werkelijkheid, maar zal niet veel invloed hebben op dit onderzoek. Enkele gegevens zijn verzameld voor de simulatie zoals wind, waterdiepte en de stroom. De windsnelheid ter plaatse van de haven is bepaald door middel van KNMI gegevens. In de studie wordt een uniforme windsnelheid gebruikt. Voor de simulatie is een kielspeling van 1,0 m is gebruikt en de totale waterdiepte is 4m. De stroomrichting is van Oost naar West, er is geen stroming aangenomen in de haveningang. Voor het onderzoek zijn 4 langsstroom snelheden onderzocht: 0,3 m/s, 0,5m/s, 0,7m/s en 1,0m/s. De manoeuvres in SHIPMA worden gerelateerd aan een voorgeprogrammeerde baan die het schip volgt tijdens de simulaties met behulp van een autopilot. Bij het definiëren van de baan is de snelheid langs de baan gespecificeerd. Het autopilot probeert de baan zo goed mogelijk te volgen met minimale afwijkingen. Criteria manoeuvres:  Vlot verloop van manoeuvres circa 5min  Voldoende afstand tot de oevers bij invaren circa 8m  Maximaal 35° - 40° roerhoek gebruiken.  De snelheid van het schip dient voldoende te zijn afgenomen binnen het havengebied (<0,5 m/s) In totaal zijn 16 situaties gesimuleerd. Er wordt een onderscheid gemaakt tussen twee verschillende vaarrichtingen. Op die manier kan men het verschil zien tussen met de stroom meevaren en tegen de stroom in. Daarnaast wordt de invloed van langsstromen op de manoeuvre onderzocht door deze te variëren. Iedere simulatie van een situatie staat op zichzelf. Daarmee wordt bedoeld dat het schip en het gebied identiek zijn, maar de baan en/of de strategie kan iedere keer anders zijn om te anticiperen op veranderde omgevingscondities. Een simulatie situatie wordt dan ook een aantal malen overgedaan om tot het gewenste resultaat te komen. Hierbij wordt iedere factor die beïnvloedbaar is, zoals het autopilot en de baan, stap voor stap gewijzigd om tot een realistisch resultaat te komen. Een gevoeligheidsstudie is uitgevoerd voor enkele variabelen (windrichting, bredere vaarweg en een neer in de havenmond), omdat deze in het onderzoek zijn versimpeld. Voor de wind is een uniforme wind en richting gekozen. De stroming in de havenmond is vanwege de complexiteit weggelaten. Door een simulatie te maken met een neer, kan gecontroleerd worden of deze invloed zal hebben. Deze variabelen zullen worden getoetst met een klasse Va schip en een langsstroom van 0,7m/s. Aangezien dit het grootste van de twee schepen is in een conditie op de overgang van haalbaar naar niet-haalbare manoeuvres. Uit de simulaties is gebleken dat de huidige Waalhaven geschikt is voor Klasse IV schepen en voor Klasse Va schepen tot een langsstroom van 0,5m/s. De formule voor de haveningang van 4B volgens de Richtlijnen Vaarwegen is nog toepasbaar bij langsstroom tot 0,5m/s. Wanneer de langsstroom toeneemt, voldoet de breedte van de haveningang niet meer. Bij een langsstroom van 0,7m/s dient de verhouding op basis van deze studie aangepast te worden naar 4,9B. Ook is er een verschil waargenomen wanneer het schip tegenstrooms vaart of met de stroom mee. Door tegenstrooms kan het schip beter manoeuvreren en het roer beter gebruiken, waardoor de vaarbaan breedte klein kan worden gehouden. Uit de resultaten van de gevoeligheidsstudie is op te maken dat de onderzochte factoren invloed hebben op de resultaten. Zo heeft de windrichting een effect op de manoeuvre en de vaarbaanbreedte, de schipper dient hier rekening mee te houden. Een bredere vaarweg zal een negatief invloed hebben op het schip, omdat het schip een lange tijd stroming tegen zich krijgt. In een situatie met een neer in de haveningang is te zien dat. Schepen hinder ondervinden. Het manoeuvreren voor schepen wordt lastiger, waardoor de vaarbaanbreedte zal toenemen. Uit de simulatie studie is gebleken dat de huidige Waalhaven niet voldoet voor de Klasse Va schepen. De huidige haven heeft een breedte van 3,7B in plaats van de minimale breedte van 4B volgens de Richtlijnen Vaarwegen. De haveningang voldoet wel aan de benodigde breedte voor Klasse IV schepen tot een langsstroom van 0,5m/s. Uit de resultaten van de simulatie studie wordt geconcludeerd dat de Richtlijnen Vaarwegen met een havenbreedte van 4B een zeer goede streefwaarde is voor enkelbaans vaarverkeer tot een langsstroom van 0,5 m/s. Deze dient worden aangehouden als een minimum en niet als een maximum. Per situatie dient gekeken te worden of een hogere breedtefactor dient te worden aangehouden, omdat in sommige situatie ook andere factoren van belang kunnen zijn zoals, de windrichting, de vaarweg en de stromingsconditie. Op te maken is dat de langsstroom een belangrijk punt is bij het bepalen van de breedte van een haveningang. Bij een langsstroom van 0,7 m/s en 1,0 m/s dient een bredere havenbreedte te worden gekozen vanwege het grotere ruimtebeslag tijdens het manoeuvreren. Hiervoor dient haveningang een minimale breedte van 4.9B aangehouden te worden. Geconcludeerd kan worden dat de huidige Waalhaven niet aan de benodigde ingangsbreedte voldoet voor een klasse Va schepen met een stroming van 0,7m/s of meer. De gemiddelde langstroom op de Waalhaven is ca. 0,7m/s. Om de situatie daadwerkelijk te verbeteren dient de haveningang ruimer te worden. De verhouding van Richtlijnen Vaarwegen met 4B voor een haveningang voldoet dus niet Aanbevolen wordt om de 4B verhouding van Richtlijnen Vaarwegen verder te onderzoeken om de nautische veiligheid te waarborgen. De resultaten van SHIPMA zijn realistisch, echter binnen de toegepaste modeleigenschappen en beperkingen. Het programma SHIPMA dient dan ook gebruikt te worden voor een eerste benadering.","binnenhaven; Richtlijnen Vaarwegen; Waalhaven","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering/Ports and Waterways","",""

(mentor); Uijttewaal, W.S.J. (mentor); Zijlema, M. (mentor); Dusseljee, D. (mentor)","2014","Permeable wooden pile groins have a long tradition as being part of the coastal protection in the Netherlands, as well as in Germany and the United Kingdom. They are built to protect beaches from eroding by reducing the current velocity along the beach and thus its ability to transport beach material. This type of groin is most popular among the population; in Zeeland (NL), they are incorporated into the national heritage. In scientific research however, they lack attention. More focus is set on beach processes themselves and on the (supposedly) more stable impermeable rubble mound groins. As several researches stress their potential as soft methods and their advantages over impermeable groins, this thesis intends to put their usage more into focus. By means of generic numerical research and a comparison to available laboratory data and analytical approaches, the understanding of this type of groins is enhanced. This thesis explores the usage of permeable wooden pile groins in coastal waters under the influence of current and wave forcing. Both impermeable and permeable groins are able to reduce the sediment transport capacity and yield sediment accumulation. Impermeable groin are researched on reasonable well, as they are supposed to be more stable and their effects easier predictable. Important disadvantages are also originating from their impermeable structure: they deflect the approaching current causing strong offshore directed flows and large scale eddies between neighbouring groins. The paths of the sediment transportation will lead to a zig-zag profile of the shoreline, eventually causing erosion landward of the original shoreline and outflanking of the groin. Permeable groins reduce the original current velocity originating from the tide or breaking waves while not changing the general flow field. As a consequence, the sediment transport capacity reduces and dangerous rip-currents are prevented to a great extent. The thesis provides insight into the theoretical behaviour of the flow field around groins based on available laboratory experiments and theoretical considerations. This is enriched by a numerical research. For the forcing by a current, an analytical model is developed which provides the global change in the water level upstream and downstream of a stream. Further, the change in the velocity behind the groin and next to the groin can be obtained. In numerical models available for hydraulic engineering and research, the direct implementation of permeable pile groins is not explicitly provided. For most large scale hydrodynamic and morphology models the flow around a groin is on a too small spatial scale to be of interest compared to the whole flow domain. However, there are tools available to approximate the effects of permeable groins. The effect of the groins on the hydrodynamics is evaluated by means of the numerical model SWASH (Simulating WAves til SHore). This relatively new model is developed with the intention to reproduce both small and large scale flows in shallow water. In SWASH, two possible tools are available of which one on basis of a Morison equation proved to be suitable for the representation of groins on a laboratory scale. The numerical research evaluates the effect of permeable pile groins on the flow field when subject to a forcing by either a constant current originating from the tide, or the like, or from breaking waves. It is evaluated that many effects caused by the presence of groins on the flow field can be reproduced on a flat and an inclined (beach) bottom, both under a current or a wave forcing. For the wave forcing at a beach profile, a more detailed analysis is done on the effect on the flow field and bottom shear stresses under variations in the physical parameters. This study gives the range of boundaries under which permeable groins are applicable and their consequent effect on the flow field.","groin; groyne; permeable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","Abstract—As current rigid needles follow straight line trajectories, limiting the path planning possibilities in minimally invasive surgical approaches, research into steerable needle instruments becomes necessary. This article outlines the development of a four-part needle prototype inspired by the ovipositor of parasitic wasps and designed to penetrate without a net push force. In the wasp ovipositor, three valves move reciprocally to gain depth in the substrate with one valve at a time, while the other two valves anchor against the substrate and provide lateral support. The needle prototype consists of four reciprocally moving needle parts, devoid of any tissue gripping textures, with a combined cross-section of 2 x 2 mm, supported by a platform which is able to move with low friction. The goal of this study is to penetrate tissue phantom material without applying a net push force by using a friction difference induced between protruding needle parts and stationary needle parts, solely based on the difference in the size of surface area subjected to needle-tissue friction. The prototypes validation in gelatin phantom shows needle insertion with limited push force, independent from the penetration depth. The performance of the prototype is measured by the amount of slip between needle and substrate. Slip shows to be proportional with needle-part offset and inversely proportional with gelatin concentration, whereas protrusion sequence and needle-part velocity seem to have little effect on performance. Validation of these relations is found challenging due to the effect of inertia and bearing friction on the measured slip.","needle steering; ovipositor; zero net push force","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-17","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor)","2014","The RET, or Rotterdamse Elektrische Tram, is the main public transport operator in the city of Rotterdam and they use buses, metro trains and trams. This thesis focusses on one of the transportation types of the RET, the trams. The Rotterdam tramway network consists of 194 kilometer of rails, 443 switches and 322 stops. During the night, all 128 trams are stored in one of two depots, one located at Beverwaard and one located at Kralingen. Maintenance of the tram wheels is a very large expense for the RET, mainly because both the rails and the tram wheels are made of steel, which causes a lot of wear. Wear causes the shape of the wheel profile to change, which can lead to a number of inconveniences. When the wheel profile shape is not optimal, this affects the both the safety and the performance of the trams along with the comfort of the passengers. Especially for safety issues, there are certain limits for the tram wheels that indicate whether a tram is still allowed to be used or not. If a tram does not comply with these regulations, the wheels of this tram are turned and the shape of the wheel profile is restored if possible. If the wheel cannot be turned anymore the wheel tire is replaced by a new wheel tire. The RET wants to save money on the maintenance of the tram wheels, but also wants to raise the overall quality of the wheels of the trams in operation. To achieve this, the RET has purchased two measuring systems for the tram wheels and installed these at both depots. When a tram passes one of these measuring systems, it automatically measures multiple parameters on each tram wheel, which are used to determine the shape of the wheel profile.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-19","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Simao Ferreira, C.J. (mentor)","2014","The wake geometry of a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) is unlike the standard Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT). The blades of the turbine continuously passes through its own wake, creating complex wake-body interactions such as flow separation and dynamic stall, and convectional grid-based numerical method which is capable of describing such near-body phenomena fails at efficiently resolving the wake geometry. However, as these phenomena have a direct impact on the performance of the VAWT, it is paramount that there exists a numerical method that is not only capable of accurately resolving the small-scale near-body phenomena but also excels at efficiently resolving the unsteady large-scale wake geometry. This was the goal of the research and the numerical method that satisfied these requirements was the domain decomposition method known as the Hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian Vortex Particle Method (HELVPM), based on the doctoral thesis of Daeninck [24] and the additional study performed by Stock [61]. In the present study, we coupled an Eulerian Finite Element Method, which only resolves the near-body domain, with a Lagrangian Vortex Particle Method, which resolves the entire wake. The advantage of such fluid domain segregation was that the Eulerian method could focus on accurately describing the near-body features whereas the Lagrangian method could focus on efficiently evolving the wake using simulation acceleration methods such as Fast Multipole Method (FMM) and parallel computation in Graphical Processing Units (GPU). The present study initially developed, verified and validated the Finite Element method and the Vortex Particle method separately ensuring it performs according to the theory. These methods were then coupled using the algorithm of Daeninck [24] and Lagrangian correction strategy developed by Stock [61]. However, during the study we determined that additional modifications to the coupling strategy is required to ensure conservation of circulation. Furthermore, it was determined that the spatial resolution of numerical method at the overlap region, where coupling takes place, plays a crucial role in the accuracy of the coupling. Even though the hybrid method of the present study sacrificed some efficiency to ensure an accurately coupled scheme, we must not that it is still at its infancy. With the help ofadvanced techniques such as varying particle core size, higher order time marching scheme in the Eulerian method, and boundary element method acceleration techniques such as FMM and/or GPU calculation, the hybrid method has the potential to substantially outperform standard grid based methods. In conclusion, the hybrid method that has been developed here has the potential to accurately describing the near-wake phenomena and efficiently evolving the wake of a VAWT.","Vortex Method; VAWT; Hybrid; Finite Element; Python; Aerodynamics; CFD; Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-12-04","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics & Wind Energy","","","",""

In the Dutch freeway design guideline (NOA) turbulence distances are applied to determine the minimal distance between on-ramps and off-ramps to enter and exit the freeway, or to switch from the one freeway to the other, and lane drops. However, the origin of these values are unknown. In the meanwhile, these values are applied, while the pressure on the infrastructure system is increasing. Hopefully these values can be decreased by measuring the effect of discontinuities on the traffic flow. In this thesis an innovative method is developed to measure the general macroscopic effects on the mean speed, lane flow distribution and lane density by combining induction loop data of multiple freeway acceleration lane locations. This thesis focuses on the effect of acceleration lanes on the traffic flow by comparing the data of acceleration lanes with the data of locations without discontinuities. With this method little effects are found on the mean (lane) speed. In the lane flow distribution and lane density effects of the acceleration lane on the traffic flow are found. On the outside lane decreases the fraction of the flow and lane density just upstream of the acceleration lane. Further downstream, the fraction and lane density increases strongly until just downstream of the acceleration, and decreases back to the ""normal"" level. On the median lane the opposite behavior is found. Based on a rough estimation the effect of the acceleration lane is found 500 meter upstream and 800 meter downstream of the acceleration lane.","turbulence; acceleration lane; lane distribution; lane speed; distance; induction loops; multiple locations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","Probleemveld: Leegstand van gebouwen Leegstand van kantoorgebouwen is een onderdeel van het totale proces van verhuur en huur in de vastgoedmarkt. Deze leegstand, waardoor verhuizingen kunnen plaatsvinden, wordt frictieleegstand genoemd. Bij een te groot verschil tussen vraag en aanbod kan echter structurele leegstand ontstaan. Structurele leegstand houdt in dat een vloeroppervlakte gedurende drie opeenvolgende jaren leegstaat. Nederland heeft in het begin van 2014 een leegstandspercentage van 15,7% van de totale kantoorvoorraad. Nederland heeft hiermee het hoogste leegstandspercentage van heel Europa, welke een gemiddelde leegstandspercentage van 10% heeft. Rotterdam stijgt boven deze twee percentages uit, met een leegstandspercentage van 18,7 % van zijn totale kantorenvoorraad in 2013. Een gezonde kantoren markt kent een frictieleegstand van 4 tot 8 %, waardoor we de huidige leegstandspercentages als problematisch mogen beschouwen. De kwantitatieve oorzaak van deze structurele leegstand is het blijven bouwen van kantoren, terwijl hier al een hele tijd geen vraag meer naar is. Dat de vraag naar kantoorruimte minder is geworden komt onder andere door de crisis en het nieuwe werken. Ook hebben bedrijven andere kwalitatieve eisen aan kantoorruimtes en hun omgeving . Zo moet het gebouw voldoen aan de nieuwste eisen omtrent duurzaamheid en moet de ruimte in een omgeving met verschillende voorzieningen zijn gelegen. Probleemstelling: Waarom leegstand een probleem is De eigenaar van een leegstaand kantoorpand ondervindt als eerst de problemen van de structurele leegstand. Het gebouw genereert geen inkomsten meer en zal uiteindelijk in zijn marktwaarde dalen. Als het gebouw geen inkomsten levert is er weinig tot geen geld voor het onderhoud van het gebouw. Dit zorgt voor verloedering van het gebouw en kan vervolgens ongewenst bezoek trekken zoals krakers of drugsverslaafden. De problemen van het leegstaande kantoorgebouw zorgen voor een slecht imago van het gebouw en zijn omgeving. Mensen zullen zich, zeker in de avonduren, niet meer veilig voelen in de buurt van het leegstaande kantoorgebouw. Onderzoeksvraag en onderzoek Aangezien leegstand niet alleen problemen op gebouwniveau, maar ook op wijkniveau meebrengt is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: Hoe kan door middel van transformatie van een leegstaand kantoorpand in een woonwijk, de kwaliteit van de hele buurt verbeterd worden? Deze onderzoeksvraag is beantwoord aan de hand van een casus, het voormalig Eneco kantoor in Zuidwijk, Rotterdam Zuid. Er is onderzoek gedaan naar het gebouw en zijn omgeving, wat heeft geleid naar een programma van eisen voor een transformatieontwerp van dit leegstaande kantoorgebouw. Elk kantoorgebouw heeft zijn eigen verhaal, een eigen omgeving en daarmee een eigen opdracht. In dit onderzoek is er dan ook niet vanuit gegaan dat de casus spreekt voor alle leegstand in Nederland of Rotterdam. Het onderzoek in de omgeving van het gebouw is een belangrijk onderdeel van het proces dat bij elke opgave opnieuw uitgevoerd zal moeten worden. De methode van onderzoek kan bij soortgelijke opgaven wel gebruikt worden. In dit onderzoek is een wijkanalyse gemaakt, zijn interviews afgenomen en zijn de resultaten getoetst aan de hand van scenario’s, met elke een eigen functie en bijbehorend ontwerp. Literatuuronderzoek Mogelijkheden Leegstand Met een leegstaand kantoorpand zijn verschillende acties mogelijk, welke door de eigenaar uitgevoerd kunnen worden: afwachten, slopen, herstructureren, renoveren en restaureren of herbestemming en transformatie. Elke oplossing heeft voor-, maar ook nadelen. Dit zal per gebouw en omgeving verschillen. Het voormalig Eneco kantoor staat al enkele jaren leeg en zal niet meer verhuurd worden als kantoorfunctie. De omgeving is echter erg geschikt voor andere functies. Ook het gebouw zal hier goed voor te gebruiken zijn en daarom is er voor gekozen het gebouw niet te slopen, maar te transformeren. Betrokken partijen Bij een leegstaand gebouw zijn meestal veel partijen betrokken, zeker in een transformatie proces is het belangrijk dat alle partijen goed kunnen samenwerken. In dit onderzoeksrapport zijn de verschillende partijen benoemd en is aangegeven vanaf wanneer zij in het proces betrokken zullen zijn. De overheid is de laatste jaren druk bezig geweest met het vereenvoudigen van transformatieprocessen. Omdat de pandeigenaar vaak niet veel ervaring heeft met leegstand van zijn kantoorgebouw kan hij gebruik maken van een kennisorganisatie op het gebied van transformatieprocessen. Bij een transformatie komen een architect, een aannemer en eventueel een financier hem bijstaan. Een partij welke vaak wordt vergeten, maar heel belangrijk is in dit proces, is de buurtbewoner. Deze partij heeft kennis van de vraag uit de omgeving. Daarnaast zal deze partij met de nieuwe invulling van het gebouw moeten kunnen leven. De transformatie zal goed geslaagd zijn als deze financieel haalbaar is, maar ook in zijn omgeving past en gebruikt zal worden door onder andere de buurtbewoners. Mogelijke functies Bij een transformatie van een kantoorgebouw kan het gebouw naar veel verschillende nieuwe functies getransformeerd worden. In dit onderzoeksrapport zullen enkele veel voorkomende functies besproken worden. Voorbeelden hiervan zijn woningen, een zorginstelling, urban farming, kantoorruimte of onderwijs. Een voormalig kantoorgebouw kan vaak ook tot meerdere functies samen getransformeerd worden. In tijden van (economische) krimp kunnen groeiende functies het overschot aan ruimte opvullen. Casus Eneco kantoor Om de hoofdvraag in dit onderzoek te kunnen beantwoorden is het voormalig Eneco kantoor in Zuidwijk als casus gekozen. Locatie Zuidwijk Samen met Pendrecht en Lombardijen is Zuidwijk vlak na de tweede wereldoorlog ontwikkeld. De wijken zijn bedoeld als rustige woonplek voor de arbeiders, afgesloten van de drukke werkstad door middel van het Zuiderpark. Zuidwijk is ontworpen naar het oorspronkelijke concept van een tuinstad, gebaseerd op de ideale stad. In de wijk is veel groen te vinden en alle voorzieningen liggen langs de centrale wijkas, de Slinge, die doorloopt in Pendrecht. Tegenwoordig ligt tussen Zuidwijk en Pendrecht metrostation Slinge, welke de bereikbaarheid van de wijken vanuit de stad heeft bevorderd. De woningen in de tuinsteden zijn inmiddels verouderd en voldoen niet meer aan de huidige normen. Zowel in Pendrecht als in Zuidwijk zijn de woningcorporaties om deze reden de huizen aan het renoveren. De woningen in Zuidwijk vallen onder het beheer van Vestia. Door de financiële problemen waar Vestia sinds 2012 onder leidt, ligt in Zuidwijk de renovatie van de woningen al enkele jaren stil. Dit bevorderd het imago van de wijk niet. Gebouw Zuiderparkweg 300 Het voormalige Eneco kantoor is gelegen tegenover het metrostation Slinge, op de grens van Zuidwijk. Het gebouw is in 1968 in opdracht van de confectiefabrikant Hertzberger ontworpen door architecten bureau Kraaijvanger. Deze schone industrie zorgde voor werkgelegenheid in de wijk en bevatte ook een sociale werkplaats. In 1992 is het pand getransformeerd tot kantoorgebouw voor GJB, later Eneco. Het gebouw kreeg een nieuwe gevel en een extra verdieping. Tegenwoordig staat het gebouw al weer enige tijd leeg en is het toe aan een nieuwe transformatie. Het lijkt er in ieder geval op dat een bedrijf met kantoorfunctie niet meer geïnteresseerd is in dit gebouw op deze locatie. Gebiedsonderzoek Wijkanalyse Aan de hand van kaarten is een objectieve wijkanalyse gemaakt. Op deze kaarten zijn de verschillende voorzieningen aangegeven en is duidelijk gemaakt wat op dit moment aanwezig is in Zuidwijk. Zuidwijk kent vanuit het ontwerp veel ruimte, groen en water, wat nog steeds aanwezig is. Dit wordt in het beleid van de gemeente bewaakt. De wijk is goed bereikbaar, met de auto vanaf de Zuiderparkweg of met het openbaar vervoer. Het voormalig Eneco kantoor is tegenover metrostation Slinge gesitueerd. Zuidwijk en Pendrecht worden met elkaar verbonden door de Slinge. Langs deze weg zijn veel winkels gesitueerd. Ook de Larenkamp, het cultureel centrum van Zuidwijk ligt aan de Slinge. In Pendrecht en Zuidwijk zijn veel scholen gesitueerd, zowel basis- als middelbaar onderwijs. Ten slotte is er onderzoek gedaan naar het gebouw zelf met zijn knelpunten en potenties. Interviews betrokken partijen en buurtbewoners Partijen welke bij het gebouw, zijn omgeving, Zuidwijk of Pendrecht betrokken zijn, zijn geïnterviewd. Een belangrijke partij hierbij waren bijvoorbeeld ook de bewoners van Zuidwijk. Aan elke partij is gevraagd hoe Zuidwijk in het algemeen ervaren wordt, wat er positief en negatief aan de buurt is. Vervolgens werd ingezoomd op het probleem van het leegstaande kantoorgebouw. Ten slotte is gevraagd wat gedaan zou moeten worden aan dit probleem en wat er in het gebouw zou kunnen komen. Scenario vergelijking en keuze De onderzoeken zijn samengevat in drie verschillende, mogelijke scenario’s voor het voormalig Eneco kantoor.  Een short stay facility  Starterswoningen  Leer- werkbedrijf voor verschillende ambachten Deze verschillende scenario’s zijn vergeleken op basis van de financiële haalbaarheid en de gecreëerde maatschappelijke waarde. Ten slotte zijn de scenario’s als conclusie teruggekoppeld naar de buurtbewoners. Er is gediscussieerd over de functies en de ontwerpen. Zo kon gecontroleerd worden of het onderzoek goed geïnterpreteerd is en de mogelijke scenario’s konden worden aangescherpt. Er is uiteindelijk gekozen de starterswoningen en het leer- werkbedrijf te combineren. Dit heeft geresulteerd in een programma van eisen voor het transformatieontwerp van het voormalige Eneco kantoor in Zuidwijk. Programma van eisen Autokievit, een autogarage welke op het moment aan het leegstaande kantoorgebouw vastzit, zal losgekoppeld worden. Dit betekent dat de garage gesloopt zal worden en er een nieuw gebouw aan de Slinge voor de garage gebouwd zal worden. De Entree van Autokievit zal aan de Slinge worden gesitueerd, zodat de bewoners en gebruikers van het getransformeerde gebouw geen hinder zullen ondervinden van deze garage. Het kantoorgebouw zal op de verdiepingen getransformeerd worden naar starterswoningen. Hierbij zal onderscheid gemaakt worden tussen woningen voor de starter die vanuit zijn ouderlijk huis op zichzelf gaat wonen en woningen voor de starter met een partner en kind. De starter in Zuidwijk is erg jong, tussen de 18 en 24 jaar oud en heeft weinig te besteden. Belangrijk is dat de huur niet hoger dan  700 per maand zal zijn, zodat de bewoners huurtoeslag voor hun woning kunnen krijgen. De woningen zullen dus betaalbaar moeten zijn en daarom zal gelet worden op de kosten van de ingrepen en materialisatie van de transformatie. Het gebouw heeft nu een industrieel- zakelijke uitstraling, welke behouden wordt aangezien deze (emotionele) waarde heeft voor de buurt. De gevel heeft nu een neutrale kantooruitstraling. Deze geveluitstraling past niet bij de nieuwe functie van het gebouw en zal daarom wel veranderd worden. De bewoners van het pand willen zich namelijk kunnen identificeren met hun woning en zich hier thuis voelen. De bewoners willen vanaf buiten kunnen zien waar hun woning in het gebouw is gesitueerd. Ook de gevel zal daarom differentiatie kennen. Het gebouw heeft op het moment een energielabel F. Om aan de energie-eisen te voldoen zal het gebouw verbeterd worden voor minimaal een energielabel B. De woningcorporaties, welke opdrachtgever zullen zijn voor de woningen, zijn hiertoe verplicht bij renovatieprojecten. Dit kan gedaan worden door onder andere de gevel beter te isoleren. Ook kan apparatuur gebruikt worden om duurzame energie op te wekken. Dit zal ook de maandelijkse kosten voor de bewoners naar beneden brengen. Op de begane grond zullen voorzieningen geplaatst worden die gerelateerd zijn aan de starter. Op het moment zit op de hoek van het gebouw ‘de Slinger’. Dit is een bedrijfsverzamelgebouw, waar door middel van cursussen en het begeleiden naar een gezonde levensstijl mensen de arbeidsmarkt op gebracht worden. De Slinger verwijst zijn klanten door naar een fitnesscentrum, een gezond restaurant en ruimte voor startende ondernemers. Deze functies zullen allemaal op de begane grond van het gebouw gevestigd worden. Zo zal het gebouw een geheel blijven, met meerdere functies. Het gebouw zal weer energie genereren, in en rond het gebouw. De nieuwe functies in het voormalige kantoorgebouw zijn niet alleen rendabel, maar passen ook goed in het gebouw. Ten slotte zijn ook de buurtbewoners blij met de nieuwe functies in hun omgeving.","Leegstand; Kantoren; Starterswoningen; Zuidwijk; Enecokantoor; Rotterdam; Veldacademie","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Veldacademie","",""

(mentor); Van den Hende, E.A. (mentor)","2014","The high speed at which innovations nowadays succeed each other calls for a different approach towards innovation in order to stay ahead of competition. Open Innovation; the purposive use of in- and outflows of knowledge to accelerate internal innovation and expand the markets for external use of innovation, has therefore widely been adopted in many different industries. It allows for leveraging capabilities outside the company in order to enhance and accelerate innovation activities and consequently deliver more highly innovative products and services, faster. HEINEKEN has also acknowledged the value of Open Innovation (OI) and has made it one of the key strategic pillars for the company in the coming years. In order to properly leverage Open Innovation, the wide variety of opportunities and various possible collaborative partners need to be explored. This report contributes to this exploration by looking into how win-win relationships can be established between corporates and young ventures. Young ventures, a category name for both start-up and scale-up companies, are considered to be a very interesting target group as they are often at the forefront of (technology) innovation. However, the significant difference in size is expected to reflect in a difference in benefits, needs and approaches in relationships between corporates such as HEINEKEN and young ventures. Bridging the gap between corporates and young ventures is therefore the focus of this project, in order to define a way to creating win-win alliances. Furthermore, providing a structured approach towards these alliances was desired and resulted in the following assignment: Design a framework for scouting and setting up win-win OI relationships for HEINEKEN and its potential partners, using knowledge and experiences from corporates and young ventures. A deep dive into theory and practice by means of literature studies and semi-structured interviews with corporates and companies in the start-up and scale-up environment has resulted in a rich amount of data and insights. These insights were structured using the Want, Find, Get, Manage model by Slowinski (2005), which identifies four main steps in setting up OI collaborations. The need for a thorough want-phase was identified as a key driver in setting up a focused and efficient approach. Elaborating on the desired capabilities of a prospected partner was deemed key in defining the aptitude of young ventures as a partner. The type of project and desired content furthermore define in which channels are considered most fitting to scout for young ventures in the Find phase. In the consecutive Get phase it is key to focus on creating mutual value between the two partiers. In aligning objectives the impact on young ventures of certain things like exclusivity agreements should be considered. Regular revisions of the agreement are necessary in order to keep agreements aligned with the volatile project scope. Furthermore, many issues can to be attributed to a significant difference in company-culture. The strategy-driven corporate has an entirely different way of working compared to the opportunity-driven young venture, often resulting in miscommunication, misinformation and a lack of understanding between the two parties. These cultural differences should be identified during the deal-making phase and should be continuously managed throughout the collaboration. By applying best practices from the young venture’s way of working to the corporate practices, a higher level of understanding is created between the two parties. Furthermore, doing this is likely to have a positive impact on innovation practices within the corporate. The framework proposed in this report addresses the main issues that impact OI relationships between corporates and young ventures. Furthermore, it offers a focused approach by proposing steps in identifying needs, objectives and proposing the appropriate channels to scout for young ventures. Additionally, it offers a guideline in setting up and managing relationships with young ventures from a corporate perspective. The framework is tailored to fit HEINEKEN’s Global Innovation Process, which makes it easy to understand and implement in innovation practices within the company. An insight that is elaborated on is the need for knowledge management of the personal networks of individuals within the company. Many relations seem to be drawn from personal networks that are intangible and undocumented. Providing insight into the vast amount of connections that exist throughout all individual networks collectively allows for a more efficient process in searching for suitable project partners. A smartphone application is proposed to facilitate easy documentation of contacts, which is shared between selected scouts within the company. This app hereby answers a need in the Find phase of the OI process and supports the purpose of the presented framework: a focused and efficient scouting approach towards win-win relationships with young ventures.","Open Innovation; Innovation management; Heineken; corporates; young ventures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

The proposed approach is a three stage process which allows for different configurations of existing matching techniques and user expertise. An experiment is set up in order to compare different Question Routing configurations. In total thirteen different configurations are evaluated, all based on three different content-based baseline methods.

The creditor and the debtor are two sides to the same medal; one cannot exist without the other. The different manifestations of the system of finance are a reflection of the different relations between the creditor and the debtor. The creditor-debtor relation is now an impersonal one, reduced to a business transaction; the creditor is institutionalized and is protected. The aspects of the impersonal, institutionalized, creditor are amassed in the Central Bank. Aspects of the creditor, with the Dutch Central Bank as it physical representation, are summarized, collapsed into a building, a building that represents their ongoing power, protecting the creditor from any possible doubt. The aim of the project is not to change the nature of the Dutch Central Bank and the banking system, by now almost purely representational, but to make it explicit. The condition of indebtedness is widespread; we are all debtors. The Dutch population holds one of the highest private debts in the Eurozone and its total private debt surpasses corporate debt. The debtor must inspire trust in his solvency, his ability to fulfill future payments, his accountability and responsibility. As debt has come to involve everyone it refers to no one in particular. An absence of representation represents this condition. Aspects of the debtor are reflected in a public square, a public space, where one, by appearing in public is available for the scrutiny of others, in a sense the essence of the indebted condition. To attempt to collapse the characteristics of the indebted into a building or a certain program would be to deny this condition, to deny its widespread existence, it would deny the fact that debt has indiscriminately involved everyone. The uncertain, undetermined space of the public square reflects the boundless condition of the indebted an antithesis to the enclosed space opposing it. The lobby is the place of intersection between creditor and debtor, a place of representation for the creditor, a place of accountability for the debtor. It is the place where both conditions come together and dissolve into one, the lobby as the central space of the Central Bank allows the debtor to penetrate into the territory of the creditor.","Bank; Creditor; Debtor; Finance; Amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-30","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Explore Lab","",""

Right between the campus area and the inner city an area is available that shows great potential in hosting a great variety of functions to support that cause. The development of that area has stagnated and is currently mainly driven by one single actor. When more actors would be motivated to be involved in the development of this area, it could form a very strong spatial link between the local knowledge economy and the facilities of the city centre. Also liveability (by creating shared spaces) and sustainability (by water treatment and raising awareness) would be improved. To get these actors committed, it is important that an urbanist translates their wishes and requirements. By cleverly integrating them and showing the potential of collaboration, he or she becomes a very useful catalyst for the quality of the whole area and its surroundings.","urban regeneration; campus; university cities; knowledge economy; urbanism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Urban Regeneration","","52.008139, 4.369691"

(mentor)","2014","Atmospheric entry is a process defined by extremes, from the great velocity at the point of entry to the high deceleration loads and aerodynamic heating in the lower layers of the atmosphere. In addition to the vehicle maintaining structural integrity, an equally important aspect of the re-entry mission is safety. This safety can only be guaranteed if the vehicle is controllable throughout the re-entry process. Mission design plays a role in adhering to operational and safety requirements in the form of trajectory planning: the development of a re-entry trajectory wherein the vehicle remains within its operational constraints and is controllable throughout. The focus of this thesis lies on the design-time trajectory development part of mission design, i.e., the development and analysis of feasible trajectories under certain requirements to be flown for a specific mission. The research goal of this thesis is formulated as follows: to what extent can optimal re-entry trajectories be developed in the design-time phase of mission development for a winged entry vehicle that provide a maximum-range capability under the objective of minimizing heat loads and adhering to operational constraints? To answer this question, a mission design tool is developed in four successive stages: 1) Development of the re-entry simulator, 2) Design of the guidance algorithm, 3) Development of the mission planner, and 4) Mission planner testing. The capacity to quickly and reliably simulate re-entry trajectories is paramount to a mission planner. For this purpose, a simulator was developed with the specific goal of later integration with the mission planner. Steering is achieved by modulating the vehicle’s attitude in terms of its angle of attack and bank angle. The guidance profile is based on the specification of attitude commands at specific points in the trajectory related to the instantaneous energy of the vehicle. The course of an entire trajectory can be specified by its guidance profile. The purpose of the mission planner is to develop guidance profiles for trajectories that keep the vehicle within its operational constraints, minimize the heat load, and provide the largest possible range under these conditions. The objectives of minimum heat load and maximum range are conflicting. Trajectories with minimum heat load requirements are generally short in duration with smooth heat flux profiles where the heat flux is maintained close to its constraint value. The total heat load is minimized by keeping the duration of the re-entry as short as possible. This, however, is in direct opposition to the objective of maximizing range, where keeping the vehicle aloft for as long as possible is beneficial. The mission planner develops trajectories by specifying the individual parameters in this guidance profile by performing multiobjective optimization to determine the combinations of parameters that result in optimal trajectories in terms of the mission objectives. The mission planner consistently provides a set of optimal trajectories over a diverse range of objective values and under the provision that operational constraints are met. Optimal trajectories are determined based on these conflicting objectives over a range of objective values, wherein the relative priorities of the objectives are varied. In all cases is the mission planner able to provide trajectories with an extended- range capability, even when minimizing the heat load is considered the main priority.","Re-entry; Guidance; Optimization; Mission planning; Trajectories","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Astrodynamics and Space Missions","","","",""

After research to transformable architecture, passive heating and passive cooling I was able to make a toolbox for making a transformable house that uses passive energy. To use that toolbox I made twelve different kind of outdoor weather situations. For every situation I used the toolbox to create the best configuration of the transformable building. Which had led to the basic requirements of my building. After this process I was able to design my first basic building which I will develop in the rest of my graduation year. This research will be a toolbox how to use transformable architecture, passive solar power, wind & thermal mass in your design and in which situation.

(mentor); Van Der Meel, H. (mentor); Cavallo, R. (mentor)","2014","Introduction My graduation project is about the lakeside development in South Chicago. Chicago Southworks was home to the previous US steel manufacturing plant. About 20 000 thousand people worked and lived at south side. The mill started to decline in the 70 ties because of the shifting market for steel. US steel closed his doors in 1992. The site has lost about 20 000 people, 40 percent of its population. The 20000 people are gone. The impact of the shutdown of the steel industry is still visible in the South side neighborhood, but the spirit of the manufacturing still runs through the neighborhood of south Chicago. The long abandoned site contains of 227 ha empty land is a potential area for e new development. The Goal of the studio is to create a strategy for the site. It includes a long term vision and a proposal for the first program. The strategy is based on urban analysis of the neighborhood and the city of Chicago. The assignment is to determine a new program and design the first intervention on the site. My strategy was to start a new development that will help the revitalization of the neighborhood and attract new people to the site. I will try to bring people back to the site with a new industry. This industry will focus on a new generation: The SMART Community! The new industry will focus on the growing number of creative’s, students and entrepreneurial engineers. South works will transform to a ‘Start-up Hub’ for small technology firms. The program of the building is a Technology Center. The building will be the first project on the site. This building will have a relation with a wide social context. The building will be a place of adventure and discovery. People will be introduced to the digital world and understand the technology that is surrounding them. The technology center will have a public and a private program. The building will help to create an interaction between the public visitors and the professional user who work in the building. It is important to use all the good qualities of the site: the water, the ORE walls, landscape and the existing infrastructure. The building will have a fluent relationship with this context. Visibility is a very important key to represent the program of the building.","Southworks; Chicago; Lakeside; Ore Wall; Technology Center; ETFE; Exhibition; Diagrid structure; U.S. Steel; Midwest; Urban analysis; masterplan; Education; Complex Projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Complex Projects","",""

(mentor); Groenleer, M. (mentor); Pieters, W. (mentor)","2014","Cyber-crime is a large problem for society. OftenA botnet is used to for cybercrime. An infected machine is infected with a bot, this bot communicates with its controller. Other machines are infected with the same bot, which communicates with the same controller. These infected machines together form a zombie army of machines: the botnet. It is estimated that 10% of all computers is infected with malware at any point in time. A bot on a machine can be removed. Enforcing better security would help here. Security comes at a cost and requires specific knowledge. Generally there can be two groups: 1) People with knowledge and resources about security and 2) People without knowledge and resources about security. The first group (usually larger companies), with knowledge has to determine which security measures to invest in, usually this group is aware of botnets. The second group (smaller organizations and the home consumer), without knowledge; the issue with regard to botnets is that this group does not have the knowledge to determine if they are infected. For many end users it is therefore difficult to determine 1) if they are infected and 2) how to mitigate the infection. The end user accesses the internet via the ISP from which they “buy their internet”. This means that all the internet traffic from an end user is going via the ISP. The ISPs are in an ideal position to mitigate the problem of botnets; the ISP can determine who is sending out what kind of traffic. This knowledge makes ISPs are a good candidate to mitigate the botnet problem. By law ISPs have to do something about this problem, but it is unspecified how much. These ISPs could mitigate botnet activity of their customers i.e. by informing end users or in a more radical situation shutting down connections until the user’s bot is cleaned up. ISPs are aware of the problem and are working on it, but their incentives are not aligned towards botnet mitigation. Contacting customers is costly, the law is vague as it specifies only an effort has to be made: the negative incentives. ISPs do face costs if they have infected users, since botnet traffic increases the amount of bandwidth they have to provide. If an ISP hosts a lot of infected machines, other ISPs could be affected by it and force the ISP to “clean-up”, in practice this does not happen often. These incentives in favor of mitigation are in place, but they are much lower than the incentives for not mitigating. The result of the incentives for ISPs is that they are contacting some customers, but with many ISPs this only is a very small fraction of the actual infected machines they host. ISPs operate in a competitive market and are susceptible to brand damage. They fear that it becomes publicly known how they are doing number wise on infected machines. For this reason reputation based on the bot infected machines ISPs hosts was researched. Such a system also has an advantage for ISPs, it helps to create awareness among people. Such awareness could make their mitigation efforts easier. First by mapping the current situation regarding botnets, Internet Service Providers and the market of ISPs. Second, since a reputation system has to be developed, the concepts of reputation and reputation systems were researched. By researching reputation in the context of ISPS design criteria for a reputation system were created. Two possible designs have also been identified from these design criteria.","Botnet mitigation; Internet Service Provider; incentive; reputation; reputation system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-12-06","Technology, Policy and Management","POLG","","SEPAM","",""

This study finds that characteristics that are of influence are: 'Number of partners', 'Collaboration', 'Clearly defined roles and scope', 'Good project management', 'Number of SMEs', 'having partners from the value-chain' and 'involving the end user'. The findings from this study suggest that for commercialization the technology used in the project should be limited in scope and mature enough at the start for commercialization of project results to be likely.

The effective support of the NPMLE can be reduced to a set of disjoint so-called maximal intersection intervals. One feature of the NPMLE that is sometimes described as unsatisfactory is that, with most data sets, several of the estimated probabilities are equal to zero, implicitly inducing an ordering between overlapping intervals and leaving the user with a rather coarse estimate of the CDF. We attempt to overcome this problem by focusing on the natural interval order the censored data describe. A Precedence Probability Matrix (PPM) for the data can be constructed, an object that uses information about all the possible orderings within the interval order. By estimating the true PPM – in itself a non-trivial task – and penalising the nonparametric log-likelihood for deviations from the data’s true PPM, smoother estimates of the CDF that better represent the possible ordering of the data can be acquired.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Statistics","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(mentor)","2014","Stock market prediction has been a research topic for decades; recently, efforts to increase the accuracy by including data from social media like Google and Twitter received a lot of attention. Social media can be regarded as indicator for sentiments and sentiments are known to influence the stock market. Current models lack interpretation; it is difficult to determine what data is relevant for stock market prediction, since there is an abundance of social media data. A regression method that induces sparsity is thus required; data that is not useful is discarded automatically. The LASSO induces sparsity via L1-regularization; however, the covariance and confidence of the found regression coefficients cannot be derived easily, while this is important for interpretation. This thesis therefore reviews all known methods for approximating the covariance and confidence interval for the LASSO and determines their accuracy using numerical simulations. A new method is proposed based on the Unscented Transform, which outcompetes all methods in the underdetermined scenario, where there are more features than data points. Unfortunately, linear regression via the LASSO has limited use for stock markets as the achieved prediction accuracy is low. Nonlinear models are often applied for stock market prediction to achieve higher accuracies. Therefore a new feature selection method is proposed for the nonlinear Support Vector Regression (SVR) to select the correct data for stock market prediction using the SVR. This method yields accurate feature selection when the number of features to select from is low.","L1 regularization; LASSO; SVR; covariance; stock market; prediction; feature selection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); Mul, E.J.T. (mentor); Aarts, K. (mentor)","2014","Insects can be alternative source of nutrients in various parts of the food-chain, as feed for livestock but also human consumption. However, the acceptation of insects as a source of nutrients is low. Insects are in no way a part of western culture except when they are a pest. Insects do play a vital role in upcoming developments such as urban farming. This research describes how insects can add value to urban farming. Project goals were made explicit as a guiding and selective tool. To define search area’s, expert interviews were done with urban farming practitioners. The urban farming context was explored with the use of nature inspired design, a method developed at TU Delft to help designers create product-service systems that benefit their direct environments. A brand analysis of the company gave brand requirements and brand guidelines that were used as boundary conditions of what the final result must be and can be. Trough a combination of NID, market, brand, urban farming and insect requirements and guidelines, the search area of bio-coverters was defined. Bio-coverters based on insects have numerous benefits to urban farming by up-cycling waste streams into high-grade nutrients and compost. Four concepts were developed within the search area. The selection process was two-fold: a rating against requirements and guidelines and a rating against project goals. The highest rated concept was chosen and based on growing black soldier fly larvae on organic wast materials from the urban farm and foodscraps from the urban residence. The larvae are a source of animal-based protein and lipids which can replace the meaty diet of carnivorous animals. The focus was on dogs that get fresh meat diets. They consume excessive amounts of meat (an average dog consumes almost twice the amount of meat compared to an average human). Experts on field of pets were interviewed in order to gain insights into the needs and wishes of the target group. These insights were then tested with a questionnaire for a focus group (people with dogs). This questionnaire had 165 respondents, of which 59 were located strongly- urbanized environments. Of this last group, more than half indicate there is no municipality green waste pickup. An average dog in this group gets about 400gr of fresh meat per day and more than 50% practices a form of urban farming. The concept was developed to be a community driven design. In this way, a community facilitated by the company can develop, improve, test and maintain the product. Modules for monitoring can be developed and added. The community is also able to adapt design parameters to individual users needs. This evolutionary aspect is in line with life’s principles (a basic paradigm from the nature inspired design method. The design makes use of readily available resources (such as surplus thermal energy, standard glass jars, standard fasteners and standard piece of wood). The final proposal was designed to be low in effort and maintenance. High-effort actions have to be taken once a week. Every day operation includes feeding the system (similarly like a trash bin). A prototype was tested with a user that fits the prospected target group. The user indicated that the design was easy to understand and increased her comfort of having insects in her home. The object felt (although manufactured with FDM technology) as a high quality product. A functional test with the final 3D printed prototype was conducted over 5 days with appropriate age larvae.

(mentor); Visser, H.G. (mentor)","2014","The aviation sector has suffered a big blow from the series of recent economic depressions. Airlines are struggling to stay in business and are looking for multiple ways to cut on expenses. This has led to the initiation of studies to find strategies which will reduce an airline’s overall fuel consumption. One of these methods is to initiate intermediate refueling stop operations on long-haul flights. This means that instead of flying with a fully fueled aircraft from e.g., Amsterdam to Tokyo, the route is split into two or more segments which are flown with the appropriate amount of fuel and possibly even different aircraft types more suitable for shorter range flight. By developing a novel computer model, this research aims at finding the answers to the following questions:  What are the fuel consumption- and emission savings that can be attained by implementing this model on specific routes and with specific aircraft types?  What are the route requirements to optimally benefit from operating flights with intermediate refueling stops?  Which costs are directly linked to introducing refueling stops, what are the consequences and what can be done to reduce these costs?  How does this concept influence the airport groundside operations and what is the impact on the airport infrastructure? The model consists of two independent programs which work in cohesion to find the optimal stopover airport for a specific route operated by a specific aircraft. The first program is the aircraft model, which is capable of calculating the fuel consumption on a specific mission. The calculations are based on the fundamentals of flight and the equations of motion. In total three aircraft types are incorporated and together cover short-, medium- and long range operations. The second program is the route model which is able to identify the costs for a specific segment and determines the optimal route by use of a modified version of the Dijkstra Algorithm and an airport database of ILS Cat. II/III equipped airports. This model computes a buffer zone in which to look for intermediate stop airports and selects the most advantageous option, based on local waiting times, landing- and navigation fees and fuel prices. The results show that on routes suitable for intermediate stop operations, the fuel reduction ranges from 5% - 10%. For the total cost reduction, these values are around 2% - 4% per flight. These figures strongly depend on the mission conditions and stopover position. Besides the fuel price and stopover time, the wind velocity and direction also have a vital role in the feasibility of the concept.","Aviation; Fuel Consumption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Operations","","Air Transport and Aerospace Operations","",""

(mentor); Van Dalen, K. (mentor); Kolstein, M.H. (mentor); Paulissen, J.H. (mentor); Vrouwenvelder, A.C.W.M. (mentor)","2014","In structural design there is a tendency towards more slender and challenging architectural structures. Footbridges become more slender with an increasing high ratio live load to dead weight. A consequence of this increased slenderness of footbridges in an increased susceptibility to human-induced vibrations. The evaluation of the serviceability of footbridges therefore becomes more important. The first aim of this study was to provide a good basis and overview of the critical aspects in the evaluation of human-induced vibrations in footbridges. From a literature study, the discussions with engineering companies and an impact study it became clear that there are four critical aspects particularly relevant for further study at the moment: vandal loading, structural damping,additional mass and damping by pedestrians and probability of occurrence of accelerations and the consequences for comfort of the pedestrians. The second part of this study was focused on the question whether a probability-based approach can demonstrate that the Eurocode is conservative in the evaluation of human-induced vibrations in footbridges. Hereto, a probability-based analysis has been performed for the vibration serviceability of footbridges and implemented in a case study with three simply supported footbridges. Instead of looking at the maximum acceleration that is expected for the bridge deck, the accelerations which individual pedestrians experience when crossing the bridge have been investigated. Four scenarios have been compared to the approach prescribed by the Eurocode. The pedestrian loading has been modeled based on two assumptions for the scenarios: scenarios based on densities of the pedestrian ?ow and scenarios based on group formation. The conducted research based on assumptions for the pedestrian traf?c and a ?xed criterion for human comfort, has given valuable insight in the use of a more realistic evaluation of human-induced vibrations in footbridges. This insight has been obtained for the incoming pedestrian traf?c and the exposure to vibrations for individual pedestrians. The adopted probability-based approach contributes to demonstrate potential conservatism in the Eurocode regarding the evaluation of human-induced vibrations in footbridges.","human-induced; vibrations; structural engineering; structural dynamics; vertical pedestrian loading; probability-based approach; pedestrian bridge; footbridge; acceleration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Mechanics","",""

(mentor)","2014","Following the success of open access rainfall products based on earth observation data, similar global products are now under development for actual evapotranspiration. In this research, seven prototype evapotranspiration products based on MODIS and geostationary satellites were compared for the Nile basin. They include the special MOD16 version of the Nile basin, SEBS, SSEBSop, ALEXI, GLEAM, LSA-SAF and CMRSET. Most datasets are not yet released, and are in their testing phase before being disseminated to a wide audience. These remotely sensed ET products are fundamentally different in their parameterizations, ranging from reference ET based fractions products to two-layer turbulent transfer schemes for sensible and latent heat. Furthermore the used spectral radiances vary widely from near-infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance to thermal infrared and microwaves emissions. This study covers the time span 2005 -2010 for the Nile basin. The independent validation datasets are based on flux towers and augmented with water balances of catchments and subbasins of the Nile system. Significant differences between the different evapotranspiration products are observed both on subbasin and field scale. A comparison based on land-use class shows that for some land-use classes the estimation of the varies products correspond whereas for other land-use classes the differences between the products is substantial. The different input data and different parameterization of the ET products, together with the large observed differences in ET values for certain land-classes and areas, calls for an ensemble product. A set of ET products based on different level of physics and spectral data is the necessary basis for creating an ensemble ET product. The validation reveals that using an ensemble product instead of a single remote sensing evapotranspiration product yields more reliable and consistent results when compared on a subbasin and basin level. Three ensemble products have been proposed and evaluated in this study: A mean product, an ensemble product based on land-class selection and an ensemble product based on outlier statistics. The ensemble mean product based on land-use class selection is a logical solution because it recognizes that not all ET products have an equally good performance for various land surface conditions. Although all proposed ensemble products show better results when compared to subbasin water-balances, more research is needed to further formulate the best ensemble ET product.","ET; remote sensing; MOD16; SSEBop; USGS; ALEXI; CMRSET; LSA-SAF; GlobCover; Inter-comparison","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-01-31","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","","0, 20"

(mentor); Mahlich, S. (mentor)","2014","This thesis deals with traffic forecasts of Airspace Users for Air Navigation Service Providers. Currently there is a high amount of uncertainty in the traffic forecast. Air Traffic Flow Managers anticipate for unforeseen traffic by increasing the forecasted maximum capacity threshold by more than 10%. The European ATM research program SESAR aims ultimately to reduce the difference between the forecast and real maximum capacity threshold by less than 3%. Prediction uncertainty results in sector over-load and sub-optimal traffic flow in the air transportation system. The objective of this thesis is to investigate sector demand predictability by quantification of the difference between real and forecast traffic, and evaluate the predictability improvement by improvement of departure time predictions. Statistical analysis is performed by plotting time & count uncertainty against look-ahead time to sector entry. On a busy day, for a look-ahead time of 2 hours and longer, flights have a higher probability to be delayed than to be earlier as planned. A comparison is made between the forecast and real number of flights entering a sector for a given time of day window. Looking at the forecast time period, it can be seen that some forecasted flights did not enter in the window anymore (out), and some additional flights entered in the window that were initially not forecasted (in). `In' and `out' flights can be explained due to flights being earlier or delayed, or flights deviating from the planned route. Looking at 10 minutes before entry, about 30% to 40% are in/out flights, which is a large amount. In general, for a look-ahead of 0 to 3 hours, there are more `out' than `in' flights resulting in an over-prediction. Over-prediction means that there are more flights anticipated than really entered for a given time window. In order to reduce over-prediction, it is suggested, taking safety into account, to reduce the number of `out' flights that deviate from the planned route. For a high capacity Maastricht Upper Area Control sector on a normal day, a 5% decrease of these `out' flights, reduces the over-prediction by 10%. Furthermore, flight phases that are major causes of uncertainty are descent, taxi and the slot allocation process. A departure time prediction improvement of 50% results in 20% arrival time error reduction, and 30% mean sector entry time error reduction, for a 6 hour look-ahead time. The used sensitivity method does not yield realistic sector occupancy count because the effect of changed ATC procedures due to improved predictability is not incorporated.","arrival time; sector demand; predictability; prediction error; prediction accuracy; trajectory prediction; departure time; demand forecast; prediction uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Operations","","Air Transport and Operations","",""

(mentor); Silvester, S. (mentor)","2014","The goal of this project was to develop a new type of vehicle that shows a fit in smart’s future product portfolio. The idea of developing a vehicle smaller than the existing smart fortwo arose from developments in the market and society. Throughout the whole automotive industry it is agreed that there is an increasing mismatch between existing vehicles and increasingly urbanizing cities. Few car manufacturers already respond to these developments by creating so-called microcars. Since the timeframe of this project was set out for 2025, one should first understand how mobility needs will change. Perhaps a simple copy of current microcars does not show a fit with these needs. Due to this the method of Vision in Product design was chosen, in order to provide a clear understanding on this changing context and thus future human needs. The domain for the project was defined as individual mobility in European metropolises of 2025. The project starts with a deconstruction of the smart brand, in order to get a good understanding how the design can fit within the product portfolio of smart since it unveils the true values of the smart brand. The second phase of the Vision in Product design method covers the construction phase. The goal of this phase is to create a vision based on constructed future context. After a thorough research all defined context factors were clustered into ten different clusters. Subsequently a coherence was shaped that led to the definition of the three meta-factors or ‘pillars’, that have the biggest impact on individual mobility in urban areas in the future context. Since not all needs can be covered, a direction was chosen that showed the best fit with the smart brand. This eventually led to the definition of the vision, which is embodied by three elements. Mission statement smart wants people to enrich their commute by letting them shape or transform their perception of the environment around them & facilitate them to shift between those two strategies when desired Interaction The interaction between the user and the environment is most important ands can be described as browsing the world wide web. The interaction the user has with the product should be like your personal second skin. Product To fulfill the desired interaction the product qualities are defined as positively open, neutral simplicity & empowering intelligence. The vision lays the foundation for the design, which can be broken down in two parts. First the ‘software’ is designed, meaning that the interaction is designed the user has with the environment and the product without thinking about concrete technologies. This is subsequently translated into a concrete design starting from the inside out, focussing on the user. The embodiment is accomplished step-by-step, putting the most important elements prior. The end of the project focusses on the styling of the vehicle.","smart; design; mobility; individual; vehicle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2016-12-12","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

The current net metering policy has an uncertain future and net metering takes away the time dependent, system critical, component of the balance of demand and supply for prosumers. An integrated transaction cost theory and market design method is used to analyze the problems in the sector and design market design options to mitigate those problems. This is done by exploring whether the reversed discriminating alignment hypothesis could be applied to this research: instead of matching governance structures to transactions attributes, turning this around and change transaction attributes to match the already defined governance structure of the electricity market. Technical and contractual solutions were found that adapt the individual transaction attributes to let them match with the governance structure of the market. The individual solutions were then composed into three market design options. The market design options are evaluated by means of their impact on the problems that resulted from the transaction cost analysis. The results are compared to the requirements following from interviews in field research. The market design option called ‘It’s all in the bundle’, making use of real time tariffs to steer demand, in house storage and an exclusive contract with one supplier with a bundle structure, turned out to be the preferred market design option. Future research should, first, take the direction of further developing the integrated transaction cost theory and market design method and could explore if this integration is also possible with other theories. Secondly it should be defined, in both theoretical and practical sense, what the possibilities, constraints and complexities following from the reverse discriminating alignment hypothesis are, that were not described by Williamson. Lastly the resulting market design should be fine-tuned by taking into account more system features such as consumer acceptance and production costs and complementing this research with other theoretical perspectives.","Transaction cost theory; Electricity market design; Prosumers; PV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of infrastructures","","Energy & Industry","",""

The information, consisting of reports, papers, maps, presentations and websites, was used to estimate the potential amount of wastewater in the sewer system of Urban Maputo. This wastewater could be available for reuse in Maputo, at the WWTP, being this the main purpose of the project “Sustainable freshwater supply in urbanizing Maputo, Mozambique” led by TU Delft, UNESCO-IHE and the Mozambican University UEM.<br/>The sewer network consists of system one and system two. System one was built by the Portuguese in the 40s as a drainage system, but nowadays it functions as a combined sewer and it discharges directly into the bay. System two, built by DHV, a Dutch consultancy firm, in the 80s consists of sewer lines, a WWTP and two pumping stations. These pumping stations are also supposed to pump a part of the water of system one to the WWTP. However, because of sand in the pipes the pumping stations are not being operated.<br/>The billed amount of drinking water was used to calculate the flow in systems one and two. These data were obtained per neighbourhood and multiplied by 0.8, a guideline in Maputo for the amount of drinking water ending up in the sewers. For the water flowing in the sewer network, three cases are estimated, the actual status, system two completely working and the total volume of system one and two. The actual flow into the WWTP is 3957 m3/day with 20,665 m3/day being directly discharged into the bay. If the pumping stations of system two were operating, 10,266 m3/day would flow to the WWTP and 14,357 m3/day would be directed into the bay (Figure 1). By measuring the amount of influent at the WWTP, using the existing Venturi meter, the calculations were validated. The measurements show a flow arriving to the WWTP in the order of the magnitude of the calculations .This influent is generated by approximately 38,000 users that are connected to the sewer system.<br/><br/>The sewer network of Maputo has a few critical parts which should be repaired as soon as possible, and better maintained in the future. First of all the pumping station of system two should be turned on. Before this is possible the sand in the sewers in front pumping station two must be removed and the pipes should stay clean. Sand and plastic bags ends up in the sewer system through drains or open manholes. To overcome clogging, drains and manholes have to be better maintained.<br/>Another recommendation is to collect the wastewater being discharged by system one and convey it to the existing WWTP or to a new one. The municipality has plans for this but lacks financing.<br/>All the water which is collected by system two is conveyed to the WWTP, but the WWTP is not functioning well. There is white slime in the effluent and colourful tarnish, which is a sign of bacteria being present in the effluent. The effluent is either directly used for irrigation of crops, which poses a risk for human health, or directed to the estuary.<br/>At the moment there are detailed plans to introduce a sanitation fee, which is necessary to improve, operate and maintain the system.

(mentor)","2014","Summary: The need for vision guided mobile robotics is becoming more apparent, however it is proven to be troublesome to stabilize its vision. For two legged robots, it is, during motion, even more difficult than for wheeled robots to be able to perceive the world around it. Finding a stabilization method which is able to reduce the motion blur while walking is essential. Inspiration can be found within the human body itself. The cerebellum is a brain area which is highly involved with stabilization in general, and numerous neurological research has been done by studying stabilizing eye movements. The cerebellum is responsible for adaption within the vestibular ocular reflex (VOR), compensatory eye movements which directly act on signals from the vestibular organ. An active binocular vision based robotic setup will be used to implement this cerebellar model with an inertia sensor, functioning as the “vestibular organ”. During the previous literature survey, several cerebellar models were found to be suitable for implementation, however they do not match the recent neurological discoveries. During this research, two kinds of cerebellar models will be implemented, one existing model and one extended to recent neurological research. Both models will be built using a self learning neural network and will be evaluated by the detected movement within the image. While experimenting with these models, the robotic head will receive both rotational as translational disturbance to simulate the sensation of motion. The cerebellar model will learn to predict the sensory consequence (the optical flow) of the combined control of the inertia sensor and the tracking system and creates a motor input signal which can counter that movement. This results in the robotic head stabilizing its vision better, while it is on the move.","active camera stabilization; cerebellar-inspired model; optical flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-01-15","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Kamp, L.M. (mentor); Van Beers, C.P. (mentor)","2014","There are 4 billion people with income less than $3000 per year, which belong to the Base of Pyramid (BoP) market segment. These people share similar characteristics such as experiencing health problems, lack of education and poor living conditions. This state is realized by several entrepreneurs as potential business opportunities, which come in form of technology solutions such as solar lanterns, drinking-water purifiers, and biomass cook stoves. Through the provision of these technologies, entrepreneurs focusing on the BoP aim at getting profit, while at the same time consciously provide technologies that can solve the aforementioned issues. On the other hand, even though there is an increasing trend and influx of investment by these social enterprises, many companies still find it difficult to scale their solution to the poor. For example, many technologies are only sold in constrained geographic markets and unable to be replicated to other markets or regions to achieve an appropriate scale of business. Thus, the research aims to understand on how technology firms focusing on BoP can solve the barriers of scaling and implementing niche strategies to grow their business. To understand the matter, the research will identify and analyze barriers, strategies and also the linkage between them. In addition, the research also establishes the relative importance of each barrier and strategy that is relevant in the BoP market. From the research, it is understood that the issue of scaling from these BoP companies can be approached by using niche concept. Niche is defined as an application of technology to small number of people that precedes the diffusion of these products to a mass-market. The approach is known to be used for analyzing technology introduction in the western market. This research aims to extend the application of the niche concept in the new field at the BoP. The research is conducted in three steps; the first phase is the theoretical gap identification from the previous studies of strategic niche management, high-technology diffusion and BoP literatures. Second phase is the identification on barriers and strategies, in which a draft list of barriers and strategies is identified and validated by conducting interviews with BoP experts and desk research of secondary case studies. The last phase is the validation of barriers and strategies & identification of their relative importance. In this last phase, six primary case studies are conducted through interviews with companies that sell three kinds of products: solar lantern, drinking water purifier and biomass cook stove. The final outcome of the research is a total of identified 21 barriers, which are grouped into three categories: market, consumer and company barriers. Out of 21 barriers that have been identified, 9 barriers are categorized as essential barriers at the BoP: Financial Capital, Affordability, Consumer’s Awareness, Institutional aspects, Knowledge of Application, Production system, Consumer's Demand, Natural Resources Labor & Employee and Infrastructure. From the aforementioned barriers, the financial capital is found to be the most important barrier as companies require funding for working capital in the form of credit for their partners, material for their products and also marketing funding for promotion to consumers. Moreover, 15 niche strategies are also identified, with 8 of them are considered to be essential niche strategies: partner network strategy, access to finance, education approach, demo experiment and develop, explore multiple markets, geographic approach, technology complementary strategy and upper-income BoP market segment approach. ? From the aforementioned strategies, partner network strategy is identified as the most important strategy. Partners can come in different forms such as distributors, resellers, NGOs and local organizations. Partners are required due to the need for the company to access local market. For example, several companies require cooperation with local entrepreneurs or informal organizations to help promote and sell their product to local society. Partners also provide flexibility, as one region may require different approaches in relation to the condition or consumer preference. In this research, the linkage between barriers and strategy is obtained. In most situations, it is found that a strategy can solve more than one barrier. For example, partner network strategy is found to be relevant to help solve the essential barrier of financial capital and affordability. These linkages also indicate geographic approach as an important strategy as its implementation can solve several barriers of government policy, consumer’s demand and natural resources & labor. In addition, from the six study cases, the notion of context-specific barriers & strategies is known. The notion indicates that barriers and strategies can be affected by the context of company, region, products and time. Those factors give the notion of dynamic barriers, which means that barriers are changing over time depending on the condition of the company and market. This revelation thus can affect the kind of strategies that company needs to develop overtime. The research extends this notion by identifying several possible stages that companies need to go through in their quest to pursue a large-scale market. The implication of findings is important for both managers and academic society. From managerial perspective, the findings of the research are important as tools to help managers identify a solution for specific barrier that companies encounter in the BoP market. From an academic perspective, this research enriches the application of strategic niche management theory by applying it in the new domain of the Base of Pyramid market. In addition, it is found that the notion of the dynamic barriers, which is still not quite covered in this research, will be an important step for further research. Understanding and predicting the stages and development of barriers that a company encounters can shed light for many companies to scale their product in this market. Next, the need of universal product design that may be relevant for different markets can be crucial in company’s attempt to achieve a large-scale market. Lastly, the understanding of the current BoP firms operation extends the idea for the companies to implement global scale niche market strategy, in which firms operate by selling small number of products in number of countries to develop their product and market.","Base of Pyramid; Bottom of Pyramid; BoP; Inclusive Innovation; Strategic Niche Management; Social Entrepreneurship","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-02-01","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of Technology and Innovation","","Management of Technology 2012-14","",""

(mentor); Lozano Montoya, F. (mentor); Fernandez Rodriguez, D. (mentor)","2014","This research, performed at Airbus Defence and Space Ground System Test Engineering department in Seville, Spain, is a part of ELDAS (Engineering for Leak Detection in Aircraft Systems) project. It deals with carrying out an investigation on the leak behaviour of the sealing systems used in an aircraft particularly A400M. The sealing integrity of a fuel system is, inarguably, a critical aspect in an aircraft sealing technology. The need for NO fluid leakage and consequently preventing any structural damage to the internal components of an aircraft drives the aircraft designers towards carrying out a detailed research on the sealing systems. The analysis is divided into two parts: firstly, to conduct a structural analysis of the current installation and to computationally study the rubber behaviour; secondly, the characterization of the leakage. This combined analysis is to investigate the current issues associated with the sealing system and propose methods for leak estimation by characterization of leak applicable to the fuel system of an aircraft. Several parameters e.g. fluid properties, material properties, surface roughness, flow conditions to name a few, are thought to be correlated with fluid leakage. This document along with the literature study report will summarize the investigation performed to study the effects of these parameters on the seal leak rate. The structural analysis is performed using Ansys Mechanical Parametric Design Language 14.5 to verify if the current design parameters are well within the prescribed limits. The non-linear behaviour of rubber seal is studied and verified with different available analytical models. A grid independence test is performed via error analysis to further strengthen the simulation obtained results. Various time dependent rubber viscoelastic behaviour are studied to understand the seal deterioration over time. This deterioration in stress within a rubber seal (Fluorosilicone) might increase leakage potential over a period of time. Investigation is also performed to understand the importance of lubrication on sealing performance along with the adverse effects of reusing an o-ring seal multiple times and the associated leak potential. Furthermore, analysis is done for different dimensional cases considering the manufacturing tolerance values. Lastly, the complex extrusion behaviour of the seal at high fluid pressure is studied and simulated to understand the seal failure at high pressure. During the literature review, it is observed that of all the leak estimation models available, no formulation appears to have general validity, so a more general model based on different flow regimes appears to be necessary taking into account the different fluid parameters, leak geometry and operating conditions. The study on the leak behaviour of static seals of an aircraft is performed to establish a correlation between gas and liquid leaks. This study can then be used to facilitate industrial leak testing by providing a correlation between leak rates for liquids and gases which can be used to replace liquid based testing with gas based testing. Obviously, the study can be used for planning further experimentation and validation purpose.","gas leak; rezoning; stress relaxation; o-ring; elastomer; extrusion failure; ansys APDL; nomograph; slip flow; choked flow; compression set; Mullins effect","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); De Vries, L.J. (mentor); Cunningham, S. (mentor); Iychettira, K.K. (mentor); Helmer, D.N. (mentor)","2014","Within electricity markets, serious concerns exist whether a competitive electricity market will provide the necessary incentives for investment in generation. In Europe several countries are looking at the options of implementing a capacity mechanism. A capacity market provides a possible solution to this problem of generation adequacy but the effectiveness of different methods is disputable and one-to-one comparison is nearly impossible. With Germany deciding on the implementation of a capacity market, concerns arise regarding the cross border effects on the Dutch market. The main research question that stressed the problem is formulated as: “To what extent does the implementation of a capacity market in Germany influence the performance of the Dutch electricity market?” Answer to this research question can help policy makers in assessing policy decision in the electricity market including cross border effects. From literature, several performance indicators are derived. A combination including both system indicators as well as the policy goals reliable, sustainable and affordable are used. The starting point for the modelling part of this research is the Power2Sim electricity market model. In order to be able to answer the research question, the Power2Sim model needs to be extended with two modules. An investment module and a capacity market module. The two modules are modelled in excel and a Visual Basic script is developed to create interaction between the three modules. The data used as input for the model consist of a wide range of reports and empirical data. The results of the model show that the introduction of a capacity market in Germany has an effect on the performance of the Dutch electricity sector. The main finding is that a capacity market leads to higher investments in the country it is implemented. The cross border effects include improvements in expected loss of load hours, total consumer costs and CO2 emission. These effects are enlarged with the expanding of the interconnection capacity between Germany and the Netherlands. CO2 price sensitivity was taken into account as well resulting in some interesting observations regarding interaction between a capacity market and CO2 prices. Following the interpretation of the results, several recommendations have been proposed. The recommendations depend on the view of the policy makers. The three indicators reliability, affordability and sustainability include trade-off. Consequently, policy makers need to decide on which indicator to give preference. A general decision to be made for policy makers is whether they value an independent electricity sector more than the free rider benefits of being dependent on German capacity. Every study is subjected to some kind of limitations. For this study, the limitations can be found in the number of scenarios that have been ran, the number of countries that have been analysed in detail and the basic way of evaluating investment. Concluding, this study has led to several contributions. This study shows that the Power2Sim model can be extended to fit capacity mechanisms. This can be valuable for policy makers in the electricity market in evaluating decision considering the implementation or consequences of a neighbouring capacity mechanisms. Secondly this study has contributed to the validation of existing studies that measure the effect of a capacity market. It furthermore extended the existing research by adding specific cross border effects for the Netherlands under various conditions. At last the research provides directions for future research on the issues that either cannot be explained or could not be fit in the current model structure.","electricity markets; generation adequacy; capacity market; cross border effects; simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy and Industry","","Systems Engineering Policy Analysis and Management","",""

This project studies the performance of safe lane changes of a highly autonomous vehicle given the currently available perception of the environment, vehicle dynamics and desired comfort and speed requirements from the user. Also focus will be on when the vehicle decides to overtake other vehicles to move closer to its desired prescribed speed, while respecting the ""rules of the road"", i.e. not causing unexpected actions in relation to the other road participants. These requirements will then be converted into linear temporal logic statements for the purpose of automated synthesis of a receding horizon controller for longitudinal and lateral control of the vehicle. Thereby allowing it to make adjustments to the desired system behavior and computing a new control strategy, relatively easy and by definition, the resulting controller is formally guaranteed to meet the safety specifications at all times. Besides this search for formal specifications, a comparison is made with more conventional control techniques by reviewing a model predictive controller that was developed parallel to this project, showing its capabilities and discussing possible safety issues.","LTL; autonomous car; DAVI; linear temporal logic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-12-11","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","DCSC","","Control Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2014","The goal of this thesis research has been the improvement of a validated, robust low-thrust optimization tool for interplanetary trajectory design, written during the author's internship. This improved tool has then been applied to design crewed Martian flyby missions. Such a mission is a crucial step within the flexible path scenario for human and robotic space exploration, formulated ``in support of the Exploration Beyond LEO committee of the Review of US Human Space Flight Plans Committee commissioned by President Obama''. This mission would provide critical experience in preparation for a Mars landing without the actual risk of the landing itself. Several technologies could be validated on this kind of mission such as new countermeasures for radiation shielding, better regenerative life support systems, further investigation of the effect of deep-space isolation on the human psyche, etc. This thesis was the follow-up of previously conducted research during the author's internship for which a basic Sims-Flanagan based low-thrust optimization tool was written. The first goal of this thesis was the improvement of this existing code. Therefore, the code has been extensively profiled and analyzed to identify and remove bottlenecks. Furthermore, advantage has been taken from the sparsity of the Jacobian to further decrease the run time. Depending on the scenario, gains in run time of up to a factor 10 have been observed. Additionally, different representations of the Sims-Flanagan transcription have been investigated. It was found that compared to a throttled representation, the classical thrust representation is slower, but more robust. The second goal of this thesis was the addition of time-optimization capabilities. Therefore, methods to analytically derive the Jacobian elements with respect to time have been established. However, numerical difficulties arose from this method. To circumvent this problem, a forward finite-difference method has been written. Furthermore, several representations to couple ephemeris to time have been set up and compared. These time-optimization capabilities have been tested on Earth-Mars-Earth flyby missions launching in 2018. Based on previous results, those time-optimization capabilities could be validated for two different objective functions: minimized launch mass and maximized final mass. Finally, the latter objective function has been selected for this research. The third goal of this thesis was the automation of the addition and optimization of additional legs. Therefore, automation algorithms have been set up throughout the program. These and the previously established time-optimization capabilities have been tested on Earth-Venus-Mars-Earth flyby missions. During these tests, issues with local optima arose. Therefore, a multi-start method has been implemented and tested. This multi-start method circumvents the majority of those local optima issues. Using the added and validated capabilities, several launch windows for crewed Martian flyby missions have been identified for different SEP power levels, different launcher configurations and different payload masses in 2018, 2019 and 2021. In addition, an opportunity for a crewed Venus and Martian flyby mission has been identified launching in 2021.","Low-thrust; Trajectory Design; Crewed; Flyby mission; Mars mission; Orbital mechanics; Astrodynamics; Solar Electric Propulsion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Exploration","","","",""

The fire and the smoke unleash a heat that causes the temperature to rise. The open car park is made out of a steel frame and to be designed for a fire resistance of 60 minutes. This car fire is a local fire whereas flashover doesn’t occur. The crucial point of the fire is when the steel frame reaches the critical temperature. If this occurs, the steel will fail and might lead to the collapse of the building. Because it is an open car park, it is assumed the natural ventilation will lead the smoke out of the building very fast. But the smoke can be trapped between the beams, which are present below the ceiling as a support structure for the floor system. The aim is to study whether the influence of trapped smoke between beams in an open car park is significant or not. And is it necessary to take the smoke into account during the design of an open car park when making use of the Bouwen met Staal guideline (BmS- guide), a guideline for the design of the fire safety of an open car park? In this study the influence of the smoke on the steel structure of the open car park was investigated by making use of a spreadsheet Car Park Fire (CaPaFi) and the software, Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS). CaPaFi is a spreadsheet which calculates the steel temperatures without taking smoke into account. It is based on real car fire tests and the Eurocode. FDS is a program that uses computational fluid dynamic calculations to run a simulation (model) of a car fire in an open car park. It calculates the steel temperature of the steel beams taking the effect of smoke into account. All the information for FDS is written in a script beforehand and run afterwards. A single car fire and a 3 car fire were modeled and studied. To verify the calculations in FDS with CaPaFi, a single car fire model was put up. Because there were still some differences in the results, 4 more models were set up with small adjustments in the first one to fine tune the model (model 2 to 5). According to the study 95% of the car fires are limited to maximum 3 (fully) burnt cars. So, 3 car fires were also taken into account and the smoke. There were two cases with 3 car fires: one with beam sticking out (model 6 with obstacles) and one with beams hidden in the ceiling (model 7 without obstacles). Based on the results of this study, it is found that the smoke which is trapped between the beams can be neglected when making use of the BmS-guide to design the fire safety of an open car park for the steel beams with a height smaller than 500mm. Also a reasonable explanation could not be found of why the temperatures of the steel beams of FDS are lower than the ones calculated by CaPaFi. And in a 3 car fire model points that are further away from the car fire can be disregarded because their steel temperature calculated by FDS, even though higher than CaPaFi, will never reach the critical temperature. At last, it is still unclear why the increased number of soot doesn’t have any effect on the temperature of the steel beams in the single car fire model.","Car park fire; Steel structure; FDS; CaPaFi; CFD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineer","","Steel and Timber Structures","",""

(mentor)","2014","It is the objective of this graduation research to determine the nations with the highest deployment opportunity for airborne wind energy (AWE) generation systems. Compared to conventional, ground based, wind energy systems, the flying structure of the airborne wind turbine substitutes the rotor blades and a tether substitutes the tower. These systems have the potential to harvest electricity against much lower cost, will soon become commercially available, and could take a significant share of the growing wind energy market. A unique top down approach is applied by analyzing all 193 United Nations member states with a combination of the conjunctive screening method with PROMETHEE-AHP multi criteria decision making. First, a set of conjunctive screening rules will determine if the basic conditions for wind energy are present. Nations which satisfy these rules are subject to a detailed multi criteria analysis. The unique set of relevant criteria in this analysis are determined from a combination of the renewable energy planning, and international business literature in combination with the view of airborne wind energy experts. The relative importance of these criteria is determined with an expert survey, based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), at which 26 experts participated from various background. A novel extension to the classical AHP weight factor calculation methodology is proposed, verified and applied to verify the breakdown of criteria into sub criteria. The results of this study are compared with the current activity in airborne and conventional wind energy. This study was able to select the nations with (airborne) wind energy activity. However this study also showed that many nations with high opportunities in airborne wind have no current activity in this field. Additionally it was found that nations, which are characterized by the highest installed capacity do not necessarily have a highest opportunity for airborne wind and vice versa. Hence many airborne wind resources in nations with high opportunity for airborne wind are still untapped and offer a great potential for future energy harvesting. Due to many similarities of the technologies, the conventional wind energy industry can also benefit from the results of this study.","AHP; airborne wind; wind energy; renewables; decision making; conjunctive screening; PROMETHEE; multi criteria decision making; Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-01","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of Technology and Innovation","","","",""

(mentor); Ruiter, I.A. (mentor); Van Alfen, M. (mentor)","2014","Recently, more research has focused to find occupational hazards in minimally invasive interventions, such as angioplasty, placing stents and the replacing of heart valves. A procedure is a minimally invasive intervention when the operating specialist uses a needle to insert a catheter into the patient’s body. X-ray based imaging techniques are used to provide imaging that help the physician to precisely visualize and locate the tissue to be treated. The visualization is enhanced by injecting contrast fluids in the patient whilst using x-rays. Interventional specialists are exposed to a lot of radiation during these long-lasting procedures hence they have to wear a heavy lead apron for protection. Both wearing the heavy lead apron and these long-lasting interventions may result in muscle fatigue in the legs and feet and ergonomic problems such as neck, back and knee complaints. This graduation project shows the development of X-eRgo: a solution for the physical problems interventional specialists face during these image-guided interventions. The solution improves the current work environment and reduces the physical problems that physicians are confronted with. Research (literature study, observations and interviews) was done to identify the specific problems and needs of the operators during these interventions. The results and insights of the research were used to define an appropriate design to diminish or prevent physical complaints. The design of X-eRgo supports and protects interventional specialists when they perform image-guided procedures in the cathlab. The physician is now able to work seated whilst being protected against scattered radiation below the Xper table. It fits the current cathlab workflow. X-eRgo consists of a high stool and a mobile lead protection with its lead protection drapes. The product is adjustable in height in order to ensure that it can be comfortably used by both taller and shorter physicians. Many actions can be performed easily, like the positioning of the C-arc(s), Xper table and the TSO modules, moving with the X-eRgo while seated, bending forward, rotating and controlling the x-ray buttons of the foot switch. A working model was made to test the product with actual users working in two different hospitals. The user test resulted in positive and helpful feedback leading to useful recommendations.","image guided interventions; minimally invasive interventions; interventional specialists; design of a support; physical comfort; x-rays; cathlab; radiation protection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

While several approaches are available to consider the important effect of wake on rotorcraft performance, the need to explore in detail and emulate the nature of this complex fluid structure has increased to meet demanding operational requirements. High loading on blades, maneuver loads, unsteady structural dynamics, vibration management, major structural components fatigue, close to ground operations and on-board ship operations, all have shown their own demanding nature related with rotor wake, a reality that traditional models and methods may not meet completely when faced with convergent design philosophies and analysis based on early life cycle assessment to boost development. The goal of this work to provide an initial insight into the potential of a rotorcraft aerodynamic wake model in state space form and its impact on rotor performance and the capability of current analytical and numerical models to consider such potential into a basic flight mechanics environment. First a brief overview of the physical phenomena is included to highlight the origin of this study and the relevance of the physics fundamentals. Then, with the presence of the wake already established, a review of diverse literature is shown containing the different approaches to rotor wake modeling. The free wake model in state space is introduced and its definition is presented as well as problem setting solution approach trough the Method of Lines, linkage to blade motion is also presented. A dissection of the different model components is presented and individual validation for every component is included. The integrated model is tested for an isolated rotor in different circumstances and compared against the behavior of experiments in order to check for suitability of the model into potential more complex flight mechanics evaluations and analysis via simulation.

Soon after construction of the harbour in 2006 the harbour started silting up at various places. From that point onwards the harbour’s basin has been dredged multiple times, but the problem turned out to be structural. In addition breaking waves are encountered near the entrance, which makes it difficult and dangerous for the fishermen to leave and enter the harbour. This problem has led to serious injuries and a fatal accident. To aid the fishermen of Hambantota a student research project is executed to identify the causes of the harbour sedimentation and provide the government of Sri Lanka with possible solution directions to deal with this problem. The research questions are formulated as follows: Which processes are responsible for the sedimentation and harsh navigability conditions at the Hambantota Fisheries Harbour and why aren’t those processes dealt with in the existing design? Which adjustments of the current design will prevent future sedimentation inside the harbour and improve navigability conditions for the fishermen and to what extend should the different stakeholders be involved to achieve this? General understanding of the large scale processes which occur at the southern coast of Sri Lanka is important before the specific problems at Hambantota can be analysed. Therefore this research project starts with an extensive system analysis. With global knowledge of the climate, tide and the wave conditions the specific problems in Hambantota were analysed. Beside a technical analysis of the port a stakeholder analysis was conducted to find out where mistakes were made and identify lessons learned to prevent problems in the future. With improvements and learned lessons in mind possible solutions were generated and evaluated based on among others: durability, sedimentation and construction and maintenance costs. Weight factors were assigned by the Project Director Team and a multi-criteria analysis was used to find the most promising alternative. The dominant process responsible for the transport of sediment into the harbour is diffraction. With this mechanism wave energy is turned around the breakwater head and directed into the harbour. This causes a sediment flow into the harbour and the sediment settles in the harbour basin. The sediment enters the coastal cell from the western boundary where mainly fine sediment is imported around the rocky headlands. Bad navigability conditions are caused by the presence of a shoal in front of the entrance which induces wave breaking at this location. Overall the failure of the Hambantota Fishery Harbour project can be explained from bad communications between the various stakeholders. Improving the communication between the stakeholders will be essential for the adaption of the harbour to be successful. Therefore the Project Director Team should collaborate with Royal HaskoningDHV and ECL, involve the Hambantota Fisherman Association, Hambantota Fisheries Traders Association, the Harbour Manager and the Hambantota Fisheries Harbour Management Committee and consult most of the governmental stakeholders. The ‘Block’ alternative is developed which blocks the incoming sediment transport by perpendicular extensions on both breakwaters. The alongshore transported sediment is accumulated in the buffer zones created with the extensions and periodic dredging is required to maintain the function of buffer zone. A shoal can’t form since the sediment supply is interrupted, so breaking waves are no longer present. The extensions at the breakwaters not only provide a buffer zone, they also provide a sheltered area in front of the harbour entrance to enable fishermen to enter the Hambantota Fishery Harbour safely.","Sri Lanka; Fishing harbour; siltation; Diffraction","en","student report","TU Delft, Department Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","6.125478, 81.128237"

(mentor)","2014","The electronics industry aims at following Moore's law which states that the amount of transistors per unit area doubles every two years. To achieve this, the industry manufacturing Integrated Circuits (ICs) requires production technologies capable of producing smaller details. The machines capable of fulfilling these demands become more expensive and so does the cost per chip. This increase in cost is undesirable and a solution to this problem is to increase the production volumes per unit of time per machine. The industry's approach to increase the production volumes is to increase the diameter of the wafer from 300 mm to 450 mm. The increase in size of some components in the lithography machines introduces a number of challenges to the position control of the wafer chuck in lithography machines. The main challenge is the positioning accuracy requirements of the wafer chuck with respect to the focal point of the projection optics. This is caused by the decreased stiffness of the wafer chuck, which induces undesirable deformations of the wafer resulting in decreased positioning accuracy of the chuck with respect to the focal point. Recently, two new algorithms for estimating the wafer and wafer chuck deformations have been developed that may help solve this problem. The estimation algorithms rely on models to generate accurate estimates. In general the input, output, or both signals are not measurable. Therefore, it is not straight forward to apply system identification techniques to obtain a model. As alternative a model can be obtained from physical modeling. Both approaches are likely to result in a mathematical model with high uncertainties. The effect of model uncertainty on one of the estimation algorithms is studied in this thesis. The model uncertainty is propagated through the algorithm to obtain a theoretical upper bound on the estimation error. The error bounds are also used to solve the constructed Least Squares (LS) problems using Robust Least Squares (RLS) algorithms where for a case study the estimation accuracy is analyzed and compared with the estimates obtained using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). It is concluded that the usage of RLS algorithms together with the obtained error bounds increases the estimation quality under certain conditions. Furthermore, to show that these algorithms work, experimental results are preferred over simulation results and therefore an experimental setup is designed. The setup will also be used to demonstrate the capabilities of the estimation algorithms under conditions that are topologically similar to those in a real lithography machine. Finally, the setup has been build and its performance is validated using measurements. From these measurements it is concluded that the setup's specification matches with the designed specifications.","Shape Estimation; Robust Least Squares","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-12-09","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Treve, V.T. (mentor); Zhao, W.Z. (mentor); Graham, R. (mentor)","2014","Presently Distance Based Separation (DBS) rules are applied during final approach. As these rules result in a loss in landing rate performance during (strong) headwind conditions, a new concept should be introduced to help maintain or improve the landing rate performance. For this purpose, the Time Based Separation (TBS) concept is in development; it involves changing separation rules on final approach by investigating the possibilities of preventing loss of runway capacity under strong wind conditions, while maintaining the required level of safety (Lepadatu, 2007). For going over DBS and modeling a TBS concept, a better characterization of the compression effect is required, which is the main goal of this report. Actual distance based separations are to be replaced by time intervals, and/or speed compensation. The problem is that the aircraft pair (leader-follower) flying different point on final approach differs in its speeds, causing the separation between the two paired aircraft to increase or decrease. Decreasing separation below the minima increases the risk of wake turbulence encounters. In addition, the headwind conditions should be taken into account since these will reduce the groundspeed and as such the time to fly when no speed compensation is applied. This study will predominately focus on these headwind conditions. The characterization issues extracted in this study are needed to feed or support the TBS FFH tool for building an airspeed profile for the leader and follower aircraft on final approach. The tool is able to include the following characterization effects: Approach Speed (Vapp), Deceleration and Stabilization Fix (DF & SF) and Glide Slope Speed. These performance parameters depend on the, aircraft type (wingspan/speed), wind profile, manufacturer (Airbus or Boeing), airline, part of the day and STAR. However, other challenging compression issues such as Time to Fly, current time separation, pilot/ATC practices and the Flight Management System (FMS) have also been analyzed in extensive detail and will act as recommendation for the future TBS studies. The data supporting the above conclusions is obtained from Charles De Gaulle (CDG) airport. To improve verification the results are compared with data from Vienna airport and show significant similarities, noting that DF and SF standard deviations are higher compared to the TAS and time to fly due to local ILS and IAP procedures. A comparison of CDG approach speed profiles with data used in RECAT-EU and Boeing data also shows significant similarities. In two case studies the new TBS FFH tool and the TBS OSED 1 tool are tested against real radar tracks. By comparing the performances of these two models, the best performances are extracted by looking at the least time separation error. In both studies the TBS FFH tool performed better. Finally, approach speeds, DF & SF and glide slope speeds resulting from this study have been used as input parameters in the SESAR Project 06.08.01 Validation Exercise for the TBS OSED Phase 2 model. Primarily results from this exercise indicate an improvement in runway throughput recovery applying the new TBS methodology when comparing low wind with high wind conditions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","ATO","","ATO","",""

(mentor)","2014","In our society, mass production is the norm. This leads to all kinds of problems, that go far beyond just the environmental effects. Consumers have relatively small amounts of influence over the products that they use and this leads to issues such as not having product that only fit your preferences to a certain degree, discarding product faster, and not being able to make or buy your personal and unique products. New technologies and the possibilities the internet is increasingly bringing along, however, could herald an era of change. With the development of 3d printing techniques, it is now possible to make single products at a relatively affordable price. The wealth of information and rapid development of design tool online, give the consumers the option the very easily design their own products. This project aims to set up a proposal for how we can effectively get users to do this. The goal is to set up a toolkit that facilitates users in designing and producing their own product. The product that was selected for this project was a set of headphones. This product contains both aesthetic qualities on which the user decides if it fits their style an personality, and technical and mechanical components which the user would normally not be able to handle in a design project. The toolkit is set up in such a way that it simulates a Professional design process. Users go from orientating them selves to designing their product to communicating in to a 3d modeler to printing it. There has been a separation of tasks in such a way that most of the complex task are handed over to a designer while the user gets control over the task that influence the overall design of the product. In order to provide as much freedom in designing, the user will be able to manually draw their designs. Because there is a person interpreting the drawing afterwards, the lack of drawing skill can be compensated for. User tests yielded mixed results. Users were able to come up with and design some very interesting and unique designs. The also indicated that they liked the way the design looked and the end result fit the expectations they had when the draw up the design. They did, however indicate they did not want to wear their products. This might be due to the fact that the headphones are a product you place on the most prominent part of your body and that therefore, the users have especially high criteria for this product. Although they did have the drawing skills, users might lack the design skills to make a design for such high criteria. Guiding and steering the users more during the design process, or selecting a different product for the toolkit, on which people place less high demands, might yield more positive results.","DIY design; headphone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial design","","Design conceptualization & communication","",""

(mentor)","2014","Direct Internal Reforming (DIR) on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) anodes is often considered for fuel cells systems utilising carbon based fuels. Methane Steam Reforming (MSR) is one of the most extensively studied types of DIR. The hydrogen formed by the MSR reaction can be electrochemically oxidised in the fuel cell to produce electricity, while the exothermic electrochemical reaction supplies heat to the endothermic MSR reaction. The balance is delicate and unsuitable design choices will result in operational problems and poor fuel cell performance. These issues are known for over two decades now and remain unsolved despite several attempts to capture the rate limiting kinetics of the reforming process on fuel cell anodes and modelling studies of methane fuelled SOFCs. It is not yet clear whether MSR kinetics derived from substrate measurements can be used to model SOFC performance and the influence of electrochemistry on the MSR reaction kinetics is rarely reported. In this work a rate equation is selected based on experimental observations and kinetics proposed in literature, on both industrial catalysts and SOFC anode materials. Ideal reactor models are derived for two specific test setup geometries, considering the electrochemical reactions in the anode. The ideal reactor models are then used to fit the parameters of the selected rate equation to experimental data from earlier work. The selected rate equation is of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson type. The rate determining kinetics are characterised by the slow reaction of surface adsorbed carbon hydroxide forming carbon monoxide and atomic hydrogen. In addition surface coverage of atomic oxygen on the catalyst is limiting the available number of reaction sites. Two constants and their respective energies, associated with the activation of the rate limiting kinetics and the surface adsorption of oxygen, are fitted to experimental data. To evaluate the selected rate equation Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) type models are developed for the two experimental setups, one with a Ni?GDC anode and the other utilising a Ni?YSZ anode. These model are used to solve fluid dynamics, heat transfer, species transport, and electrochemistry. To model methane steam reforming in the fuel cell anode the selected rate equation is implemented in the CFD models. The obtained models are used to simulate MSR on the fuel cell anode for the experimental conditions. The modelled methane conversions and I-V characteristics are compared to the experimental values. The spatial distributions in the anode predicted with the selected rate equation and a power law model, fitted to the same experimental data, are compared to evaluate the use of global reaction models. For the Ni?GDC anode setup the model predicts the experimental methane conversions with good accuracy: the R2 value is with 0.987 close to unity. The experimental and modelled I-V characteristics are in good agreement. The model adopting a power law reaction mechanism underestimates the gradients in the anode. However, the model shows poor agreement with the experimental results obtained on the Ni?YSZ test setup. Large deviations with the temperatures and concentrations assumed in the ideal reactor model are found which might explain the inaccuracy of the model. The good agreement on the Ni?GDC anode suggests that MSR kinetics in SOFCs can be modelled for both open and closed circuit conditions with an appropriate intrinsic rate equation. This was not confirmed for the Ni?YSZ anode. Therefore further investigation with a combined experimental and modelling ap- proach, preferably on similar setups, is required.","SOFC; methane; reforming; MSR; kinetics; modelling; DIR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Sustainable Process and Energy Technology","",""

With their innovation RooT wants to bring a positive impulse to green mobility on the electric scooter market. The key to RooT’s innovation is a rod mechanism which achieves a passive reverse tilt motion. Reverse from conventional because the e-scooter tilts forwards when the driver accelerates and backward when the driver decelerates. Passive because the tilt motion is induced by the reaction of the RTS to the acceleration. The amount and rate of tilt depend on the acceleration magnitude. At a constant speed the RTS’s self-balancing property keeps the scooter horizontal. The effect is that the driver experiences a more fluent ride. Moving with the scooter instead of being dragged after or pushed into the handlebars. The tilt technology has been developed and tested through various prototypes. But how, where and in which product form can the RTS platform be brought to the market successfully? And how can the industry and consumers be convinced of the added value and feasibility? When driven the concept has proven to sell itself. Therefore an example case of the RTS platform application to a Novox C50 e-scooter was initiated as a graduation project. The Novox C50 RTS has been developed in seven phases. An Internal and External Analysis lead to a detailed design brief for the development of the RTS platform.

(mentor)","2014","The devastation caused by Hurricane Ike in the Galveston Bay area (Texas, United States of America) proved the necessity of an improved water defense. Multiple flood risk reduction studies were undertaken. The Texas A&M University of Galveston proposed the Ike Dike, a fortification of the coastal spine to prevent a storm surge from entering the Galveston Bay. It includes construction of a storm surge barrier at the Bolivar Roads inlet (3 km) consisting of a navigational section to close of the Houston Ship Channel and a wide shallow environmental section. For the environmental section a preliminary design was made by De Vries (2014). For the navigational section (span of 220 m) the project group (IV-infra, DUT and Royal HaskoningDHV) concluded that a barge gate with a length of 240 m, width of 40 m and height of 20 m seems a suitable solution. The barge is stored parallel to the channel and connected to the shore by a hinge. Approximately 30 hours before landfall of a hurricane, the barge is set afloat and swings 90 degrees around a hinge to two concrete abutments and is immersed. The barge will now act as a simple supported beam and a 1 m high gap is present below the barge. Once the hurricane has passed the barge is set afloat and returned to the storage area. A structural design with static loads has been developed by IV-infra. The dynamic behavior and response to wave and current excitation is not included in this structural design, which is essential information to determine the technical feasibility of this design. This dynamic behavior is investigated in this report. To do so the following phases of a complete closing cycle are distinguished which are assessed separately: Swing operation, immersion operation, landing, closed position and occurrence of a negative head (a bayside water level exceeding the seaside water level). Next to these phases it is assessed if a concrete or steel barge is preferable. First a wave study was completed to determine the governing closing wave conditions and hurricane wave conditions. Swing operation: The barge is closed in one hour with anchor lines connected to the abutment and storage area. During the swing operation the roll motion is governing. But can be reduced by introducing ballast water in the outer compartments of the barge or a different configuration of the anchor lines. Immersion operation and landing: The barge is immersed with pumps and valves in one hour. During the immersion operation the stick slip mechanism will occur but the duration will be limited and will not result in problems. For increasing drafts the heave, sway and roll response will increase slightly but stay within acceptable limits. Closed position: The overall motion of the simple supported barge will consist of a combined torsion, vertical bending and horizontal bending motion. Due to the high underflow velocity the barge is prone to self-excitation in vertical, horizontal and torsion direction. The impact is expected to be limited due to outflow of water in the longitudinal direction and the influence of turbulence but substantial research is required into this topic. The first natural frequency in vertical bending is close to the peak of the wave spectrum.

The results of this thesis are that an algorithm was developed which had to be tested in simulation and should run (semi-)autonomously on an embedded system but there are no good test results on the algorithm. Developing and testing an algorithm using an existing simulation proves to be very problematic as the used simulation software is very complex and has gone out of support by its developers. Although the embedded system was chosen because it is equiped with a digital signal processor, I sadly found out that its proprietary driver is mutually exclusive with robot-messaging middleware, when it comes to operating systems ? kernel support: the choice was between the driver by using an old kernel or the middleware by using a new kernel. The latter was chosen. A real-time software kernelpatch necessary to communicate with the robotic arm unfortunately was still in development in the final stage of this work. Porting an inverse kinematics algorithm from Matlab to C++ and adapting the trajectory generating algorithm for middleware went well, but could not be tested thoroughly because of simulation and real-time issues. This also holds for testing the velocity control algorithm. The conclusion of this report is that there is future work necessary in order to see if the developed algorithm for vision-based velocity control actually works.","vision; velocity; control; embedded","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Systems","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","Hurricane Sandy made landfall in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States (U.S.) October 29, 2012 as a post-tropical cyclone. With a wind field of approximately 1000 mi (1600 km) and a near 90 degree landfall angle with the coast, the storm generated an 11.6 ft (3.52 m) storm tide above mean sea level (MSL) at the Battery, New York City, and resulted in more than $65 billion in total damage including the U.S. and the Caribbean. With the threat of future sea level rise and the possibility of stronger future storms, implementing flood protection measures in New York City and the surrounding areas is an imperative. This thesis is a response to Hurricane Sandy. It presents a feasible flood risk reduction system for Jamaica Bay, New York City, and a preliminary design for a storm surge barrier to be constructed as a part of this system. This thesis also addresses possible environmental impacts, pollution, and vessel traffic in the bay. Because it is a preliminary design, and due to the time constraints of a MSc. thesis, the design of the storm surge barrier is neither complete nor detailed. Some aspects of the barrier are developed and reasonable assumptions are made for other aspects based on similar past projects. The Jamaica Bay Flood Risk Reduction System (JBFRRS) has been designed to be implemented in three (3) phases with the final phase beginning in 2032. The reason for building the JBFRRS in phases is to decrease the initial costs of the system. The purpose of this phased approach is also to reduce the pollution in the bay and to allow the JBFRRS to adapt to sea level rise as it occurs. Due to the uncertainty of future sea level rise, storm intensity and frequency, an adaptive approach could be the most applicable. It allows some flood protection measures to be immediately constructed while the more expensive elements of the system are under further design. The most significant finding concerning the barrier is that it could be overflown during storm tide events. This is due to the large surface area of the Jamaica Bay basin behind the barrier. This aspect is important because it lowers the height and therefore the costs of the barrier. Vertical lift gates are found to be optimal at this location due to their high reliability, lower costs through repetition, and their ability to allow tidal flow during normal conditions. Piers with shallow foundations along with top and sill beam have been chosen to house the vertical gates. An initial estimate of the costs the JBRRS ranges from $1 billion to $2 billion (2014 dollars). Because the barrier is still in the early design phases, the final costs of the system will differ from this estimate.","adaptive; resilience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","","40.612778, -73.839444"

(mentor); Molenaar, W.F. (mentor); Pasterkamp, S. (mentor); Adriaansens, D.H.M. (mentor)","2014","Introduction In navigation locks levelling is executed under free flow. The net flow from the upper section into the lower section of the waterway is considered as a water loss. An innovative water saving concept is an IRS Lock. IRS stands for inflatable rubber structure. The concept consists of an air filled IRS applied in a lock chamber. In this way part of the water loss is substituted by an ‘air loss’. It was not clear whether or not the IRS Lock concept is a feasible water saving solution. IRSs are formed by a rubber sheet connected to a foundation. The sheet is so flexible that it is considered to have no bending stiffness. The shape of the IRS results from the loads acting on the sheet. During the use of an IRS, four phases are distinguished; the inflation, the inflated, the deflation and the deflated phase. In each phase, the internal pressure is different and thus a different shape results. In case of the IRS Lock, the IRS is completely submerged and the hydrostatic load is the main load. Also loads occur by flows from lock operations and vessel movements. The different phases of use, shapes and the new application area make the design of the IRS Lock a complex process. Design A first design of the IRS Lock has been developed. The Eastern Lock, located in the Terneuzen Lock complex, was used as an environment for the design. In the design the sheet of the IRS is connected to the lock chamber walls. In navigation locks a minimum keel clearance is required between the vessel and the lock chamber bottom. The IRS is located above the bottom of the lock chamber. The water level in the lock chamber, and therefore also the available depth and keel clearance, varies by the tide. The first design of the IRS is optimized in such a way that the design results in a large water saving while maintaining the minimum required keel clearance. The designed IRS has a crest height of 2,5 meter and still allows the draught of the design vessel. In total three IRSs are applied in the length of the Eastern Lock. Additionally, several elements of the IRS Lock have been elaborated. Among others the strength of the rubber sheet has been verified. Functional performance The functional performance of the first design of the IRS Lock has been assessed. Per Lock cycle the designed IRSs will save 9056 m3 of water. Because of the tidal fluctuations in the water levels, and the limitations in available depth and keel clearance, the IRS can only be used for 6 of the 18 lock cycles per tidal period. The total amount of water that is saved per tidal period is on average 25% of the total water loss. As part of a RAMS-analysis, a Failure Mode Effect Analysis has been performed. Measures have been taken to keep the risk of failure at an acceptable level. From the functional performance it follows that the designed IRS Lock is technically feasible. An alternative for the IRS Lock is a pumping station that pumps the lost water back into the upper section of the waterway. It has been found that in all possible situations the IRS Lock will use more energy per unit of saved volume than a pumping station. Also the Life Cycle Costs are higher. This makes the IRS Lock economically less attractive.","inflatable structure; navigation lock; water saving; functional performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","51.334647, 3.820077"

(mentor); De Vlugt, E. (mentor)","2014","The aim of this study was to determine if and how specific characteristics of visual information influence the motor control strategy adopted during a visuomotor tracking task. To this end, twenty healthy subjects and two stroke patients were measured. Changes in wrist joint admittance (i.e., wrist rotations due to external forces) due to specific manipulations of the visual scenery related to task demands (i.e., tolerance, velocity, preview; experiment 1) and related to presentation of visual information (i.e., gain, optical flow density; experiment 2) were quantified using System Identification and Parameter Estimation (SIPE) techniques in order to distinguish between continuous feedback, intermittent feedback and anticipatory feedback control strategies. To this end, a linear physiological model comprising short-latency muscle spindle feedback \'and long-latency visual position feedback was fitted to the experimental data. To study control adaptability, the potential of a linear time invariant (LTI) technique to analyze time variant (TV) control behavior was explored. In both experiments, manipulations of the visual information elicited significant changes in intrinsic and reflexive neuromuscular properties and use of visual feedback. The findings suggest that humans flexibly adapt their use of visual feedback between continuous feedback and intermittent feedback control, dependent of demands on task precision and movement velocity. Anticipatory feedback control was dependent on the amount of future task information available, but was suppressed by high task demands and increased when movements were visually amplified. LTI models can successfully be deployed for the analysis of TV control behavior in tracking tasks, provided that actual movement amplitudes are small. It is concluded that the discussed methods yield potential in the identification of motor control adaptability for the use in diagnostics of movement disorders.","visual feedback; sipe; system identification; physiological modeling; motor control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-12-17","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Hoogendoorn, S.P. (mentor); Verhoeven, A.P. (mentor)","2014","Late 2013 the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment created the project Spookfiles A58. In this project the cooperative traffic theory is used to solve traffic wave congestion. In the cooperative theory, vehicles are able to communicate with their peers and roadside traffic systems quickly. Vehicles constantly broadcast data about its situation (like location and speed), while other vehicles and the roadside use this data to make decisions. Siemens Nederland is involved in the Spookfiles A58 project to develop roadside equipment capable of this kind of communication. The project raised the question how Siemens Nederland should position itself strategically in the upcoming cooperative traffic business. The ensuing goal of this assignment is therefore to design the strategic position of Siemens Nederland in the cooperative traffic business. The assignment is divided into two scopes. The first scope is restricted by the present context and is set between 2014 and 2018. The second scope is omits all restrictions and is set in 2025. The answer to the design goal is split likewise. An external analysis indicated a clear demand from the Dutch government for roadside cooperative solutions, due to potential savings and increased efficiency. A competitor analysis showed that the cooperative traffic business is currently still in development and as of yet no solutions are available. Meanwhile the Dutch government is keen on decreasing the say of Rijkswaterstaat in the cooperative development in favor of the private sector. This can currently be seen in the Spookfiles A58 project. At the same time the automobile industry is responding to a (future) customer’s demand by creating cooperative vehicle-to-vehicle communication and solutions. A smart device trend indicates a demand for smart and more personalized solutions. When extrapolating this trend to vehicles it is likely that drivers are interested into smart services in the car. The internal analysis revealed that Siemens AG is currently independently developing cooperative traffic solutions. Their solutions however differ from the current demands of the Dutch market. The strengths of Siemens Nederland match the requirements set by the cooperative concept. They have knowledge of the market, its players, are currently at the forefront of cooperative development and have access to traditional roadside equipment to help ease the transition. Their weaknesses are mainly based on the rules imposed by Siemens AG. At the same time they have experienced difficulties extending innovative projects based on server technology. Finally they currently have limited human resources. As a result of the context analysis a final strategic proposal for 2018 was made. The proposal is called Cooperative Roadside Infrastructure Service or RISE for short. The RISE proposal was designed specifically to fit the conditions set by the context. It exists of two physical products and a number of software services. The products are the Roadside Gateway (RG) and the Roadside Platform (RP). The RG is basically a simple data relay device positioned along roads, creating a communication channel between the vehicle and the RP. It is cheap and easy to replace. The RP is a server capable of aggregating moving vehicle data, hosting applications, and connecting to the Internet. The services are traffic management applications, information applications, aggregated vehicle data services, and (in 2017) a Software Development Kit to stimulate third party developers to add value to the system. Siemens Nederland will sell these services using several subscription models while financing the implementation of the products by itself. The risks of RISE can be found in the inherent privacy issues, replacement by smartphone, and the heavy dependency on the automotive industry and other stakeholders. The financial analysis shows that the Net Present Value of RISE is estimated  9,4 million in total up until 2020. It is also argued that the actual value might be much higher. This is caused by the expected effects of the cooperative traffic applications on traffic safety, sustainability, and traffic flow. Currently these issues cost the collective millions of euros per year. Since RISE is set in 2018 it is based on the context of the present. However, when finalized it has to account for the changes after 2018. To account for this distant future a vision was generated of 2025. In 2025 vehicles are able to drive completely unassisted by the driver. For the vehicle to become truly aware of its context it is able to perceive the direct environment through a network of on board sensors and its indirect context by use of a number of wireless connections. These vehicles are called KEEN. Using this combined input of information KEEN are able to make decisions on an operational, tactic, and strategic level. A user just gets in the car and based on available real-time and historical data the KEEN drives the user to his or her destination. This detaches the user from the vehicle since the interactions are reduced radically. This increases the focus on comfort, entertainment and productivity services. Siemens Nederland is advised continue research on this topic to account for this change of meaning in the future.","Siemens; cooperative traffic; cooperative systems; business strategy; strategic design; RISE; V2V; V2X; vehicle communication; traffic; infrastructure; autonomous vehicles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Van Thiel de Vries, J.S.M. (mentor); Minns, T. (mentor); Jäger, W.S. (mentor)","2014","Marine contractors deal with processes that are understood qualitatively but are hard to quantify. The amount of data available for these processes is ever growing, and so too the intrinsic value that lies within this data. Several data driven model approaches can be used to analyse this process data, one being a Bayesian Network (BN) approach. A BN is a statistical tool that has been used in previous research for predicting processes in the area of Marine Contracting. The BN approach is further explored in this thesis as a way to analyse process data. The objective of the research was to determine how a data driven model approach like the BN approach can be used to effectively analyse process data that drive everyday Marine Contracting practices. To this end, first a theoretical study was performed. Then the BN method is applied to three processes that are dealt with on a regular basis in the marine contracting practice. The first process concerns the wear of cutter suction dredger tools. The pickpoints that are used for cutting soil wear down depending on various parameters. Being able to predict this wear process is of high importance for any soil cutting project. The BN proved to have some predictive skill though the errors were quite large. This research it could not conclude if the predictive skill is an improvement on the currently used methods for geology- or wear prediction. The second process is the cliff erosion at the island of Lolland (Denmark). As part of a large tunnel construction project an erosion cliff is to be constructed with the purpose of supplying adjacent coast with a certain amount of sediment. The erosion cliff will be constructed in two phases. Using a data driven model approach, the first phase can be used as a pilot in which various construction configurations are monitored. This process data can then be used to feed a data driven model, like a BN, to optimise the construction of the second phase. The third process is the wave overtopping of coastal structures. A database with quite a lot of well-defined overtopping cases is readily available for feeding a data driven model approach. Several other calculation methods, based on the same data, are readily available as well. Due to time constraints, the actual validation of an overtopping BN and the comparison with other overtopping methods is has not been completed for this research. Concluding, the benefit of using a data modelling approach like the BN approach for the Marine Contracting industry lies mostly in the collection, storage and management of data. Well-defined instances (sets of process parameter values related to one single case) needed for feeding a BN is the most vital aspect of its benefit. These instances give a good handle on large quantities of available data. A BN’s main strength is that its structure in combination with the properly managed data is capable of holistically capturing highly complex processes.","Bayesian Network; process data analysis; data driven model; marine contracting; big data; cutting tool wear; overtopping; cliff erosion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

In 2007 a severe storm caused major physical and economic damage along the coastline, proving the need for action. Umhlanga Rocks is a densely populated premium holiday destination on the eThekwini coastline suffering from similar problems due to its narrow beaches and lack of dunes in certain places. Interference with the coast of Umhlanga can entice fierce resistance from different groups of stakeholders, which makes finding a suitable solution more difficult. The above leads to the following problem definition: Due to erosion and extreme weather conditions the coastline of Umhlanga Rocks is shifting on shore, causing narrow beaches, decrease of tourism and increased risk of failures of the coastal structures. The current situation requires a new long term safety strategy, taking into account the social, economic and environmental vitality of the Umhlanga Rocks area as well. To solve the problem definition the main question states: How can the eThekwini municipality create a sustainable Umhlanga coastline while adding value to the area? To answer the main question many different elements, varying from conventional coastal protection measures to experimental ideas that would increase local business, were formulated during a brainstorm session. These elements are ranked on their cost, added value and technological feasibility. From the highest ranked elements in each category 11 different alternatives are created. By performing a multi criteria analysis these 11 alternatives are narrowed down to three alternatives and an additional `do nothing’ option is included. The do nothing option assumes that the beach will be completely gone in 30-40 years. It is further assumed Umhlanga Rocks recreational businesses are coupled to the beach and property values will drop by 12% once the beach is gone. This gives a NPV of R.15,000,000,000. It is suspected that the equilibrium that normally exists in the cross shore sediment transport is disturbed and more sediment moves offshore than onshore. The sill is designed to prevent the sediment form moving too far offshore and thus to create a new equilibrium. The bar retaining sill consists of prefab concrete elements located just outside the surf zone. From the Delft3D model it followed that the beach stays roughly the same size after construction of the sill. The NPV bases the cost of the sill on reference projects. With the beach maintaining its current size the total NPV amounts to R.116,000,000,000. The nourishment option adds enough sand to the beach to compensate for erosion and add 15 meters of beach according to the Delft3D model. It is assumed the nearby sand depot can be used to perform the nourishment. The nourishment itself will be done using a dredger connected to a floating pipeline to pump the sand to the beach. Shovels will be used to divide the sand over the beach area. The cost of the nourishment is based on the cost of a similar project, with the benefit of the added beach area the total NPV is R.142,000,000,000. The submerged breakwater creates a calmer wave climate near the coast and will thereby reduce erosion and increase beach growth. The Delft3D model suggests an average beach growth of 20 meters. For the breakwater design different materials are considered. Geotextile systems look very promising and have several advantages over a rock or concrete breakwater. A design with geotextile bags and one with geotextile tubes is made for the Umhlanga Rocks area. The NPV of the breakwater amounts to R.131,000,000,000. A second multi criteria analysis is performed to determine the overall best option. According to this analysis the construction of a submerged breakwater made of geotextile tubes provides the best solution to the problem from social and technical preferences. Social preferences include perceptions of stakeholders involved like environmental groups and property owners, but take the construction and maintenance costs of the alternative into account as well. In this case the geotextile tube breakwater uses conforming materials, does not cause any visual horizon pollution and seems to deliver the best benefits for the price involved. At the same time the results from the 3D simulations have shown that the breakwater is able to perform well on the technical preferences including the breakage of waves offshore and increase of beach width.","beach stabilization; South Africa; Durban; coastal protection","en","student report","TU Delft, Departments Hydraulic Engineering - Integral design and maintenance","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","-29.728450, 31.088348"
