(mentor); Vegt, N.J.H. (mentor)","2014","As the EU’s most visible expression of European digital heritage, Europeana has established itself as a reference point for European culture on the Internet. With the ambition of moving forward to transform in to an open platform for discovery and re-use of heritage content, Europeana Europeana started up a new project- Europeana Channels. Channels are thematically segmented vertical services for discovery, reuse and contribution of heritage information in Europeana. The concept would allow for Europeana network partners (professional users) to curate content as a trusted source. The general public (non-professional users) can search for content under their interested themes, provided with rich media access and interaction opportunities. They should be able to participate in a two-way conversation, not only consuming information, but also making contributions. The assignment of this graduation project is to design a concept for Channels, which should engage non-professional users with various content genres in a participatory, meaningful and enjoyable way. In order to understand who would be the potential users of Channel, their motivation to use Channels and the ideal experience on the platform, both literature research and user research were performed on physical exhibition visitors and virtual exhibition visitors. Based on the results, the culture vultures were defined as the main target groups of Channels. In spite of the huge diversity in target users, the personal growth (gaining knowledge, insights, expertise, inspirations) and social interaction which brings added value to them are their main motivation to engage with Channels and making contributions. As with the experience, apart from of the primary expectation of searching for content efficiently, an inspirational and explorative environment which could bring new perspectives and insights to users would be valued by them very much. Research on the current development of similar platforms on digital heritage and the trends of the online platform were studied. Together were the principles of Europeana, some promising directions for Channels were discussed. The phase of forming design brief was crucial to this project. With the proceeding of research, the complexity of the project was increasingly realized. For such a project it is impossible to design everything, therefore lots of decisions were taken at this phase. The general vision of Channels was proposed, with “Aliveness” as its core value and the strategy of focusing on the enhancement of the content. The design goal were refined as “To develop and sustain users’ engagement with Channels by empowering their personal growth and meaningful social interaction on the platform."" And it was decided that based on a general structure design for the platform, the design focus of the project will be on user contribution, especially the collection experience. The interaction vision was also put forward, which is “enlightenment”, “achievement” and “connectedness”. After the iteration of ideation and conceptualization, the final concept was gradually developed. A general structure and layout design for the whole platform was proposed, as well as a focused design on the collection experience. Three main sub-concepts, “collaborate on collection”, “annotation” and “statistics” were proposed to enhance the user collection experience on Channels. The design was evaluated with selected target users. The results showed that the concept was quite promising in enhancing the enduring user engagement, and that the qualities of interaction vision were assessed positively. However, the success of an online platform is attributed to many factors(content quality, valuable user contribution, etc.), and users would need time to explore and experience the platform, seeing what they can gain really. Thus, further recommendations on the concept refinement and the future development of Channels were offered in the end.","user engagement; web platform; cultural heritage; Europeana","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Verweij, M.D. (mentor)","2014","In this thesis we researched the applicability, properties and efficiency of the finite element method to solve the one-dimensional Westervelt equation, which describes nonlinear plane wave propagation. The goal was to investigate whether this lesser-known solution method has advantages or disadvantages compared to more commonly used solution techniques. We developed an understanding of nonlinear wave propagation by analyzing the Burgers equation, which we used to benchmark solutions. We used the commercial finite element software package COMSOL to calculate first solutions, where we found that numerical errors occur as the wave propagates through the shock wave formation distance. We examined the effect of several numerical parameters and concluded that reducing the element size decreases the overall error of the solution, both near the shock wave front and elsewhere. This also helps reduce numerical oscillations if present. Increasing the element order also improved the solution. The time stepping algorithm was found to have a strong connection to the element size. The maximum time step depends strongly on the minimum element size. Reducing physical parameters such as the amplitude of the source, or adding damping, were also researched but were shown to have little effect on reducing the numerical error around the shock wave front. The finite element method can solve inhomogeneous domains with relative ease compared to homogeneous domains, which may be an advantage over other methods. We then developed our own Matlab implementation of Galerkin's finite element method for the Westervelt equation to get more insight into the algorithms behind this method and get a better understanding of the effect of numerical parameters. We implemented two different time solvers and we concluded that our specific choice of backward differential formulas was producing more accurate results than more general build-in time solvers that come with COMSOL or Matlab. Furthermore we saw that the accuracy of the solution does not only depend on spatial numerical parameters, but also on the time solving parameters. Different time solving techniques can yield different degrees of accuracy and efficiency, and must therefore be chosen with care. We finally turned to adaptive finite element method techniques in order to improve overall accuracy and efficiency. We have shown that a simple form of adaptiveness can help improve the accuracy of the solution, but its efficiency depends on the implementation and the number of spatial dimensions in which the equation is solved. The finite element method provides different types of adaptiveness, such as local refinement/coarsening, node movement and local change of the order of the basis functions, which may be combined together. We showed the advantages and disadvantages of a node movement implementation based on the MMPDE-6 algorithm. We concluded that more research can be put in incorporating (combined types of) adaptiveness to solve the Westervelt equation.","Finite Element Method; Adaptive Mesh; Westervelt equation; Nonlinear Wave Propagation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Numerical Analysis","","Bachelor Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics","",""

It can be operated at 65 MHz with a target of 5 e- RMS noise and 92 dB dynamic range. The architecture of the whole sensor is explained with a functional illustration of every block. The pixel is based on a 4T pinned photodiode structure, and the high dynamic range is realized with an extra MIM capacitor in the pixel. The pixel Y-axis addressing and control are accomplished by a block called pixel row driver. For the pixel readout, in readout columns, correlated double sampling is implemented which significantly reduces the reset or kTC noise. The signal in the columns will be multiplexed and sent to 8 readout lines. Those signals on 8 lines are sent to single-ended to differential converters, and finally are read out via buffers. The digital control signals, such as the address of pixel array, signals to switch between different modes, are created from a block called digital control block, which works as an interface between an FPGA and the internal circuits. The functional simulation with parasitic resistance and capacitance and the layout of every block and the whole sensor is illustrated. The noise simulation and result analysis also are given.","high dynamic range; stitched design; CMOS image sensor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Microelectronics","",""

Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), superconducting resonance circuits, are a suitable candidate for this purpose due to its multiplexing potential, but in literature excess noise in phase readout is encountered and attributed to so-called two-level systems (TLSs). Reduction in TLS induced noise and loss will provide greater flexibility in design and a route towards background limited detector performance.<br/>In this thesis, TLSs from surface and bulk sources are modelled, so that their behaviour can be predicted through numerical computations of the field distributions inside the resonators. These calculations not only provide a guide for sensible chip designs, but allow for interpretation of experimental data and determination of dominant TLS sources.<br/>It is found that for Al CPW resonators on Si or SiN, the noise is surface dominated but with a non-negligible bulk contribution, while for microstrips on a SiN membrane, the noise is bulk dominated. As the loss in microstrips for narrow microstrips is dominated by the substrate-air interface, the dominant TLS loss and noise sources do not necessarily coincide and should be treated independently. This makes it impossible to determine the dominant CPW surface noise contribution. Additionally, microstrips and CPWs on the same dielectric perform similarly, while Si is better than SiN, both in terms of loss and noise, due to a combination of SiN interface and bulk effects. Finally, material dependent loss and noise parameters have been determined and the importance of thorough Si surface cleaning has been established, yielding the best Al CPW noise ever encountered.<br/>For sub-mm astronomy in space, the logical path to improvement would be the use of thorough cleaned Si as a dielectric, overetching and the use of LEKIDS and hybrid resonators, where microstrips are still viable for use. Importantly, having located the important TLS locations for various cases, tackling these problems areas further could provide the step towards background limited performance in space.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

(mentor); Vrijling, J.K. (mentor); Verlaan, J.G. (mentor)","2014","Construction, infrastructure and public or private projects have a long history of project ailments which almost always lead to cost escalation. From all the studies conducted in the past that looked and examined the cost escalation phenomenon, it seems that cost overrun is more of a rule than an exception. Some studies show even that on average 9 out of the 10 large infrastructure projects had, in one way or another, to deal with budget deficits and costs overrun. But After nearly two decades since the PRI was introduced, in which countless studies have suggested improvements to increase the accuracy and hit rate, the difference between the results that the model produces and the reality are worlds apart from each other. It seems that there is aspect/factor which plays a big part in the real world but it is missing in the model, which causes the project to go over budget. In this study it will be assessed if ‘dependency in normal events’ and ‘dependency in special events’ (e.g. accidents, Small-probability-large-consequence events, etc.) are causing the cost escalation. The results can be split up in 1) Normal Events and 2) Special Events. When the events were ‘normal events’, the results showed a clear picture how dependency influence the outcome. It did not matter if one added 2 or N events. In both cases dependency did not influence the outcome itself (i.e. the mean, µ) but had a great impact on the uncertainty of the outcome (i.e. standard deviation, ?). In addition to this, the results showed that the effect of dependency has on the cost estimation is strongly influenced by the number elements the cost estimation consist of. When it consisted of 2 elements, the smallest uncertainty and the largest uncertainty could be found when the elements were, respectively, fully negative dependent and fully positive dependent. But when the cost estimation consisted of ‘N’ elements the smallest uncertainty did not dependent on the sign of the dependency between the elements, but the number of elements that were positive dependent and on the number of elements that were negative dependent. The smallest uncertainty was located when the two were in balance (i.e. 50% of the elements were positive dependent on the first element and 50% was negative dependent on the first element). For the second cases, where one looked if dependency between special events can explain the cost escalation of project, this study showed that the uncertainty whether or not a special event will occur, is strongly influenced by 1) the sign of the dependency between the systems and 2) the standard deviation between the individual systems. In addition to this, the possibility to incorporate qualitative factor, such as the management quality, in to the cost estimation process. By means of a dichotomous variable, which is either true (i.e. 1) or false (i.e. 0), it is possible to quantify the effect that the qualitative factor has on the occurrence of a special event or, for that matter, the effect on the total costs estimation. Even though dependency is not used in the conventional way, the systems (i.e. special events) are still dependent. Finally, similar to the first case the mean (µ) was not affected but the standard deviation (?). Even when the dependency between the special events was created by a dichotomous variable (i.e. an event that does (1) or does not occur (0)), the only variable that was influenced was the standard deviation (?).","probabilitic; costs; costs escalation; dependency; special events","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

These elements are at the point of reaching the end of their life span, are subjected to damages or a change in functionality. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate their structural safety. In many cases, existing structures do not meet the minimum level of structural safety according to the current building codes. If it is possible to improve the verification of the minimum level of structural safety of existing structures, it is not necessary to take expensive measures like reconstruction or strengthening these structures. For concrete beam elements the structural safety appeared to be in most cases governed by shear resistance. This study specifically investigates the shear resistance of vertically prestressed dapped end beams. An analytical study is performed in order to evaluate the influence of vertically prestressing on the failure mechanism and the shear resistance of vertically prestressed dapped end beams. Next, an analytical calculation procedure based on the equilibrium of the “torn-off” section is used to determine the bearing reaction of several prestressed dapped end beams. Additionally, a Case Study is performed to verify if the results of a nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) using a highly simplified model are in accordance with the results described in CUR-report 40. In this report the results are described of a full size test on a prestressed dapped end beam. Determining the design shear resistance of vertically prestressed dapped end beams using the equilibrium calculation procedure will give very conservative results. This is caused by the unknown locations of reinforcements and possibly by omitting the concrete contribution to the shear resistance caused by the compressive zone, aggregate interlock and dowel action. Furthermore, in case of correct detailing of reinforcement, the equilibrium calculation procedure will in all cases lead to a safe, lower limit of the shear resistance. It should be noted, that in the experiments in case of a limited amount of reinforcement the concrete contributes to the shear resistance significantly. It is of great importance that proper detailing of reinforcement is carried out to prevent sudden failure of dapped ends by shear. In case of improper detailing the failure mechanism assumed to be governing can mostly not develop. In accordance with the results described in the experiments, this will probably cause early failure. The finite element model (FEM) used is highly simplified. Only the prestressing cables and Dywidag bars are included in the model and loads are not distributed over multiple nodes. Overall it can be concluded that initiation as well as the direction of crack propagation are simulated quite well. However, it is not possible to make realistic statements about crack propagation, crack width and realistic crack strains at different load steps. More important, the calculated bearing reaction is a safe lower limit of the shear resistance. During the NLFEA it became clear that obtaining a realistic model of a prestressed dapped end beam is strongly depended on the input parameters used. It is expected that modelling of all reinforcement bars will result in a less conservative shear resistance. Further research is required to verify the statement above.","shear capacity; half joints; dapped end beams; vertically prestressed; FEM; DIANA","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Concrete Structures","",""

Unfortunately, the influence of LLJs on wind turbine power production is still difficult and costly to quantify due to that the existing LLJ models are all time-based. The work that is done in this report addresses the research question should low level jets be included in offshore wind turbine design.<br/>In this report, data from an offshore meteorology site IJmuiden is studied to analyze the occurrences and properties of LLJs. It is found that LLJs are frequent phenomena which occur at 1/3 of the days in a year. Most of the LLJs are observed when the atmosphere is very stable, which means stability is a crucial factor to LLJs. Based on the diabatic wind profile model, an assumption is made that the LLJ wind speed profile is related to friction velocity, Obukhov length and roughness length. The observed data is divided into groups by Obukhove length to find the relationship between these factors and the wind speed prole of a LLJ. It is found that the LLJ model can be fully dened by introducing an intersection height. The newly developed model is applied to wind turbine power analysis. The theoretical results agree with the simulations on Bladed, which show that power production variation due to the occurrence of LLJs depends on multiple factors, these are: Obukhov length, friction velocity, wind turbine hub height<br/>and wind turbine rotor radius. The power production of 5 MW reference wind turbine due to the occurrence of LLJs diers from -0.27 to +0.31 MW compared to the expected power production considering constant wind speed across the rotor disc when Obukhov length varied from 60 to 180 m. The results also imply the applicability of the new LLJ model. It is recommended that wind turbine engineers should include LLJs in wind resource assessment. This LLJ model can be further improved by future research with data obtained from onshore meteorology sites. In addition, this research can be extended by applying this model to fatigue and load studies.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

(mentor); Ngan-Tillard, D.J.M. (mentor)","2014","The copper grade in the Aitik mine in northern Sweden is decreasing, therefore other deposits are investigated. One of these deposits is the satellite deposit discussed in this thesis. The grade of this deposit is higher than in Aitik and could thus be used to increase the copper production at the Aitik mine site. The goal of this thesis is to establish a preliminary development plan for a satellite copper deposit, which will be processed at the Aitik processing plant. A literature study showed that the geology of the Aitik mine is the same as that of the satellite mine. Therefore the same design properties could be used as in the Aitik mine. Because of the small surface operation and a steeply dipping ore, the best surface method for the satellite mine is an open-pit operation. The mine design will slightly differ from the Aitik design, the overall slope angle will be higher which results in less waste and thus less extracting costs. The overall slope could be made higher by a smaller bench width. Different cut-off values and elevations of the pit bottom are tried. The best result was obtained with an elevation of the pit bottom of 400 meters. This means that the pit will be 85 meters deep, since the average surface elevation is 485 meters. For the cut-off value is found that the best cut-off value is 55 SEK. This would result in a maximum profit. The fragmentation of the ore could best be done using a finer blasting schedule, instead of using an in-pit crusher. The costs of finer blasting is less than that of an in-pit crusher. The production schedule shows that the surface operation of this satellite mine will be from the $1^{st}$ of January 2018 to the $29^{th}$ of May 2024, this means that the open-pit mine will produce for just under 6,5 years. These dates are hypothetical and depend on the real starting date. After that a underground operation is considered. When this production schedule is used the Net Present Value of the project will be 59,9 MSEK. Therefore this project is economically profitable, although the profit is fairly low. However, the prospects of a high-grade underground mine are promising. Therefore this will be a profitable project. It is recommended for this project to do a more thorough research. The accuracy of grade in the ore body is not very high, so this should be evaluated by drilling more boreholes. More models should be evaluated, different cut-off values could be used, but also different production times could be considered to mine the ore quicker and start earlier with the underground operation. Also, a leaching plant at the Aitik processing site should be considered. More and more gold and silver is extracted from the Aitik area, but the recovery of these metals is fairly low, this could be increased by a leaching operation.","mining; boliden mineral ab; production schedule","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Resource Engineering","",""

Analysis of the interviews shows that there are a number shortcomings of the market actors on the mobile market to create value with a platform ecosystem for mobile network operators. Identification and analysis of shortcomings of actors for a software platform will contribute to use platform theories in Mobile for Development and also contribute to advise mobile network operators to overcome barriers of a software platform ecosystem.","mobile for development; business model; platform ecosystems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Information and Communication Technology","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor)","2014","Three main goals have been assigned to Dutch electricity policy: a reliable, affordable and clean electricity sector. In order to make the electricity section cleaner by decreasing GHG emissions, the SDE+ regulation has been introduced to increase the share of renewable energies in the overall electricity production. The drawback of the introduction of renewable energies is that it also makes to the electricity grid less reliable. The main reason for this increased unreliability is the incapacity of the electricity network to cope with high electricity production fluctuations. One solution to cope with high production fluctuations is to allow electricity consumers to respond to variations of electricity prices resulting from the availability of electricity on the network over time. To allow demand response, households may purchase smart grid appliances. These appliances, for example smart washing machines or smart fridges, adapt their electricity consumption depending on the price of electricity. The benefits for households is that the purchase of smart gird appliances may lead to lower electricity costs. There is however a large uncertainty about the extent to which households will be willing to purchase smart grid appliances and provide demand response. Since demand response is important to allow a wider integration of renewable energies in the Dutch electricity sector, policy measures to support adoption of smart grid appliances might be needed. To create effective policies, more insight must be gained into the factors leading to a high share of smart grid appliance adoption. The purpose of this work is to identify a set of directions for policy that allows a large adoption of smart grid appliances on the scale of city districts. The identification of directions for policy is done by using an agent-based model. This model allows simulating the decision-making performed by each individual households to decide whether to purchase smart grid appliances. In addition, it enables to incorporate the effects of interactions between households on the final adoption percentage of smart grid appliances. The analysis in this work has been performed by using the Diffusion of Innovations Theory of Rogers (1962). In this theory, (potential) adopters are assumed to be divided among five different categories: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards. Adopters of each category have different reasons to adopt and different roles in the diffusion of innovations. The outcomes of the model shows that the adoption of smart grid appliances by innovators and early adopters, which typically represents a small size of the population, open to change and having sufficient financial resources, is not expected to be difficult. Encouraging the formation of consumer groups, for example of the scale of city streets, and the nomination of product ambassadors may largely contribute to the adoption of smart grid appliances by households belonging to these adopter categories. Underlining the benefits of adoption for the environment and for community building is expected to offer important motivation. Model outcomes however also underline the fact that convincing early majority population, late majority population and laggards, which typically represents a large size of the population, might be extremely difficult in the case of smart grid appliances. As explained by Rogers, adopters belonging to these populations are pragmatics. Important factors influencing adoption are the amount of savings that can be made through the purchase of smart grid appliances and the easiness of their utilisation. The large-scale adoption of smart grid appliances would therefore require that the plug-and-play concept is applied to smart grid appliances. According to several studies, most households request a large amount of savings per month in order to spend more on smart grid appliances. The amount of savings that can be made in comparison to these expected is low. Therefore, the expectation is that smart grid appliances will only be adopted on large scale in case their purchase costs equals the ones of traditional appliances. The adoption of smart grid appliances does however not necessarily mean that they will be used in their ‘smart function’. Hence, the large-scale adoption of smart gird appliances does not necessarily mean that a city district is able to shift strongly its electricity demand when needed. The support of adoption by early majority population, late majority population and laggards on the scale of city districts is not expected to be effective, since the challenge mostly lies in the technological and commercial adjustment of smart grid appliances. Only when the characteristics of smart grid appliances will be interesting enough for the population categories just cited, will it become effective again to support adoption on the scale of city districts. The challenge will then become to promote a new electricity consumption behaviour. This new electricity consumption behaviour is only expected to be accepted if the changes in consumption behaviour are minimal.","Diffusion of Innovations; Scenario discovery; Agent-based modeling; Smart grid appliances","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-07-24","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis & Management","",""

(mentor)","2014","In a modern environment users are more dependant on their ability to use their mobile phone for nearly everything. They communicate with almost any device and those devices provide nearly limitless access to for instance a watch or in new applications, a lock. Issues encountered with these devices are the almost always lack the ability to keep functioning for extended periods of time while having high transfer speeds and not a lot of space to store batteries. We present a means to keep a device operating for years with high transfer speeds in Bluetooth low energy connections, while functioning for year on end while connecting to a smartphone for access to the internet. To keep the solution working, high transfer speeds and minimal delays are needed as people are not willing to wait for extensive periods for a lock to open. This has to be done while operating for years with minimal space requirements. Our design uses the the Bluetooth low energy (LE) specification to keep the device connected to the mobile phone. The phone is connected to both the device (a lock) via Bluetooth LE and the internet. While the Bluetooth LE specification is low power, it is still considerably wasteful if high transfer speeds are used. As the internet connections of mobile phones are still considerably slow (even HSDPA) in response time, we can use this in our advantage to save power. The delays in these connections can be used to put the device to sleep. We also maintain full compatibility with the Bluetooth LE standard and keep high transfer speed when needed. Our solution provides the best transfer speed combined with the lower power consumption of low transfer rates. This is done by dynamically throttling the delays between each radio wakeup event. The method is tested for different delays expected in connection types like GPRS, UMTS and HSDPA. As a result device is able to operate for over 35% longer and save 144% power per message exchange without significant additional delays and without compromising the Bluetooth specification. It is also possible to use the technique without any low level access to the link layer which is preferable since it is not always possible to get access to the Bluetooth stack.","wireless; low power; Bluetooth; internet; mobile connection; energy; power consumption; energy saving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Software","","Embedded Systems","",""

In addition, the QB50 mission has the main objective to measure the characteristics of the lower thermosphere. In scope of the QB50 project the TU Delft will develop two nanosatellites called Delta and Phi (DelFFi) which will perform formation flying experiments as well. The lessons learned of operating Delfi-n3Xt - the predecessor of DelFFi - and recommendations for future Delfi missions are outlined in this thesis. During the operations of Delfi-n3Xt the Command & Data Handling System (CDHS) performed well. In addition, a design is proposed to include flexible telemetry (FlexTLM) and a telemetry history playback functionality for DelFFi. This robust but flexible design will enable the DelFFi mission to transmit more relevant telemetry, while at the same time semi-autonomous FlexTLM configurations will reduce the time resources required of the mission operators. In the second part of this thesis, the feasibility of wireless intra-spacecraft communication for nanosatellites was investigated. An analysis of the performance and considerations of such an implementation is given, based on experiments conducted with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules in a representative nanosatellite environment. The on-ground experiments with BLE have proven the performance of the wireless link in a nanosatellite is excellent and the power consumption is moderate. Therefore an experiment to implement a completely wireless BLE temperature sensor on DelFFi is proposed. The wireless experiment on-board DelFFi will provide validation of the BLE technology in a space environment. This experiment will pave the way for more extensive wireless intra-spacecraft capabilities for future nanosatellites.","DelFFI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-07-23","Aerospace Engineering","Space Systems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","In networked systems, particularly over wireless or shared channels, the scarcity of communication resources makes the application of traditional control strategies with periodic sampling problematic. Alternative approaches with aperiodic sampling, such as: event triggered control and self triggered control, have been recently proposed to reduce network usage. Nonetheless, their features have not been exploited to propose less conservative hardware designs. Because hybrid nature of embedded systems along with aperiodic control executions lead to complicated infinite-state systems. In other words, deriving formal approaches for behavioral analysis of these systems is cumbersome. In this study, modeling the traffic generated by aperiodic control systems is of interest. By doing so, one can use the resulting models to guarantee correct functioning of networked control systems, for example in appropriate dimensioning of the underlying communication system or conducting schedulability analysis. We propose a technique to remove temporal and spatial dependencies to derive a timed automaton (or a quotient system) inspired by approaches in the literature. Based on the proposed construction technique, the timed automaton captures the behavior of the controlled system. The derivation of transitions in the timed automaton are based on reachability analysis of each region in the state space using the following facts: the state space is abstracted to a finite number of convex regions and the convexity of a set is preserved under a linear map. Two cases are considered and for each, LMI-based conditions are derived. First, a self triggered strategy, that is state dependent and based on Lyapunov Razumikhin stability conditions, is considered. The self triggered technique is modified to a more suitable formulation inspired by an approach in stability analysis of switched systems. We show that it suffices to only derive the sampling function for half of the state space and then generalize it to the whole state space with an appropriate mapping. Then, reachability analysis is used to derive the automaton. Second, it is shown that for a class of event triggered control systems, the triggering mechanism can be formulated as a quadratic function of states at triggering instants. Then, one can abstract away temporal and spatial dependencies in the triggering mechanism to derive a quotient system. For each region of the state abstraction, the lower and upper bounds of inter-execution intervals are derived. Then, a reachability analysis of dynamical systems is applied to outer approximate the reachable sets over the derived time intervals. Using the results from reachability analysis, the timed automaton is constructed.","networked control systems; event triggered control; self triggered control; formal verification; linear matrix inequality; timed automata","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

The DelFFi project is parts of the QB50 mission, led by VKI, that intends to launch 50 CubeSat to 350-400[km] altitude in 2016, to carry in situ research in the lower thermosphere. This kind of research has never been done in the past, nor envisioned in the future. Hence, unique challenges are faced by the participating teams. The research was divided into three parts. Part I deals with research a photovoltaic and semiconductors theories, which lead to the understanding of the solar cells working principles. It was followed by an assessment of the available hardware useful for the DelFFi design. Part II deals with Launch and Early Operations of Delfi-n3Xt, predecessor or DelFFi launch on November 21st, 2013, as well as telemetry analysis of the EPS. This lead to lessons learned that could are used in Part III which synthesizes the previous and includes a proposed design of the DelFFi power subsystems. This includes the EPS board and Battery selection, as well as a detailed layout of the solar cells within the panels of the proposed deployment configuration. The later, was used to assess the available power for satellite operations through a model using ESATAN-TMS and Microsoft Excel. Based on the available hardware, and follow up analysis, solar cells assemblies as well as a COTS EPS board and Battery pack have been selected and price quotes are available for procurement. The LEOPS experience as well as the detailed documentation review and analysis, done for Delfi-n3xt, lead to several lessons learned which are employed in the proposed design for DelFFi. The key ones are not relying on the ADCS for the power performance, which lead to a satellite with cell on every face possible as well as double sided deployable panels; a operational balance of the power budget through duty cycling of the subsystems in different operational modes; and a design which increases the overall EPS efficiency from ~63% on Delfi-n3Xt to ~70% on DelFFi. Over the last months an almost full life cycle in a satellite mission has been experience: design, launch, operations, and selection of components. The proposed design remains to be manufacture once the selected hardware arrives on site, and further testing will improve the accuracy of the model used for assessing the available power. The proposed solar energy supply system is and improvement of the one on its predecessor with increased efficiency and design for a mission in a very particular region of the Atmosphere, which will deliver new science returns.","DelFFi; EPS; DelfiSpace","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Systems Engineerong","","","",""

(mentor); Pont, S.C. (mentor)","2014","This is the thesis of a graduation project at Philips Lighting venture, Luminous Patterns, concluding the master program, Integrated Product Design, at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering of the Technical University Delft. Philips Luminous Patterns is a venture proposed within the New Business Development Group of Philips Lighting. The fundamental product innovation of Luminous Patterns is to integrate physical patterns of light into “art panels” that consumers or businesses can customize to their liking and easily install by themselves. Although Luminous Patterns products are aimed at both consumer and professional customers, it will be introduced to the professional market first. The customization of the panels consists of choices between various top materials, various nodes options, various colors and types of power cords, various types of graphics and interface controls. The Luminous Patterns panels exist in single panel and multi panel configurations. Although various light nodes can be integrated, two types of nodes exist now: the linear and round node. The round node was ready for trial production, but only a rudimentary first prototype of the linear node existed. In figure ES.1 renderings of different panel and node styles can be found. This report describes the development of the trial production design of the existing panel concept, the development of a viable product concept of the linear node and the development of new future concept designs: After a short introduction on Luminous Patterns, explaining the approach used in this report, an analysis was done to identify challenges and opportunities associated with the panel concept. From this analysis, it was concluded that the current panel design was not able to provide a satisfying least viable product, as some decorative top materials were identified as too expensive or not completely opaque, causing undesirable cast shadows on the material. A new sheet metal design was proposed for the panel concept. This powder coated sheet metal design provides new design possibilities and is a cheaper minimal viable product than the original design. With the manufacturability validated by the Philips Winterswijk factory, which also validated the design from an economical point of view, prototypes were made to evaluate this new design. Together with the design of a single and multi panel bracket, which allows panels to be mounted in a single or multi panel configuration, it is ready to be used as a trial production design. Besides the development of the panel, a viable concept of the linear node was made. This new design takes important design elements from the original concept and translates it into an extrusion based design which uses a light guide. This allows for differently sized and cheap nodes. Based on an early prototype, a proof of the concept has been realized demonstrating its feasibility. In figure ES.3 the old linear node prototype, build into a panel, can be found, together with the new linear node prototype. Finally, based on the notions of Luminous Patterns, three future concepts were developed. These concepts provide a window into the future, which helps to identify new opportunities and design directions. A prototype, as found in figure ES.4, was made of the most promising concept to judge its appearance and to convey future Luminous Patterns products to Philips management in a milestone meeting to make Luminous Patterns a formal venture. In the end, all developments contributed to Luminous Patterns being made into a formal venture!","LED; Philips; fixture; wall; light; patterns; mass customized","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Firstly in consumer level, by making the charging process more convenient, safe and user-friendly, by removing the messy cords , and secondly in power system level by increasing the reliability and resilience of distribution networks, contributing into the micro grid healing procedure through bidirectional power flow capability. To this end, the interconnection of the EV with the low voltage grid ac-buss is examined. The interconnection is fulfilled in two stages. The first stage considers a boost converter for the conversion of the low frequency 50 Hz ac-buss to regulated dc-buss. The second stage utilizes the IPT technology and LCL compensation topology to charge wirelessly the battery of the EV. This thesis focuses on development of firm theory and experimental investigation of the above mentioned LCL-IPT topology. With the proposed topology bidirectional flow is achieved while, the efficiency of the system, considering Silicon Carbide MOSFETs, was calculated to be around ~93%. To verify the many analytically deduced theoretical considerations and developed models an experimental setup is built. For the experimental set-up, SiC-based MOSFETs have been utilized as the converters switches. Eventually, a high efficient voltage-controlled experimental prototype operated at 110 kHz, able to realize bidirectional inductive power transfer is constructed. The experimental results verified the developed theory and developed models. The efficiency of system was measured to be as high as 92.5%, even though the LCL filter losses are not optimized.","IPT; bidirectional; LCL; control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","DC&S","",""

They were given refactored components and were assigned small coding tasks to complete. Contrary to our expectations, we observed both increases as well as decreases in understandability, showing that immediate increases in understandability are not always obvious. This study suggests that negative effects could have been caused by the fact that the test subjects were used to long methods rather than a decomposed design. Another finding is that unit tests, accompanying refactorings, can lead to more substantial increases in productivity. Secondly, developers tend to implement higher quality solutions when working with clean code. A recommendation to improve the net return on refactoring is to not just refactor to improve its understandability, unless one has additional motives, such as easing maintenance or increasing testability.","refactoring; code quality; software re-engineering; unit testing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van den Berg, J. (mentor)","2014","Nowadays companies endure several challenges in order to succeed. They operate in dynamic environments in which customers are more demanding and active. The products and services they offer are similar in comparison with their competitors and one of the few key differentiators is improving business processes such as marketing, customer relationship, product and services quality, and financial performance. In order to improve these processes is imperative to recollect data from different sources (customers, sales, feedbacks, finances, etc.), but then a new challenge emerge: what to do with the bulk of historical data that companies have and don’t know what to use for? One of the answers to this question is provided by Predictive Analytics (PA), a general term that includes statistical models, empirical methods and tools that are used to gather and analyze information and to predict outcomes of the problems solutions Predictive analytics is gaining attention and is forecasted as one of the next technologies to be broadly adopted by companies in the near future, therefore, IT consultancy companies can find new opportunities for their businesses, offering services to their customers related to that technology. Such services are named Predictive Analytics Services (PAS). Nowadays, companies such as SAP, IBM, CGI or Teradata currently provide predictive analytics services to their customers, however, other companies such as Avanade Netherlands BV have not incurred in providing them. Decide to provide predictive analytics services is the first step an IT consultancy company should do, however, there are another important decisions that the company must take in order to reach the final goal. These decisions are related to which technology approach to adapt, which type of predictive analytics technologies (existing on the market) to focus, the type of services that should be provided, which type of industries will be services targeted and on which lines of business within those industries to focus. One of the managerial tools that can help IT consultancy companies such as Avanade Netherlands BV in taking the right decisions for providing predictive analytics services is a technology roadmap. The main objective of this master thesis was to develop a roadmap for providing predictive analytics services. First, information was gathered about Predictive Analytics and Predictive analytics services in the market. Then with such information a model roadmap for providing predictive analytics services was designed. This model, contained three main layers named market, technology, and company and one extra layer used as a guide for the application process named choices. Then, information about Avanade Netherlands BV was collected and use as the main input for applying the model. When implementing the roadmap in the company some relevant aspects were identified. One of them was the importance of finding the right people that have access to the information to make the right choices. Another important aspect to take into account when implementing the roadmap is the communication – of the main objectives of the roadmap, the decisions/choices made so far during the process and the level of technical detail that is needed during the process. Regarding the usability of the roadmap in Avanade, it was possible to conclude that roadmapping process helps to connect external with internal aspects in a high level, being more useful when connecting external factors such as Industries and market analysis with internal factors such as readiness/ skills of staff and technical readiness of products available. Also, according to the evaluation performed in Avanade, it was possible to conclude that roadmapping integrates different aspects such as product/service, business and market perspectives in a high level.

(mentor)","2014","Radiation therapy is a form of therapy for cancer treatments, where ionizing radiation is used to eradicate malignant cells. The patient is treated with a device called a linear particle accelerator. It contains a source, from which photons are emitted. Constructing an optimal treatment plan for radiation therapy involves optimising the angles from which the patient is irradiated. Other degrees of freedom arise from the use of a multileaf collimator, allowing beam shaping. It is quite common that the tumour lies between other organs. With the multileaf collimator we can adjust the beam shape in such a way that we expose the healthy organs to a minimal amount of radiation. There are many shapes we cannotmake using the multileaf collimator. Column generation is a method for mathematical optimisation, that can be used to optimise treatment plans for radiation therapy. At some point during the column generation process, a suitable aperture must be found. This aperture is restricted because of the requirements of themultileaf collimator. In this project we have developed a algorithm that finds a suitable aperture for the column generation process. At first this algorithm creates an optimal aperture, while only taking some basic requirements of the multileaf collimator into account. Afterwards, the aperture found is adapted into an aperture that complies with all common requirements of multileaf collimators. The algorithmthatwe have developed, does not guarantee an optimal aperture. Even though better apertures might in the end deliver a better treatment plan, it is not a necessity. The column generation process can correct itself in the next step. How the column generation process responds to the apertures created during this research project, has not yet been tested.","radio therapy; multileaf collimator","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2018-07-18","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","The objective of this thesis is to design an algorithm for learning the structure of non-parametric Bayesian networks (BNs) from data and has been written as part of acquiring the bachelor's degree at the Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics of the TU Delft. Inspiration for improving an existing algorithm while designing a new procedure was provided by the study of Sneller in [11]. Non-parametric BNs can be used to model both continuous and hybrid data, but perform best when only continuous data is used. They do not require the severe assumption of the joint normal distribution, and there is no need to discretize the data. Instead, only the normal copula is assumed and has to be validated. This is done by comparing the determinant of the rank correlation matrix of computer generated data under the assumption of the normal copula (DNR) with the determinant of the rank correlation matrix of the actual data (DER). The BN starts with nodes only, and edges are added based on a high rank correlation (Spearman correlation). Colliders and paths between independent nodes are used to determine the direction of arcs. As this can only be done up to Markov equivalence classes, the last arcs are directed randomly, making sure that no cycles are created. Based on two public datasets a comparison is made with the well-known PC algorithm. It turns out that the number of edges added by the new algorithm is approximately 1.5 times higher than the number of edges added by the PC algorithm, while some nodes are left unconnected by the new algorithm when they were found connected by the PC algorithm. The procedure for directing edges on paths between independent nodes and for finding colliders has improved compared with Sneller. Using an artificial dataset that containes independent nodes, the algorithm modeled all but one independence relations well. It was not possible to entirely model the independencies correct, as another independence would have been violated. A few arcs that could not be learned from the data were directed randomly.","Bayesian networks; Data; Non-parametric; Structure learning; Algorithm","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","Retail design has a considerable effect on influencing consumers’ perception and behaviour in a store. Lighting can play a large role in this. However, research about the influence of light on product perception is very limited. Therefore, this research has studied the influence of several lighting characteristics on different value dimensions of product perception. Besides that, a relation between those value dimensions and the atmosphere created by the light was examined. Product and atmosphere perception For this study, product perception was distinguished into perceived quality, social value, aesthetic value, ease of use and functionalities (see Creusen and Schoormans, 2005). Social value and aesthetic value could be classified as expressive values, whereby self-esteem and expressing yourself are important. Ease of use and functionalities are utilitarian values, which have a focus on cost benefits and functional performance. The perceived atmosphere of a store can be described as lively, cosy, detached and/or tense (Vogels et al., 2008). Lighting characteristics The explored lighting characteristics in this study were light level, colour temperature and accent lighting. The light level or illuminance is the amount of light incident on a surface and is expressed in lux. Colour temperature is a term to indicate different types of white light. When colour temperature is low, the colour impression will be reddish (warm) white and when the colour temperature is high, the colour impression will be bluish (cold) white. Accent lighting is focussed light used to emphasize certain objects or areas. The light levels used in this study were 300 lux and 1000 lux. These were based on light levels recommended for retail areas by IESNA (Illuminating Engineering Society of North America). Furthermore, colour temperatures of 2700K (warm white) and 4000K (cool white) were used. Also the interaction effect of light level and colour temperature was considered. Therefore four different lighting settings with combinations of light level and colour temperature were used. Next to that, a lighting setting with accent lighting was used. This setting had a colour temperature of 2700K and light level of 1000 lux, so it could be compared to the setting with the same colour temperature and light level. Procedure In total 102 subjects, mainly students, have participated in this study. The participants were assigned to one of five lighting conditions and presented with a toaster and an athletic shoe. Every group observed these products under a different combination of lighting characteristics described earlier. The participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire to assess the perception of the products on the different value dimensions. Besides that, they had to describe the atmosphere created by the light by rating a list of atmosphere terms. Results Of the five value dimensions of product perception, ease of use was most influenced. This value was influenced by accent lighting and by colour temperature. In the presence of accent lighting and in the setting with higher colour temperature (4000K = cool) ease of use of the toaster was perceived to be higher. Furthermore, a higher colour temperature increased the perception of quality of the toaster. Light level influenced the perceived functionalities provided by the toaster. In the settings with a lower light level (300 lux) those functionalities were perceived to be better. Moreover, an interaction effect of colour temperature and light level was found. A lower light level in combination with higher colour temperature (300 lux/4000K) and a high light level in combination with lower colour temperature (1000K/2700K) increased the perception of the amount of functions for the shoe and the impression the shoe would make on others. Furthermore, the current study showed that the atmosphere dimension detachment has positive correlations with ease of use of the shoe and functionalities of the toaster, both utilitarian values. Besides that, a negative correlation between the atmosphere dimension liveliness and perceived quality of the toaster was found. Discussion In general, a combination of a colour temperature of 4000K and light level of 300 lux is recommended, since those lighting characteristics have a positive influence on product perception. However, if a higher light level of lower colour temperature is desired, the combination of a colour temperature of 2700K and light level of 1000 lux is advised. This could be the case when it is desirable to draw attention to the product or when a cosy atmosphere is preferred. Accent lighting seems to be especially beneficial for glossy products, since only the toaster was positive affected by accent lighting. To draw a more solid conclusion, more research is needed into this field. Future research could be performed in real shopping environments, could use products with different materials or could examine different interactions of lighting characteristics. Furthermore, a curve similar to the Kruithof curve could be developed to visualize the lighting combinations that are preferred in retail environments. The Kruithof curve visualizes a region of illuminance levels and colour temperatures that are considered as comfortable.","lighting; product perception; retail design; consumer research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2014","The vast developments in the electronic industry over the past few decades have provided smaller and lighter electrical components that spurred advances in dexterous upper extremity prostheses. Prosthetic companies have commercialized anthropomorphic artificial hands including over 10 different grasp patterns and auto grasp features to prevent objects slipping. However, wrist function remains inadequate. This forces prosthetic users to compensate for lack of wrist function, causing musculoskeletal pain in the neck/upper back, shoulders, and the residual arm. Adding a multiple degree of freedom wrist to the already overweight hand prostheses forces research in alternative actuation methods. Considering these issues and the fact that past studies have shown pneumatic actuation to be a promising lightweight option to actuate upper extremity prostheses, the goal of this research is to develop a functional lightweight pneumatically powered two-degree-of-freedom wrist prosthesis. The developed prototype is designed to actively move the wrist in a certain position where it will passively lock in place in order to be able to perform the desired task. With a weight of 95.4 grams and a with a circumference similar to the average human wrist, the final prototype enables enough output torque to employ a 500 gram prosthetic hand over a maximum range of motion of 42°/42° for flexion/extension and 51°/52° for pro-/supination. In its current form, however, significant improvements can be made by optimization of material choice in order to reduce friction, reduce weight, and increase the amount of torque the locking mechanism can withstand. All things considered, this prototype reveals that pneumatically actuated prostheses show promise of becoming a true lightweight competitor for the current industry standard in upper extremity powered prosthetics.","prosthesis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-10-08","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Janssen, M.F.W.H.A. (mentor); Hidders, A.J.H. (mentor); Zuiderwijk-van Eijk, A. (mentor)","2014","The potential value of open data is said to stimulate innovation, promote economic growth, and contribute to transparency, accountability and citizen participation. In spite of numerous advantages of open data, considerable impediments hinder the provision and use of open data. One category of impediments is related to metadata which is considered as key enablers for the effective reuse of open data. The metadata provides descriptive, contextual and other detailed information which interprets the user’s purpose when he or she makes use of open data. Unfortunately, current descriptive metadata can barely provide contextual information, which is required to interpret open data. Users could not explore the open data resource themselves to determine if the open data resource would be worth working with for their purposes. Metadata about the conditions under which the open data has been gathered, who has provided the open data and how to use the open data are possible factors that can influence the appropriateness of the open data. However the absence of contextual metadata model results in ambiguous semantics of the open data and unawareness of the datasets by users. The objective of this thesis is to develop an ontology of metadata which aims to facilitate five steps (creation, distribution, discovery, utilization, and feedback) of the open data process. In the research, we conducted the scenario analysis modeling users’ activities describing how a user finds, or uses the open data to obtain a pragmatic understanding of detailed intentions from user’s perspectives. From the scenario analysis, the lists of particular activities are identified in order to conclude requirements for the development of the scenario-based metadata ontology. Next, the requirements were applied to generate necessary metadata as entities. The seven-step ontology construction methodology was adopted as a detailed guidance for constructing our proposed ontology. Finally, the developed metadata ontology is evaluated using a questionnaire to assess competence of the proposed ontology from four aspects: perspicuity, accuracy, completeness, functionality and usefulness. The scientific contributions of the research illustrate the potential of ontology technologies in modeling metadata for facilitating activities in the open data process. The metadata elements in the ontology not only describe characteristics of open datasets but also express potential usage functionalities linking to the related open datasets. Thus,it can be regarded as a semantic base supports the semantic understanding of metadata in the context of the open data process. furthermore, we introduce scenario-based design techniques for manually creation of metadata elements. It is a feature of this research that we focus on usage scenarios from user perspectives. It can be used to discover more requirements for creating more metadata or to modify the our work in order to adapt to changing situations. We recommend other researchers not only in this field but also other fields in computer science to adopt scenario-based technique for defining goals and requirements for their design. Finally, the scenario-based metadata ontology can be served as a reference ontology used for designing open data e-infrastructures. Especially, it is recommended that this metadata ontology could be implemented on the ENGAGE platform as an alternative metadata model. The practical contribution of this research primarily gives practical implications for information architects who are responsible for designing open data e-infrastructures. The results of the scenario analysis give insights into what the users’ requirements and what actions they would take on the open data portals or platforms. Furthermore, the scenario-based metadata ontology improves open data use by providing convenient and easy semantic browsing of open data resourses based on formalised metadata. It enbales users to easily identify and distinguish similar open data resources by scanning metadata, and clearly know possible operations on open datasets. Moreover, the suitability of CERIF data model for representing open data resources has been demonstrated by mapping the entities of the proposed ontology to the CERIF logical entities.","metadata; open data; open data process; ontology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-07-18","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software and Computer Technology","","Web Information Systems","",""

(mentor); Tempelman, E.Y. (mentor); Kool, P. (mentor)","2014","Retail business is radically changing in this decade, due to (mobile) internet and changing relationships with consumers. In order to thrive in this new world, G-Star should adapt to create a seamless partnering experience with it’s customers - something quite different from the current sales and distribution approach. I have designed such an experience, for the year 2018, focussing on two elements. First, a store with a digital layer, but centered around the tactile, high-context experience. And through a digital ‘cloud’ that allows for a personalized relationship with each customer. Approach My approach is based on the Vision in Design (VIP) methodology developed at TU Delft. It focusses on re-framing and reinvention by creating future opportunities, instead of solving incremental present-day problems. Problem Three meta-factors combine to turn the world of 2018 into a ‘showroom without walls’:  Re-balacing Relationships: In the past, retailers used to have power over consumers: they had local mini-monopolies on distribution and knew more than their customers. This power balance reversed because of the Internet, but developments like big-data are changing it again.  Polarized Journeys: Customers will increasingly optimize non-interesting purchase journeys, seeking maximum convenience and ‘maximize’ the pleasure and quality of experience of meaningful purchase journeys.  Proposition Overload: Divisions are fading between taste-making media, product-making brands and fulfillment-oriented retailers. Together with many new sales channels, (social) media outlets, brands and propositions, the 2018 consumer will face a myriad of decisions. My assignment was to envision the most valuable shopping experience for this new future, thereby choosing how to respond to these developments. Strategic Solution I want to give people an option to build an empowering partnership with G-Star. This should happen in a way which is fitting for the brand: in a conditionally accepting and product-oriented manner. We help you find the best denim, but don’t celebrate your dog’s birthday. My recommendation is to focus on maximizing experience, leaving the super-efficient shopping and optimizing consumers to platforms like Amazon and Zalando - it’s an arms race we cannot expect to win. For experience-driven consumer attitudes, we should offer options to partner with, which boast clear added value. For example, remembering your style and size preferences, access to celebrity curators or ability to reserve products when visiting a store. Likewise, consumers that choose to disregard, instead of partner with should still be able to shop at G-Star, albeit less valuably. Finally, we choose to distinguish between two attitudes that fit the above criteria: Hands-on Venturing: For customers with clear taste preference who prefer to be in-control when shopping, the store should behave like a tool they control to find the coolest products and optimize their experience. G-Star takes on the role of a ‘wingman’ who assists you valuably. Attuned: Customers who need more guidance and prefer to be ‘taken for a ride’, need to trust in G-Star to take the lead. Like snowboarding a challenging mountain, G-Star should take on the role of the more experienced snowboarding partner, who leads the way, but still lets you ride. Design Proposal The final concept design is framed in the form of customer journeys, where the customers interact with a physical store environment with a digital layer and with a digital ‘cloud’ which allows for a ubiquitous, personalized relationship with G-Star. Getting the customers to experience a more edgy, empowered, raw version of themselves by bonding with G-Star clothing is still at the core of each journey. The store concept is a 150 m2 monobrand store, designed to serve both the Hands-On and Adhering attitudes - who traverse different routes in order to enable fitting interactions for each group. The store offers many touchpoints with a ‘digital layer’, yet this layer does not stand in the way of a contextually rich, tactile G-Star experience, as this is one of the biggest values of a physical store. An example are interactive mirrors that allow for 360 photos, digital measuring, rich media info on products the customer is wearing, product and price comparison. By ‘cloud’, we refer to a digital platform that makes all relevant information available to both customer and G-Star in every part of the journey and in any place or device. To create trust, this information can be accessed, edited, adjusted, elaborated and removed by customers. The compounding nature of this data-partnership could prove incredibly effective after some time, as customers grow a strong and valuable relationship with G-Star. For example, G-Star knowing your measurements can help predict product sizes and reduce returns. Also, having access to (famous) curators can lead to entirely new ways of selling clothing, i.e. periodical subscriptions where personalized sets are delivered to customers, together with exclusive messages from their curators. The designed concept is expected to be technologically viable by 2018 and costs can be kept similar to those of a present day G-Star store of the same size. In order to gauge market opportunity and customer response, real-world testing with actual customers has been performed in G-Star flagship store. We’re not executing an existing product/service, but deploying entirely novel ones. Thus, in order to further validate and develop the concept, I advise Lean Methodologies in quick, iterative sprints, opposed to a linear approach to product development.","retail; omnichannel; design; experience; vip; vision in design; augmented reality; multichannel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2016-07-18","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","For a prolonged period, the photovoltaic industry has been on the brink of transition towards improving the performance and reducing the manufacturing costs of solar cells. In this view, hydrogenated amorphous/crystalline silicon (a-Si:H/c-Si) heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells have gained considerable attention, by bridging the benefits of c-Si and a-Si:H of high efficiency and low cost potential, respectively. Metallization is the final step in SHJ solar cell fabrication and has a substantial impact on the device cost and performance. The opaque top metal contacts block the incident light and increase the overall series resistance of the SHJ solar cell, building up additional optical and electrical losses. In this contribution, the introduction of screen printing Ag polymer based paste is realized as an alternative metal deposition method to the commonly used thermal/electron-beam evaporation of Ag/Cr/Al. Motivated by the low cost and high performance of Cu material, the feasibility to fabricate Ag-free contacts is also investigated through the application of Cu electroplating process. Due to poor adhesion of Cu electroplated contacts an average FF of only 57% was observed leading to low efficiency SHJ devices, while the insufficient metal thickness produced by thermal/electron-beam evaporation delivered a FF value of 72%. On the contrary, these issues are avoided with screen printing and thereby increased FF values are demonstrated. This thesis proposes a method for optimizing grid metallization sizing for SHJ solar cells, which yields the minimum electrical and shadow losses. The screen printing conditions are fine-tuned and the finger width is narrowed down to 67 ?m with an aspect ratio 0.18. Together with the optimal grid design utilization by the dominant screen printing technology, higher FF values were achieved reaching 78.8%. Finally, the optimum grid design and the improved FF highlighted the efficiency of 21.1% on a textured substrate.","silicon heterojunction; SHJ; metallization; screen printing; copper electroplating; evaporation; front contact; grid optimization; solar cells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-09-25","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The source filter model is investigated in depth, since it is the most important ""ingredient"" of linear prediction analysis. We also review seven linear prediction (LP) methods based on the same general LP optimization framework. Moreover, we examine the importance of pre-emphasis and glottal-cancellation prior to LP. The second part of the thesis, provides an experimental evaluation of the LP methods combined with several pre-emphasis and glottal-cancellation techniques in the context of two general application areas. The first area consists of applications which aim to estimate the true glottal flow or glottal flow derivative signal. The second area consists of applications which aim to find a sparse residual. In particular, five factors are investigated: the sparsity of the residual using the Gini index, the estimation accuracy of the glottal flow derivative using the signal to noise ratio (SNR), the estimation accuracy of the vocal tract spectral magnitude using the log spectral distortion distance (LSD) metric, and the probability of obtaining a stable linear prediction filter. All these factors are evaluated for clean and reverberated speech signals. The sparse linear prediction methods and the iteratively reweighted least squares method combined with the second order pre-emphasis filter give the most accurate glottal flow derivative estimates, the most accurate vocal tract estimates and the sparsest residuals in most cases. Finally, we compare several linear prediction methods in the context of the speech dereverberation method proposed in [1, 2]. This method enhances the reverberated residual obtained via the autocorrelation method. In the context of this application, we show that the sparse linear prediction method and the weighted linear prediction method combined with a second-order pre-emphasis filter perform better than the autocorrelation method.","linear prediction; sparsity; reverberation; glottal flow; vocal tract; pre-emphasis; glottal-cancellation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","","",""

Because of the saturated Dutch consumer market, Auping wants to enter a business-to-business segment. The hotel market is interesting, due to its size, expected growth and ease to enter. However, in this market beds are seen as consumables, which result in a high environmental impact. This conflicts with Auping’s Cradle to Cradle ambitions. How to overcome this problem? Model to design a Product Service System Derived from literature, a circular model is created to structure the development of a Product Service System. The first two stages, dive in and direct, are performed during this graduation project. Dive in stage During the dive in stage the company and the market are analyzed. Market needs are found with a qualitative research. This research existed of interviews with hotel managers, interior architects, observations of the housekeeping and analysis of online hotel reviews. The results were split up in two categories. Functional needs, such as low costs and emotional needs such as supplier engagement. Direct stage Three concepts are derived from the market needs. The concept ‘Stay and Pay’ is chosen as the most attractive one. In this concept Auping remains owner of the bed, even when it’s placed in the hotel. A sensor detects when a guest sleeps in the bed. The hotel pays Auping per night that the bed is used. This results in predicable and low costs for the hotel. It enables Auping to implement Cradle to Cradle principles since they remain owner of bed during its complete life-cycle. The hotel and Auping become partners because they both have an interest in attracting guests. The hotel takes care of good hospitality, while Auping ensures a clean, fresh and inviting bed for each guest.","product service system; circular economy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Molin, E. (mentor); Cunningham, S. (mentor)","2014","Road transport is one of the major contributors to pervasive problems such as air pollution, oil dependency and global warming, hence it is desirable to make mobility cleaner and more sustainable. Electric vehicle (EV) is considered as an alternative which can potentially reduce the environmental impact substantially in contrast to cars powered by fossil fuel. Many governments including China have thus implemented policies in EV promotion including purchase price reduction and non-monetary incentives. However the market penetration of EV is still quite low despite the policy incentives, one of the main reasons is a lack of knowledge concerning demand and consumer preference for EV. The goal of this study is to investigate Chinese consumer preferences for electric vehicles and give policy recommendations regarding EV promotion based on consumer preference. In order to elicit consumer preference for different EV types in general and for several attributes of car, a stated choice experiment is conducted to collect choice data of consumers, and various advanced discrete choice models are applied for the estimation of preference parameters. Apart from car attributes, the roles played by attitudes and socio-economic condition in consumers' car choice are also explored. Our models show that people have strong preference for driving range extension and slow charging deployment in residence area. We also found that people can be clustered into three classes which have varied preference and individual characteristics: Early Majority has a strong preference for BEV(Battery Electric Vehilcle) and low fuel cost; Long Trip Goer likes PHEV(Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle) the most and is the only group which have concerns for fast charging density and time; Laggard dislikes BEV and especially PHEV, this class is also indifferent for fuel cost reduction. We incorporate the above insights into the analysis and evaluation of several policy options for EV promotion based on a set of policy criteria including effectiveness, efficiency, equity and feasibility. The policy recommendation is to increase slow charging coverage in residence communities and develop fast charging network on highways, while a mild price reduction incentive may still be needed.","electric vehicles; consumer preferences; choice experiment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport and Logistics","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

The Algebraic Structure Based Model (ASBM) of Langer and Reynolds (2003) provides an innovative approach for modeling the turbulent stresses, while incorporating information on the structure of turbulence and providing closure for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The normal turbulent stresses, for which the ASBM has shown superior results, are difficult to replicate using the conventional Boussinesq hypothesis that forms the backbone of common eddy-viscosity models. The results for mean velocities and diagonal turbulent stresses, and the computational cost are kept at an acceptable level to allow the model to compete effectively with common eddy-viscosity models. In this work, the ASBM has been applied to two new validation cases; the plain wall jet of Eriksson et al. (1998) and the slot impinging jet of Zhe and Modi (2001). Encouraging results are obtained for the normal turbulent stresses, while the mean velocities and turbulent shear stress are comparable to the v2f eddy-viscosity model of Lien and Durbin (1996). Also drawbacks of the ASBM are pointed out that emerge from the fact that the model is algebraic and hence relies only on local flow properties.","turbulence; turbulence modeling; RANS; wall jets; impinging jet; ASBM; structure based modeling; v2f","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-08-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Energy Technology","",""

Companies in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods industry focus their strategies on the operational processes of their organization. The company goals are generally focused on the efficient production of large volumes of products. The IT department plays a supporting role in this environment and has to deal with changing demands from the business and changing goals that are set by higher level parties in the company. The problem is that IT cannot align these constant changes with their own IT strategy and the services that they deliver to the business. This thesis researched which factors in the IT strategy processes can be changed to improve the IT and Business alignment in a case company in the FMCG industry: Heineken Nederland. The result of the research is that the positive and negative factors can be placed in three parts of the organization: the Business side, the IT side and the Organization as a whole. The research found that the factors that can be influenced by the IT side can be grouped into three categories: IT Communication, IT understanding of the Business and the IT landscape. The thesis concludes with recommended changes for improvement for the case company and for the FMCG industry.","business-IT alignment; IT strategy; business strategy; process; factors; strategic alignment; case study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","ICT","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor)","2014","Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) are emerging in the industrial, consumer and re- search domains. A key challenge for UAS communications is overcoming slow and unreliable wireless connectivity by achieving high link utilization on multiple radio interfaces. We have developed and implemented a peer-to-peer communication framework, based on Dispersy and Libswift, that allows multihomed (connected to multiple networks) UASs to utilize all available links. In our experiments we address four use cases. The first use case describes data transfer from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to a ground station, where the UAV starts and finishes out of communicative reach. The second use case expands on the first by utilizing two links on both entities. The third use case focuses on a UAV relaying communication between two ground stations that are incapable of communicating directly. The final use case has two ground stations in contact with each other, that successively receive data from a UAV and immediately share it. The results show low data transfer throughput in general. Multi-link utilization is functional, but the data transfer rate is 32% lower for two links than for a single link. Data duplication rates are significantly higher for wireless links than for wired links, and more than double when utilizing two links instead of one. Libswift is responsible for the data transfer and its reported problem with long latency is suggested to be the primary cause for these disappointing results. Thus, future implementations should work with an improved version of Libswift. We consider the effective utilization of multiple links combined with peer-to-peer systems to have real world use cases for UAVs and mobile devices in general. Therefore, we recommend future research to focus on deployable applications to that end.","UAV; Peer-to-peer; Multihoming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Parallel and Distributed Systems","","Computer Science","",""

If one browses “saving money” in Internet, the results will show tons of blogs with different rules, strategies or examples on how to do it. This project is not about that; it is about exploring the meaningfulness of saving money by discovering its intrinsic value. Of course there will be some people that will argue that saving money is, by itself, meaningful enough, however is a good exercise to think about how can one save money focusing more on what can one do with that resource and contributing to ones happiness. In this report I will try to persuade you to find the importance of being more conscious about your savings, your goals and your emotions. I will bring you through my own quest on finding the meaningfulness of saving money. In order to do that, I worked together with the Delft Institute of Positive Design. Together with them I conducted a research taking a BILLEGAS piggy bank as design case study and defining the success elements that contribute to people’s happiness when saving money. Also, I had the external collaboration of Rabobank Netherlands and their Marketing department in charged of the personal savings and capital market. This quest started before my research internship, but was only until that moment that the idea of contributing to Positive Design came across. I gathered literature from different fields, such as Positive Psychology, Positive Economics and Positive and Emotional Design, to narrow down this project. Together with the results of the research, it helped me to focus the directions that I explored. Parallel to that I did a study about the different solutions available in the market and placed them in a chart that was used for the ideation and the concept generation phases. Together with those concepts, two user tests were conducted. The users tests aimed to evaluate the proposed ideas and gather new insights to continue unveiling the challenges that took me closer to synthetize this project. In the end a Human-Product Interaction solutions is proposed that encourage people to save money, reflecting and exploring on the importance of each item they are saving for, making an assessment between the price that is paid for an item and the value one can discover within that item.","saving bahviour; happiness; meaning; discovering value; piggy banks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Stikkelman, R.M. (mentor); Kwakkel, J.H. (mentor); Brouwer, R.R.J. (mentor)","2014","Vopak is the world largest independent tank storage provider, specialized in storing liquid chemicals, gasses & oil products and is active in 29 countries. For the storage of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), a global strategy was constructed in 2010, in which LPG terminal opportunities have been identified and which is now out of date. The problem is delineated, arguing that it is essential for Vopak, as a leading terminal operator, to be able to continuously identify robust hotspots for LPG terminals in order to manage risk whilst growing strongly. It is concluded that consultant reports are not directly suitable for LPG terminal hotspot location and that the LPG market currently is going through a lot of change. Hotspots are defined as a opportunity for a LPG terminal in a certain point in time. LPG is produced as by-product at refineries and at oil and gas production sites and because LPG is a substitute product with multiple end uses. These characteristics make LPG terminal business cases less apparent due to a less structural supply-demand imbalance. It is underpinned that due to high capital expenditures associated with LPG terminals, understanding of LPG market dynamics is needed. The research objective is to develop and execute a strategy to systematically identify potential LPG terminal hotspots with both a base case forecast and with a deep understanding as to how opportunities can develop in different future scenarios in order to make robust investment decisions. In order to reach this objective the research question is defined as follows: “How can LPG market dynamics and terminal hotspots emergence be understood and described?” The overall methodology consists of a modelling strategy. A novel method, recently applied in other theses and under research at the TPM faculty of Delft University of Technology, Scenario Discovery, is the main research approach. Scenario Discovery assists in identifying relevant scenarios for decision makers by applying data mining- and statistical algorithms to large databases of simulation model results. The method has not been applied often to this type of problem in a business environment. The research strategy consists of the creation of a simulation set-up resulting from a literature review of theory, the creation of an LPG model based on what the driving forces in the LPG market are, available data sources and how LPG terminal hotspot conditions can be quantified. Together with the simulation set-up and the LPG model, scenarios can be generated, that can test identified LPG terminal hotspot locations identified in a base case forecast. Together with the base case forecast and the simulation results, conclusions of the research can be drawn. The scientific relevance of the research is to test the applicability of Scenario Discovery to the type of problem at hand, while the practical relevance of the research is a contribution to the 2014 LPG strategy at Vopak by means of supplying a list of LPG terminal hotspot locations. Limitations of the research are the inability to; identify all future states of the LPG market, to assess LPG terminal hub functions in a metric and to assess the effect of action made in the system. The theoretical context is further explored by means of making the problem characteristics explicit and reviewing different scenario schools. It is concluded that the intuitive logic scenario school is most appropriate for the research. Scenario Discovery belongs is appropriate for the research, but needs to be tailored. Methods and steps of Scenario Discovery are discussed, after which the tailored Scenario Discovery approach is presented. This approach takes identified LPG terminal hotspot locations from the base case forecast and tests them, one by one; using data generated by the scenario simulations and identified LPG terminal hotspot indicators. The LPG model is then conceptualized. Production and consumption variables that should be used in the LPG model are identified. Production variables are; associated petroleum gas (APG) flaring reduction, the shale gas effect, LPG from associated & non-associated gas source combined in one variable, and LPG from a refinery source. Consumption variables are; chemical consumption, possible propane dehydrogenation plant projects, domestic consumption, autogas consumption and industrial consumption. The LPG model is constructed in Microsoft Excel and generic rules for model creation as well as regions are established. The balancing mechanism in the model is assumed to be the proportionate distribution of a surplus in a simulation over the global chemical capacity. A number of validation and verification steps are presented that were executed during the research in order to validate and verify the LPG model. Then, the simulation set-up and scenario filtering steps are discussed. 50.000 simulations are executed using a Latin Hypercube sampling strategy. After filtering out ‘logical impossible’ scenarios, 11.800 scenarios remain for analysis. The logical impossible scenarios have to be filtered out due to the chosen modelling strategy and are done so by means of four rules that are the consequence of the modelling approach. The LPG terminal hotspot conditions are constructed and quantified. This is done by means of analysing the business model for an independent LPG terminal and with an expert opinion. The LPG terminal hotspot conditions are classified by 4 rules, representing basic terminal justification, need for new infrastructure, stability of the surplus/deficit and terminal justification on the long term. With use of the base case forecast, the hotspot location shortlist is constructed. The locations are divided in import and export opportunities and are ranked according to the severity of the opportunity with the LPG terminal hotspot conditions in mind. 14 import and 7 export hotspot locations are identified on a shortlist. These hotspot locations are then elaborated on with the base case story line. The locations are hereafter tested on their robustness and causality using the tailored Scenario Discovery approach per identified hotspot location. Then, different parts of the research are critically discussed. The research approach and used methodology are examined. After this, the results of the research are critically reflected upon. In addition, the societal, academic and practical relevance of the research are discussed. The conclusions of the research are drawn by means of answering the main and sub research questions. It is concluded that the hotspot classification rules are not black and white but the process of applying these rules is valuable. The full understanding of hotspot emergency is only partly understood, in the next step of the project management cycle, probabilities should be assigned to the found events. Next to this, it is concluded that the Scenario Discovery process is applicable next to the base case forecast and not separately due to communication strengths of base case results, which could have been more aggregated in this research. In addition, it is concluded that the methodological approach is appropriate and replicable to other products/systems provided that are substitute products, supply driven and require high infrastructure investments. It is then concluded that the chosen driving forces were appropriate, but that a shift in the global chemical consumption gravity point should be examined more closely. In addition, the possible breaking of a hotspot classification rule should be done by hand when examining a potential location. It is recommended for Vopak to examine the base case and Scenario Discovery results of this research first when embarking on a new study in a certain location. If the two rules representing infrastructure need are limiting, it should be checked if the LPG terminal can be combined with something else. If the rule representing new infrastructure need is limiting, an analysis on the competition should be executed. And when the stability of the surplus is limiting, the dialog with consumers that potentially can switch feedstock should be sought, and preferable be included in the business case with a long term contract in order to safeguard stability and prevent substitution. In addition, the LPG model can be updated with new figures. Further research can be done on the creation of a generic Scenario Discovery approach for business trade systems, the balancing mechanism of the LPG model, the scenario filtering process, and on more dynamic LPG market models.","Scenario Discovery; LPG; Terminal; Deep Uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-07-18","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","SEPAM","",""

This is mainly due to the habits, poor nutrition and dental hygiene of the population, especially in rural areas. These areas, in which about 68% of the population live, have experienced a chronic shortage of wealth working force, means, facilities and specialists for several decades. This makes the access of rural population to healthcare very difficult. Moreover, specialists are not normally found at rural areas but in big cities. Travelling to urban areas to be diagnosed and treated is very time consuming and expensive for rural people. High number of individuals are pushed into poverty every year because of the healthcare payments they have to afford. Forus Care Pvt. Ltd., a startup company based in Bangalore (India) focused on delivering software-based healthcare solutions to improve the acess to the most unprotected to the healthcare system. The company took the initiative in adressing the oral cancer problem in India by developing a software-based analysis device. In order to empower as much people as possible, the device was thought to be portable, simple, low-cost and be able to be part of a telemedicine service system. The graduation project presented in this report has been developed as part of the company’s project. The objective of this gradaution project has been the development of the physical side of a new oral screening device for rural areas in India.

This results in a single-agent and multi-agent approach to assign speed limits to highway sections. A difference between our work and existing approaches is that we also take traffic predictions into account. The performance of our method is evaluated in macroscopic simulations, in which we show that it is able to significantly reduce congestion under high traffic demands.

Parameterized Skills is a state of the art reinforcement learning algorithm that does this. The algorithm consists of two steps. First, reinforcement learning is used to learn the parameters of a control policy that optimize the reward for training tasks. Second, supervised learning is used to find a function that finds the parameters as a function of the task. Four supervised learning algorithms will be implemented in Parameterized Skills and it is evaluated which of these yield the best performance in terms of accuracy and energy effiency and in terms of required time. These supervised learning algorithms are support vector regression (SVR), polynomial regression, a neural network algorithm and locally weighted linear regression. The supervised learning algorithm that yields the best performance will be applied to a task with four dimensions. Currently, Parameterized Skills has only been applied to a task with a varying goal space. The size of the data set should be increased if a more complex task is learned. It is evaluated how well the data set size scales with an increased dimension. It is concluded that locally weighted linear regression scales better in terms of the required size of the data set used to construct the controller. Locally weighted linear regression is also faster than SVR, a speed up of 2\% was achieved already on the task with a varying start and goal position, so with four dimensions. The construction time of SVR increases exponentially with the size of the data set.

Two functional ingredients in such a system are: (i) sensing that provides granular information on occupant location, and (ii) a communication system to transmit control messages from a user. We consider an ultrasonic circular array sensor that provides the dual functionality of granular occupant sensing and a communication receiver for user control transmissions. A ceiling-mounted sensor configuration with a co-located ultrasonic transmitter and array receiver is considered. Algorithms for localization and tracking of an occupant in an indoor environment is presented.The resulting occupant location and tracks may be used for energy-efficient lighting. In addition, a user may control lighting by sending messages at a near-ultrasonic frequency through a mobile device, which are processed by the receiver array, and used to adapt a requested parameter of the lighting system. The proposed sensing and messaging solution is tested in an indoor office space with an 8-element receiver array sensor prototype. The efficacy of both systems is evaluated empirically and through simulations.","localization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-08-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Circuits and systems","","Telecommunications","",""

(mentor); Strous, T.D. (mentor)","2014","With growing interest in sustainable forms of energy, the wind industry is growing rapidly. The Doubly Fed Induction Generator is the most popular choice for the drivetrain because it is cost effective. However, it suffers from reliability and maintenance issues due to the slip rings and brushes it requires. The Brushless Doubly Fed Induction Generator (B-DFIG) aims to address these drawbacks. With increased wind power penetration, tripping of wind turbines during grid disturbances is no longer acceptable for the power system. Therefore, it is important to study the performance of such wind turbine drivetrain under low voltage events. This thesis studies the Low Voltage Ride Through (LVRT) characteristics of the B-DFIG for its application in wind turbines. This thesis first looks at the modelling and control of the Brushless Doubly Fed Induction Generator (B-DFIG) to be used in a wind turbine drivetrain. It develops the steady state model using circuit theory to study the steady state characteristics of the machine. The dynamic model is developed to form the basis of the study of the machine during low voltage events. Further, the controller is developed based on vector control. The second part of the thesis looks at the performance of a B-DFIG based wind turbine under symmetric low voltage dips. It compares the performance of this generator with that of the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) and Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) - two of the most prevalent generators used in wind turbine drivetrains today. The thesis also looks at protection methods for these generators. It has been seen that the issue with LVRT performance of the PMSM is the rise in the DC link voltage which is due to the mismatch in power generated by the machine and the power transferred to the grid. It has also been found that apart from offering better reliability through the exclusion of slip rings and brushes, the B-DFIG also has an improved LVRT performance when compared with the DFIG - the protection is simpler and can be built into the control algorithm of the machine controller.","Brushless DFIG; LVRT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Electrical Power Processing","",""

(mentor); Minnoye, A.L.M. (mentor); Remmerswaal, J.F. (mentor)","2014","This graduation project was initiated as a collaboration with IQ Medical Ventures, a medical incubator situated in Delft. The goal of the project was to design an ergonomic and intuitive handle for Ureca Catheter. Ureca is a device being developed by IQ Medical Ventures, in collaboration with Prof. J. Reekers, interventional radiology professor at Amsterdam Medical Center. Ureca is a loop catheter which uses the P.I.E.R. technique for treating obstructed arteries. PIER is a minimally invasive technique used in interventional radiology for unblocking completely obstructed peripheral arteries. It has the advantages of not requiring complete anesthesia, and having shorter recovery time than the classic bypass. The project was initiated with the problem statement, which was followed by a detailed planning of the project phases. The first phase represented the analysis. The analysis phase had four main parts of focus: the medical analysis, the product analysis, the process analysis and the user analysis. The goal of this research was to gain a better understanding on the problem, the context, the user and its needs. The outcomes of the analysis were the list of requirements, the design and the interaction visions. The most important requirements stated that the product should be easy to handle, allow increasing and decreasing the guide wire loop, and facilitate locking the loop in any position. Based on the research outcomes, the ideation and conceptualization processes were conducted. Several ideation methods were used, such as: brainstorming sessions, morphological charts and shape explorations. Starting from the developed ideas and from the program of requirements, three concepts were developed. In order to select the most suitable concept, a selection method was used. Three most important criteria were used to evaluate the three concepts and to select the one that would be detailed in embodiment. Based on the cost, ergonomics and look & feel, the second concept was selected. The next phase of the design process was the embodiment. In this phase, the concept was separated in several parts, which were optimized and detailed: the casing, the locking mechanism, the loop mechanism, the locking mechanism, the controllers and the stock parts. The parts were developed and then assembled together in the final product. Several models and prototypes were built during the embodiment phase, in order to test various functional principles. Finally, a user testing session was organized. Prototyping First prototype The first prototype was 3D printed in the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, TU Delft. This prototype was built after all the parts were optimized and detailed, and had the goal to test the functioning principles of the product. The prototype did not have the same look and feel as the final product was intended. However, the other aspects of the prototype were very close to the actual product. The designed parts were 3D printed based on the Solidworks models, and the stock parts were ordered from Qosina. The parts were assembled together and the loop catheter was included. The working principles of the product were tested and validated.","medical design; interventional radiology; catheter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-07-15","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Another technology which might step in the coming years is Software Defined Networking (SDN), a more mature technology in data centers, which strives to revolutionize the current Long-Term Evolution (LTE) architecture. However, the integration of SDN components into the legacy network and the transition between phases need to be carefully addressed. This thesis aims to develop a new Evolved Packet Core (EPC) (the core network corresponding to the LTE radio network) SDN-based architecture and to take into consideration the challenges that this technology might bring to the mobile core. Therefore, a thorough assessment of the interfaces and protocols that should be preserved or modified on both the user and control planes is investigated. By describing the simulation details of the proposed architecture, one of this thesis goals is to present the trade-off between preserving the traditional 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) architecture and the actual benefits, along with the challenges for mobile operators in adopting SDN and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) in their deployments. To achieve this, two testbeds are used: one based on a network emulation tool and another one using physical elements. The obtained results emphasize the flexibility in deploying such solutions. Furthermore, a detailed comparison of two SDN controllers performances is presented. In order to fully benefit of the flexibility of NFV and SDN in their networks, mobile operators should have an overview of the different tools and technologies, which might allow SDN integration in their networks. Another thesis goal is to provide the necessary information in order to give operators the input for building their roadmap to the upcoming technologies.","EPC; LTE; NFV; SDN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Network Architectures and Services","","Electrical Engineering, Telecommunications track","",""

(mentor)","2014","With the continuous miniaturization of CMOS technology into the nanometer regime, the reliability of SRAM memories is threatened by accelerated transistor aging such as Bias Temperature Instability (BTI), Hot Carrier Injection (HCI) and gate oxide breakdown. Among these mechanisms BTI is known to be the primary aging mechanism in nanoscale devices. The overall effect of BTI is a gradual increase of threshold voltage (Vth). BTI significantly reduces the Static Noise Margin (SNM) of an SRAM cell and makes it more susceptible to failures. To address the impact of BTI in memory array a variety of bit flipping techniques has been proposed. However, all the proposed bit flipping techniques require at least an additional column to store the inversion flag which imposes considerably large area overhead. In this thesis, we propose two techniques to mitigate BTI induced aging in embedded memory: aging-aware instruction encoding and self-controlled bit flipping; both schemes take the workload into consideration. The aging-aware instruction encoding technique is based on changing the encoding of the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) in order to balance the occurrence probabilities of 1s and 0s and therefore minimize the impact of BTI in the embedded memory. To evaluate this scheme, we used the Leon2 processor for course case study. A C++ based simulation environment was used to exhaustively search for an encoding resulting in a balanced occurrence probabilities of 0s and 1s. The simulation results revels that on average up to 30% SNM degradation improvement. Self-controlled bit flipping is based on inverting the content of the memory array during write operation with respect to a specific bit of the written word referred to as flip bit; this bit is left untouched during the write and used as a reference bit to indicate either the written data is inverted or not. Simulation results show that up to 33% SNM degradation improvement can be achieved. The area overhead of the proposed technique is the flip circuitry only. For this reason, our technique saves 64% of the area overhead induced by the periodic flipping techniques.","aging; Bias Temperature Instability; Instruction Encoding; Static Noise Margin; Bit flipping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-03-20","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2014","The destabilization of a hexadecane, water, and baker’s yeast (O/W/Y mixture) emulsion by aeration and formation of a clear oil layer was investigated. The role of the air bubbles to destabilize the emulsion and form a clear oil layer was observed on previous research, but not investigated further until the current research. Initial hypotheses stated that the air bubbles were assisting the mechanism by rupturing the protein film and inducing coalescence by direct contact between droplet/droplet or droplet/oil layer, and by surface aided contact, using the bubble as a mediator for coalescence. A sensitivity analysis of the 4 phase mixture (O/W/Y/A) system to yield a clear oil layer by changing operational parameters was used to determine and explain the existing interaction of the air bubbles with the oil droplets to induce their coalescence according to the results obtained and phenomena observed. Preliminary experiments were performed to identify the factors influencing the aeration process and understand the requirements to compare the parameters individually. The dynamics of the separation process were studied using a setup consisting of 4 custom made glass columns, custom made steel plate spargers and air flow mass controllers. The value to compare the different series of experiments was the percentage of oil recovered in each column. The results revealed an influence in the four parameters changed, superficial gas velocity, height, bubble size and yeast concentration. The increase of the superficial gas velocity resulted in a higher percentage recovery but without the presence of a clear oil layer (large droplets accumulated at the top instead). The increase of height in the mixture aerated resulted in a lower percentage recovery and large droplets accumulated at the top. In contrast, the reduction of the height resulted in a very positive recovery and the formation of a clear oil layer, almost immediately. The increase of the air superficial area by reducing the bubble size produced a higher recovery but with a large variation for the results obtained with the smallest bubble size. The increase of yeast concentration affected negatively the percentage of oil recovered as expected. Taking these results into account the hypothesized mechanism was adapted to consider the multilayer protein adsorption at the oil and bubbles to explain the phenomena observed.","emulsion; aeration; droplets; protein; bubbles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-07-15","Applied Sciences","BPE","","Life Science & Technology / Biochemical Engineering","",""

Active Shape Models (ASM) is an approach that attempts to fit a Statistical Shape Model to landmarks. One possible approach is to let a user fit the model onto the MRI data by placing landmarks for ASM. Usually, the user can only see the global fit of the Statistical Shape Model; adjustments to landmarks have a global effect. This hinders the user in time-efficiently constructing a set of landmarks that maximizes the accuracy of the segmented shape. A novel landmark influence visualization is proposed that improves the usability of Active Shape Models. Landmark influence is defined as the change the model fit will undergo if a landmark is removed. The landmark influence is visualized using disk glyphs around landmarks. A region-of-interest filter can be used to inspect influence on local regions. Distance maps and animations visualize how the shape will change. A user study was performed to evaluate the visualization. No correlation was found between segmentation accuracy and the visualization. Similarly, no correlation was found between the time required for segmentation and the visualization.

The objective of the study is to perform a model-based policy analysis in order to investigate the future advancement of the System Dynamics field. The aim of this investigation is to determine what this advancement should look like and how that can be accomplished. Several steps were taken to reach the objective. First, actor groups who had a stake in the future of the System Dynamics field, even if they are outside of the System Dynamics field, were identified through a network analysis and an actor analysis. These analyses ensured that no crucial group was ignored. Members of these groups were then consulted, through over forty interviews, on their views about how the System Dynamics field would advance and what positive advancement would look like. These interviews were analyzed resulting in the identification of five main perspectives called collaboration, oversimplification, broad System Dynamics and domain support, academic growth engine, and no problem. The first three of these viewpoints were further specified into System Dynamics models and used for policy testing based on criteria determined from the interviews. From interviewee responses, five policies were identified for testing: 1) certification programs for practitioners of System Dynamics & clear labeling of System Dynamics types, 2) broadening the power base of System Dynamics, 3) setting up beneficial platforms for practical applications of SD, 4) including less traditional applications of System Dynamics in the System Dynamics Review (the main academic journal of System Dynamics), and 5) improving the network benefits of Special Interest Groups (these groups are within the System Dynamics Society, which is the main authority on System Dynamics). These policies were tested on the basis of six Key Performance Indicators as identified through interview questions. Following from this preliminary investigation, five policy combinations were identified to have the best relative effect considering the three models and all Key Performance Indicators: 1) all policies are enacted, 2) all policies except “including less traditional applications of System Dynamics in the System Dynamics Review” are enacted, 3) all policies except “setting up beneficial platforms for practical applications of System Dynamics” are enacted, 4) all policies except “certification programs for practitioners of System Dynamics & clear labeling of System Dynamics types” are enacted, and 5) all policies except “certification programs for practitioners & clear labeling of SD types” and “including less traditional applications of System Dynamics in the System Dynamics Review” are enacted. While no policy combination clearly showed an improvement across all perspectives and all Key Performance Indicators, the analysis of the models did show that policies that might work well for one perspective did not always work well for another. Further, each perspective was found to be credible and thus, no single perspective can reasonably removed. Therefore it is a main conclusion of this study that all valid perspectives should be considered while determining long-term strategy.","system dynamics; model-based policy analysis; multiple models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor)","2014","Suction caissons are a type of offshore foundation that allow for fast and noise-free installation and decommissioning of offshore structures. They have been used for 30 years in the oil and gas industry and are also becoming more common in the offshore wind sector as a promising way to cost reduction, both for foundations of single turbines and substation foundations. The suction caissons are installed by applying a differential pressure between the inner and outer sides of the caissons, which pushes the caissons into the soil. When a platform is founded on multiple suction caissons, the way the wind and wave loads are transferred through the structure and various caissons into the soil will depend on the stiffness of both the platform and the caissons. The design of the substructure and suction caissons should thus be combined to include the effects of soil-structure interaction. This is currently done by modelling the suction caisson foundations as a set of linear-elastic springs attached to the substructure. These springs are however not able to capture the non-linear behaviour that is often characteristic for soils. When the stresses in the soil increase the soil will behave softer, leading to an increase of the displacements of the suction caissons for high loads. The substructure will help decrease large differences between the displacements of the suction caissons, resulting in a more even load distribution over the foundations and thus smaller design loads for the suction caissons. This allows for smaller suction caissons and savings of material and costs. A method has been developed to model the suction caisson foundations using non-linear springs. The characteristics of the springs are determined using FEM calculations with a nonlinear soil model in the geotechnical software PLAXIS. The springs are then implemented in a structural model of the substructure and the multiple foundations in the structural software SACS. The resulting loads on and displacements of the suction caisson foundations for a test load case have been compared to results from a complete FE model and a model that uses linear-elastic springs for various soil stiffnesses. The comparison has shown that the developed model gives results that match well with the results from the full FE model. The linear-elastic model on the other hand gives results that deviate significantly for high loads. As the model with nonlinear springs is able to predict the behaviour of the soil and the substructure accurately it can be used to make a more efficient design of suction caisson foundations.","suction caissons; soil-structure interaction; offshore engineering; offshore wind; non-linear springs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-22","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore Engineering - European Wind Energy Master","",""

On the one hand, decisions regarding urban regeneration are based solely on investment costs. On the other hand, extra performances obtained by urban regeneration are described in qualitative manners. It is hypothesized that both shortcomings result in sub-optimal decision making. More optimal decision making is believed to be achieved by applying Value Engineering (VE) during the earlier stages of the design process. Herein, it aims to improve the value of a design by providing modifications that either eliminate costs that do not contribute much to the performance of a project, or adding extra performances for relatively low costs. Most successful implementations showed the use of VE in the product industry.

(mentor)","2014","Over the last decade, the costs of sequencing a human DNA molecule have been drastically reduced. It is therefore expected that the DNA sequence of patients will be used more often as a diagnostics tool in future clinical applications. However, DNA sequencers deliver millions of small fragments from random positions of the very large DNA string. These fragments are called short-reads. To assemble the short-reads such that the original DNA sequence becomes known, various software tools called short-read mappers are available. The long run-times of these tools do not favor the large-scale deployment of DNA sequencing technologies in clinical applications. Therefore, the work presented in this thesis focuses on the analysis and acceleration of one widely used mapping tool, called the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA). This tool is used to align short-reads to a reference genome. The Convey Hybrid-Core computing platform is used to implement an FPGA-based design of the BWA aln step of the algorithm. The current design has the same functional capabilities as the software, and runs over multiple cores in parallel. The hardware run-time is still between 12X and 22X longer than the software run-time. This is mostly due to using a DFS- over BFS-approach in searching and the long memory delay of the platform. However, the design still allows for many improvements; the current design does not utilize all resources and it can still be pipelined. Furthermore, the scalability of the design is better than that of the multithreaded software implementation. It is estimated that, with such improvements, the design can obtain a speed-up of up to 13X over the software implementation.","short-read alignment; genetic alignment; convey; fpga; short-read mapping; bwa; dna","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kooijman, A. (mentor); Dijkgraaf, O. (mentor)","2014","This master thesis covers the development of a grass collection system and grass catcher for Skil Urban Trimmer. The number of people that live in an urban environment is rapidly increasing. A result of this urbanization is the growing demand for products that are specialized for urban needs. This demand has driven Skil to launch the urban series: gardening tools specialized for owners of small urban gardens and little space for storage. The Urban Trimmer will be a new addition to the urban series. On average, owners of urban domestic gardens have, as one might expect, a smaller lawn area and less storage space compared to residents outside of the city. As a consequence, their needs differ and currently offered electric mowers are too bulky and their features are superfluous for these small gardens. Prices are too high and they take up too much storage space relative to the area of lawn that they are needed for. The Urban Trimmer should appeal to its target group by offering the basic features of a lawn mower in a more affordable and compact product. One of these basic features is the collection of grass clippings, the goal of this graduation project was to develop the grass collection system for the Urban Trimmer. Skil aims to achieve the compact size and low cost price, by utilizing a small electric motor and fitting it with a light-weight cutting head. This cutting head will be mounted with replaceable plastic swivel blades. Ordinary grass collection principles rely on the suction that is generated by the propeller like shape of the cutting blade. The flat swivel blades of the Urban Mower do not create the lifting airflow required for this type of collection system. A new type of collection system had to be developed within the size and cost restrictions that were set for this product. The collection system that was developed during this project utilizes the cooling-airflow from the electic motor, in combination with the circulation of air inside the deck for the collection of clippings. By utilizing these sources of energy that would otherwise be lost, power consumption is kept low. The cooling air is directed into the collection discharge at the rear of the deck. The tapered shape of the deck and the lift inducing cutting disc transport the clippings out of the trajectory of the cutting blades. From tests performed during this project it can be concluded that it is not possible to realize a reliable grass collection system within the power and price restrictions set for this product. More motor power is necessary to drive the cutting head and collection system without clogging, and the cost price of the mower exceeds the 20 dollar limit predetermined by Skil. The collection system that resulted from this project was proven to work with a small increase in motor power. In addition to the collection system, a grass catcher was designed specifically for the Urban Trimmer. This new grass catcher solves the problems that were encountered with existing collection reservoirs. The safety guard automatically opens when the grass catcher is attached, eliminating the need for a second hand during this process. The position of the connection of the bag on the top of the mower offers better visibility of the connection of the bag. The frame of the bag can be folded flat for compact storage.","Skil; lawn mower; grass collection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Kamp, L.M. (mentor); Roeser, S. (mentor)","2014","With developed markets approaching saturation, multinational corporations are directing their attention and resources towards emerging market economies (EMEs). Traditionally, multinational companies (MNCs) target the top of the economic pyramid, represented by the wealthy elite. However, there is a visible trend in MNCs exploring the potential of the untapped market at the base of the economic pyramid (BoP), which now represents the fastest growing segment of the world’s population and an enormous business opportunity. Also, MNCs are experiencing increased pressure to address rising global societal issues, including poverty and disease burdens in bottom of the pyramid segment of developing countries. The “Base of the Pyramid” debate has become a popular topic in literature. This debate focuses on the notion of “eradicating global poverty via profits”. This notion advocates that private enterprises, governmental, non-governmental organisations and the less wealthy can collaborate to achieve simultaneous economic development and social transformation, otherwise known as “inclusive innovation”. Thus, the introduction of an innovative frugal technology, in this case biosimilars, into emerging markets has the potential to foster inclusive innovation and consequently help address growing global poverty and income inequality. This research project will attempt to examine whether the hypothesis of inclusive innovation, eradicating poverty via profits, is valid and whether it has manifested in reality. This will be done using a multi-level perspective approach which takes the incumbent regime and relevant technology transitions into consideration. Furthermore, socio-technical ethical scenarios will be developed based on this multi-level perspective. The immediate results of this project show that inclusive innovation can be considered an aggregate concept composed of improved social & economic development, alleviated disease burden and profit generation by MNCs. A reduction in income inequality is considered under the auspices of economic development. In addition, inclusive innovation has an intrinsic ethical consideration to it considering its proximity to improving the quality of human life at the bottom of the pyramid. It is also a multidimensional concept that does not translate into a single positive effect, but rather transcends different variants of well-being, such as social development, economic development and disease burden. That being said one scenario to fostering inclusive innovation, the one with the most potential, is the scenario where “collaborative synergies” are employed between MNCs and EMEs. Furthermore, based on the research conducted within the context of this project, inclusive innovation is defined as both an outcome and a process which has the end goal of improving the quality of life for the bottom of the pyramid, while simultaneously generating profit for involved multinational corporations. Improving the quality of life is achieved through generating innovation- driven employment opportunities for the BoP which is expected to help improve its economic and social status.","inclusive innovation; emerging markets; biosimilars","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology Dynamics & Sustainable Development","","Management of Technology 2012-2014","",""

The hypothesis is that (changes in) Oxygen-18 concentrations in the stream should tell something about the relative contribution of fast runoff compared to slow runoff (groundwater flow) inside the stream. A conceptual hydrological model incorporating both tracer dynamics and discharge should be able to model this. Using tracer previously measured in the Brugga catchment (South-West Germany) by people of the University of Freiburg, both lumped and FLEX-Topo inspired models are developed and calibrated to this data. Results showed that of all models considered, only a FLEX-Topo inspired model, containing a variable groundwater level that is able to occasionally (partially or wholly) submerge the wetland model structure, was able to predict a decent hydrograph when calibrating purely on tracer data. The results indicate that calibration of a FLEX-Topo inspired model to only tracer data is a real possibility, and opens the door to more sophisticated modelling attempts, for instance calibration on multiple tracers or multiple tracer sampling points.","Hydrology; Tracer; Isotope; Oxygen-18; Calibration; FLEX-Topo; Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-03-31","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Hydrology","","47.897583, 7.944243"

These tough gas reservoirs have been overlooked until now due to the high economic risks of development. These risks are mainly related to the large uncertainties that exist in the reservoir architecture. Understanding the depositional processes of crevasse-splays will help in minimizing the uncertainties in interpreting the internal depositional setting and deposition processes.<br/>This research focuses on the mapping of thin bedded crevasse splays in a low-net-over-gross floodplain environment in the distal areas of the Huesca fluvial fan (Miocene) of the Ebro basin in Spain. This outcrop is a good analogue to the Permian Rötliegend and Triassic Bundsandstein intervals in the West Netherlands Basin. A field study of the Huesca fluvial fan is used to analyse the reservoir architecture (size, shape, spatial distribution and connectivity) of the reservoirs of fossil crevasse-splay deposits. At two outcrop locations an interval of crevasse-splay deposits is mapped, using detailed lithostratigraphical logs, a type section log, photo-panels and lateral characterizations of sand beds. With these data a correlation panel is constructed to determine the connectivity of the mapped layers, and cross-sections are made to determine the lateral continuity, vertical stacking and grain-size variations.<br/>On a single layer level, results show both a decrease in bed thickness and in grain size from proximal to distal, related to the energy of deposition. Grain size is also related to distributary-channel proximity, decreasing away from the distributary crevasse channels. In multi-storey stacked sheets, incision of distributary channels into underlying crevasse deposits near the crevasse apex creates sand-on-sand contact. The approximation of a crevasse splay as a simple accumulation of homogeneous sheet like layers should be refined in order to lower the uncertainties in the tough gas reservoir model. A quantitative dataset for the size, shape and stacking patterns of crevasse splay sandstone is composed, which can be used as an input in static reservoir models.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Rozendaal, M.C. (mentor)","2014","Introduction The retail industry is confronted with unparalleled change. In the supermarket industry, this change results in a predicted shift in marketshare of 4% in the coming years. This report aims to describe the change and concludes with a profitable substitute for the disappearing local grocer. Market share Rabobank (2014) predicts Lidl’s urge for expansion and the growth of online will cause a shift in market share of 4% the coming years. This means a total of 1.5 billion will change ownership. This is an unprecedented shift in market share for the supermarket industry that will produces winners and losers among the current supermarkets. Conditions According to Quirijn Bolle (Marqt), the logistic model is the most important thing when starting a new supermarket concept. According to Bart Fischer (Ahold) it is all about the right assortment, as efficient as possible at the right location, for the right price. For Ibrahim Daoudi (Ummah supermarket) the purchasing is key in running a supermarket. Animated or automated The future of retail consists of two types of experiences. One is a fully automated experience, which is guided by technologies that are supported by bright, highly trained humans. The other is a fully animated experience, where outstanding brand representatives are supported by advanced technology in delighting their customers. Zeitgeist model Bloom’s Zeitgeist model shows us that in 2022 romance wil peak. Wooden crates and chalkboards are a perfect fit for this time. After 2022, a lot of the romance will disappear and we’re going to make a transition to the ratio world. Here the computer finally becomes our best friend. Future scenario’s Four future scenario’s were created by combining the Zeitgeist model with the two future retail experiences (animated or automated). This model was used to come up with the ideas. Final Design The new supermarket concept ‘van hier & daar’ (from here and there) is a profitable substitute for the disappearing local grocers. It combines fresh products from local businesses with dry groceries from Albert Heijn and non-food from HEMA. By offering a pick up service, the small assortment increases with over 25.000 products. Branding The self describing name points to the unique combination of local fresh produce (hier) and dry groceries and non-food from Albert Heijn and HEMA (daar). Since these last two are well known and trusted players in The Netherlands (they both have a brand awareness ratio of 99%), their logo’s are used in the main logo to attract customers.","retail; supermarket","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2014","The Forze Hydrogen Racing team in Delft is developing the Forze VI; a hydrogen powered racing vehicle. To improve the vehicle dynamics for the Forze VI a torque vectoring approach is roposed. Torque vectoring provides vehicle stability control, for both vehicle accelerating and decelerating conditions by transmitting vectoring torque between the left and right wheels without deteriorating the longitudinal performance of the vehicle. In this thesis two di?erent torque vectoring control algorithms will be presented. The ?rst control algorithm is a PID and LP controller based upon a linear single-track model. The second controller is a LP controller based upon a two-track model. Both controllers are yaw rate tracking controllers. In this thesis it is assumed that a neutral steered vehicle model provides the desired yaw rate. This neutral steered yaw rate is then imposed on the Forze VI by both controllers. The dynamics of a vehicle can be very complex. The vehicle dynamics depend upon various parameters and non-linear models. For the ?rst controller a linear single-track model is used. This is a simpli?ed model of the vehicle where both the front and rear tires are assumed to be one lumped mass. With this linear model a PID controller is constructed. The LP provides the left and right rear wheel torques, from the yaw moment of the controller. The LP also takes into account the friction and engine limitations. This control algorithm is only compatible with a rear wheel drive vehicle. The second controller is based upon a non-linear two-track model. In this model each wheel is separately modeled. This means that the model is more accurate but more knowledge of the vehicle parameters is needed. With this two-track model it is possible to determine the torques for all four wheels. This means that this controller will be compatible with a four wheel drive vehicle. The LP controller is a combination of the PID and LP from the previous controller. The LP controller uses the equation of motions of the two-track model to determine the torques for the left and right rear wheels, with respect to the friction and engine limits. Both controllers show improvement of the lateral vehicle dynamics, compared to the dynamics of a vehicle with no torque vectoring. With torque vectoring the lateral acceleration is higher and therefore the velocity through corners is higher. These higher velocities through corners will translate to faster lap-times, which is the goal of this thesis. The second controller shows similar results with the ?rst controller, but seems to have a slight more aggressive control output. Both controllers determine only the left and right rear wheel torques. The potential of four wheel drive for the second controller is not simulated, as the Forze VI is only rear wheel drive. The LP controller can in the future use it's fully potential when Forze decides to build a four wheel drive vehicle.","torque vectoring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

These coastal systems have a large ecological value and are important for rich biodiversity. The Santo André Lagoon is part of a natural reserve that is officially under protection of the country. It has a rich flora and fauna and is an important place for many (protected) birds. Every year during February/March the Santo André Lagoon is breached to renewal the water and to lower the water level to prevent the birds’ nests (with eggs) from flooding built on the waterline. After breaching an inlet is shaped and closes typically within weeks. Understanding of the behaviour and morphological development of the inlet until its closure is of great importance to maintain the ecological environment. Understanding of the morphological development of this artificially breached inlet is of importance to maintain the nature and its biodiversity. Previous modelling gave more insight in the processes involved in the inlet closure, but did not succeed in reproducing its closure. Reasons for not being able to reproduce the inlet closure thought to be due to the fact several physical processes were missing and not taken into account, but may be of large importance. Physical processes, such as: wave asymmetry, infragravity waves and current feedback on wave propagation (including current refraction). In this study the morphological development of the inlet of the Santo André Lagoon is investigated using the morphodynamic model XBeach that includes the additional physical processes (that were not included in previous modelling). Besides the general development, the influence and contribution of these physical processes are investigated. Modelling of the behavior resulted in better understanding, but did not succeed in simulating the closure. It suggests onshore transport is underestimated and tide may be overestimated. The contribution of the physical processes investigated has influence on the development of the inlet that may cause the closure. Even though the inlet is not closing in the model, with this study new insight is given in the processes involved in the closure of an artificially breached inlet and interesting approaches for further research.","XBeach; process-based modelling; inlet; Santo André Lagoon; Portugal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","38.112259, -8.799431"

Deze applicatie is in eerste instantie bedoeld voor de faculteit EWI, maar moet ook makkelijk uitbreidbaar zijn voor andere faculteiten en studies van de TU Delft. Om dit doel te bereiken is een mobiele applicatie ontwikkeld voor het Android platform, wat met een paar aanpassingen ook kan worden uitgebreid naar de iPhone. Met deze applicatie worden scholieren in groepjes rondgeleid door de faculteit en worden tijdens de rondleiding vragen gesteld die inhoudelijk iets te maken hebben met de gekozen studie, faculteit of iets anders TU Delft gerelateerd. Tijdens de rondleiding zullen de scholieren naar verschillende kenmerkende locaties in de faculteit worden gestuurd alwaar ze deze opdrachten met elkaar moeten oplossen. Denk hierbij aan de /pub, de kantine of DIMES. Het uiteindelijke systeem bestaat uit drie onderdelen, de applicatie (client), de server en een website voor de opdrachtgever. De applicatie kan worden geïnstalleerd op de mobiele telefoons van de scholieren en dit is wat de scholieren zullen gebruiken tijdens de rondleiding. De applicatie is geschreven met Unity, wat het ontwikkelproces erg heeft versneld door de vele standaard functionaliteiten die Unity levert en de gratis beschikbare libraries. Verder is er gebruik gemaakt van een server om het multiplayer aspect van het spel te beheren. De client communiceert met de server door requests te sturen naar webpagina's op de server die de server verder afhandelt. Ook kan de server push berichten versturen naar de client met data dat kan worden uitgelezen door de applicatie. Om data op te slaan wordt gebruik gemaakt van een MySQL database, waar informatie over onder andere de spelers, opdrachten en de route wordt opgeslagen. Naast de applicatie is er ook een website gemaakt met behulp van het Twitter Bootstrap framework, waarmee de opdrachtgever inhoud kan toevoegen aan het spel. Met de website kan de opdrachtgever informatie zoals groepen, mijlpalen, opdrachten en routebeschrijvingen toevoegen aan de database, wat vervolgens gebruikt kan worden door de applicatie. De kwaliteit van de code was ook een belangrijke factor in het project. Het testen van de applicatie door middel van unit tests en een gebruikerstest was een onderdeel daarvan. Ook is de code naar Software Improvement Group verstuurd die de onderhoudbaarheid van het systeem analyseren. Voor het systeem is een score van vier uit de vijf sterren behaald, met een mindere score voor duplicatie en unit size. Aan de hand van deze feedback zijn er aanpassingen gedaan aan het systeem om deze onderdelen te verbeteren. Uiteindelijk is er dus een applicatie ontwikkeld dat werkt voor Android telefoons, die uitbreidbaar is voor andere studies en schaalbaar is met het aantal mensen dat naar de open dag komt. De applicatie zal echter nog wel verder worden uitgebreid voordat de open dagen beginnen. We eindigen dit verslag dan ook met aanbevelingen voor verdere toekomstige ontwikkelingen.","EWI; open dagen; game","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Technische Informatica","",""

In contrast to other sustainability frameworks it explicitly includes a business approach. The framework involves decoupling wealth from resource usage by product life extension, using renewable energy and diversity for resilient and productive systems. The framework can be seen as a solution for the end of the age of cheap resources and fossil fuels. CE is primarily promoted by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation which published three reports that primarily focus on the business case. For circular product design there is little information available. Therefore this thesis looks at what CE means for circular product design and how that can be applied by use of a case study. A Circular Design Model is proposed that identifies five main characteristics for circular design: future proof, disassembly, service, remake and recycling. Based on these five main characteristics various guidelines from literature were gathered and combined to create a Circular Design Guideline List. The list shows all relevant guidelines that can be taken into account. Based on the guideline list three tools are presented that can be used to apply circular design: a Circular Design Vision, A Circular Design Spider Map and a Circular Design Scorecard. Depending on the situation and user a simpler or a more extensive tool might be more suited. The tools have been developed by and used in a case study of the design of a circular indoor luminaire. With an understanding of LED developments and products analysis opportunities are identified for a circular indoor luminaire. A concept design has been developed that shows the application of circular design. For the concept design the main characteristics are: ease of access to the LED module and driver, easy disassembly and modularity.","circular economy; circular design; luminaire; lighting; design guidelines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Although the opportunities are extensive, organizations are struggling to find the right way to adopt more collaborative processes. Also Ahold is exploring the potential of co-creation. From the believe that every employee has the potential to produce valuable ideas, they set up an online platform to efficiently tap into employees’ creativity and bridge the gap between head office and stores. Although they are convinced of the potential value of the platform, a revision of the interaction design is needed to enlarge motivation of employees and broaden the scope of generated ideas. This graduation project attempts to redesign the current innovation platform by coming up with a co-creation solution that fits the organization’s context. The IdeasGarden is an online platform to collaborate on innovation and to support knowledge sharing with regard to running innovation projects. The platform connects and empowers people to get involved in the innovation process and to realize surprising ideas for organizational impact. The platform is moderated by concept developers of the Retail Innovation Team and accessible to all employees. The IdeasGarden platform has a diverse set of functions that inspire interaction and support a two-way dialogue. The IdeasGarden has various touch points (both online and offline) which transform online ideation into a more immersing and rich interaction during all stages of the innovation process.","co-creation; collaboration; innovation; service design; change management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

De tijdsduur die een vrouw nodig heeft om zwanger te worden, wordt gezien als een belangrijk instrument voor het vaststellen van de vruchtbaarheid van de desbetreffende vrouw. In dit verslag wordt gezocht naar de verdeling van deze tijdsduur. De meest voorkomende methoden om tot een verdeling van de tijdsduur te komen zijn de prospectieve en retrospectieve cohort studie. De prospectieve cohort studie volgt de vrouw vooruit in de tijd. De vrouw wordt gevolgd vanaf het moment waarop zij stopt met het gebruik van anticonceptie. Eindpunt van de studie is het tijdstip waarop de vrouw daadwerkelijk in verwachting is. Het verkrijgen van de data wordt in het geval van een prospectieve cohort studie bemoeilijkt, doordat het tijdstip waarop besloten wordt om zwanger te willen worden per vrouw varieert. Voor de één is dit kort van tevoren, voor de ander lang van tevoren. De retrospectieve cohort studie volgt de vrouw terug in de tijd. Beginpunt van de studie is nu het moment waarop de vrouw in verwachting raakt. Gekeken wordt wanneer de vrouw is gestopt met het gebruik van anticonceptie. Het interpreteren van een retrospectieve cohort studie wordt bemoeilijkt, doordat onvruchtbare vrouwen niet in de studie worden opgenomen. Het mag duidelijk zijn dat beide methoden moeilijkheden met zich meebrengen. In het artikel van Keiding wordt een alternatieve methode aangedragen: het current duration model.

Het blijkt mogelijk te zijn om op basis van de verdeling van deze current duration, de verdeling van de tijdsduur die een vrouw nodig heeft om zwanger te worden vast te stellen. In hoofdstuk 1 wordt het current duration model uitgebreid beschouwd en geanalyseerd. Vervolgens worden in hoofdstuk 2, 3 en 4 verschillende schatters beschouwd.

After integrating these tools, do NPCs display plausible emotional reactions under a variety of circumstances? The end result was an extension of the Entika editor with new “emotionally sensitive” objects, and the corresponding extension of the semantic engine to support emotional annotations of events in the game world.

However, this leads to a gigantic number of states with many duplicates. A near-duplicate detection algorithm can be a solution to limit the number of states found by Crawljax, while crawling the most essential, unique states. Through a literature survey it became apparent that Simhash and Broder are two state-of-the-art near-duplicate detection algorithms that are suitable for Crawljax. In this project, both algorithms are implemented into Crawljax. These algorithms have been tested extensively to determine the performance of the new duplicate detection algorithms on Crawljax in comparison with the current version of duplicate detection. The testing has been done using a separate calibration tool, which can distribute tasks over different machines to lower the amount of time needed for the tests. This calibration tool will return the number of mistakes of every near-duplicate detection algorithms for many different parameter values. This make it possible to compare the performance of the near-duplicate detection algorithms. The results of the calibration tool showed us that Crawlhash was faster, but Broder was slightly better. Additionally the so-called threshold-slider has been designed to simulate what would have happened with the state-flow-graph of a crawl if a higher threshold was used. This makes it possible to find a nice threshold for one specific web application.","Crawljax; fingerprinting; near-duplicate detection; testing","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Delft University of Technology","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","Computer Science","",""

This thesis presents a case study on an area in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, to see whether groundwaterlevel data can be used as complementary data for hydrological models of ungauged basins. It has been divided into two Hydrological Response Units (Lowland and Hillslope) with use of the surface slope and the height above the nearest drainage (HAND) algorithm. The main result is that a combined addition of groundwater level measurements and constraints did show reduced uncertainty, and thus improvement, of the internal model processes, especially the fluxes towards and out of the slow responding reservoir. Validation of these processes still remains difficult in ungauged areas, but it is believed that valid results can be made on the outflow out of the lowland areas with a combination of constraints and groundwater measurements to determine internal processes, and evaporation estimates obtained from satellite imagery to reduce the uncertainty of the total runoff out of the area.","hydrology; topography; modelling; groundwater; FLEX-topo; Baden-Württemberg; Rhine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","","48.85, 8.20"

(mentor)","2014","The technique of speed skating is unique in comparison to other sports that require human propulsion. Skaters generate a forward velocity by pushing off sideways. The ideal push-off technique is a trade-off: a more sideward directed push-off facilitates power production, but a more forward directed push-off increases the transfers rate of push-off power into a forward velocity. The exact trade-off for the ideal push-off technique is unknown. Insight in the distribution of power in more than one direction and into the energy expenditure during different push-off techniques helps a speed skater in improving his or her push-off technique to the ideal push-off technique. This study quantifies the effect of different push-off techniques on the mechanical power, power distribution and energy expenditure. The study was limited to a group analysis of three push-off techniques: the small, self-chosen and wide push-off technique. A three-dimensional power balance model was used to calculate the mechanical power in forward, sideward and upward components during speed skating. This model was driven by velocity and acceleration data, obtained by two synchronized measurement systems, and estimations of air and ice friction coefficients. The acceleration was measured by an Xsens MTI (Xsens) device and the velocity was calculated by fusing position (Local Position Measurement (LPM), Inmotio) and acceleration measurements (Xsens). The subject specific air and ice coefficients were estimated with position measurements (LPM) during gliding experiments. The mechanical power results were limited to the average mechanical powers of one representative stroke-cycle of skater and technique. The energy expenditure was estimated with steady state heart rate measurements (Polar) during speed skating. This study proved a significant difference in forward power component, sideward power component and the total mechanical power between the push-off techniques studied, as well as the energy expenditure between the push-off techniques. The sideward power increased from small to self-chosen to wide push-off technique. In addition, this study showed that the change in total mechanical power was mainly due to the change in the sideward power component and that the energy expenditure in the self-chosen technique was the lowest. The relative mechanical efficiency, the ratio between total mechanical power and steady state heart rate, was significantly different for the three different push-off techniques. In addition, the relative mechanical efficiency increased from small to selfchosen to wide push-off technique. In summary, of the three push-off technique was the self-chosen push-off technique the most energy efficient push-off technique; this technique required the lowest energy expenditure for the required forward velocity. However, this technique was not the most mechanical efficient. The total mechanical power of the wide push-off technique was generated most mechanical efficient. This is because the more sideward push-off will make the push-off velocity less independent of the moving velocity and can be freely chosen to the optimal leg extension velocity, but introduces more ’wasted power’ in non-effective movements for the performance. The selected measurement method of this study can improve the current determination of the ideal push-off technique: analyzing the important trade-off between the mechanical efficiency and push-off orientation. This method be used to identify small changes between push-off technique in the mechanical efficiency and push-off orientation, and thus be used to improve speed skating performance. However, the measurement accuracy of this method requires to be improved further.","speed skating; push-off technique; mechanical power; power distribution; energy expenditure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-07-13","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Van der Toorn, A. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Esteban, M. (mentor)","2014","Tokyo Bay is an area exposed to storm surges generated by typhoons. Consequently lowlands along its coastline are subject to flood risk. Dike walls, levees and barriers have been developed by the Japanese to protect these coastal areas. In the coming decades it is expected that a rise in sea level will occur. Also, climate change is expected to induce an increase in intensity of typhoons and therefore larger storm surges. These two circumstances would cause a need for the coast to be protected from higher water levels. The question arises whether the coastal defences of Tokyo Bay will be able to resist these future conditions in a satisfactory manner. In case there is a need for taking measures, a storm surge barrier could be an alternative course of action instead of dikes. The aim of this project has been to determine whether a storm surge barrier is a good solution for the flood protection of Tokyo Bay in the future. Moreover, a proposal for a conceptual design has been developed. The design addresses the challenges that this barrier would bring, mainly the large depths and the high seismicity of the area. Previous studies have analyzed the cost of upgrading coastal defences, considering conditions for the year 2100 and a typhoon of approximated return period of 100 years. In this report, this cost is compared to the cost of building a storm surge barrier, for the same scenario. Different locations have been studied for the barrier and the optimal one has been found to be close to the bay mouth, near cape Futtsu. The report also analyzes the convenience of using certain design conditions (sea level rise, typhoon return period). As a result, it is advised to consider as a safety standard larger return periods than the ones the Japanese have used up till now (100-200 years). Besides the cost calculation, a multi-criteria analysis is performed in order to compare all the considered options. The result is that barriers do not surpass coastal defences upgrading, if a return period of 100 years is considered. However, in case larger design return periods are applied, as recommended here, the barrier is supposed to increase its advantages, compared to the upgrading of coastal defences. The result of these considerations is a proposal for a barrier close to the bay mouth and built for a return period of 500 years. Once the overall design conditions are set for the hypothetical barrier, a layout is defined in order to satisfy the contemplated requirements and functions. The main requirements are flood protection (control water levels inside the bay during typhoons), navigational (allow shipping) and environmental (allow sufficient water exchange to protect the ecosystem inside the bay). The proposed barrier that fulfills these requirements is composed of a dam, a movable barrier part and a permanent opening. Finally, a conceptual design is developed. Part of the barrier is a dam, which would cross a long and deep section of the bay. The aim is to present an innovative design that offers advantages compared to standard solutions (rubble mound section, use of geocontainers). This thesis proposes a sand-filled geotextile structure for the dam core. This design offers a good performance during the dam lifetime, at a price that makes it competitive. The geotextile structure is composed of vertical cells and is expected to offer interesting advantages, like cost savings compared to a quarry run standard solution. Also, the expected performance during its lifetime improves with respect to other geotextile technologies, such as geocontainers. The proposed design allows for compacting the filling and avoiding gaps in the core of the structure, which is expected to help the stability of the dam and reduce the damage in case an earthquake happens.","storm surge barrier; Tokyo Bay; flood risk reduction; seismic design; geotextile cells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

Het bedrijf is de laatste paar jaar sterk gegroeid en kan zijn administratie niet meer bijhouden. Hierom is afgelopen jaar een bachelorproject gestart bij Adecs Airinfra om de administratieproblemen op te lossen door deze te digitaliseren. Drie studenten van de TU Delft hebben toen eInsight ontwikkeld, een app en website bedoeld voor hetnregistreren van uren van werknemers, zodat het management inzicht krijgt in de bedrijfsactiviteiten. Dit product is echter nooit in gebruik genomen, vanwege interne, organisatorische problemen. Het werd bovendien duidelijk dat eInsight problemen bevat op het gebied van gebruiksvriendelijkheid en synchronisatie. Ook was er behoefte aan nieuwe functionaliteiten. Hierom is dit project gestart, genaamd eInsight 2, dat als doel heeft deze problemen op te lossen en de nieuwe functionaliteiten aan het product toe te voegen. In het project is begonnen met het maken van een aanpak. Hierin is vastgesteld dat er eerst een oriëntatiefase plaatsvindt, gevolgd door het vaststellen van de eisen. Daarna wordt begonnen met het maken van het softwareontwerp en het daadwerkelijk implementeren van de software. Er wordt gewerkt volgens de scrummethodiek, wat betekent dat er elke twee weken een sprint is waarvan aan het einde getest en geverifieerd wordt met de opdrachtgever of het opgeleverde voldoet aan de eisen. Naar aanleiding van de analyse is besloten de app opnieuw op te bouwen. Het zou langer duren om de app om te bouwen dan om opnieuw te beginnen. Op de synchronizer aan de serverkant wordt op de huidige software voortgebouwd, omdat het te risicovol is opnieuw te beginnen gezien de onbekendheid met de gebruikte frameworks. In de eerste sprint zijn de eisen van het product in samenwerking met de klant vastgesteld. Daarna is begonnen aan het ontwerp van het product en aan de implementatie. Dit is na vier sprints voltooid. Er zijn tijdens het project veel acceptatietests uitgevoerd waar veel waardevolle feedback uit is gehaald. Uit de discussie blijkt dat de planning aan het begin van het project te optimistisch was. Het proces verliep soepel en technisch is er nog het één en ander op te merken. Belangrijk onderdeel is het logboek: in eerste instantie was dit een must-have, na testen bleek dat er eigenlijk geen behoefte aan was. Verder had de analyse aan het begin van het project beter gekund. In de appdatabase zijn tijdens het project problemen ontstaan met het uniek houden van records bij het gebruik van meerdere apparaten door een werknemer. Ook was een beter ORM-framework voor Android wenselijk geweest. Aan de interfacekant was het nuttiger om de code op te delen in meer verschillende activiteiten. Ten slotte bleek dat het beter was geweest om direct aan het begin geen Android 2.3.3 te ondersteunen, iets wat nu op de helft van het project is besloten, vanwege de ondervonden problemen met de interface. Uit de eerste feedback van SIG bleek dat eInsight 2 net geen drie sterren scoort. Er zijn verschillende aanbevelingen gedaan: de synchronizer zou herschreven kunnen worden voor betere integratie met de managementportal. Beide onderdelen doen veel hetzelfde, maar net even anders. Dat vermindert de onderhoudbaarheid. Aan de appkant worden meerdere interne databases per gebruiker aangemaakt. Beter is om de UUID die nu alleen voor werkdagen wordt gebruikt ook voor (sub)activiteiten te implementeren. Wat betreft de grafische interface kan in de zijbalk op een tablet in de toekomst een andere kleur worden gebruikt die minder afleidt. In de conclusie wordt duidelijk dat het project geslaagd is. Met de app is het mogelijk om van begin tot eind de werkdag van een werknemer vast te leggen en dat in real-time de (sub)activiteiten met de server gesynchroniseerd kunnen worden en inzichtelijk zijn op de managementportal. Ook zijn de reacties, van de chauffeurs en werknemers die de app testten, positief. Het proces is goed verlopen: Autohulpdienst Broekmans is dicht betrokken geweest bij de ontwikkeling van de app. Hetzelfde geldt voor het interne proces in het team.","boekhouding; administratie; app; Android; C#; ASP.NET MVC; Entity Framework","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Technische Informatica","",""

Consequently, the EU has set itself the target of reducing these emissions by 40% by 2050, compared to the 2005 level. In December 2012, the European Commission communicated that they would prefer any measure that is aimed to contribute to this goal to be implemented on a global level and via the International Maritime Organisation. Nonetheless, this report works from the assumption that, in a few years, the European Commission may still propose a regional scheme. Previous studies have shown that an emission trading system, compared to studied alternatives, is the most effective and efficient policy, when applied on a regional level. Accordingly an emission trading system has had the European Commission its preference over alternative policies and is therefore the policy analysed in this report. The few previously executed studies on the possible inclusion of CO2 emissions from the maritime sector in a regional emission trading system, predominantly concentrate on the possible environmental and economic impacts. The inclusion of CO2 emissions from aviation in the EU Emissions Trading System, however, has shown that an effective and efficient design is not necessarily enough for a successful implementation and operation of the scheme. The successfulness of a design is also determined by its (political) feasibility. The main objective of this report is to provide the Dutch Government with an advice on which design (characteristics) is most favourable for the Netherlands, considering both effectiveness and feasibility. In addition this report aims to provide some insight and guidance for the follow-up process, leading up to and during the negotiation process. This insight should assist the Dutch Government in achieving the design it favours most. In order to draw up a well-substantiated advice, two main knowledge gaps need to be filled. The first gap is the lack of knowledge about what the impacts of the designs will be, specifically, for the Netherlands. The other refers to the lack of knowledge on how the impacts of various designs influence their (political) feasibility. The information needed to fill these knowledge gaps is gathered via executing interviews with experts in various relevant fields and performing desk research on predominantly CO2 emission reductions in the maritime sector, (feasibility of) international climate policy-making and the inclusion of aviation in the EU Emission Trading System. The subject of aviation is used to conclude on lessons learned. This is of interest for this report because of the similarities between the cases. With these knowledge gaps filled, effectiveness is defined as a design’s capacity to reduce the amount of CO2 emissions. Differentiation between the different design options is made based on their cumulative reductions until 2030. Feasibility is defined as a combination of a design’s ease of implementation and operation (practical feasibility), legal feasibility and political feasibility which all have to be of a sufficient level. As practical and legal feasibility already have been addressed in a number of previous studies, this report mainly focuses on political feasibility. Political feasibility, in this report, is interpreted as the vii feasibility of gaining acceptance from the members of the International Maritime Organisation for the proposed design. Two frameworks are drawn up outlining the relevant factors and relationships that influence a design’s effectiveness and feasibility. Using these two frameworks, the lessons learned from the inclusion of aviation in the EU Emissions Trading System and an actor analysis, a solution space for feasible designs is drawn up. The solution space indicates boundaries and requirements, as well as some preferences to increase a design's feasibility and/or effectiveness. Based on this solution space, an already developed design, with known environmental and economic effects, was altered step by step into several new designs. The effectiveness and feasibility of these new designs were estimated and subsequently, compared. Figure 1 shows a schematic visualisation of the results from this comparison. As a result of this comparison, ‘design G’ is concluded to be the most favourable, for the Netherlands as well as the EU. The most relevant design characteristics are given on the next page in Table 1. A more comprehensive overview is given in Appendix P. In the second part of the policy advise – Section 7.2 – an outline is given of notions that may prove useful during the follow-up process, leading up to and during the negotiations. Most of these notions can be considered general guide lines on how different (groups of) stakeholders can be won over to support the design. In addition advice is given that reflects on suggested behaviour and focus during the negotiations. Most of the notions can, besides by the Dutch Government, be used by any other stakeholder supporting the design, like the EC. Generally, it is the task of the Dutch Government to communicate the importance of the (political) feasibility of a design to the EU Member States and the European Commission. Furthermore the Dutch Government is advised to concentrate solely on aspects of the design that are of (great) interest, specifically, to the Netherlands. This includes exempting/compensating small ships and special service ships. As a result of the corresponding objectives of and impacts on other EU Member States the remaining goals of the Dutch Government are assumed to be sufficiently represented by the other parties. It is recommended the possibility to expand the scope of the design is investigated to increase both effectiveness and feasibility. Further quantification of impacts for non-Annex I countries under a scenario with and one without common but differentiated responsibilities to assess whether compensational arrangements are needed is also advised. Table 1: Geographical scope of emissions: All CO2 emissions from ships sailing to EU ports from the last port of call, and from EU ports to the next port of call (including all intra-EU voyages) Cap: 40% reduction in emissions from bunker fuels in 2050 compared to 2005 levels (and an internal target of 10% reduction by 2030, from 2005 levels). Character of trading: Semi-open scheme: one-way link to the EU ETS, allowing ship owners to offset some of their emission reductions by buying emission rights from stationary sources Initial allocation of allowances: Partially via auctioning. The part that is auctioned starts at 5% and gradually increases with a yearly 2.5% to 50%, after which it will remain constant. Use of revenues: Mainly: Support for abatement options in the shipping sector and funding R&D in that sector Partly: refund authorities for regulatory transaction costs Ship size scope: >5000 GT Ship type scope: All ships, excluding those accountable for proportions of <1% of total emissions (e.g. offshore vessels, service vessels, yachts and fishing vessels).","Maritime sector; Emission Trading System; Carbon dioxide; Feasibility; Effectiveness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructure Systems & Services","","Transport and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Van Der Meer, J.D. (mentor)","2014","TNT is the preferred express provider of several large MedTech suppliers in Europe, delivering medical devices to hospitals with various special services. Due to competition replicating these services, TNT no longer possesses key differentiators, and is losing ground against competition. Furthermore, hospitals are innovating in their supply chain by introducing booking slots, limited opening hours and delivering at departments. Anticipation to these constraints is necessary to deliver the quality demanded by TNT’s customers. A growing number of logistical companies specialized in hospitals are offering full supply chain solutions to hospitals, leaning out their supply chain and addressing and creating these constraints. Due to the complexity of hospital supply chains, a generic solution is required for all supplies is in order create secure and transparent logistical processes. Although the supply chain aims to provide a logistical solution for all products in a hospital, specific restraints are required for medical devices. Especially the increase in lead time the generic supply chain causes is a reason for MedTech suppliers to demand their products are delivered at a departmental. The ordering process with current procurement systems of the hospital are, like the supply chain itself, generic and time consuming. To initiate a quick response from the supplier, nursing staff order products via telephone when urgently required. Furthermore, logistical processes concerning high value medical technology is often not entrusted with internal logistical personnel due to their lack of knowledge about these devices. Delivering at a department of a hospital is a complex task to perform for courier, having to cope with high levels of insufficient and inaccurate delivery information in large complex medical facilities, unavailable recipients and obstructions in access. The delivery information is highly important for a driver to find the recipient in a hospital. This information is transmitted to supplier at the moment of ordering, but is often insufficient due to the lack of knowledge of logistics with the supplier. The stream of information requires an accurate transmission of sufficient information, but instead is passed on through a large number of stakeholders making it error sensitive. Direct communication with the recipient is required to obtain the necessary delivery information. By incorporating the ordering process in the supply chain, TNT is enabled to capture accurate and complete delivery information by linking unique users to orders. Users can create an unique user account with at TNT, that captures their exact location inside a hospital and enables them to log into an application on a smartphone or website. With this application the user can execute orders, register incoming consignments, communicate with the driver, provide feedback and request delivery information. User friendly processes and barcode scanning enable in minimum 50% reduction is time spend for ordering and accepting a consignment. Furthermore, the application provides a live feed of available products and ETA of consignments. With these benefits, the application caters a trustworthy and easy to use service. Orders initiated with the application are automatically linked to an user account and therefore always equipped with sufficient delivery information. The exact information which is required for a driver to find the first drop-off location inside the hospital is pasted on partially integrated or additional routing label on the consignment. With this information an on-time and in perfect condition delivery can be executed by the driver if no discrepancies will occur. The driver is provided with an application on which the driver can rely for back-up options in case discrepancies occur during a delivery. Additional details about the first drop-off location, contact can be established with the first contact person as a first resort. If this fails, a secondary drop-off location and contact person can be approached in the same manner, providing the driver with four options to deliver the consignment despite discrepancies. As an addition, both applications establish a two-way communication between driver and recipient, informing about the delivery and enabling the user to make changes to delivery instructions. This two-way communication provides users with control and visibility in the supply chain. Investments are required for the development of user and driver applications, a print system, training for TNT drivers and training for customer service of the suppliers to facilitate this service. In return, TNT can offer their customers a high performance departmental delivery for which an additional price can be charged. In addition, TNT will save money by removing inefficient processes. Efforts are required from hospitals and suppliers to establish communication supporting the service. MedTech supplier will be provided with superior delivery service, increasing availability and therefore sales. Furthermore, MedTech suppliers can offer hospitals with a high performing departmental delivery, while eliminating or reducing cumbersome and superfluous administrative task, ultimately increasing profitability. Due to the value of hospital knowledge for express providers and the assumption that users prefer to use a single account for all orders, a quick implementation is required to stay ahead of competition. A roadmap is provided in which advice is given on the implementation of this service.","supply chain; MedTech; hospital; E-procurement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product in Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","This study was aimed to develop a method for the rapid assessment method of the influence of intended bay developments on the bay’s flushing conditions. The study was focused on tidally dominated, small-scale, shallow water coastal bays. Because water is the carrier of (polluted) material, the exchange with the external water body, or flushing, is a crucial determinant in the water quality (TAKEOKA, 1984). The average residence time as defined by TAKEOKA (1984) was found to be the most suitable indicator for flushing. A method of the box type was developed to estimate the average residence time. The method is based on basic bay and forcing parameters of which the individual influences on the flushing were derived by the use of a schematic 2D numerical model, following the systematic approach of a dimensional analysis. The application of the resulting analytical equation to real cases was validated by comparison of the average residence times derived by the rapid assessment method (RAM) and those resulting from detailed flushing studies. The dispersion coefficient was used as a calibration parameter. The relative influence of the parameters on flushing was validated for the Kuwait Bay and Boston Harbour. However for Venice Lagoon the results were unrealistic. Finally, the performance of the RAM was tested by the use of a detailed numerical model of Doha Bay as a reference. The influence of a variety of hypothetical changes to the bay’s bathymetry and geometry and two actual intended developments was estimated through the RAM. Comparison of the resulting relative changes of the average residence times to those derived by the numerical model showed that the RAM was valid under certain assumptions. The largest point of concern is the way the influence of the inlet characteristics is represented in the RAM. This RAM is not applicable to bays with shallow inlets. Furthermore, although the absolute values are not the primary concern, the RAM seems to underestimate the ‘actual’ average residence times due to the exaggeration of the mechanism of tidal pumping. To conclude, the developed rapid assessment method in its current is a valuable tool to assess the relative influence of relatively large scale bay changes on the flushing conditions of bays with a deep inlet channel. However, to enhance the area of application, further research on the influence of the inlet characteristics on the flushing process is recommended.","Flushing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Happee, R. (mentor)","2014","Electronic stability control (ESC) has been shown to reduce the accident rate in a number of situations. Therefore, it is important to keep improving ESC and other control systems. One way to do this is by improving the available information on the state of the vehicle and its environment. The tire-road friction coefficient µ is particularly important, as it limits the maximum possible tire forces. Literature shows that systems like ESC, ABS, torque vectoring and adaptive cruise control all benefit from knowledge of µ. In this study, a new estimation method is proposed to estimate µ, using tire forces. The method works in the non-linear region of the tire and for combined slip conditions. For each tire, µ is estimated using an extended Kalman filter, together with a magic formula tire model. The algorithm then selects the estimate with the lowest uncertainty. The method is developed in Matlab, and evaluated with a CarSim vehicle model under braking, steady-state cornering and for a double lane change. The results show that this estimator is promising first step. It succeeds to estimate µ when the tires are at their limit, but is less successful at lower slip levels. An explanation is that the effect of µ on the slip-slope is not present in CarSim. In the real world, a relationship exists between µ and the slip-slope, so that the estimator has the potential to work for lower levels of slip. Therefore, the proposed next step is to evaluate this estimation method on a real vehicle.","tire-road friction coefficient; extended Kalman filter; on-line parameter estimatio; vehicle dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-07-12","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

The results of this research project are far from the complete picture of the mechanical stratigraphy of this outcrop, but the following conclusions are a start:  Current data suggest that the outcrop contains a pre folding NE-WSW conjugate set that continued on in the early stages of folding which eventually lead to sub parallel NE dipping fractures. During folding NW dipping fractures were formed.  Fracture height is not limited by bed thickness.  Current data suggests that white limestone beds are thinner than the red limestone beds.  Current data suggests that the mechanical properties of the white and red limestone are similar.

(mentor); Larsen, C.M. (mentor)","2014","Though booming, offshore wind development is constrained by its high cost. One potential way to meet this challenge is to reduce the uncertainty in wave modeling and hydrodynamic loads calculation model for offshore wind support structure design. The thesis covers two aspects for calculating loads acting on a offshore wind support structure: an improved hydrodynamic load model and a modified higher order wave model. In studying hydrodynamic load model, FNV and Rainey's methods, both intended to explain third order phenomena observed on offshore slender structure, are compared and analyzed to solve the surface piercing problem, critical for a slender structure at an extreme sea state. Rainey's new equation is preferred over FNV. Second order irregular wave model, a simple higher order stochastic wave model, enables it to include non-linear contributions from waves. Analysis focuses on how the modified wave model affects wave surface elevation, wave power spectrum and wave kinematics. With improved hydrodynamic load model and wave model introduced, there are in total six methods available to calculate the loads acting on a slender offshore wind support structure. The proposed six methods are invstigated by comparing load statistics and corresponding power spectrum of shear force and bending moment at foundation base. The implementation of non-linear models increases foundation shear and bending moment by 1% to 34% For a floating type support structure, the analysis concentrates on dynamic response of structure, including spar hull and mooring lines. With the assistance of numerical tool RIFLEX, the non-linear dynamic problem is solved in time domain by displaying displacements and forces at targeted sections on mooring lines and cylinder hull. It is observed that the low frequency components exerts a reduction effect on maximum axial force on mooring lines, while higher order frequency effects are absent. Based a simple long term extrapolation, environmental contour line method, the reduction effect is predicted to be 9% at the mooring line for a 50-year sea state. When it comes to fatigue analysis, second order irregular wave model only slightly differs damage level at cylinder hull around surface piercing point, but greatly reduce cycle numbers on mooring lines.","offshore wind; nonlinear wave loads; contour line method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore Engineering","","","",""

A significant fraction of these applications use cloud infrastructure to cope with this vast amount of data. Commercial clouds use virtualized environments, but most distributed applications are designed around the idea that they run on physical hardware. When this is no longer the case, guarantees for an application’s reliability and performance no longer hold. To remedy this issue, we design a powerful and comprehensive system called Nebu. Nebu is able to provide information about the physical topology of the cloud to the distributed application and is capable of automated virtual machine and application deployment. Nebu performs these tasks without depending on any single distributed application or virtual machine manager. Instead, Nebu provides efficient APIs that make it easy to provide compatibility with many popular distributed applications and virtual machine managers. We develop Nebu as an open source project using modern software engineering practices. In particular, we use the agile development method Scrum in combination with the Kanban scheduling system. We apply iterative API design through the use of RAML and supporting UML diagrams. Because no effective methods for testing distributed applications have been developed, we use both unit testing and manual testing. We also apply automated regression testing through the use of continuous integration. Because there are no formal guidelines on how to validate distributed applications for the kind we investigate in this work, we develop Nebu and perform real-world experiments with multiple distributed applications using an enterprise multi-cluster infrastructure. These experiments show that Nebu enables applications to give guarantees about reliability without degrading their performance. To increase Nebu’s usability, we provide extensions that offer compatibility with the distributed applications Hadoop and MongoDB, and virtual machine manager VMware.

The fractures are digitized in 3D using OpenPlot software. OpenPlot can automatically calculate the orientation of every fracture. The length has to be calculated in Excel. Stereonet is used for further processing of the data. Gocad is used to calculate the fracture intensity of different areas of the outcrop. There are two fracture sets in the outcrop, they are perpendicular to each other. One of the sets is perfectly vertical after back rotating, the other set has a dip angle of about 60 degrees after back rotating. Both sets consist of conjugate fractures with an angle of 40 – 50 degrees between the two systems. In large areas of the outcrop only one of the two conjugate systems is developed, so the conjugate fractures are not always visible. The fracture intensity can also show big differences throughout the outcrop, there are a few places with a much lower fracture intensity. The software used in this project can cause some problems, which can result in deviations and errors in the data. The software actually is usable for 3D fracture modelling if the problems are known in advance and are taken into account.","Alima anticline","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Applied Geology","","34.336476, 8.334732"

This thesis focuses on the decision for a top-down (TD) or bottom-up and network oriented (BN) strategy. There seems to be a trend in Dutch housing away from TD strategies and towards more BN strategies. However, there are still municipalities which apply TD strategies. This has raised the main question in this research: Why do some Dutch municipality apply a top-down strategy while others apply a bottom-up and network oriented strategy to develop dwellings? The mechanisms behind the decision of a Dutch municipality to apply a TD or BN strategy in Dutch housing have been analysed by using theoretical concepts of network theory and urban governance, by conducting an analysis of the conditions in the Dutch housing system, an analysis of the development of strategies and the accompanied conditions and through three case studies. The main conclusion is that the more a municipality is operating in a network of interdependencies, the more a BN strategy is required. The presence of a network of interdependencies can be determined by analysing the presence of the variety, closedness, interdependency and dynamics in the network of parties. The more these four network conditions are present, the more one operates in a network of interdependencies.","Dutch Housing; Network theory; Urban governance; Top-down; Bottom-up","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-07-07","Architecture and The Built Environment","OTB Research","","Housing Studies, Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","","52.002729, 4.370284"

De onderzoeksvraag bij deze dataset is ""Is het relevant om te controleren op prostaatkanker bij mannen tussen de 54 jaar en 75 jaar"". Om deze vraag te beantwoorden is gebruik gemaakt van verschillende analyses. Bovendien zijn twee datasets gesimuleerd. Survivalanalyse is een methode om te analyseren hoe lang het duurt tot een gebeurtenis plaatsvindt. In de geneeskunde is dit een vaak gebruikte analyse. Survivalanalyse wordt vaak toegepast op data waarvan alleen bekend is dat tot het einde van het onderzoek de gebeurtenis niet plaats gevonden heeft, dit heet rechts-gecensureerde data. Dat de gebeurtenis niet plaatsvindt tijdens het onderzoek kan meerdere oorzaken hebben. In de geneeskunde komt het vaak voor dat data rechts-gecensureerd is doordat een persoon overleden is door een andere gebeurtenis, waardoor de onderzochte gebeurtenis niet plaats kan vinden. Dit heet een competing risk. Standaard survivalanalyse gaat er vanuit dat het tijdstip van censuur onafhankelijk is van het tijdstip waarop de gebeurtenis plaatsvindt. Als de gebeurtenis niet plaatsvindt door het optreden van een competing risk, is deze aanname in het algemeen niet waar. In dit geval moet gebruik gemaakt worden van competing risk analyse. De twee competing risk modellen die het meest gebruikt worden zijn het oorzaak-specieke hazardmodel en het model van Fine en Gray. Voor de gesimuleerde datasets geldt dat bij dataset 1 de ene groep meer kans heeft op de beoogde gebeurtenis dan de andere groep. Bij dataset 2 zijn de kansen op gebeurtenissen gelijk. Na analyse van deze datasets volgt de conclusie dat als er verschil is in het aantal personen dat overlijdt aan de beoogde gebeurtenis, dit ook naar voren komt uit de resultaten. Voor de prostaatkanker-data geldt dat de competing risks de doodsoorzaak domineren. Daardoor komt uit een globale analyse een ander resultaat dan uit een meer nauwkeurige analyse. Uit meer nauwkeurige analyse volgt dat het relevant is om te controleren op prostaatkanker bij mannen tussen de 54 jaar en 75 jaar.","competing risks; prostaatkanker; survivalanalyse","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","This thesis investigates whether interval methods can be employed in the construction of a novel controller synthesis algorithm based on backward induction. Interval methods are methods employing interval arithmetic, which is an arithmetic defined on real-valued intervals rather than on real-valued numbers. In the controller synthesis algorithm presented in this thesis interval methods are used to determine pre-images, represent approximations of closed sets, implement operations on these sets, and solve non-linear constrained optimisation problems without the need for derivatives. While interval methods only impose modest requirements, i.e., they require that interval extensions of the difference equation describing (or approximating) the plant dynamics, cost function, and inequality constraints can be constructed, they do however suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In the presented synthesis algorithm the curse of dimensionality limits practical use to systems for which the number of states and control inputs are relatively low. The thesis can be divided into four parts: - The first part of this thesis (Chapters 2, 3 and 4) introduces interval arithmetic, a number of interval methods, and set computation. - In the second part of the thesis (Chapter 5) the controller synthesis algorithm is presented and implemented using the concepts presented in the first part of the thesis. - In the third part of the thesis (Chapter 6) the implemented synthesis algorithm is successfully used to generate, and test the viability of, controllers for two benchmark problems. - The fourth part (Chapter 7) concludes the thesis, gives recommendations for improving the synthesis algorithm and suggests a number of topics worth considering for future research. In conclusion, this thesis shows that interval methods can be used to construct a controller synthesis algorithm for non-trivial control problems.","control; controller synthesis; optimisation; interval methods; interval arithmetic; dynamic programming; backward induction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-07-07","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems & Control","",""

(mentor); José, J. (mentor); Alberto, C.M. (mentor)","2014","This thesis aims to assess some of the most relevant potential implications of a recently approved new methodology for establishing the cost of energy of the Spanish regulated electricity tariffs for low-voltage consumers, which substitutes a much different previous methodology: * The previous methodology was based on quarterly auctions (so-called CESUR auctions). The resulting price of these auctions was used to set the cost of energy to be included in the regulated retail tariffs for the next quarter, and so, it was a methodology that allowed the consumers to pay a price for electricity which was known ex-ante by them, and which was stable for the following quarter. * The new methodology is based on a real-time pricing (RTP) approach. It implies that the last-resort retailers will charge their consumers in their (usually bimonthly) bills, a cost of energy based on an electricity-market average-hourly price of the billed period. This average-hourly price is calculated using real hourly prices of day-ahead and intraday markets, as well as an hourly load curve for each consumer. This hourly load curve could be either the actual one if the consumer has a smart meter allowing for hourly metering, or an average one calculated by the system operator if the consumer does not have such a smart meter. Thus, this new methodology opens the door, to those consumers with smart meters, to save costs by implementing new demand-response actions by shifting their demand from hours with high prices to hours with low prices. More concretely, the specific questions that this thesis attempts to answer are: * Will the consumers pay more or less than what they used to pay with the previous methodology? How much? * What will be the maximum savings that the consumers with a smart meter may obtain if they optimize their consumption profile? * What will be the consequences if, instead, they follow the worst possible profile? To answer the above, this thesis proposes and implements an innovative approach, which goes beyond current state of the art, providing the following original contributions: * A sophisticated bottom-up model for generating realistic consumers’ load-profiles, based on: - A detailed representation of the technical characteristics of electric domestic devices or services (DoS); - A realistic characterization of the use of these DoS in Spain based on statistics on socio-demographic data. * A detailed optimization model to simulate optimal demand-response strategies of individual consumers that minimizes their electricity costs by shifting their demand to hours with lower prices subject to restrictions based on both technical and behavioral considerations. In this thesis, this approach has been applied to a realistic case study based on data of 2010 for Spain. The main conclusions of the analysis carried out are: * If the new methodology for establishing the cost of energy would had been approved in 2010, the average annual electricity costs’ savings obtained by those consumers without smart meters which are billed according to the average standard load profile published by the system operator would had been of 12.55% with respect to the actual costs they paid for electricity that year, with an standard deviation of 1.02%.3 * Those consumers with smart meters, that are billed according to their actual consumption profile, would had obtained slightly higher annual savings of 12.78% in average, with a standard deviation of 1.59%, just by following the same consumption profile they had without responding to real time price signals. * At a monthly level, the higher savings are obtained those months with lower average and higher standard deviation on hourly prices. Main reason for this is that for those months with lower hourly prices, the cost of energy established ex-ante through the CESUR auctions was significantly higher than actual hourly prices. So just by changing the methodology to an ex-post establishment of the cost of energy based on actual electricity hourly prices, significant savings would have been obtained. * If those consumers with smart meters, instead of following the same demand profile they actually had, would had responded to real time prices, shifting their demand to those hours with lower prices, they could have achieved additional annual costs’ savings of 6.33% in average. On the other hand, non-rational consumers following the worst load profile possible would have suffered average costs’ increases of 3.21%. *Above figures are based on perfect-flexibility assumptions. That is, they could only be obtained by consumers equipped with a kind of smart-box that would allow them to optimize and manage each DoS without restrictions regarding when to switch on and off them. On a more realistic situation with consumers not equipped with this device, considering that, usually, they will not be awake at certain hours to switch on or off some DoS (i.e.: from 1 am to 7am), the average annual maximum costs’ savings estimated by the case study of this thesis are of 4.35%. In this case, an average consumer following the worst profile possible would have seen its annual costs increasing by 2.92%. * On a monthly basis, those months presenting a higher volatility with regard to day-ahead hourly prices are those in which rational consumers obtain higher savings. This is due to the fact that higher volatility implies higher differences of prices between different hours, and so, more opportunities to obtain savings by shifting demand from expensive to cheap hours. In the analyzed cases, these months are usually those with the lowest average day-ahead price. The reason for that is that these months were usually those with a higher penetration of variable wind energy, which introduced higher volatility. * Although maximum annual average savings obtained through demand-response strategies in both cases, with (6.33%) or without a smart-box (4.35%), are not negligible, when expressed on absolute terms, these would have meant annual average savings of 8.78 euros and 5.96 euros respectively in 2010. Thus, consumers with a smart-box that could shift their demand to hours between 1 am and 7 am, could obtain 2.82 euros more of additional average annual savings than consumers without such a smart- box. On the other hand, non-rational consumers following the worst profile possible do not obtain significantly different losses when they can shift their demand to the period 1 am – 7am and when they cannot. * In any case, the observed savings are probably a low incentive for consumers to change their consuming behavior (although higher market electricity prices could increase this incentive). Thus, this thesis suggests that in a context of electricity market prices similar to those in 2010, it seems that, if regulatory authorities still aim to modify consumers’ demand profile, provided that they consider this important enough to reduce other system costs (i.e.: system operation costs; required additional investments on new generation and network capacities to cope with peak demand; etc.), they will have to think on additional measures beyond a mere real time pricing of electricity to provide incentives attractive enough for consumers to modify their behavior.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-07-18","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Policy and Management","","EMIN","",""

(mentor); Bouman, E. (mentor)","2014","The amount of people using smartphones to access shared content has rapidly grown in the last couple of years. Popular services to share the media all rely on a client/server model, which have scalability issues and are prone to censorship. A decentralized approach would make censorship more difficult and growth more sustainable. Thus the main research question of this project is: How can Android users search and stream media in a decentralized way? In answer of this question, an Android application was developed that enables decentralized searching and downloading of torrents and streaming of video torrents. After a Research Phase and a Design Phase, which took a week each, the Scrum software development strategy was used during the Implementation Phase. This phase was divided over three sprints of two weeks, during which several requirements, as defined by the MoSCoW model, were implemented. These three sprints resulted in three iterations of prototypes, of which the last one implemented all must have requirements, three out of four should haves and even two could haves. The resulting application is based on Tribler, a fully decentralized BitTorrent client, which was developed by the Parallel and Distributed Systems (PDS) research group at the Delft University of Technology. As Tribler is written in Python, a language not supported by Android, a modified version of the Kivy Python for Android framework was used. The reuse of the Tribler code results in a more maintainable codebase, as no additional modications are needed. To provide a native Android experience to the user, an Android Graphical User Interface (GUI) was developed in Java. Because the standard means of communication between the Tribler process (Python) and the Android GUI (Java) are limited, they communicate via XML Remote Procedure Calls (XML-RPC). This has the added benefit of providing a simple Application Programming Interface (API) to the Tribler process, which could be reused in versions for iOS or Windows Phone, or to run Tribler as a headless server. Decentralized data exchange is handled by both libswift, used for small metadata (such as thumbnails), and libtorrent, which is used to download torrent files. Both these libraries had to be ported to Android, of which the latter was generously provided by the Android Tor Tribler Tunneling (AT3) team. In addition, the VLC for Android player was also integrated. The communication between Tribler and VLC goes through a Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server integrated in Tribler, which is used to stream media directly to the user. The reuse of Tribler code also has some drawbacks: high definition content can not be streamed reliably on low end hardware, such as the Samsung Galaxy Nexus (2011). More recent hardware, such as the LG Nexus 5 (2013), has no such problems. With smartphones rapidly getting faster (following Moore's Law), this was deemed as an acceptable trade-off.","Tribler; decentralized; bachelor; streaming; BitTorrent","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Technische Informatica","",""

Despite this, the Internet in all its forms and protocols has proven to be extremely sensitive to manipulation by forces in control of the infrastructure of the Internet. Along with the growth of The Internet came the growth of censorship and filtering by governments. Governmental forces across the world have filtered, blocked and eavesdropped network traffic for both economic and political reasons. This thesis focuses on the question of how filtering techniques and data censorship introduced by overseeing (governmental) forces can be circumvented. The challenge is to offer a fully autonomous and anonymized network of interconnected users with high-quality experience. Along with this research, software has been implemented which enables the buildup of a file sharing network, where data is hard to trace and downloaders are indistinguishable from other users of the network. It forms the basis for a future anonymous network. This thesis and the developed software are a proof-of-concept which can and will be further developed by the Tribler team at the Delft University of Technology. This thesis introduces the `p2p onion router', an anonymized network where high bandwidth can be achieved. This makes it more attractive than alternatives such as TOR for multimedia streaming. A new cryptographic approach based on the existing counter mode is introduced. This enables packet loss and packet reordering in stream ciphers, in order to utilize the benefits of BitTorrent traffic in onion routing.","anonymity; peer-to-peer; Internet; TOR; Tribler; p2p","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Parallel and Distributed Systems group","","","",""

(mentor); Vermeeren, A.P.O.S. (mentor)","2014","This master graduation project is focused on designing an E-learning portal, for home-care managers and planners, to learn working with Careware. Careware is an hour registration program (accessed by web-portal) from helpLine B.V. that provides IT support for care providers. It enables caregivers to access more functionalities and data in comparison to other software. This software helps users to create detailed schedules, time registrations and provide all kinds of information needed for this care sector. Careware is divided into two systems. The main part is an Internet portal, running on PC’s (used by managers and planners). The other part is an application running on smart devices (Android, Apple iOS) used by caregivers. The users face problems in learning to operate the software. Only one day of training is offered to familiarize them with the software. The main purpose of the E-learning portal is to teach its users the basic skills of Careware. The analysis of Careware is made by exploring the software and its current context. To get to know the context of Careware, observations of the current trainings are performed. With the information gathered from these researches the decision to continue the project focussing on the PC users (webportal of Careware, the planners’s software of Careware) has been made. Not only will the E-learning portal be used to teach the basic skills to users, it also offers support to planners and managers when doing their daily activities. Through gathering this information a more detailed research about the context of planners and their daily activities is performed. The detailed research starts with a literature research to gather information about online learning. By conducting interviews, the use and learning of Careware has been further explored. The literature research concluded in an E-learning delivery method, teaching approaches and strategy for the portal, where users can choose between a linear and non-linear learning path. By conducting interviews with a teacher and a few planners, the usage and learning of the Careware PC platform has been researched. Concluded from these interviews was that each organization has its own way working with Careware, some using different modules than others, to complete their daily activities. Learning the basic skills is the same for each organization. By defining the functions & features, having a list of specifications, an information structure and a flowchart, the design was created and discussed. With the help of the gathered information from the previous researches the E-learning portal is divided into four modules: Learning Content, Community, News and Playground. Learning Content The learning content module focuses on teaching the basic skills of Careware to the users of the E-learning portal. The content has been divided into different categories, where each category consists of instructional videos and manuals to learn specific topics. The topics are created regarding the existing Careware trainings. Each category ends with a test to keep track of the learning progress. To offer a non-linear learning path, the levels will not necessarily have to be taken in a specific order. By using the search option, users have the possibility to search for individual videos and manuals. Community The community module builds a ?connection and discussion platform between planners and managers of all companies using Careware. A questions & answers section will be included to help users to get feedback on their work Groups can be created to refer to the teams planners and managers are working in. In these groups, users can exchange documents or discuss schedules. News To centralize information and make users aware of important updates and/or news, users can navigate to the news module. This module consists of information from the organization and/or Careware. Playground The playground offers users an option to test the software without working in the actual environment. Users can try out new features or test their knowledge. After creating an interactive prototype, an evaluation is performed to gain feedback from users for the improvement of the E-learning portal. The design of the portal was appreciated by all participants and made them feel comfortable using the portal. The navigation was clear and participants understood what they could expect of the different tabs. Design improvements have been made based on the evaluation results from these tests. For further development, recommendations are provided to optimize the implementations of the E-leanring portal. These consist of: more extensive user tests to improve the design and optimize the learning content, good consultation with the development department of helpLine B.V. and introduction and promotional activities to let more users know and join the platform and community. The portal has not only been designed to teach users the basic skills of Careware, but also to build a community that allows users to create discussion, feedback and ask questions among users of all organizations. The portal allows users to test Careware, without having to start the actual Careware website on their computers. In comparison to the original training, users are now more independent and can decide their own learning curve.","Online Learning; Careware; E-learning; helpLine B.V.","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2014","In this thesis a morphodynamic model of a tidal embayment, first studied in Schuttelaars & de Swart (1996), will be described and investigated. The difference with the rectangular embayment in Schuttelaars & de Swart (1996) is that the width is described with an exponential function. We focus here on the width averaged solutions. This gives us a cross-sectional averaged system of equations similar to an one-dimensional system. For the sediment transport a bed load and a suspended load transport model are considered. We also distinguish the situation with and without an externally prescribed overtide. In the situation without overtide the forcing at the seaward side is described with a basic tide. Including the overtide means that we also use higher harmonics in the forcing at the seaward side. The equilibrium bed levels are calculated for each sediment transport model. This shows that for bed load transport the width variations do not have a lot of influence. The resulting equilibrium bed level is exactly the same as the one in Schuttelaars & de Swart (1996). For suspended load transport are three models used: advectively dominated, diffusively dominated and combined sediment transport. The equilibrium bed level for advectively dominated transport is hardly influenced by the varying width because the velocity is compensating the effects of the change in width. For diffusively dominated transport the equilibrium bed level becomes convex for a converging embayment and concave for a diverging embayment. The combined suspended load transport without the externally prescribed overtide shows that the equilibrium bed level is similar to the diffusively dominated transport. For the situation with the externally prescribed overtide the effective length of the embayment decreases for large values of the relative width scale. For these values the model does not apply.

(mentor); Cunningham, S.W. (mentor); De Vries, L.J. (mentor); Oruc, S. (mentor)","2014","In the last few decades, the European Union has directed most of its efforts towards the creation of an internal market, free of internal borders, where competition reigns and the invisible hand guides the market to a social optimum. The assumptions on which this ideal is based, however, do not always hold in practice, especially when it concerns a good as peculiar as electricity, which sets itself apart from other commodities through a number of its physical characteristics. In their attempt to safeguard their strategic objectives of acceptability, accessibility and affordability of power for end users, policy makers face two strategic challenges, arising largely from the physical characteristics of electricity: market power and Congestion. Congestion may be dealt with in a number of ways, but congestion management schemes strongly impact the dynamic interactions in the market, possibly exacerbating market power. Given the high cost associated with ”getting it wrong”, a thorough understanding of the workings of these mechanisms is required. This thesis aims to increase the understanding of Financial Transmission Rights, a risk hedging tool for market parties in electricity markets with inter-zonal price uncertainty. More specifically, the work herein attempts to better understand the strategic bidding options producers have, and the effectiveness of market regimes designed to counteract them. By measuring the welfare allocation and price distortion that result from strategic producer bids, the policies can be contrasted to a no-policy scenario, and their effectiveness may be assessed. The methodology used in this thesis is that of a multi-level optimisation procedure, based on supply function equilibria for generation portfolios consisting of multiple generators. Producer action spaces are discretised using multipliers based on the competitive scenarios. Once the action spaces have been defined, each action combination in the upper level problem (the market for FTRs) results in a static non-competitive Nash equilibrium of the lower level problem (the power market), which is obtained by solving the market for all possible action combinations given the FTR strategy, and determining the equilibrium strategies. Using these results to populate the pay-off matrix for the upper level problem, the Nash equilibrium in this upper-level problem determines the outcome for the given parameter space. The interpretation of results is limited by the assumptions of the market being a duopoly and fully static, absence of price elasticity of demand, complete information, and imperfect information regarding the true cost functions of generators. These assumptions correspond to what might be termed a worst-case scenario for policy makers. The conceptual model is translated into a Python-based simulation environment. This environment is then used to determine effectiveness of the following policies in a network consisting of three nodes, four generators and one load-serving entity: a hybrid transmission right, largely corresponding to an FTR with a use-it-or-lose-it clause, and a hedging-only requirement imposed on the FTR portfolios producers hold. The former policy aims at counteracting the leverage effect from losses in one market on profits in the other, while the latter focuses purely on countering sign changes of nodal price differences. Analysis leads to the following insights: The strong interdependency between FTR and power markets is once more shown: producers are able to leverage losses in the power market against greater gains in the FTR market. Evidence is found for producers being able to leverage their FTR profits by taking small losses in the power market. The Hybrid policy has some success mitigating this. No evidence is found for behaviour causing nodal price differences to change sign; as a result, the Hedge policy has a detrimental effect due to reduced competition. While the research presented in this thesis provides a necessary and useful first step towards a better understanding of strategic interaction in coupled markets, it is far from a definitive judgement on the issue. Further research is recommended to focus on one of the following areas: the generalisation of this work to include a more dynamic power market; an empirical analysis of existing combined FTR-electricity markets; or a comparison to the susceptibility of other congestion management schemes to strategic behaviour.","Financial Transmission Rights; Market Power; Policy Design; Convex Optimisation; Non-Cooperative Game Theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","SEPAM","",""

Characteristics of the process are that the process is based on a single piece flow concept and that editing is done on the physical cover. This results in mostly sequential work. In this report an overview of a study on predicting the layout of a balanced production line for future ramp up rates is done. In order to get an overview, working schedules are created based on input and output parameters as shown in Figure 1. New relations are found and techniques for the creation of the schedules are designed. And a model is made that point out the factors that influence balancing a line most. The model is explained extensively. It is advised to follow the point of the checklist in Figure 2, when making the schedules that help to get insight in future rates. Also the influence of working on Saturdays is studied. It is concluded that scheduling the work in the 2S12 shift model can reduce the total cycle time and therefore the amount of moulds in the process compared to the 2S10 shift model at the production rate of 6,06 ACs/month. Also the amount of available production rates in order to balance is more for the 2S12 model. Fur the future ramp up scenarios it can be said that the rates that can be reached are 4 5/9, 6, 9 and 12 1/8. And in the 2S12 scenario also the rates 6 5/6 and 13 2/3 can be reached.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-09-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

In order to do this, QGIS is used to determine the watershed and river paths based on ASTER GDEM satellite data, and to classify the land cover based on Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite data. The results generated by QGIS are compared to open source available datasets and high resolution Google Earth Pro images. The watershed and river paths determined in QGIS are accurate for high relief areas. In low relief areas, the results are not trustable. Here, the watershed and river path results seems to be controlled by the errors in the ASTER GDEM data. The resolution of the used Landsat 7 ETM+ is not large enough to distinguish various rock types accurately. A map that indicates the amount of clay within the basin could be created using the Landsat 7 ETM+ images though. Lithological classification using satellite images is a promising technique, with a lot of applications. However, to perform accurate lithological classification higher resolution satellite images and more detailed lithological information is necessary.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

(mentor)","2014","By signing the Valletta Treaty, several countries have obliged themselves to save archaeological heritage sites and fund relevant research. UNDERSTRESS is a proposal for funding which does research and provides data to predict damage done to such archaeological site by construction of linear infrastructure. As a preliminary study this BSc thesis is carried out in the framework of UNDERSTRESS. Although research has been done on archaeological artefacts embedded in sand, charred organic seeds have not been investigated thoroughly yet. The sand, which comes from a depot near Dronten in the Netherlands, has been used because multiple archaeological artefacts have been found in that sand layer. As analogue for the charred organic seeds coco pops, the cereal, have been used. The characteristics of the sand as well as of the coco pops have been investigated. A falling height of fifty centimetres has proven to create a reproducible density. To test the damage to the coco pops samples have been triaxial tested with a vacuum pressure applied of 80 kPA. This vacuum pressure create an effective confining pressure of 80 kPA as well. With the falling height and the confining pressure, a sample configuration in which two layers of coco pops are placed, the damage to those coco pops is zero when applied to a strain of five millimetres. The damage is made visible by using 3D visualising software called Avizo. The grain have not been damage during that test and they have not reallocated as well. For another configuration the coco pops did not react the same. The entire sample was filled with coco pops and sand as supporting material and this time the strain was 15 millimetres. Three scans made at three different times during the loading show that the coco pops are not damaged until after the sample has reached its maximum stress. All the damage to the coco pops as well as the reallocation of the coco pops happens between the peak stress and the unloading. At the slice where the radial deformation of the sample is the largest are all coco pops are damaged with most of them crushed. Two centimetres above and below this slice, the coco pops are partially damage and further away from this slice, the coco pops are not damaged. In total, 10 percent is damaged during the loading. The coco pops are damaged so severely, not much information they have stored would be available if it were charred organic seeds. The charred organic seeds do have twice the strength of a coco pop according to earlier research.","charred seeds; triaxial test; sand pluviation; tomography","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2014","Exact is a global supplier of business software. Their online business solution, called Exact Online provides its users with a toolkit for Customer Relationship Management (CRM), HR, logistics and manufacturing with a particular focus on small- and medium sized businesses. Salesforce is a popular CRM system that is used by companies worldwide. Exact’s recent focus with Exact Online is on creating an ecosystem of (partner) companies around Exact Online by opening up data via an Application Programming Interface (API), offering a set of mobile apps, and by offering the possibility to integrate data from Exact Online into other business applications. For this Bachelor project, a project group consisting of two students created a plugin framework and a set of plugins that enable Exact to facilitate and develop plugins for Exact Online. The possibility to embed plugins with data from Exact Online within other business applications, will be a possible advantage for customers to choose for Exact Online above other business administration software. In particular, Exact wanted to have a set of plugins for CRM-system Salesforce. The project team, proposed to make the assignment more abstract by using a more generic approach. An advantage of such an approach is that a platform independent set of plugins can be offered. Consequently, it will be possible to embed plugins within multiple different business applications. The main challenge in this project was to maintain the features that an integration within a specific platform will offer, yet keeping a generic approach in order to realize a high degree of adaptability, extendability, maintainability and to allow a secure environment for data exchange. With the final prototype that the project team delivered at the end of this project, those goals have been achieved. The final prototype of the Exact Online Plugin framework can be embedded in two different ways in another application. Firstly, it is possible to use a plugin as a ‘stand-alone‘ version. A plugin can be embedded within another application, and show all data related to accounts in Exact Online. Secondly, it is possible to embed a plugin into another application while sending along data that belongs to the other application. These data can be for example company names or phone numbers. The plugin framework will then attempt to match the provided account data with accounts from Exact Online, and show a customized view adapted on and integrated with the ‘host‘ application. Matching is an essential part of the integration of external accounts with accounts from Exact Online. Algorithms that can be used to achieve this matching make use of the distance property of a set of words. In the implementation of the Exact Online Plugin framework this means that organization names are compared to see the degree of similarity between them. Moreover, the algorithms of Levenshtein, an algorithm of Jaro-Winkler and a combination of both are used in specific. The matching module is a feature that have been thoroughly tested, because of the use of a test-driven approach for development. This approach, helped to optimize the level of acceptance for the matching algorithms. Next to unit and user test, a detailed assessment has been made on the security of the application. The creation of a threat model helped to identify potential threats from a security point of view. Based on the findings, application improvements could be made. Concluding, the Exact Online Plugin Framework provides a flexible and maintenance-extensive way to create plugins for Exact Online. By maintaining a generic approach, it is possible to embed plugins within multiple different third-party applications, yet showing application-specific data because of a matching module that is built in.","exact; online; plugins; matching; levenshtein; jaro-winkler","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Technische Informatica","","51.9906985, 4.389538"

(mentor); Zarouchas, D. (mentor); Gagar, D. (mentor)","2014","The present study focuses on understanding the effect of load and temperature on Acoustic Emission (AE) signal propagation in an Aluminium 2024-T3 panel. In addition, the ability of an AE system to locate damage under these operational and environmental conditions was evaluated. The work was performed in two stages. In stage one, the wave group velocities of guided Lamb waves were measured for a range of temperatures from -40 ?C to 70 ?C. At each temperature level, six different static loads were applied that ranged from 0 MPa to 250 MPa in increments of 50 MPa. A mathematical analytical model for the effect of temperature on the wave group velocities was re-produced in order to verify it through experimental and FEM results. Furthermore, experimental and FEM results have been obtained for the effect of load and the combined case. It was observed that the variation of temperature and load altered the wave group velocities. The results showed that an increase in the temperature resulted in a decrease of the wave group velocity and vice versa. Furthermore, external applied loads resulted that the change group velocity varies linearly with increasing stress and has a sinusoidal dependence with the angle between sensor path and loading direction. Which meant that the wave group velocity decreased for small angles, increased for large angles and varied with a sinusoidal behaviour for the other angles between the propagation path and the loading direction. The effect of temperature and load can be super imposed onto each other. Experimentally obtained wave group velocities with temperature were within an error of 6% to the analytical solution and for the FEM results this was within 3%. In stage two, a representative AE signal, simulating a fracture phenomenon was emitted from a randomly selected point. Using values of wave velocity measured in stage one, the location of the representative AE signal under these conditions was calculated and errors were determined. It was found that the location algorithm was not sensitive to wave group velocities changes due to temperature and loads, thus providing an accurate location of the source within 1cm, for a specimen size of 65 by 60 cm. The experimentally obtained localization results were also supported with results from a numerical model that calculated location errors for many locations in and outside the array. The effects of temperature and load were taken into account in the Time Differences Of Arrival (TDOA) function for a known location. These TDOA were then fed into a location algorithm (Geiger’s method). It was found that location errors due to temperature or load were within 1.5 cm and were at some areas more significantly affected than at other locations. The reduced location accuracy of these source locations can be related to the angle dependent effect of load on wave group velocities. Source locations that have an angle between most sensors paths and loading direction that fits the largest change in wave velocity were found to be more significantly affected. The experimental results also presented problems with threshold selection during the experiments. A low AE threshold could translate into too much noise in the acquired signals, which can result in wrongfully triggering, while a high AE threshold could translate into incorrect group velocity measurements because a later part of the waveform would be used for triggering. Therefore the development of an threshold independent trigger mechanism is a recommendation for further research as well as investigating the effect of EOC in complex or composite structures.","Acoustic Emission; Structural Health Monitoring; Environmental and Operational Conditions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Mechanics, Aerospace Structures & Materials","","Structural Integrity and Composites","",""

(mentor); Luijendijk, A.P. (mentor); Van Overeem, J. (mentor); Jacobs, W. (mentor); Rijks, D.C. (mentor)","2014","An offshore terminal is proposed to be constructed adjacent to the entrance of an Estuary in the Niger Delta. A dredged approach channel of around 10 km long, 250 m wide and to a depth of -14 m LAT is required to allow ships to reach the terminal. From earlier research it is found that high transport rates of fine sediment, in the order of 10 million m3/year, are expected to cause significant sedimentation in the proposed channel. This research aims to describe the complex processes associated with the expected cohesive sediment infill, and find mitigation measures to reduce the scale of required maintenance dredging effort for this project specifically and for similar projects in general. The local environment is subject to strong seasonal variations in wave heights, wind speeds, residual current velocities as well as varying discharges of water and sediment by the Estuary. Significant wave heights during the wet season are typically 1.5 m with a peak period of 13 s. The capacity of the waves to erode sediment in the coastal zone is larger than the capacity of the flow to keep the sediment suspended. This causes sediment induced buoyancy effects to take place. Two main processes were identified that determine the infill of the proposed channel. Episodic discharge of sediment from the Estuary and interception of sediment transported by a residual current in the coastal zone. Fluid mud events were observed in the field, which could result in significant infill rates if the mud layer is able to reach the proposed channel. This process is highly uncertain and requires further research in order to estimate the relative effects. By the use of a Delft3D sediment transport model, sediment transports in the project area were simulated. It was concluded that the expected sediment infill is predominantly caused by the residual transport in the coastal zone and to a lesser extent from sediment originated from the Estuary. A list of potential mitigation measures to reduce sediment infill for similar projects as this specific case is proposed. From an analysis of these measures it is concluded that no single solution is able to reduce sediment transport towards a dredged channel on a long term. The complexity of such muddy deltaic systems make it difficult to change the sediment transport processes significantly, therefore the focus should be on the channel configuration to minimize trapping of sediment and to optimize maintenance dredging efficiency. A downward sloping channel bed was proposed to achieve a self-cleansing channel by transporting the mud infill in offshore direction under the influence of gravity. Due to the gentle surrounding bed slope and resulting maximum slope of the channel bed (1:2000), the effectiveness of this solution is expected to be low. A reduction of the stratification induced residual current was proposed to be achieved by redirecting the fresh water discharge from the Estuary away from the project area. By the use of the Delft3D model it is found that this measure is not effective for the considered dimensions of the channel. The effect of a sediment trap was analyzed using a 2-DV trapping model, set up with the Delft3D software package. The reduction in sediment transport towards the proposed channel by a sediment trap of the considered dimensions is estimated at 20 - 55%. During down–time for maintenance dredging due to shipping traffic in the approach channel, the sediment trap can be maintained. This results in more time available to perform maintenance dredging activity. A limited amount of data was available for this study, therefore additional data is required to calibrate the Delft3D model and obtain more accurate results. Further research on the optimum use of a nautical depth is recommended, as a low expected consolidation rate of the mud infill might reduce the amount of required maintenance dredging.","Delft3D; cohesive sediment; Niger delta; trapping efficiency; sediment infill","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-07-04","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Romeijn, A. (mentor)","2014","In offshore industry, subsea pipelines are used for transporting oil and gas from wells to remote platforms and from platforms to nearby shores. A microscopic flaw in pipeline during installation and operation will grow normal to the principal stress if the threshold value of fatigue stress range is exceeded. In case, these microscopic flaws gradually grow into critical crack size, the pipe material will fail by fracture. Offshore oil/gas pipelines are typically constructed by joining steel pipes by welding. Residual stresses are generated in the vicinity of weld seam during welding process, which if tensile, can be detrimental to fatigue strength of the pipes. Four point bend full scale fatigue tests are carried out on notched pipes to investigate the effects of these residual stresses on fatigue crack growth. A four point bend test-rig is designed and constructed to carry out these tests. During analysis it is observed that the results for pipe specimens with residual stresses are comparable to pipe specimens without residual stresses. It might be due to phenomenon like plastic deformation taking place at the crack tip during the fatigue loading. Another gain of this thesis study is to investigate the scale effects on the fatigue crack growth. Scale effects include the effects of change of specimen geometry and size on fatigue crack growth. Codes (BS7910) allow the use of fatigue data of strip specimens with through thickness crack to relate to full scale pipe specimens with surface cracks. It is argued that residual stresses initially present in pipe are relieved when the strip specimen is cut from pipe. To investigate the difference, three point bend fatigue tests are carried out on notched strip specimens extracted from the pipes. On analysis of the results of full scale pipe tests and strip specimens, it is found that fatigue crack growth rates are comparable for both cases.","fatigue; residual stress; crack growth rate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Recent attempts to improve the situation are targeted mainly towards regenerating areas close to the city center. However, in many cases regeneration does not guarantee the vitality of these areas and success of the projects. In reality new plans tend to neglect social and economic complexity of renewed areas by replacing these structures with developments profitable for real estate companies. The extension of the international business district together with redevelopment of Calvary market area in Vilnius is one of the examples of such trend. What is more, plans of redeveloping areas in the city center are fragmented and are not contributing to create the overall vision for the center, or focus on social integration and creation of vital and diverse city life, instead the plans might trigger creation of gated communities and large scale retail centers that have negative impact on vitality of this area. This project aims to find ways to develop areas in the city center of Vilnius by integrating the informal market as a generator of vitality for new interventions. There are several projects concerning development of complex structures in the context of post-soviet cities carried out under Metropolitan Spatial Structure research theme in, TU Delft. However, one could recognize a certain gap in lack of insights on the aspects of vitality in these cities. This particular thesis aims to contribute to the mentioned subject while researching the conditions of vital city life in post-soviet context as well as the spatial structure of Vilnius and its center. The conclusion derived from this research will be used to formulate design guidelines for specific area of the city – CBD expansion and Calvary market zone. Intended outcome of the project is the vision for the city center and design proposal for a specific area, in result this project could be used as an example of developing complex structure in post-soviet city.","functional diversity; vitality; urban regeneration; postsoviet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-07-04","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Complex Cities","",""

The main aim of this project is the spatial, environmental, social and economic integration of Eleonas between the city of Athens and to offer a new living environment to the city of Athens proposing a new housing system through specific typologies. The new typologies respond to the scale of existing social conditions and economic situation. It’s not a proposal of simply a new city or a new park, or a combination of the two, but a whole new proposal for a new way of living. This project proposes an alternative vision for the area of Eleonas that has the potentialities to be an example of a new urban environment.","diversity; integration; restructuring; residual; Athens; urban village","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-01","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Complex Cities","",""

(mentor); Powolny, F. (mentor)","2014","For the master project work was carried out for the development of a fluorescence lifetime imaging probe for fluorescence guided surgery. For this project a prototype was designed. The work on the prototype was divided into three main parts, hardware, firmware / software, and system / optics. In this thesis the firmware / software of the system are described. An overview of the system is given and the performance is evaluated. The systems hardware consists of a mainboard with a Spartan 6 FPGA and a Cypress FX3 USB3 controller. Secondly a daughterboard was designed which houses the LinoSPAD chip, a line of 256 SPADs. The outputs of the SPADs are directly connected to the FPGA. The FPGAs firmware was developed. The system had to incorporate a Time Correlated Single Photon Counting structure for the 256 channels. TCSPC calculates the timing of individual photons and stores this information in a histogram. The Time to Digital Converters were implemented in the carrychain structure on the FPGA. A clock of 100 MHz is used, therefore 512 stages (128 Carry4 blocks) form the delayline of the TDCs. The TDC range is > 10 ns to fill the complete clock period. The histograms were stored in the FPGA RAM memory blocks. The final firmware has 8 TDCs, each having 32 channels. Those channels are connected to one TDC. Each channel has its own RAM memory in which the histogram is stored. The memories can be read-out in less than 2 ms over USB3. The performance of the TDCs was assessed. The resolution is 20-21 ps and the non linearities are DNL 4 LSB and INL 7.5 LSB. The results were confirmed both in simulation and in the physical design. Crosstalk from SPADs was removed by not storing timing information when multiple SPADs fire in one clock period. Secondly the systems software was developed. The software has a user-friendly GUI in which the main aspects of the fluorescence signals can be plotted. Both the raw TCSPC histograms and the extracted information as intensity and lifetime can be shown. In order to extract the fluorescence lifetime, two algorithms were studied and compared: Wiener filter and Centre of Mass method (CoM). The Wiener filter is based on deconvolution of the measured signal with the Instrument Response Function of the system (IRF). On the deconvoluted exponential, a fit is made to extract the lifetime. The CoM uses the centre of mass of the fluorescence histogram and the centre of mass of the IRF to make an estimation of the lifetime. Both algorithms show similar results in simulation with errors up to 30 ps over a lifetime range from 100 ps up to 1 ns. These errors are obtained for a histogram with 2500 photon counts, noise and systems non linearities being present. However the Centre of Mass method is up to 100x faster compared to the Wiener filter due to its lower complexity. The FluoCAM camera system, already developed in a previous project, was calibrated. It was also used to perform biological experiments in-vivo. Findings of fluorescence lifetimes are comparable to literature for well-known fluorescence compounds. Furthermore first tests in vivo (mice) reveal similar lifetimes over several days. The LinoSPAD system could not be tested for fluorescence as the LinoSPAD chip is not working. Instead a fluorescence emulator was designed in a second FPGA to test the LinoSPAD FPGA system. The emulator mimics fluorescence exponential signals, however due to FPGA limitations the derived exponentials are not analysable to extract lifetimes. Besides an emulator, some experiments were done with a single SPAD. The systems resolution and non linearities were confirmed using SPAD noise density tests. The noise rate of the SPAD was found in the same order as expected (100 Hz). Finally with the data collected from FluoCAM, the performance achievable with the LinoSPAD camera system was estimated. Main system requirements have been fulfilled during the project. However the system has to be tested with the working LinoSPAD chip to confirm the usability of the complete system. The first step towards a fluorescence probe has been set.","FLIM; surgery; lifetime; fluorescence; ICG; FPGA; TCSPC; TDC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Circuits & Systems","",""

A proof of concept was designed which is able tomeasure the cell concentration of yeast in a suspension by using sensors which measure the impedance and optical properties of the suspension. The project is divided into three parts where each duo will have their own focus. This thesis focuses on the software and data processing subsystem. The other pairs will focus on the optical and impedance sensors The signals from both sensors are converted to digital values. To process the raw data, filters are designed to condition the signal. Using the filtered data, routines are implemented to calculate the cell concentration. This value is transferred to a computer, where a user interface is implemented to graphically display the progress of the cell concentration. Using only the optical sensor, the measurements were accurate to about 40% in the range 0-10 g/l, and 10% in the range 10-120 g/l, making the total range 0-120 g/l. The impedance sensor was extend the range of the measurements to 0-150 g/l with an accuracy of 15%. However, the calculations needed to convert impedance values into cell concentrations were too sensitive for the microcontroller The routines for the optical sensor were successfully implemented on an Arduino microcontroller showing promising results. This was achieved with the help of a graphical user interface which was designed for validation when actual yeast measurements were performed. Although the routines for the impedance sensor yielded correct results for capacitance, the implementation of the code on the Arduino gave erroneous values when cell concentration was measured.","cell; concentration; sensor; optical; impedance; software; processing; Applikon","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-03","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electronic Instrumentation","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Wols, F.J. (mentor)","2014","The world demand on energy, combined with environmental concerns, constitutes the need for a plentiful supply of safely produced energy without carbon emissions. The High Temperature Reactor (HTR) is the predecessor of the Gen-4 VHTR design, and has a large thermal efficiency and unsurpassed safety features. Thorium offers more natural resources, more proliferation resistance, and better waste characteristics than uranium. The safety features of the HTR and the resourcefulness of thorium can be combined in a thorium breeder pebble bed reactor. In this research, radial cooling is proposed as an improvement to this reactor type, specifically to solve or strongly mitigate the problems involved with the high pressure drop, temperature variations and reactivity control. The system was compared to the axially cooled case to investigate the effects of the change in coolant direction, and studies have been performed to research the physicalfeasibility of radial cooling within practical and safety constraints. MATLAB models were built to compare the thermal hydraulic behaviour of axially and radially cooled core designs. In order to verify the thermal hydraulics and include neutronics in the simulation, the feasibility of the radially cooled core was investigated in more detail using coupled THERMIX / DALTON steady state calculations. Transient behaviour was researched with THERMIX in stand alone mode. It was found that radial cooling is a feasible design option for this reactor type. The placement of a central reflector allows sufficient regulation of the mass flow distribution, leading to small helium outflow temperature variations. The control rods can be placed in the central reflector, especially for the system with outward cooling, where the rods are constantly cooled by fresh helium. The pressure drop was found to decrease from 1.2 bar to 38 millibar. Simulations on both pressurized as well as depressurized loss of forced cooling incidents with SCRAM have been performed, and the maximum temperature remains well under 1600 degrees Celsius in both these cases. Reversing the coolant flow direction to inward cooling enhances the radial spread in power density, which lowers the maximum transient temperatures. However, it has a negative effect on reactivity and makes the placement of the reactivity control system in the central reflector more troublesome due to the higher centre core temperature. This means that the system with outward radial cooling is considered more favourable.","pebble bed; thorium; High Temperature Reactor; radial cooling; HTR; PBR; nuclear energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Reactor Institute Delft","","NERA","",""

Its dynamics challenges the predetermined patterns of urban life and conventional planning, it offers opportunity for architects and urbanists to rethink alternative approaches and solutions to facilitate the people to make collective choices dealing with the complex urban conflicts.

In Fact the rapid growth of urbanization and migration in Tehran after the modernization, resulted polarization that affected on Ray, physically and socially and led to separate Ray from the rest of Tehran in higher scale. In addition, due to environmental changing, a fragmentation has happened inside the district socially and physically. The Abdol Azim Holy Shrine is located in the centre of the old radius nucleus of the district which has more than 10 million pilgrims per year. The district has witnessed rapid growth in the last two decades, mostly because of its free lands, agricultural lands, land price and industries that migrants, working class and middle class people have settled. As a result, this unplanned growth has led to change Ray’s identity. Ray have been defined as the main religious-historic centre in Tehran master plan which has attracted the attention of planners and investors. The aim of this project is find out important factors for integrated spatial development of Ray as a segregated district in order to reinforce Ray identity and quality first in local level and then in metropolitan scale. On the other word, Improving the local structure within the metropolitan structure is the aim of the project. In order to achieve this goal, Ray should be analysed in different aspects and a multiscales strategies are needed. Generally, the project searches planning perspectives in the neglected district to revive the local quality as a promoter of urban cohesion in different scales.

(mentor)","2014","The need for a more resource-efficient and low-carbon electricity sector has boosted the integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in power systems, especially of wind and solar energy. However, their intermittent output hinders the match of electricity demand and supply which is required for the smooth operation of the electricity grid. This problem is translated into higher electricity price, higher CO2 emissions due to the need for back-up electricity from fossil fuel plants, and even jeopardy of the reliable electricity services provision. Electricity storage is considered to be an effective way to address these issues and enhance system flexibility. The objective of this work is to assess the contribution of storage to cost and CO2 emissions reduction in the electricity system, to estimate its profitability as an investment option and to examine the interactions between energy storage and the other actors involved in the operation of an electricity system. The storage performance under the presence of the electricity transmission option for balancing purposes in the system was also examined. The methodology applied to carry out this research is modeling a power system on MS Excel. For the last part of the objective mentioned above, the model results were combined with a stakeholder analysis. The project is implemented in collaboration with Shell Global Solutions International BV. During the conceptualization phase of the model building process, a literature review was conducted in order to explore the outcome of previous studies on the value of energy storage, the applications of storage in power systems and the technologies available. Moreover, a research on the electricity markets operation was carried out in order to identify the elements of a power system model and their interconnections. Then, the model deliverables and structure were defined and desk research was conducted for the collection of the necessary input data. The simulation is based on the power system of Germany, since this is a system with high wind and solar capacity. After an iterative process of verification, validation and specifications adjustment, the model got its final form and sensitivity analysis tests were performed. Firstly, different strategies of storage use with respect to the charge/discharge policy, the storage capacity in the system and the type of storage used, were tested under the current system conditions. The results confirmed that storage can reduce the cost of system while generating profit for the storage operators but this is only possible for the pumped-hydro installations. Vanadium redox batteries also reduce the cost of the system but to a lower extent; moreover, they are not yet economically viable. It was also proved that, although storage facilities are mostly charged in the spot market, discharging energy in the balancing market is the main source of profitability from storage operation. Therefore, the variations in the flexibility reserve required in the system affect a lot the storage provider’s profits, which may fluctuate significantly from year to year. On the other hand, the economic value of storage for the system remains around the same level regardless the fluctuations of flexibility reserve in the system. With respect to the combination of storage and transmission in the balancing market, the research showed that transmission is a competitive option which affects storage profitability but does not influence a lot the value of storage for the system. Finally, in terms of environmental performance, storage seems to increase CO2 emissions in the system because it is mostly charged by lignite plants. However, this is highly subject to the current merit order formulation (lignite plants, coal plants, CCGT in ascending marginal cost order) and changes when CCGT gets cheaper than the other plants. The second round of tests looked into storage performance under different system conditions. It was found out that more aggressive RES penetration in the system showcases the value of storage for the system. The profitability of storage also increases but when RES penetration becomes very high the electricity price spread in the spot market reduces and affects negatively the profitability for the storage provider. On the contrary, the increase in the level of electricity demand initially devalues storage for both actors, because it decreases the electricity price spread and the frequency of storage facilities use. However, when demand becomes very high and the current installed capacity cannot cover it, storage regains its value. The impact of fuel and CO2 prices variation on storage is also attributed to the effect of this variation on the electricity price spread. Under the current merit order structure (lignite, coal, CCGT), the decrease in CO2 price and the rise in gas price enhance the value of storage, while all the other changes either decrease or totally eliminate it. Finally, the increase in the predictability of wind and solar variations reduces significantly the value of storage. The same is true for the increase in the amount of electricity transmitted to an external system, but to a smaller extent. The last part of the research project, the stakeholder analysis, shed light on the interrelations of storage with the other actors involved in power systems. Under the current system conditions, the consumers, the providers of electricity from intermittent RES and especially lignite plants operators are affected positively by the introduction of storage in the energy system. Gas plants are also benefited from storage integration but to a limited extent. The impact on the other electricity providers (nuclear, biomass, hydro, coal) is negative but small. However, it must be mentioned that since storage facilitates the penetration of RES, the electricity suppliers from fossil fuel power plants are also threatened by the reduction of their share in the energy mix. Therefore, the impact of storage on their profits might be negative in the long run. The most important players for the storage deployment in power systems are of course the government, since it is at the head of the energy storage policy; the storage providers who invest on the technology; and the fossil fuel power plant operators, who hold very powerful position in the system. In terms of recommendations derived from the project, it is proposed to storage investors to support R&D on electricity storage and to invest in pumped-hydro storage, when it is not hampered by technical restrictions; or in vanadium redox batteries, when they become profitable. In relation to the storage operation plan, they should participate in both spot and balancing market and perform a thorough study on the price fluctuations in the electricity markets before designing a charging/discharging strategy. To the policy makers, it is advised to offer subsidies for the currently unprofitable but most promising storage technologies and to enhance R&D on them. Moreover, it is suggested to promote the coupling of energy storage with wind and solar power plants and to attract the interest of the fossil fuel plants providers towards the investment on storage technologies. In conclusion, the main areas for model improvement and further research are: the evaluation of storage performance by combining different storage types; the modeling of electricity transmission in spot market; and the impact assessment of storage on stakeholders under different scenarios and for various storage use strategies.","energy storage; electricity market; renewables; intermittency; flexibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

The incoming signals are temporarily stored in the second main part of the system which is called the “RAM”. The purpose of storing the signals in the RAM is because the incoming data form the Bluetooth transmission and the outgoing data to drive the LED system is working on two different clock frequencies. The third part is called the “Controller”. The task of the Controller part is to request the information from the RAM part and then to put this on the output of the FPGA to drive the LED system. The data that is read from the RAM part contains RGB values for every LED. The Controller controls all these in- coming data in such a way so that the different variations of the colors can be sent to the LED matrix.","Bluetooth; FPGA; LED; Android; VHDL","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","","",""

It involves a probabilistic framework, where a set of orientation-specific detectors are used for each body part for both localization and orientation estimation, their responses being converted to a continuous orientation probability density function. To improve the localization, spatial anatomical constraints between the head and body are used, in a Pictorial Structure approach, to balance the part-based detector responses. The single-frame head and body orientations are integrated over time by particle filtering and estimated jointly to account for orientation restrictions and to obtain anatomical possible orientation configurations. The experimental evaluation is done over 65 pedestrian tracks in realistic traffic settings, obtained from an external stereo vision-based pedestrian detection system. The results show that the proposed joint probabilistic orientation estimation framework decreases the absolute mean head and body orientation error by approximately 15 degrees. Also, the system runs in near-real-time (8–9 Hz), which allows the use in the car.","computer vision; orientation estimation; active pedestrian safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Pattern Recognition","","Media Knowledge and Engineering","",""

Sepia on the other hand is a large player in brand visibility products, looking to expand their portfolio with innovative new products. From a collaboration between these 2 companies, the idea for a flexible digital flag emerged. Within this graduation project, the goal was to develop a possible design for the digital flag, based on the three pillars of Industrial Design. Therefore, all technology should be integrated into a feasible design, with respect to both the human and business aspect of the product. As a high technological product, the innovation should be reflected in a unique and appealing design. The resulting design is the combination between an LED display and a standalone flag in a unique and innovative design. The unique 3-dimensional shape of the display ensures 360 degree visibility and invites for further exploration. The bright, changeable digital content and high flexibility of use create new opportunities for effective advertising at events or points of sales. In addition, a fully autonomous version of the digital flag was developed. As the first battery powered LED display, this configuration is perfectly fit to be used on locations with limited facilities. During the development, communication with clients and experts in different disciplines has played a crucial role. By going through multiple iterations each time new aspects were discussed and optimized in order to create a better design. During the complete process, multiple creative and analytic design methods were used along with a well-structured planning to ensure continuous progress. Considering the time restraints and extent of this individual project, the level of elaboration is quite advanced. Although the concept is not ready for production yet, the building of a full-size prototype has started to test and evaluate the design. As some of the main parts for the prototype are still under construction, the mechanical prototype will be completed between the delivery of this report and the final graduation presentation. As both companies are still enthusiastic about the project, the investigation for patentability of the design has started and plans for further prototyping and market research are made. These steps will provide a better insight in the market potential for the product and eventually define the future for the digital flag.","design; brand visibility; flexible display; flag","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2016-07-04","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","","51.03759, 3.89168"

(mentor); Remøy, H.T. (mentor)","2014","A major renovation or transforming of a monument in the Netherlands requires an environmental permit. For this permit a cultural-historical research is needed in which contains the values of the object are determined. This examination is usually done by specialized historic research agencies, which results in considerable costs. In addition to the economic impact there is also the impact in terms of time, both directly and indirectly. This research gives insight in the impact of these examinations on the transformation process. By carrying out a six case studies answers to the research questions are given. This is combined with a literature and theory study. This research paper gives insight in these influences but also contains recommendations on how stakeholders can improve the process and deal with historical examinations. In conclusion, the impact of the study in the majority of cases is not economically significant. It is mainly the impact of the examination on the design of a redevelopment project that can slow down the process and therefore entails additional costs. It is striking that, in contrast to what is outlined in Article 5.4 Environmental law regulations, many environmental permits are granted without any historical examination. In many simple monumental redevelopment projects expensive examination is unnecessary. Executing the examination prior to the construction project can make large improvements. By consulting the municipality upfront unnecessary changes to the design during the construction process are prevented. Making the influence of the cultural historic examination insightful and to a minimum influence as possible. Modifications to a monument will always be custom made solutions and depending on the role and attitude of the municipality. Therefore the impact of the cultural historic examination is unknown upfront. Bij transformatie of ingrijpende renovatie van monumenten in Nederland is de omgevingsvergunning verplicht. Voor deze vergunning is een cultuurhistorisch onderzoek nodig waarin de waardes van het object vastgesteld worden. Dit onderzoek wordt doorgaans door gespecialiseerde bouwhistorische onderzoeksbureaus gedaan, wat de nodige kosten met zich meebrengt. Naast de financie?le invloed is er ook een invloed qua tijd, beide zowel direct als indirect. Dit afstudeeronderzoek is gericht op het inzichtelijk maken van de invloed van deze onderzoeken op het herbestemmingsproces. Door de uitvoering van een casusonderzoek waarbij een zestal casussen zijn onderzocht wordt antwoord gegeven op de onderzoeksvragen. Dit in combinatie met een literatuur en theoriestudie. Hierdoor wordt onder andere de invloed duidelijk, maar worden er ook aanbevelingen gedaan hoe de betrokken partijen de omgang met historische onderzoeken kunnen verbeteren. Concluderend is de invloed van het onderzoek in de meeste gevallen financieel niet noemenswaardig. Het is vooral de indirecte invloed die het onderzoek op het ontwerp van een herbestemmingsproject heeft die het project kan vertragen en daardoor extra kosten met zich meebrengt. Het is opvallend dat in tegenstelling tot wat er in artikel 5.4 Regeling omgevingsrecht staat, er nog veel omgevingsvergunningen verleend worden zonder dat er een historisch onderzoek wordt uitgevoerd. Daarentegen is in veel eenvoudige monumentale herbestemmingsprojecten een kostbaar onderzoek overbodig. Er is nog veel winst te behalen door de uitvoering van het onderzoek voorafgaand aan het bouwproject. Door vooroverleggen met de gemeente worden onnodige aanpassingen aan het ontwerp tijdens het bouwproces voorkomen. Hierdoor wordt de invloed van het cultuurhistorisch onderzoek, voor zover het mogelijk is, vooraf inzichtelijk en beperkt. Doordat aanpassingen aan monument altijd maatwerk zullen zijn en de rol van de gemeente grote invloed heeft is het onmogelijk om de invloed van cultuurhistorisch onderzoek voorafgaand volledig vast te stellen.","cultural historic reports; cultural historic examination; monuments; heritage; environmental permit; costs; time; case studies; general provision environment law; environmental law regulations; cultuurhistorische rapporten; cultuurhistorisch onderzoek; monumenten; erfgoed; omgevingsvergunning; kosten; tijd; casusonderzoek; Wet algemene bepalingen omgevingsrecht; Regeling omgevingsrecht; Wabo","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Real Estate Management","",""

(mentor); Van Timmeren, A. (mentor)","2014","Since 2001 after the fall of Taliban around 6 million Afghans have returned from Iran and Pakistan, who have chosen to move to the large cities of Afghanistan, particularly to Kabul. The massive waves of returnees and inflows of social-economic migrants have made Kabul the fastest growing city in the world, which creates various problems for the city to deal with. (Feenstra, 2010) The formal sector, which includes the ministries, municipality and international assistance communities, is suffering from intergovernmental conflicts. More importantly the formal planning, Master plan 1978, fails to provide the inhabitants with basic needs, such as adequate shelter, urban utilities and security. Therefore the big Warlords are partially fulfilling these needs and hence seizing more power and territory within the city through land grabbing and illegal urban development. The proposal of the graduation project is to develop sites in cooperation with public and private stakeholders. The development of Strategic sites promotes an adaptable, inclusive and non-rigid approach, which is a tool toward local development aiming to improve overall quality of life, as well as economic and social prosperity. This new way of thinking will provide ground to address the complex and interwoven issues of Kabul in a more comprehensible and small way, rather than one expensive blueprint such as master plan, which does not incorporate the changes and stakeholders into the planning process.","Kabul; Warlords; land development; strategic sites; stakeholders","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","","",""

It should provide the required quality of service in terms of predictable guaranteed as well as best effort services to meet the application constraints. The application traffic patterns applied on a NoC is hard to predict due to dynamics of the application. A characterization framework is required for design space exploration of NoC architectures. This framework should be able to evaluate NoC performance for a set of applications. In this thesis we propose a NoC characterization framework for design space exploration called NoCExplorer. NoCExplorer is a cycle accurate simulator, developed using SystemC and VHDL. It supports individual blocks in the NoC to be synthesized or replaced with register transfer level VHDL code for mixed language simulations. NoCExplorer provides a rich set of performance parameters to analyze a NoC and can generate heat maps for visual representation of link utilization and router congestion in the NoC. It was correlated with many journals and publications to prove the correctness of the results. Results from the experiments in this thesis show that the NoC performance is impacted by cycle interval between flit injection into the network. An increase in the interval between the flit injection within the packet significantly increases the average latency of the NoC. The ratio of increase in latency varies for different NoCs under a set of synthetic traffic patterns. NoCExplorer provides capability to map custom application over the NoC to evaluate its performance. A DAB application transaction model was mapped on many NoCs. We are able to assess the performance of many NoCs and visualize the congestion and link utilization. Stressing the NoC by reducing its clock frequency by a factor of 100x of core operating frequency, one of the spidergon based NoC with across first routing algorithm showed best results for the given application constraints.","NoC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-04","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","","52.221537, 6.893662"

Door het maken van deze twee modellen wordt gepoogd om bij te dragen aan de inhoudelijke robuustheid van hedonische prijsmodellen door het valideren ervan met nieuwe data en het toevoegen van nieuwe variabelen. Hiermee wordt antwoord gegeven op de vraagstelling: Op basis van welke variabelen is de beleggingsprestatie van Nederlands winkelvastgoed te voorspellen? De uitgevoerde analyses hebben geleid tot een huurprijsmodel waar in eerste instantie 1011 winkelunits in opgenomen zijn. Wegens een tekort aan waarnemingen van branche-variabelen en met name de standplaatskwaliteit heeft het huurprijsschattingsmodel een steekproefgrootte van 558 winkelunits. De te verklaren variabelen zijn daadwerkelijk gerealiseerde winkelhuurprijzen uit de vastgoedpraktijk. Hiervoor zijn 9 variabelen gebruikt, die een significante relatie met de huurprijs bleken te hebben, te weten: het aantal inwoners in een straal van 2km, een lage of hoge WOZ-waarde van huishoudens binnen 10 minuten reizen, de branchegroep (dummies), het oppervlak, de standplaatskwaliteit (dummies), de huurprijstrend, de restduur van het huurcontract en de totaalduur van het huurcontract. Additionele variabelen zijn gevonden, echter droegen die niet bij aan een hogere verklaringswaarde, en dus niet aan de kwaliteit van het model, of werden niet-significant in een multiple regressie.","Huurprijs; Winkelvastgoed; Real Estate Investment management; Hedonisch; Prijsmodel; Rendement; Hedonic pricing method; Huurprijsmodel; Rendementsmodel","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate and Housing","","Real Estate Management","",""

Carry-over of solids were between 300g/hr at a fluidisation velocity of 0.9m/s and 15g/hr at a fluidisation velocity of 0.5m/s. Experiences and results from these tests were used to develop a 25kWth unit that will be tested in a commercial scenario before the end of 2014. This study has shown that the utilisation of atmospheric bubbling fluidised bed technology for the combustion of sawdust with a thermal power of 10 - 25 kW is feasible. That means that the technology is ready for the introduction in products for SMEs and domestic markets, where as previously it was assumed that the technique was mostly limited to large industrial applications.","fluidised bed; sawdust","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-07-03","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","","53.2191700, 6.5666700"

(mentor); Ozcan Vieira, E. (mentor)","2014","When sailing with a spinnaker over a long distance, the sailor has to manage other activities, making it impossible to keep an eye on the spinnaker at all time. A spinnaker can easily become unstable and then the risk arises of the spinnaker getting wrapped around the forestay. For the sailor, this creates a sense of distrust in the spinnaker. The Spinnakersafe should prevent a spinnaker wrap and evoke trust in the spinnaker. The product should feel like a product that boosts the sailor’s performance, rather than a tool that has to keep the sailor from making mistakes. This master thesis shows the process and results of designing the Spinnakersafe. The process is divided in three phases: 1) problem definition and analysis, 2) Ideation and conceptualization and 3) elaboration and detail design. In phase 1, the problem and the context (emotions and semantics) are analysed. An FTA, questionnaire and phenomenological study are techniques used. The phase is concluded in a design goal: “In the domain of long-distance sailors with a limited crew, I want the users to feel trust in the employed spinnaker, so that they can take charge of their adventure” and an interaction vision: “Like having an additional crew member” The experiential requirements are: The product must evoke trust. The user must not feel limited by the product. Handling the product should be intuitive and understandable. In phase 2, based on the design goal and interaction vision, ideas are generated. One final concept is chosen for further elaboration in the third phase of the project. The concept is product that will block the spinnaker from passing through the area between the mast and the forestay. Phase 3. After a proof of concept, the partial solutions are worked out. The result is a detailed design proposal for a physical product. The design is not be optimized for production, but decisions are made on materials and production techniques. The design is tested on interactive qualities by means of a user test with a full-scale prototype. The goal of this test is to find out if the design meets the proposed experiential requirements. The conclusion is that the design is successful in preventing a spinnaker wrap and in evoking trust in the spinnaker. The user does not feel limited by the product and can understand intuitively how to deploy the product. However, the hoist of the product is experienced as very unpleasant and overwhelming. The design needs to be adapted to improve the experience in this part of the usage.","DFI; Design; Sailing; Spinnaker; Interaction; Trust","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

It is a place which many prefer above a regular office. Not only to become more productive, but also to become creative. Surroundings are not seen as a distraction, but used as inspiration. Even when full focus is needed, light sound and movement of others is not seen as an annoying, the brain filters and uses everything to a satisfying amount. Scientists show that people can enter a state of mind, in which everything is subordinated to one specific goal. A personal fascination that enables them to work twenty hours a day, without any problem while experiencing great pleasure. It is about tasks that lie so close to personal interests, that urge and energy are infinite. The brain functions in a happy and non-restraint way, something children experience much more often than adults. Research shows that the skill of creativity is directly linked to the ability of acting like a child. It is about disabling the personal ‘inner critic’, the part in our brain that stops us from acting out of the ordinary. Over the past years, many buildings have been design to bring creativity into the office. Colors, homely furniture and natural elements, to make us more relaxed. Sports fields, unusual art and even slides, to stimulate us to act more like a child. And large open spaces, daylight and flexible diverse work spaces, to make us feel more free. But where these are common tools used within building designs towards creativity, they all look very dissimilar. The most obvious difference between the coffee house and the ‘creative office’, is the presence of facilities. Meeting- and conference rooms, machinery and tools, copy- and print service, fablabs and so on, are sections found in actual work environments. ICT-help, finance- and legal support, and a large network of professionals are other important qualities, which are missing at a coffee house. Where the surrounding of the location is used by many as a ‘hidden office’ full of creative minds, a large coffee house in urban setting, the design is based on adding the missing facilities becoming part of the existing. Many qualities named and visualized by scientists and architects are already present at the location. The actual design is based on the user and consists of a rather simple design in which architecture is made to a mean, creating a place where something can happen. It is about challenging to do something with the given space, using the broad range of facilities. The endless potential to make use of the openness provokes. A building which will get its identity from the user, an always changing identity representing creativity.","creativity; work space; office; innovation; business incubator; inspiration; southbank; london","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Explore Lab","",""

This report describes the design and implementation of a software extension to automate the placement of air ducts in buildings, for a building modeling software package called Revit. The main goal is a system that, given a building with unconnected vents, will produce ducts to connect those vents to a certain source. This report will discuss possible algorithms for solving the problem. One of these algorithms is an approach that creates a grid around each connector and uses Kruskal’s Algorithm to create a minimum spanning tree (MST) through that grid, to create the shortest path through all connectors. This algorithm did not yield optimal solutions as it tended to make too many corners. Also, “greedily” selecting all shortest paths between connectors often resulted in strange paths through the grid. Another approach, which is our final prototype, uses points created by the user which define the location where a main trunk of the duct system should be placed. The algorithm uses clustering techniques to divide the problem in smaller problems and will solve these clusters with structures that are regularly used in the building industry. It gives the user the opportunity to pick his or her desired solution for each cluster, enabling a lot of customization. Features of the system include wall avoidance and the use of duct connectors using industry standards. Features which are desirable but not implemented within this project are an extended three-dimensional sup- port, more and intuitive user interaction, more support for wall intersections and support for capacity calculations. The testing of the prototype is based on unit tests, where all classes are tested individually and extensively during the entire course of the project to make sure that no unforeseen situations would occur during the development process.

(mentor); Henze, L.A.R. (mentor); Rezaei, B. (mentor)","2014","This thesis presents a toolkit that aims to increase cognitive proximity among strategic designers and senior decision makers. In keeping with the general aim of the research program CRISP - PSS 101, these tools aim to establish a shared language and shared understanding (overlap in mental models) among these disparate actors. Such sharedness is crucial in their collaborative efforts when developing new value propositions or when involved in strategic innovation. However, appropriate tools for heterogeneous network communication and collaboration at a strategic level appear to be missing. In addition, it is suggested that designers have an added value by providing senior decision makers with new frames that help them perceive their business environment as well as the strategic activities in a new way. A better understanding of, for instance, the social reality of their customers will help them identify latent needs, explore new business opportunities and develop new propositions. This yields two main questions: (1) how to support strategic designers in their interaction with senior decision makers to establish a common ground? And (2) how can strategic designers help senior decision makers develop new mental models of their business ecosystem? These two questions are intricately linked as they provide the ends as well as the means for interaction. The research takes an explorative approach, starting with developing a tentative conceptual framework of “what is going on”. This framework is grounded in preliminary observations and a literature study, which focuses on strategic thinking for dynamic business ecosystems (e.g. Product Service Systems) and theoretical concepts concerning social meaning-making like: cognitive proximity, mental models, sensemaking, frames and metaphors. The findings from this literature study are presented in a conceptual model and used to define a set of design guidelines that serve as the foundation for the design and application of the toolkit. The central premise of the design guidelines is formed by the concept of metaphor. Metaphors have the intrinsic quality to bridge communication and generate new understanding. This notion of metaphor is operationalized with a number of complementary concepts, like: causality, open-ended, generative, transferable, embodied and recognizable. The toolkit includes two types of artifacts: diagrams and three-dimensional objects (i.e. tangible). The diagrams primarily intend to support communication in one-to-one conversations or small group meetings, whereas the three-dimensional objects support communication in workshop sessions for larger groups. These symbolic artifacts (i.e. metaphors) are in fact the stimuli that prompt sensemaking, which consequently stimulates mental model development and generate shared understanding. The application of the toolkit is examined in a variety of empirical studies. These studies include interactions between Behzad Rezaei, a strategic design consultant, and senior decision makers from public and private sector organizations. The toolkit is deployed in the early stages of a client-consultant relationship to facilitate the first encounters between Behzad and senior decision makers. Most of the data was collected through observations during workshops and meetings. The observations focused on how the tools were used during the meetings and workshops and how they affect the interaction between the strategic designer and senior decision makers. Subsequently an evaluative interview is conducted to reflect upon the application of the toolkit and to concatenate the results of the empirical studies. The results show how the toolkit fulfills several roles to serve a variety of purposes: it facilitates communication, supports frame creation, initiates sensemaking, develops understanding and stimulates sensegiving. The toolkit not only increases proximity between strategic designers and senior decision makers, but once senior decision makers succeed in their sensegiving attempts, the toolkit also amplifies proximity between strategic designers and other organizational members. These results are analyzed through three lenses (i.e. dimensions): cognitive, physical and socio-material. The aim of the analysis is to extract principles that may contribute to subsequent research or tool development. From the analysis a number of principles emerge that seem to enhance the interaction between actors (i.e. strategic designers and senior decision makers, and senior decision makers and their organizational members) and their hermeneutic interaction with the world (i.e. business eco­system). These principles include bridging metaphors, generative metaphors (i.e. analogies), memes, shared display, mapping, multimodality, transparency, coordination, reflection (i.e. perspective taking and making) and malleability. In particular multimodality, mapping and malleability seem fundamental for stimulating and facilitating activities like reflective conversational interactions, perspective taking and making, boundary crossing, strategic sensemaking and sensegiving. Consequently these activities promote the development and alignment of mental models in such a way that they help actors establish a common ground. Moreover, the principles portray two processes that form the answer to the key questions above. The first process involves the alignment of mental models to create cognitive overlap; it corresponds with the first question. It encompasses processes like coordination and embodiment. The second process relates to the second question, it concerns the shaping or development of mental models to increase their accuracy. It involves methods and activities like: (re)framing, sensemaking, reflective dialogue.","toolkit; PSS development; network collaboration; strategic innovation; shared understanding; cognitive proximity; metaphor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","MSc Design for Interaction","","52.0026, 4.37535"

The case of Medellín, Colombia","De Bont, J.C.A.","Sohn, H. (mentor); Nottrot, R. (mentor); Van de Voort, J. (mentor)","2014","In many Latin American cities, like Medellín, the food distribution system has an apparent irrational structure. The case is that food is distributed first to the city centre and from there redistributed towards the periphery with a concentrically raising price. This becomes most clear if we look at the informally built settlements that are mostly located in the outskirts of the city adjacent to surrounding rural area. These settlements mainly started to grow from the 1950s on. Until the 1970s the city of Medellín prospered economically. This prosperity leaded to an immense growth of the city, as in most of the other Latin American cities. It was round this time that the expansion limits of the city were reached as well. Next to the growth of industrial centers, proliferation of squatter settlements took place. This resulted in an increasing differentiation between the formally and informallu built parts of the city. The informally built neighbourhoods on the slopes around the city covers the whole ring surrounding the metropolitan area in all possible directions. A clear example of this differentiation is the food distribution system that was not equally developed throughout the city. Ever since the introduction of the Mayorista (central wholesale market) in 1971 no public markets were added to the network. Instead private developments took over, from the 90s on mainly supermarkets, and big vacuums emerged in the supply network. This imbalance causes increasing food prices for the people in lower social classes (mostly living in informally developed areas in the periphery). Next to that it creates an undesirable dependence on big scale centralized systems and organizational structures. There is a big contrast between the systematics of the informally built neighbourhoods and the (food) logistics system. The informal as a counter to the formal system is developed in a decentral and adhoc manner. The informal systematics work just like the slums themselves namely from the bottom-up. This decentral character of the informally built structures is not reflected upon in the (spatial) structure of the food distribution network in Medellín (and other Latin American metropolitan areas). The hypothesis is that this issue becomes most clear there where we can see exchange between the formal and informal. For this reason this will be the area of focus. In order to develop strategies that are complimentary to the projects that are done in the past years in Medellín the research and project that will follow from this is focused on food. The issue of food (in)security is not widely covered within the upgrading projects as they are proposed up till now. By addressing the theme of food we start at the foundation of the Maslow pyramid. We could say that without proper nutrition one is not able to develop further as a person. It makes possible that people will go to libraries, study and go to school. In more than one way it forms the basis of life. Within the process of segregation the dichotomy of formal versus informal practices plays a major role. Spatial segregation goes hand in hand with the social stratification process taking place in the urban society of Medellín. In order to tackle this dichotomy the concept of analytic borderlands (after Saskia Sassen) is introduced within the debate. The socio-economic phenomenon of informality has a big influence on the spatial reality of the city, from the emergence of informally built neighbourhoods all the way to the ambulant vendors appearing on the street. The informal can be seen as a counter to the formal system, but is as well complementary to it. It is developed in a decentralized and adhoc manner. The decentralized character of the informal is largely ignored within the contemporary spatial systematics of the city. The centralized strategies as used by the conquistadors, (formal) urban planners and food distributors have one thing in common. What they have in common is that they are not capable of dealing with the entire city as a complex (decentralized) heterogeneous system. The metropolitan food distribution in Medellín, like in a lot of other Latin American cities, is immensely centralized, which has an enormous impact on the issue of food security. If we look upon the role of the borderlands as they occur in Medellín, we see that they are as much spatially disintegrated as most of the other areas in the city. One of the main reasons for this spatial segregation is the ongoing social stratification of the urban society. On the other side we can see that the borderlands play a major role as the facilitator of exchange between what are supposed to be formal and informal systematics. If we look into the flow of commodities, in this case food distribution, than we see that these systems are not at all separated, but are fully interwoven. Next to that the necessity to reconnect demand and supply of food products will be taken in account. This results in the concept of introducing a hub that reconnects the formal and the informal, both with regards to architectural spatial aspects as well as with regards to demand and supply of food. The borderland thus plays a big role in the urban (food distribution) system, mostly in the socio-economic sense. The spatial framework that will be worked with treats the borderland as mediator between formal and informal structures. The borderland consists of a spectrum reaching from absolute formal to informal. We should take in account that there where formal elements appear in the city, the city is not fully formal. At the same time informally built pirata developments (organized informal land occupations) are not through and through informal as they can be legalized. This heterogeneous representation of the city is reflecting the urban reality more sincere and appropriate than the dichotomous view does. The conclusive urban strategy states that there is a necessity to introduce additional food trading hubs in the city. This is mainly a reaction to two specific results of the currently followed strategy. The first being the emergence of a large area that is not covered by these centrally acting distributors.The second are the homogenization attempts by the various markets in the city, mainly the Mayorista, that are not sufficiently working. Although they succeed (up to a certain extend) to keep informal activities outside their own perimeter, they are not able to do so with regard to informality in general. Informal trading emerges just next to the market, also since the two are largely depending on each other. With regards to the working of the urban distribution network an alternative is presented in the form of an decentralized hub network. Additionally to the proposed decentralized (cross dock) hubs new connections in the road network need to be introduced. One of the main objectives of decentralizing the food distribution system is to cut some of the intermediaries that are now needed, since all products (have to) pass through the Mayorista. Based on the docking station logistic system food can find its way directly to the several hubs. The food products will get closer to the consumer and this with less resale points, making a lower price possible, mainly for the people living in the (lower social strata) periphery. Additionally these hubs will be locally integrated as architectural objects within their direct context. Central to the idea of the heterogeneous borderland is the concept of hybridization. The hybrid is where the formal and the informal come together and form a hybrid cityscape. This term the hybrid cityscape will be defined based on the theoretical framework, based on the borderland and the assemblage theory (after Manuel DeLanda). Theories on hybrids, in-between worlds and an emerging third world are wide spread. From Popper’s Third World, to the Third World of Bhabha all the way to Foucault’s Heterotopia. All of these theories try in one way or the other to pose an alternative to the (then) leading concept of the dichotomy as a way to perceive the world. Although on several levels (scientific, cultural or spatial) they all aim at the same, they fill the gap that is left by the dichotomous world view. Or as Foucault puts it: “they have a function in relation to all the space that remains”. The hybrid is thus not the space that is left between the two outer poles, but forms the connection, the relation between the two. It is the middle of the spectrum between formal and informal where the hybrid cityscape emerges. Within the project the hybrid cityscape is dealt with as a product of the borderland. This is about integrating informal elements within a formal scheme. It is chosen here to work with the grid, as a representation of the universal. But instead of using the grid as a tool of homogenization it will be used to offer room for the spontaneous.","Medellín; food distribution; architecture; peripheral food market; informally built settlements; Colombia; Mayorista; informal vs formal; dichotomy; hybrid cityscape; food security; analytic borderland; assemblage theory; decentral food supply hubs; short chain; heterogenisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Explore Lab","","6.2308, 75.5906"

In the western part of the Netherlands and many other deltaic areas weak clay and peat deposits overlay stiffer sand layers. In these geological conditions flexural buckling may cause a considerable design constraint. The purpose of this thesis is to enlarge existing knowledge about this phenomenon and use this knowledge to improve the existing design methods. To validate and to further improve the existing models a comparison with the laboratory tests from the TU Munich has been made. In the laboratory research of the TU Munich; GEWI28-100 micro piles (28mm S500 GEWI steel with a 100 diameter groutshell of C20/25) with a length of 4m were used in buckling tests. In this thesis a physical non linear model of the complete GEWI pile is made in INCA. In combination with DSheet 9.2 beta the resulting moment-curvature relations obtained from INCA can be coupled to geometrical non linear (second order) analyses provided by DSheet. The lateral soil springs in DSheet are modelled with p-y curves for soft clays according to the API. Because the use of these p-y springs in a buckling calculation lead to a gross overestimation of the measured buckling loads PLAXIS 3D is used for more advanced modelling of the soil behaviour. The Kaolin (clay) used in the test of the TU Munich has been modelled with the Hardening Soil model. The resulting numerical buckling calculations in PLAXIS 3D have empirically shown that drained analyses on the basis of the undrained shear strength provides a good match with the laboratory results. The renewed model to determine the buckling of a micro pile is based on the analytical solution of the TU Munich. In this renewed version, mathematical superposition is used to determine the buckling load of each individual component of the micro pile (steel, grout and soil). By using empirical relations between strength and stiffness of the three components using numerical tools and literature the design value of the buckling load of a micro pile can be determined with a simple algorithm.","micropile; buckling; p-y curve; ankerpalen; knik; PLAXIS 3D; DSheet","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van Nes, A. (mentor)","2014","The planning intention of many post-war urban areas was to create quiet and harmonious, healthy dwelling areas for mostly working class families. However, unpredicted effects such as safety issues (crime and feeling of being unsafe in public spaces) started to take place in many of these areas just a few years after realization (Van Wegen and van der Voort, 1991, p. 172-173). The urban design of the Dutch post-war areas, like too wide streets, a lot of space between the buildings, windows and doors do not face the streets and blind facades of the backsides of the shops have a negative influence on safety in public spaces (Rueb & van Nes, 2009). Thus, the main research question of this master thesis is: “Which urban design interventions can improve the public space in Osdorp-Oost, in order to increase the safety for the inhabitants”. First, the features of public space in urban environment that contribute to safety are reviewed with the help of literature research. In this report, two approaches about safe urban design are compared. The first one is called Social Safe Design made by van den Voordt & van Wegen. This approach could be described by three factors: visibility, accessibility and attraction. The second approach was made by van Nes et al. It is actually an improvement of the first theory and could be described with the next keywords: accessibility, connectedness, vitality, identity and visibility. It was made with the help of space syntax analysis, which provides a strong scientific base for this approach. The literature review concludes that the second approach is more extended than the first one and will form a good starting point for the design of the graduation project. Next, in order to understand the main design concepts of the chosen location, in relation to safety, the social and special structure of Western Garden Cities (Osdorp-Oost) was described. Also the data research about the age groups, nationalities, incomes, housing prices and subjective and objective safety were review about the strategies that took place in order to improve the post-war neighborhoods was reviewed. Then in order to understand how the space is currently used in Osdorp-Oost and to link the location with the theory, different fieldwork analyses was performed. Safety related factors that were defined earlier in the theoretical framework such as: infrastructure, functions, the use of the ground floor, buildings heights, location of the entrances and green facilities were mapped and analyzed. In addition, in order to define safe and unsafe places in more detail in Osdorp-Oost, the inhabitant were interviewed about their perception of safe and unsafe places in the neighborhood. Four reference cases were analyzed as well: Wisgerebbuurt, Overtomse Veld, P. C. Hooftstraat and Ertskade in Amsterdam. The results of the performed analyses were implemented in several solutions for Osdorp-Oost in order to increase subjective and objective safety in Osdorp-Oost. The solutions were tested with space syntax analysis and the most suitable one was elaborated in to final design for Osdorp-Oost. The structure of the thesis is as followed. Chapter 1 forms an introduction of the project and describes motivation, problem field and problem statement. Chapter 2 describes the research approach, research questions and methodology. It also provides theoretical framework and location analysis. Chapter 3 describes the fieldwork. In the last chapter 4 the concepts and final design interventions for Osdorp-Oost are described. The chapter will finish with the final critical evaluation of the methods and design.","subjective safety; objective safety post-war neighbourhoods; design checklist","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","MSc 3, 4 Urban Regeneration","",""

This means that technical solutions have to be found to solve the entailing problems of a highway.

From experience they know in the gas industry that by adding surfactants to the water at the bottom of the well, liquid loading can be postponed to a lower reservoir pressure. The water will start to form foam, which changes the flow in the well as foam is easier to drag upwards. But the precise effect of the surfactant on the flow is still unclear.

(mentor); Brezet, J.C. (mentor)","2014","Society is changing and the government/ municipality is forced into a new role. In Rotterdam, citizen participation has already been part of the financial plan since 2010. In 2010, 3 years before the King’s speech, the executive board of the city of Rotterdam agreed on a four year financial plan to stimulate citizen initiatives in the city of Rotterdam. The municipality of Rotterdam has currently several projects running to stimulate citizen initiatives to improve the social cohesion in Rotterdam. In the collaboration with organizations and citizens of Rotterdam on initiatives, the Stadsinitiatief is one of these projects in which the municipality gains experiences in this new role. The Stadsinitiatief is an idea competition in which participants can win money prize to realize their initiative. The Stadsinitiatief wants initiatives which the citizens of Rotterdam feel part of and be proud of. The initiatives are required to be of value for the city of Rotterdam and its people. Concerning the revenue of the initiative, there are no strict criteria. Both non-profit as for-profit are allowed to participate, but both have different financial criteria which they need adhere to. What is clear is that The Stadsinitiatief is not for business ideas that have no social relevancy. The goal of the Stadsinitiatief is to “use the creativity, organization ability and decisiveness of the citizens of Rotterdam for iconic, city wide initiatives.”. The Stadsinitiatief wants to utilize the ideas and talents of citizens in Rotterdam. So what makes the Stadsinitiatief different from other competitions? Everyone from Rotterdam is allowed to participate, but the commitments from the initiators and quality of the project plans are necessary qualifications for initiatives to be considered by the board. Ultimately the initiatives that fit the criteria the best will be selected. Ultimately the initiatives that are allowed to participate must have the following focus:  Initiatives need to have social value or impact.  Initiatives should be of benefit for Rotterdam and its citizens Initiatives focused on commercial activities and who only provide economic value instead of social value are not admitted to the competition. Economic value itself is not forbidden, as long as its provided next to social value. Furthermore, for-profit initiatives have different criteria then non-profit. Ultimately the Stadsinitiatief is about initiatives being launched for the good of Rotterdam and its citizens. However, the future of Stadsinitiatief is unsure. The municipality of Rotterdam is facing a few problems: 1. high investment costs for realization of initiatives. 2. Budget cuts by the Dutch government and more importantly 3. Public dissatisfaction for spending a considerable amount of money into a single project. The municipality does not want to forsake the social willingness, extensive knowledge and funding possibilities that are existing inside the city. The municipality of Rotterdam wants to continue enabling citizens and organizations, using the previously gained experience with the Stadsinitiatief, to improve the city and help them implement potential initiatives. The municipality of Rotterdam is looking at several opportunities to keep stimulating this collaboration between citizens and organizations in Rotterdam. Luckily, the internet made it easier and cheaper for people to work together through the use of technology. A prime example of online collaboration that has grown dramatically through the years is crowdsourcing. With crowdsourcing ambitious entrepreneurs and organizations source the crowd to find a solution for their problem. Crowdsourcing can be a powerful tool to improve and launch a product or service. This can already be witnessed on platforms like Kickstarter, where the crowds finances new innovative or creative products. Crowdsourcing offers an interesting mechanism that can be beneficial to the city of Rotterdam. So how can crowdfunding be used as a solution to stimulate citizen initiatives in Rotterdam by providing the same values as the Stadsinitiatief. The Stadsinitiatief is an interesting case which should be studied deeply to get good insights on the mechanics. Three research topics were analysed in an exploratory study: 1. the Stadsinitiatief 2. Initiators’ success factors and 3. crowdsourcing. What was gained from this exploratory study is the fact that launching initiatives relies on two main factors: the entrepreneurial traits of initiators and quality of a plan. When both were present the success of an initiative was guaranteed. But both of these factors relied on other key factors. The entrepreneurial traits of initiators allowed them to become more knowledgeable, connect with participants, be open to feedback and this eventually resulted in better entrepreneurs with better developed plans. What could be seen clearly was that all the factors were intertwined. A quality plan was not possible with feedback and a successful entrepreneur needed others to make the initiative a success. This graduation project shows clearly the importance of connecting with the right persons, improving plans based on external feedback and promoting initiatives to gain public support. Based on the insights gained from these research topics, a crowdsourcing app (CityConnect) was presented that uses these main insights as main features to help initiators successfully launch initiatives. CityConnect is an app that gives initiators tools to present, improve and launch initiatives. CityConnect is also an app that helps bring initiators together with other citizens and organizations within Rotterdam. The app provides solutions for challenging insights that were gained from the research. It also clearly showed that crowdsourcing combined with a mobile solution can be a powerful tool in stimulating citizen initiatives in Rotterdam.","crowdsourcing; initiatives; social; app; mobile; Rotterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Wambeke, T. (mentor)","2014","The development of dredging as a major player for surface mine applications has led Royal IHC, a large equipment supplier and consultant for dredging and mining operations, and the TU Delft to work on more advanced optimizations techniques for the design of dredge mines. Three implications of the design of a dredge mine were found to be crucial for optimizations, namely: 1) depth control, 2) mining direction and 3) creation of multiple ponds. The conventional approach for open pit mines, in which a series of nested pits are created to determine an optimal mining sequence, was tested using the core module of Whittle and showed not to be readily applicable on dredge mines, because 1) multiple ponds may be created, 2) the depth to be mined for a certain area changes in time and 3) the nested pits expand randomly towards high graded zones. A new method for optimizing dredge mines was introduced as a second approach, which determines an ultimate depth per stacked block model, based on the cumulative values and finds an optimal route for a pond through these stacked blocks by using an adapted version of the Nearest Neighbour algorithm. Four limitations for this approach are recognized: 1) the depth difference between stacked blocks could become impractical, 2) full utilization of the field is not possible because it may reach a premature dead-end or it may enclose a group of non-mined blocks, 3) the blocks have to meet the same length and width requirements of a pond; therefore not incorporating the accuracy of the data and 4) it lacks the function ability to mine the area in layers. Project Alpha indicated that the new approach finds an optimal mine design; however, the long lifetime of the mine (>60 years) results in a low recovery of 65%. Decreasing the lifetime of the mine would result in a higher recovery. The conventional approach showed to be impractical for the design of a dredge mine, while it created multiple thin deposits.

(mentor); van der Velde, J.R.T. (mentor)","2014","Urbanisation trends in developing countries are synonymous with urban informality. This trend and the processes associated with it have a tendency to manifest themselves in a very specific type of socio-spatial structure, which is fundamentally an expression of urban political systems. Within the context of South Africa, and more specifically Durban, the marked shift towards neoliberalism has led to the establishment of an increasing informal sector, as the urban poor strive to create a means of economic survival outside of the formal system. This is largely a result of the inability of the state and the formal sector to provide sufficient employment opportunities, especially for the lower skilled population and migrants, as well as the inability of the state to meet the basic needs of the poor in terms of housing and service delivery. These new informal market spaces that are emerging, primarily in areas with high connectivity such as transport nodal points, are places with a richness of cultural diversity, strong social networks and supply linkages with the formal sector. In a post-apartheid city such as Durban, the socio-spatial segregation of the former apartheid regime is still strongly manifested within the urban structure of the city. This poses many obstacles to integration, as well as socio-economic development and environmental sustainability. Within the city of Durban, urban development is largely driven through market-based initiatives and local fragmented architectural projects, which do not take into account the current reality of the area, which is that there is a large informal economy within Durban, and that they are at current not being integrated into urban plans and development initiatives. This starting point of this thesis is that it considers the formal and informal economies to be one economic system that can respond to the unique demands of both. The approach of this thesis is based on the elements of recognition and integration towards the inclusion of the weakest actors within the planning process. This resulted in the proposal of a methodology which aims at integrated actions within a multi-scalar setting towards the recognition of the identity of the local area.","informal market; integration; participatory planning; strategic; recognition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Complex Cities","",""

(mentor)","2014","It is estimated that in the EU, energy consumption will rise to 4,350 TWh in 2030. Offshore wind farms can provide a solution. The technical wind energy potential for offshore wind farms of the European waters is estimated to be 30,000 TWh annually. For feasibility studies, building and operating offshore wind farms weather assessments are needed. These assessments used to be performed by expensive static weather stations. Nowadays advanced buoys are also used. An example is the SEAWATCH Wind LiDaR buoy equipped with a ZephIR300 LiDaR, that performs wind estimations based on the back scatter of laser pulses. Buoys are financially much more attractive than static stations, however they still have two main disadvantages: first, measurements are influenced largely by the pitch and roll motions that are created by sea waves. Second, the buoys need to be moved manually. The goal of this project is to design a scaled prototype of the SEAWATCH Wind LiDaR buoy, equipped with an actively stabilised platform and autonomous position control. This thesis focuses on the design of the actively stabilised platform and overall design of the prototype. The platform is designed with two gyroscopes, which are used to measure the angle that needs to be compensated. The compensation for motion takes place through three linear electric actuators which are controlled with a microcontroller. The total buoy is designed to closely match the dimensions of the SEAWATCH Wind LiDaR buoy. After testing the design, it can be concluded that the built prototype can stabilise a maximum angle of 38 degrees within 3,2 s. When stabilised, the maximum deviation angle of the platform is 3,3 degrees. The overall design of the buoy closely matched the scaled dimensions of the SEAWATCH Wind LiDaR buoy. The design is waterproof, floats and is able to sail in desired directions. It is therefore determined that proof of principle for an actively stabilised platform on an offshore buoy is demonstrated. For further development it is recommended to have a larger budget in order to purchase faster actuators. Also the actuators must be able to resist a large amount of side stress to prevent breakage. It is also recommended to reduce the noise influences of the gyroscope and develop a more accurate test setup. Finally it is recommended to design both a self-sufficient power system and to add partial heave control to the platform control.","active stabilisation; platform; buoy; lidar; wind assesment; SEAWATCH; buoy; wind farm","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2014-07-03","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","","",""

We present a first tool that efficiently retrieves the protein sequences by just comparing the fingerprints, even in the presence of a high error rate. A clustering method is first employed to reduce the redundancy of the database. Given a fingerprint, our algorithm employs an efficient filtering strategy to identify potential matches and a dynamic programming to verify the matches found. These matches are then mapped back to the original fingerprint database to get the final proteins. We analyzed the detection behavior on simulated data and investigated how the use of additional information may improve the performance.

(mentor)","2014","Het Nuon Solar Team gaat voor het eerst meedoen met een nieuwe race: de SASOL solar challenge in Zuid- Afrika. Deze race is totaal anders opgebouwd dan hetwereld kampioenschap dat elke twee jaar wordt gereden in Australië. Het doel in Zuid-Afrika is om zoveel mogelijk kilometers af te leggen in een gegeven tijd, terwijl in Australië het doel was om een gegeven aantal kilometers af te leggen in een zo kort mogelijke tijd. Daarom is het nodig dat er een nieuwe strategie wordt ontwikkeld voor de race in Zuid-Afrika. In dit project is een model gemaakt voor de lange termijn strategie. Het doel van de race in Zuid-Afrika is zo veel mogelijk kilometers afleggen in een gegeven tijd. De race bestaat uit acht etappes en in elke etappe is er de mogelijkheid een extra rondje te rijden. Dit extra rondje mag zo vaak mogelijk gereden worden en ligt op een vaste plek op de route. Dit betekent dus dat de afstand gemaximaliseerd kan worden door het aantal extra gereden rondjes per dag te optimaliseren. De strategie is bepaald door de volgende drie stappen te doorlopen: de data analyseren, de race modelleren en het optimaliseren. De data bestaan uit twee soorten: de route data en de weersvoorspellingen. Deze datasets zijn geanalyseerd en vervolgens gebruikt bij het modelleren van de race. Bij het modelleren van de race zijn eerst de route en de weersvoorspellingen op een juiste manier ingeladen. Daarna zijn de energieinkomsten en het energieverbruik gemodelleerd zodat hiermee op elk moment van de race de Battery State of Charge (BSOC) kan worden voorspeld. Vervolgens is er geoptimaliseerd met behulp van NOMAD. Dit is een algoritme gemaakt voor op simulatie gebaseerde optimalisatie. De doelfunctie van de optimalisatie is de totaal gereden afstand met als beslissingsvariabelen het aantal extra rondjes dat wordt gereden per etappe. Er is maar één voorwaarde: de BSOC moet altijd boven de ondergrens van de batterij liggen. Deze optimalisatie is vervolgens uitgevoerd voor meerdere weersvoorspellingen. Voor de weersvoorspelling van 23-04-2014 geeft dit dat er 4535 kilometer afgelegd kan worden tijdens de race en er een gemiddelde snelheid van 56 km/h wordt behaald. Deze snelheid is erg laag, maar dit komt omdat het weer in Zuid-Afrika in april veel slechter is dan in september. Als laatste zijn in dit verslag nog aanbevelingen te vinden voor hoe de strategie verbeterd en uitgebreid kan worden zodat Nuna straks kan winnen in Zuid-Afrika.","Nuna; Strategie; Nuon Solar Team; Zonneauto; Solarcar; Zonnewagen","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","Dit document beschrijft het ontwerpproces van een deel van de subsystemen uit het Battery Management System wat voor het bachelor eindproject is uitgevoerd. Voor het ontwerp van het BMS is een modulaire master-slave topologie gebruikt. De behandelde subsystemen zijn de spanningsmeting, de voeding, het PCB-ontwerp en de CAN-isolatie. De belangrijkste problemen in deze subsystemen bij het huidige BMS zijn dat de afzonderlijke cellen een ander spanningsniveau krijgen, dat het BMS de cellen te snel ontlaadt en dat de communicatie via CAN niet optimaal is. Na onderzoek bleek dat de eerste twee problemen werden veroorzaakt door niet praktische waarden voor de ingangsimpedantie voor de afzonderlijke cel aansluitingen. Het gekozen ontwerp voor de spanningsmeting maakt daarom gebruik van een multiplex topologie, dus een hoge ingangsimpe-dantie wanneer het BMS uit is. De implementatie hiervan wordt verzorgd door een IC. Gemeten is dat de ingangimpedantie van de ontworpen spanningsmeting in de orde ligt van tientallen MW. Voor de voeding is gebruik gemaakt van twee buck-converters, omdat de CAN communicatie galvanisch gescheiden dient te zijn. De converters zijn ge?mplementeerd met IC’s als switch en bereiken efficienties van 80% en 55% in het toegepaste bereik. Tevens zijn de rimpelspanningen 70 mV en 24 mV voor respec-tievelijk de PCB- en de CAN-converter. Gezien de context waarin dit ontwerp plaatsvindt, is er tijdens het ontwerp steeds op gelet om energiever-liezen zo gering mogelijk te houden. Zo is er ook onderzoek gedaan naar het exacte energieverbruik van het totale circuit. In de praktijk is een aanverbruik gemeten van 122:0 mW . Het uitverbruik is gemeten op 1:36 mA. Waarmee aan de eisen voor het ontladen en energieverbruik wordt voldaan. Alle genoemde onderdelen zijn ge¨ ?mplementeerd op een PCB van eurocard formaat, waarbij zoveel moge-lijk rekening is gehoudenmet EMC. Een groot deel van de systemen is uitvoerig getest, de spanningsmeting is echter nog niet getest maar zou volgens de data-sheet wel ruimschoots aan de eisen moeten voldoen. Gecontroleerd is met een IR-camera dat de temperatuursstijging binnen de perken blijft, wanneer grote stromen door de balanceertraces lopen. De gemeten stijging is 6 C wanneer er een stroom loopt van 6 A gedurende 30 seconden. Het PCB ontwerp voldoet aan de voorwaarden wat betreft de connectoren, het gewicht en de fmetingen. Zo weegt het gehele BMS in totaal 394 gram en wordt hiermee aan de gewichtseis voldaan. Voordat het systeem daadwerkelijk in Nuna wordt ge?mplementeerd dienen nog meer uitgebreide tests gedaan te worden, waaronder vooral ook een duurtest en een test bij hogere omgevingstemperaturen.","Battery Managent System; Nuna","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2019-08-13","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Electronics","",""

(mentor)","2014","Offshore electrical energy production out of wind energy is a growing market. Wind and water data is needed to measure the most profitable location to set up offshore wind farms. Retrieving the required information can be done by placing expensive masts or deploying moored buoys with measuring equipment. The problem with moored buoys is that they need to be relocated by ship every time wind data from a different position is need, which can be time-consuming and expensive. The goal of this thesis is to design an autonomous positioning system for a scaled prototype of an offshore wind measurement buoy. The main requirements connected to this goal is that the system must be able to measure its current position, calculate in which direction it must travel to reach its destination and have appropriate propulsion to move the prototype toward that destination. The prototype must also be able to keep its position and prevent itself from drifting off. From tests performed on this prototype, recommendation for the design of a full-scale autonomous positioning buoy are derived. The system that is designed uses a GPS module to measure its location and a gyroscope to measure its orientation. A microcontroller uses this information to calculate the direction to a pre-programmed destination. This direction is used to sent signals to two motor drivers, which control two DC motors with propellers attached to them. The system is designed in such a way that it can be easily added to the scaled prototype of the buoy: the motors are attached to the underside of the prototype, while the rest is placed inside the prototype. The different parts of the autonomous positioning system are tested, confirming that they work like they were designed to. The prototype with the system attached can move itself in any horizontal direction, and the correct signals to control the motors are generated. Due to a failing test setup, a test that combines these parts was unsuccessfully. For the design of the full-scale buoy, a different hull shape for the buoy is recommended. The designed propulsion costs too much power when scaled up to be realizable in full-scale. For more accurate navigation, the use of an electric compass is recommended above a gyroscope. An electric compass measures the Earth's magnetic field to calculated which way is north. Also techniques like Differential GPS or accelerometers can be considered for more accurate positioning. Differential GPS (DGPS) uses signals with GPS corrections sent by land stations to get a more accurate position measurement.","buoy; boei; autonomous; positioning system","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Ziekenhuizen krijgen kleinere subsidies, maar de kwaliteit van de zorg mag niet achteruit gaan. Door processen in het ziekenhuis te optimaliseren, kan er voor gezorgd worden dat de jaarlijkse kosten van een ziekenhuis achteruit gaan. Hiermee wordt dan niet de kwaliteit van de zorg aangetast. Een kostenpost van een ziekenhuis die door middel van optimalisatie verkleint zou kunnen worden, zijn de kosten van operaties. Om te kunnen opereren heeft de chirurg instrumenten nodig, deze instrumenten liggen in instrumentennetten. Elk type instrumentennet heeft een vast inhoud qua soorten instrumenten en hoeveelheden instrumenten. Aangezien voor elke soort operaties bekend is welke instrumenten hiervoor nodig zijn, kan er voor elke operatie al de benodigde instrumentennetten in de OK worden gelegd. Echter zitten er vaak ook instrumenten in deze netten die niet gebruikt worden tijdens de operatie. Aangezien deze instrumenten wel in de OK zijn geweest en dus niet meer steriel zijn, moeten deze instrumenten onnodig gesteriliseerd worden. Deze scriptie gaat over het optimaliseren van de indeling van instrumentennetten. Op het gebied van het optimaliseren van de indeling van instrumentennetten is nog weinig onderzoek gedaan. Er is tot nu toe een specifiek onderzoek gedaan naar het optimaliseren van de indeling van instrumentennetten. Het resultaat van dit model is echter dat het model niet oplosbaar is. In het onderzoek van deze scriptie wordt gebruik gemaakt van een Heuristiek, genaamd Simulated Annealing. Dit is een Local Search heuristiek. Local Search algoritmes beginnen bij een begintoestand en bekijken dan de buurtoestanden, de toestanden die dicht bij de begintoestand liggen. De buuroplossingen worden bekeken en daarna wordt de beste oplossing gekozen. Dan wordt deze beste oplossing de nieuwe begintoestand en wordt er wederom naar de buuroplossingen van deze begintoestand gekeken. Dit herhaalt zich net zolang tot er geen betere oplossing gevonden wordt. Er is dan een lokaal optimum gevonden, dit hoeft echter geen globaal optimum te zijn. Met behulp van Simulated Annealing is de indeling van de instrumentennetten van het Haga-Ziekenhuis geoptimaliseerd. Resultaat van het onderzoek geeft weer dat het mogelijk is om de totale kosten, qua opslagkosten van de netten en de sterilisatiekosten van de instrumenten, te kunnen laten dalen met 6,7% door de instrumentennetten te herindelen. Dit is een besparing van 7600 per jaar voor het HagaZiekenhuis. Verder onderzoek naar de keuze van de parameters van het algoritme van Simulated Annealing zou wellicht een nog grotere kostenbesparing kunnen opleveren. Dit zou een vervolgonderzoek kunnen zijn op deze scriptie. Een andere mogelijk vervolgonderzoek is de indeling van de instrumentennetten te optimaliseren met een andere heuristiek.","instrument; instrumenten; instrumentennet; net; simulated annealing; heuristiek; optimaliseren; optimalisatie; local search; HagaZiekenhuis; OK; sterilisatiekosten; ziekenhuis","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Optimization","","","",""

We present a semi-automated framework for comparative visualization of inflammatory lesions in MRI of the spine in axial SpA patients. The first part of our method localizes and segments the VUs using a fully automatic algorithm based on quasi-periodicity of vertebral column intensity profile and tissue class probability maps. The second part uses these segmentations to align baseline and follow-up scans by deriving a locally rigid transform from a pre-computed deformable registration. To facilitate visual comparison, the co-registered baseline and follow-up images are fused in a single color-encoded difference image. This allows an expert reader to efficiently interpret progressive changes while focusing on just one image.

De wens van NedTrain en het doel van dit project is om deze software uit te breiden met de functionaliteit om flexibele schema's te berekenen. Deze roosterproblemen hebben te maken met het probleem dat ook wel bekend staat als het Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem. Hierbij wordt er naar een schema gezocht voor bijvoorbeeld het onderhoud aan treinen. Doordat elke trein binnen een bepaalde tijd gerepareerd moet worden en er ook rekening gehouden moet worden met de beschikbare resources, is dit probleem moeilijk om op te lossen. De bestaande software van NedTrain bestaat uit een interface, genaamd de NedTrain Planner, en een solver, die er voor zorgt dat instanties opgelost worden. Deze software kan echter alleen vaste schema's genereren. Op het moment dat er activiteiten verplaatst worden, kunnen er conflicten ontstaan, waardoor het schema niet meer geldig is. Dit wordt opgelost door het implementeren van een nieuwe solver. Deze solver maakt gebruik van het chaining algoritme en de COIN Linear Programming library. Het chaining algoritme is nodig om te zorgen dat bij het verplaatsen van activiteiten het schema consistent blijft qua resources. De COIN LP library is gebruikt om flexibiliteitsintervallen te kunnen berekenen, die vervolgens worden weergegeven in de interface.","resource constrained scheduling; NedTrain; RCPSP; chaining; linear programming","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Algorithmics","","","",""

(mentor); Van den Berg, P.L. (mentor); Aardal, K.I. (mentor)","2014","Ambulanceplaatsingsmodellen hebben tot doel om ambulances op een efficiënte manier over een gebied te verdelen. In Nederland streeft men ernaar zoveel mogelijk oproepen binnen 15 minuten te dekken. Een oproeppunt wordt ‘gedekt’ door een ambulance als deze binnen 15 minuten na melding bij 112 ter plekke kan zijn. In dit onderzoek wordt de werking van een zestal statische ambulanceplaatsingsmodellen vergeleken. De belangrijkste modellen zijn MCLP, MEXCLP en ATTM3. De andere modellen (DSM, ATTM en MALP) zijn in bepaalde mate variaties op deze modellen. MCLP is een model dat vaak wordt gebruikt om standplaatsen te bepalen. Dit model maximaliseert de oproepen die door tenminste één ambulance gedekt worden. MEXCLP heeft ook tot doel de dekking door tenminste één ambulance te maximaliseren, maar houdt daarbij rekening met de kans dat een ambulance al kan zijn uitgerukt. ATTM3 is een model dat tijdens dit onderzoek is ontwikkeld. ATTM3 minimaliseert de gemiddelde aanrijtijd (de tijd die het kost om naar een oproeppunt te rijden) en houdt daarbij rekening met de beschikbaarheid van de drie dichtstbijzijnde ambulances. In het eerste deel van het onderzoek bepalen de modellen voor elke Nederlandse ambulanceregio zowel de standplaatsen als het aantal ambulances per standplaats. De vergelijking vindt vervolgens plaats aan de hand van elf verschillende criteria (zoals bijvoorbeeld door hoeveel ambulances een punt wordt gedekt, gemiddelde aanrijtijd en oplostijd). Het blijkt dat MEXCLP en ATTM3 het beste scoren op deze criteria. In het tweede deel van het onderzoek worden eerst de standplaatsen bepaald met MCLP. Vervolgens bepalen de andere vijf modellen hoe de ambulances over deze standplaatsen moeten worden verdeeld. Dit met het doel te onderzoeken hoe de doelfuncties en de elf criteria worden beïnvloed als alleen MCLP standplaatsen kunnen worden gebruikt. Het blijkt dat de doelfuncties en de kenmerkende criteria van de modellen ernstig verslechteren.","ambulance; plaatsingsmodel; ambulanceplaatsingsmodel; MCLP; MALP; MEXCLP; DSM; ATTM; ATTM3; ambulanceplaatsingsmodellen; plaatsingsmodellen; ambulances; ambulance location model; emergency medical services","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Optimization","","","",""

(mentor); Van den Dobbelsteen, J.J. (mentor)","2014","Easy access to the current status of a surgery in the operating room (OR) can be beneficial to hospitals since it can improve the working efficiency and reduce the operational costs. Using indoor positioning systems (IPS) to obtain the position information of medical staffs in the OR could be an indirect method to enhance the awareness of the current status of a surgery. Among various IPSs available in the market, the proximity-based infrared positioning system could be selected as a possible option for the application in OR considering its advantages like short-range detection, low price and less signal interference with the medical equipment. However, infrared signal cannot penetrate opaque materials, which poses a potential problem of signal blockage in the OR, an environment that is crowded with medical devices and medical staffs. In order to analyze the working performance of the infrared positioning system in the OR, a simulation platform was proposed and developed in this project to simulate the working behavior of the system. Using the platform developed in this project, scenarios were simulated where tags attached at different parts of a medical staff can be detected by infrared transmitters installed in the OR. Based on the results generated from the simulations, data analysis was done to evaluate the working performance of the infrared indoor positioning system in the OR. Specifically, our research focused on the relationship among the following three parameters: detection rate, tag position and OR context. Simulation results revealed that tag position and OR context have different effects on the detection rates of tags: 1) Tag position has huge effects on the detection rate, with head and arms yielding high detection rates and the rest of body components (back/chest and legs) yielding low detection rates. 2) OR context on the other hand, does not have significant effects on the detection rates of tags. These conclusions provide better reference for potential application of IPS in the OR: when considering a proximity-based infrared system as an IPS in the OR, special attention should be paid to the tag positions on the human body, while the possible change of the OR context would not be a big factor of influence.","proximity detection; IPS; infrared; OR; Unity3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-02","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor)","2014","Nippon Express NL is a third party logistic warehouse service provider. At they’re Amstelveen site where they cater only to Canon Europe N.V., they are challenged by a varying customer demand where the maximum load is nearly twice the average workload. Within CCB a number of activities are performed for CENV. NEN seeks to optimize their warehousing activities in order to minimize the resources used and reduce order throughput time while complying to the requirements and throughput capacity set by CENV. NEN therefore seeks alternative warehouse systems that could improve the utilization of the material of CCB and improve the control of the workload of CCB. Using a flow model, the processes within CCB are identified as well as the various flows of goods within CCB. Each of these flows, or product families, are input for creating a value stream map to determine the throughput times and value added times. As example of the result of the VSM, the average lead time of inbound combination 01000010101 is 09:47:15 while the VAT is 01:49:13. Meaning the VAT is only 18,6% of the lead time. In other words, 81,2% of the time (07:58:02) the work necessary stands still somewhere in CCB. One of the main reasons for these large waiting times is the amount of work that is released unto the work floor. The capacity and workforce of CCB is being utilized to their best abilities.

(mentor); Rommens, O. (mentor); Jennen, P. (mentor)","2014","When we walk on the streets in Istanbul, we are submerged by second use of space. The background offered by the city is an opportunity for interpretations. Facades are a layer of time, the streets a giant market, tracks in empty plots an inscription of flows... Spontaneity is overlapping with established rules. It is like the every built part of the city is customizable in a context of tremendous change. While entire districts are demolished and rebuilt in the name of modernity, social practices turns out to disappear leaving new spaces without appropriation due to the fact that individual expression is stifled. Thus we have to look from the inside of the informal use of formal spaces to imagine new ‘open’ spaces. However, while trying to conceptualize space in architecture it is difficult to grasp how the small everyday events and small details of spatial practice partake in the production of public realm. A theoretical pictorial language intends to sum up each of the situation. Through abstraction, as means to map, a focus is put on the spatiality of the appropriation. The idea is to unveil different practices encounter in the context of Istanbul which reveal different interpretations of what the city is for ‘common people’. Thus the aim is to understand the character of everyday life which might appear boring, repetitive and alienating but at the same time potentially original, vigorous and emancipating. It is important to articulate those mechanisms in order to understand the appropriation as part of the experience of interaction rather than just a framework of experience for the development of the project. The insights given by the research and the daily practices helped me to locate a strategic site to design a public building landscape based on the community. The project takes into account the social practices already in THE place. The main idea is to preserve the informal uses of space in a zone under a future eviction. Thus, the analysis of informal network in a macro scale shows where the most intense location is located. The project takes place on the edge of social interactions present on the site. It follows the border of the inscription made by the movement and practices of people. Thus, the project is placed as a link in the site, edging what is already there, contrasting but not conflicting. It is a link between past and future for new appropriations. This columns landscape appears as a drawing, blurring the practices, a sort of an ambiguous forest. A meticulous design phase allowed to leave room for indeterminacy. Thus, the project cannot be grasp at once, and the infinite possibility of routes allows an infinite discovery of spaces and an intense interaction between people, project and environment.","ambiguity; appropriation; Istanbul; border conditions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Public Building_Border Conditions","",""

Huidige oplaadpalen voor elektrische personenauto's zijn ontworpen om slechts één voertuig tegelijkertijd op te laden. Het probleem dat hieruit voortvloeit is verspilling van laadcapaciteit wanneer auto's langer worden geplaatst dan de oplaadtijd. In deze thesis wordt toegelicht hoe de hardware van een oplaadpaal kan worden ontworpen zodat er op één 32 ampère-aansluiting en door koppeling aan een gebouwbeheersysteem meerdere auto's opgeladen kunnen worden. De hardware word onderverdeeld in vijf verschillende onderdelen: de communicatie met de server, de autocommunicatie, de stroomaansturing, het meten van de oplaadstroom en het regelen van de stroomwaarde. In de servercommunicatie wordt gekeken welk protocol er gebruikt wordt en welke gegevensoverdracht er plaats moet vinden. De autocommunicatie detecteert de bepaalde autostatussen. De stroomaansturing wordt gedaan door het aansturen via een 'pilot'-signaal. De stroommeter wordt gebruikt om de werkelijk afgenomen oplaadstroom van het net te meten. Ten slotte krijgt de stroomregelaar vanuit de server een ingestelde stroomwaarde, vergelijkt deze met de werkelijke gemeten oplaadstroom en zorgt ervoor dat de stroomaansturing correct wordt aangestuurd. Aan de hand van een programma van eisen worden verschillende implementatiemogelijkheden bedacht. Na een afweging wordt een bepaalde keuze verder gespecificeerd, geïmplementeerd en ten slotte gesimuleerd. De hardwareschakeling wordt geïntegreerd in een circuit en getest. Ten slotte volgt nog een iteratiestap waarin het totaalsysteem getest wordt gevolgd door een conclusie, reflectie van de opgestelde eisen en aanbevelingen. Er is gevonden dat deze schakeling de vermogensdistributie over meerdere auto's mogelijk maakt. De gevonden hardwarekostenbesparing voor bepaalde toepassingen is significant. Hierdoor kan in een massaoplaadconfiguratie een veelvoud aan schakelingen worden geplaatst.","elektrische voertuigen; elektrische auto's; opladen; pulsbreedtemodulatie; hall sensoren; priva","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Prins, M. (mentor)","2014","According to current theory, corporate real estate departments should choose a limited set of personalized Key Performance Indicators that are based on their own strategy and context. In general, organizations are often found to lack an objective assessment and rationale for the selection of these KPIs. Although previous studies have made an inventory of a large amount of possible performance indicators for real estate, still relatively little is known about what inluences the choice for certain indicators. In this study the factors that influence an organization to choose certain KPI’s to benchmark their real estate are uncovered. In order to do this, 22 interviews were conducted with a variety of experts and practitioners. As a general conclusion, it can be posited that two of the strongest influences that were found are the current financial crisis and the fact that CREM departments report to finance. These two factors both cause a strong focus on quantitative and especially financial KPI’s. However, what influences benchmarking practices above all is the fact that benchmarking is a very complex process, many challenges can be encountered along the way and producing truly meaningful results requires competence, experience and a well-structured process. Organizations, on average are found to have built still relatively little experience and competence in this area, only the most basic kpi’s are used as portfolio-wide benchmarks and the validity and completeness of these benchmarks is still low.","Real Estate; Benchmarking; Performance measurement; KPI; Key Performance Indicators; Measuring; Performance; Indicators; Performance indicators; Challenges; Opportunities; Benchmarking process; Strategic; Added value; Adding value","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Real Estate Management","",""

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor)","2014","The main goal of this project is to verify the numerical model SWASH when dealing with overtopping prediction by comparison of full scale measurement results to results of numerical model testing. For that purpose, the harbour in Zeebrugge (Belgium) has been considered; there, several storm events have been measured in a rubble mound breakwater section. In order to get a proper reproduction of these, a stepwise process has been carried out: First, wave propagation has been tested in SWASH along a flat flume. Results have shown good performance of the software. The next step was to introduce a smooth impermeable dike on a shallow scenario. Also in this case, good performance has been observed; propagating waves reaching the dike are affected from reflection and they are able to run-up the slope, getting overtopping records in some cases. Finally, to get a proper reproduction for the real case in Zeebrugge, porosity was added to the dike in the prior step. It has been concluded that SWASH is not able to model breakwaters only by means of a porous structure; therefore, an impermeable core is required to allow simulation of real phenomena. After conducting some tests over an impermeable core with an outer porous layer, it has been proved the software is not able to reach reliable levels for waves running up the slope. Strong dissipation is taking place within the porous layer, so that SWASH is concluded to underestimate overtopping prediction for rubble mound breakwaters.","wave overtopping; SWASH; Zeebrugge; porous structure; antifer blocks","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","51.353798, 3.171246"

Traditional NPV analysis proves to be limited due to a number of reasons, such as lack of capturing uncertainty and lack of changing the course of action when new information becomes available. The real options framework addresses the limitations of NPV and has proven to be suitable for valuations, assuming that the models are calibrated to realistic conditions.

De manier waarop spreadsheets ingevuld worden, laat echter vaak te wensen over. Er zitten vaak fouten in gecompliceerde spreadsheets, zoals lege cellen, veranderde formaten, verwijzingen naar niet-bestaande cellen, enzovoorts. In de praktijk blijkt dat spreadsheets vaak door meerdere mensen beheert en ingevuld worden. Het zou in dit geval wenselijk zijn om regels op te stellen waaraan een ingevulde spreadsheet zou moeten voldoen. Dit zou kunnen voorkomen dat (gedeeltelijk) fout ingevulde spreadsheets uitgewisseld worden binnen een organisatie. Infotron wil een oplossing aanbieden voor dit probleem: het incorrect en onvolledig invullen van spreadsheets. Hiervoor wil het een systeem genaamd DeliverXL op de markt brengen dat een maker van een spreadsheet template de mogelijkheid geeft voorwaarden te stellen aan het invullen van deze spreadsheet. Wij, vier derdejaarsstudenten aan de Technische Universiteit te Delft, zijn deze uitdaging voor het bacheloreindproject aangegaan. Bij dit project is het de bedoeling te laten zien dat men in staat is om succesvol een volledig softwareproject te doorlopen. Het ontwikkelde eindproduct DeliverXL biedt de mogelijkheid om op gebruiksvriendelijke manier voorwaarden voor een spreadsheet op te geven. In het systeem is er onderscheid gemaakt tussen managers die spreadsheets van voorwaarden voorzien, en submitters die ingevulde spreadsheets inleveren. Managers hebben een overzicht van alle ingeleverde en gecontroleerde spreadsheets. Submitters hebben een overzicht van alle spreadsheets die ze nog moeten invullen. Bij het inleveren van een ingevulde spreadsheet wordt het bestand automatisch door het systeem gecontroleerd en ontvangt de submitter uitgebreide feedback mocht het bestand niet goed ingevuld zijn. De ontwikkeling van DeliverXL is opgedeeld in zogenaamde milestones. Aan het einde van elke milestone was een werkend product beschikbaar. Het product is ontwikkeld als webapplicatie met een Model View Controller opdeling. Doordat het systeem uitgebreid is getest is de kwaliteit van het eindproduct gewaarborgd. De implementatie is door feedback van de Software Improvement Group kwalitatief verbeterd, waardoor de code goed te onderhouden is en geschikt is voor uitbreiding. Het product zoals het nu is, zou in principe in huidige staat op de markt gebracht kunnen worden. Toch zouden wij adviseren, op basis van feedback uit het bedrijfsleven, nog extra functionaliteit toe te voegen om het product commercieel aantrekkelijker te maken.","deliverxl; infotron; spreadsheet; excel; constraint; template; voorwaarden; voorwaardenset; validatie","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Hoeven, F.D. (mentor)","2014","The graduation research focusses on mitigations in the built environment abating aircraft noise which can used by urban planners, designers and policy makers operating in airport regions. Aircraft noise is an issue for airport regions as it forces building restrictions upon aircraft noise exposed areas (e.g. for Schiphol and the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area) and increases the chance people living in such areas will face (stress related) physical disorders. Instead of focusing on the noise source (the aircraft) this research aims to develop mitigations which can be applied within the built environment for different varieties of aircraft noise. The research first develops aircraft noise abating solutions by literature study, which are converted to twenty-four design patterns. The design pattern methodology has showed to be effective to translate (technical) information to design and planning tools and incorporates today’s complex realm of (airport) urban planning and design. Moreover, the research maps average and incidental sound pressure levels in the Schiphol area which are used to indicate where in the vicinity of Schiphol the design patterns can be applied. This results in design pattern which are partly generic (can be applied in any airport region) and specific (application of the design patterns in the Schiphol area). Aside from design patterns, also a qualitative system to analyse the effects and presence of (spatial) aircraft noise abating solutions in airport regions has been developed. By this analysis framework, different areas within the Schiphol region are analysed which indicates how the existing area can be optimized. In the final parts of the thesis, the design patterns are tested by two design cases. The first case aims to test the application of design patterns by urban designers and planners working in the Schiphol area. The results are positive but suggests further research and simplification of the design patterns in needed. The second case addresses an individual design proposal which is tested in a numerical model. The numerical model quantifies the sound pressure level reduction for the aircraft noise variety the second design case focussed on. The results are positive and show the design patterns applied in the second case contribute to increased sound pressure levels although more research will be needed.","aircraft noise; noise reduction; spatial interventions; spatial analysis; Schiphol; noise modelling; urban physics; building technology; building materialization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Explore lab","",""

(mentor)","2014","KE-works is a six years old company which aims to optimise the product development process in industrial applications. To accomplish this, KE-works deploys a web-application called KE-chain. KEchain is an engineering workflow management system with the objective to increase the efficiency of the product development process through better control, more efficient distribution, access and use of product-related information. Users have the possibility to set-up a project, manage the tasks belonging to this project, and control the workflow and information distribution. With KE-chain users are able to create structure in the heap of information that composes their product and, when used right, improve the process of their project development. One of the key elements in optimising the product development process is the monitoring of the available data to give users insight in the status of the project. Currently it is difficult to get a good overview of a project within KE-chain and it is not possible to see what tasks are cirtical at a certain moment. A common way of showing the status or performance of systems is the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s). These indicators, for example in the form of a graph or a table, can quickly give information about the performance of a system. KE-works has decided that it wants to give its users an overview in the formof a project-specific dashboard with KPI widgets. Therefore the assignment is to design and develop an integrated KPI dashboard into KE-chain. To design the KPI dashboard, which we named KE-board, we shortly researched the field of Performance Measurement to get an overview of the different approaches for the design of KPI’s. As a basis for the design we have adopted the Lean methodology [1] which has been used by KE-works in the past. In our research we have actually connected the Lean wastes to measures in KE-chain. To do this, we have chosen a bottom-up approach, which means we started by identifying the available data, after which we extracted several groups of measures. We have interviewed several clients of KEworks, the users of KE-chain. From these interviews we deducted which groups of measures were important for which user roles. To verify which measures are of importance for these dashboards, we have questioned and interviewd the consultants of KE-works. By combining the results of the interviews and the questionnaires we designed 7 KPI widgets. Finally, we created KE-board and integrated it into KE-chain in five weeks of implementation. After that we have evaluated the complete dashboard by interviewing the consultants of KE-works. On top of that, we have sent them a questionnaire in which they rated the functionality of the widgets to see if they contribute to their purpose and achieve the goals that we set for them. KE-board has been received well by the management and employees of KE-works and according to the extensive evaluation we can state that it definitely contributes to the optimization of the product development process in KE-chain.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Computer Science","",""

Architecture is not only the images we see, but in fact a multidimensional experience, which goes beyond the visible. From this perspective to space my research question was formulated as: how can the characteristic and qualities of sound become an alternative way of mapping, interpreting and designing space? The way I approached my research on sound and space in relation to architecture is based on the theory of B.Blesser and L_R. Salter in the combination of R. Ganchrow. All architecture theoreticians dealing with the relation of sound and space, suggests that in the perception of sound the observer is the vantage point , the center of space , and from this point sound is able to deform and distort the perceived space. In the Aural Architecture: The invisible character of space, Blesser and Salter theorize the aural arenas that shaped around the observer, who is the center of space. They emphasize that the materiality of the physical space is able to reconfigure our aural arena. They suggest that sound interacting with reflecting surfaces acts like amplifiers of the aural space, while absorbing materials shrink our acoustic arenas. Based on this and on the deformable character of sound mentioned by Ganchrow, it is arguable that sound interacting with reflective material expends while absorption shrinks the physical limitation of the space as perceived by the observer. One example of applying this theory is by a mapping started with decomposing the space first into elements that produce sound and second to architectural elements that influence the character of sound, such as materials that reflect (amplify) and absorb , producing a wide catalog. This is followed by breaking down the site into spatial compositions - from narrow to wide spaces which influence the character of sound. From all the inventory mappings, what interested me is how sound interacts with space and how it is able to transform the perceived space by reflection and absorption (similarly to vision) which was tested to represent by different mapping methods such as transcriptions, photograph, collage, spatial narratives, and experimental perspectives. As a conclusion of the research, on a social level sound is an emotive medium of space. It influences the perception of space and it shapes or deforms social relationships. Sound is also a performativity medium of space (city) that is shaped by its inhabitants and belongs to its inhabitants. Another important spatial aspect of sound can be found in its interactive character . Sound interacts not only with the observer, but also with the space itself. Sound by nature belongs to space and therefore to architecture. Sound in space adds multiple dimensions to the built environment such as time, movement (though reverberation) and rhythm. By those characteristics sound is bonded with architecture.","sound space body","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Public Building","","Border Conditions","",""

(mentor); Correlje, A. (mentor); Annema, J.A. (mentor); Fens, T. (mentor)","2014","In order to meet EU climate commitments, the Netherlands need to accelerate the growth of renewable energy production. The energy market in the Netherlands is a partly regulated market, transport and generation of electricity are regulated. Therefore, governmental policies have an effect on the emergence of renewable energy technologies in the Netherlands. The Dutch government decided to increase the use of renewable energy by supporting measures such as subsidies and fiscal incentives. The focus of this research is on solar electricity production by Photo Voltaic (PV) panels in the Netherlands. To this end, four feasible policy options are developed. A cost benefit analysis is used to study the effect of the four solar PV scenarios. High adoption rates of PV mainly effect the medium voltage (MV) and low voltage (LV) electricity grid and are the focal point of this research. The high voltage grid and the international energy market are out of scope of this study. Four solar PV scenarios are developed for the year 2030 based on policies contradictions related to the Dutch electricity system. New formulas are developed to study the effects of the solar PV scenarios on the Dutch electricity grid. Those new formulas are additional grid limitations for grid design and will help to estimate future grid limitations when adoption rates of solar PV rise. Peak loads caused by solar PV are determined and compared to the utilization of today’s grid This methodology allows to calculated the effects of high adoption rates of solar PV, on a national level. This study showed that large parts of the grid have enough capacity for high adoption rates of solar PV. When more than 50% (14.4 GWp more than twice the installed capacity of Germany, which has the highest adoption rate of solar PV worldwide) of all feasible roof area is covered with solar modules grid capacity limitations at Low Voltage (LV) and Medium Voltage (MV) will be exceeded. Capacity limitations will arise first at LV/MV transformers, because reserve capacity is limited. However transformers can be relocated and therefore capacity enlargement is relative cheap. Moreover cable limitations will be exceeded primarily at older grid sections. When grid sections are renovated it is relative low cost to double the capacity. Solar PV affects power quality, although capacity limitations are reached before power quality becomes normative. The grid analysis is an important input for the cost benefit analysis executed in this study. The effects are relative low in the lowest three solar PV scenarios, however they are significant in the most extreme solar PV scenario. This study showed that solar PV has a positive contribution to the national welfare when solar PV used as an additional power scours. At (extreme) high adoption rates of solar PV, the national welfare effects are negative. Moreover this study shows that costs and benefits of solar PV are unequally distributed over stakeholders. Residential solar PV owners are net winners. The Dutch government, gird operators and the current power suppliers are net losers. In contradiction to the principles of a CBA it is moral not acceptable to compensate the grid suppliers for their loss. Although there solar PV has positive effects on welfare in this study, the sensitivity analysis made clear that multiple factors have far reaching effects on the outcome of the CBA. The price the Dutch society is willing to pay determines to which adoption rate solar PV is welfare enhancing. The conclusion of this research reflects on the title of this study. The original title evaluated from “it is all about the money” to “it is all about morality”.","cost benefit analysis; CBA; solar energy adoption rate; solar PV; Dutch electricity grid; allocation of cost and benefits; economics solar; renewable energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-07-01","Technology, Policy and Management","Economie van Infrastructuren","","MOT","",""

At the moment, urban designers respond to an ever-changing living environment by making a snapshot based on predictions about the future. Because of the inherently uncertain nature of the future, a contemporary design is hence partly based on assumptions instead of facts. However, if we can base a design merely on the fact that change will happen, we can focus on the process of change rather than on the outcome and thus better be able to deal with future changes. The goal is to create adaptable urban designs, in order to construct future proof urban environments. The relatively novel theory of ‘biomimicry’ might provide opportunities for the construction of adaptable designs. A biomimicry design approach tries to learn from nature’s successes in order to solve human problems. The theory proposes three levels of learning from nature: the level of form, the level of process, and the level of system. Learning on the level of form is predominantly practised in current applications of biomimicry within fields of research other than urban design. Importantly, there are also six design lessons from nature which represent the theory’s six life’s principles, one of which is ‘adapt to changing conditions’. The theory has been widely acclaimed in other fields of expertise, such as industrial design, architecture, and organisation processes. However, till this day, the theory has not been applied often in urbanism, nor has it been evaluated scientifically in this field. The main research question posed in this report is: How can biomimicry be applied in urban redesign and facilitate change in urban environments? The research evaluates biomimicry: is it just a hype or does it provide a solution for designing our uncertain future? The final result is a general strategy for applying biomimicry in urban redesign. This adds knowledge both to the field of urban design strategies and to the field of biomimicry. It is suggested that the strategy can also be applied in other disciplines. Starting with a literature study, a strategy is developed and tested on two pilot cases in different contexts. These cases both contain an analysis and design of an urban regeneration area: Strijp S in Eindhoven and the Agniesebuurt in Rotterdam. Based on the design results, the strategy is further developed and reflected in order to improve and strengthen the strategy. The strategy consists of eight steps that together form the design strategy (see Figure 1). However, some steps can also be used solely and implemented in other strategies. Different actors can be involved in different steps. In this design strategy, a biologist is consulted in order to understand processes, systems, and forms of nature which could be translated into design implementations. A linkage is created between the disciplines of biology and urban design. Strategies of nature are examined in order to find solutions for the specific problems that are faced in both Eindhoven and Rotterdam. In Eindhoven, the challenge is the transformation of a partly empty former industrial area into a regenerated area. Other problems in Eindhoven that were encountered are the scarce water quantity and temperature changes. This poses future threats to the area. Rotterdam, and specifically the Agniesebuurt also faces problems of future changes in water quantity, water quality and in temperature. These problems formed the starting points for the search for solutions in nature. Human society and natural systems experience similar problems of change like in and thus provides us with proven solutions for coping with unpredictable change i.e. ideas for urban interventions. The ideas are translated into various specific design solutions or abstract concepts and categorized into different scales. Moreover, they show the different consequences for the urban environment. Profound concepts arise because multiple ideas are combined into one concept. The implementations of the nature inspired design ideas in both cases result in an improvement of the adaptability of the area. This is accomplished through two important aspects. First, by taking the topic of change as the starting point for the creation of concepts. And second, through the integration of design interventions at different scales across the urban fabric. Integrating implementations throughout scales results in a profound understanding of design interventions. Adaptability is facilitated by the nature of the ideas derived from nature. The focus is primarily on change itself rather than on the final long-term plan of a possible future scenario. Options are kept open to changing directions, magnitude, and character of functions and implementations. Thus through the application of biomimicry in the field of urban redesign, the urban designer does not create a snapshot of what the future could possibly look like, but instead proposes a possibility for an area to change over time. Though it is important to note that the urban designer must remain critical about nature’s proven lessons. The designer must not take the examples for granted as the ultimate solution for achieving a successful design result per definition, since human society and nature do differ from each other. This research explored the possible added value of the application of biomimicry in urban redesign. The strategy that was constructed through this thorough research, supported with two design proposals, could form a valuable tool worth knowing when designing adaptable urban for unpredictable times to come.","biomimicry; urban design strategy; adaptable urban environment; changing conditions; adaptable design; nature inspired design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Urban regeneration studio","",""
