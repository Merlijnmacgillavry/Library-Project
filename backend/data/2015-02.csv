(mentor); Cankurtaran, P. (mentor); Bouwman, M. (mentor)","2015","The project is aiming at setting a strategy to realize “how de Doelen can be the musical culture centre of Rotterdam and build its reputation” and “how de Doelen can integrate the classical music concerts to the lives of the residents of Rotterdam 18 to 26”. To combine the two goals in the strategy, Brand Driven Innovation (Roscam Abbing, 2010) is introduced as the theoretical guideline. In Brand driven innovation, a Brand, which is de Doelen in the project, is the platform for a shared understanding between Marketing and Innovation, and between organisation and the Outside world (Roscam Abbing, 2010, p. 19). Brand driven innovation provides guideline. Different perspectives and theories are introduces to explicate Marketing, Innovation and the Outside world in the project. The main research question is formulated after the explication- “How can de Doelen integrate classical music experiences to the lives of Young Rotterdammers while developing itself as the musical centre of Rotterdam by involving Young Rotterdammers’ systematically under Brand driven innovation?”. Three researches are conducted to answer the main research question. The first research, context analysis, gives an overview of the detachment between de Doelen’s classical music experiences and Young Rotterdammers. The finding of Research one shows neither the existing classical music concert experiences nor de Doelen attracts young Rotterdammers. Three further questions are derived and answered in Research Tow and Research Three. Research Two, Lifestyle Research answers the two questions: 1. Both de Doelen and Young Rotterdammers expect de Doelen to be a part of Rotterdam’s society. However, De Doelen does not fit in the value of Rotterdam now. What are the values representing Rotterdam? 2. Classical music experiences do not fit in the lifestyles of Young Rotterdammers nowadays. What are those lifestyles? Research Two demonstrates de Doelen can integrate itself in Rotterdam through position the Brand as a “collaborative experimental” Brand. This position fits the values of Rotterdam. The Brand develops itself through collaborating with Young Rotterdammers in the possibilities of a classical music experience. ? To investigate the lifestyles of Young Rotterdammers for discovering potential collaboration partners and fitting classical music experiences in their lives, a research method is proposed by the author. Five Rotterdammers lifestyles are targeted. Research three focuses on exploring the possibilities of classical music experiences with the five target lifestyles by answering the third question derived from the findings of Research one. 3. Young Rotterdammers’ needs of going to classical music experiences are hidden. How can de Doelen trigger the needs of them to integrate classical music experiences to their lives? Summarizing the three researches leads to the answer of the main research question. The answer is depicted in Strategy direction. A roadmap is illustrated. Different collaboration partners and experimental goals are set in the short-term, medium-term and long-term strategy. Through the collaboration and the experiments, de Doelen will be the musical culture centre of Rotterdam while integrating classical music experiences into the lives of Young Rotterdammers .","de Doelen; Brand driven innovation; Rotterdam; Classical music experience; Lifestyle research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

One possible solution to improve the design process and create more efficient designs is structural optimisation. This Master’s Thesis focusses on the development of a technique for optimisation of reinforcement in 3D concrete shapes on costs and structural safety. This optimisation has been achieved by a combination of techniques. An assessment model has been developed to assess options on estimated costs and structural safety. The structural safety is tested with a truss model of the geometry, analysed by the Matrix Displacement Method (MDM), tested with Strut and Tie Models (STM) and assessed by a safety penalisation. Optimisation is achieved with Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO). This nature inspired optimisation technique is capable of creating, selecting and improving a swarm of options during an iterative process. The result of this Master’s Thesis is a tool that can design reinforcement in the shape of truss models in 3D geometries, assess the quality of options and select options based on their costs effectiveness.","Reinforced Concrete; Strut and Tie Model (STM); Structural optimisation; Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO); Concrete costs estimation; Matrix Displacement Method (MDM)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Concrete Structures","",""

(mentor)","2015","Recently an innovative nourishment method has been applied as a counter measure for coastal recession in the Netherlands. This soft engineering solution, also known as the Sand Engine, consists of a shoreline perturbation of $21.5$ Mm\textsuperscript{3} sand which will be redistributed along the shore by the natural forces of waves, tides and winds over a stretch of $10$ km to prevent coastal retreat. It is expected that this multifunctional 'building with nature' solution has several economical, ecological and recreational advantages compared to the traditional nourishment approaches. The mega nourishment intervention may therefore become one of the common nourishment methods to combat beach erosion. The international potential is assessed by determining the relative influence of wave climate parameters and nourishment dimensions on the lifetime of a mega nourishment for a straight alongshore uniform sandy shore. The Mega Nourishment tool has been developed to obtain a first estimate of the lifetime for a geographical location in the world by computing the nourishment redistribution and the cross shore erosion of the shore using wave climates from two global wave models. The redistribution of the nourishment is caused by gradients in the \gls{LST} and is simulated with the Unibest-CL+ coastline model. For the coastal erosion two process are taken into account: The erosion due to a rising sea level and the landward directed sediment loss during a storm simulated with a 1D Xbeach model. A comparison has been made between the tool results and an other model simulation of the Sand Engine. All simulations estimated different redistribution rates for the Sand Engine depending on the wave climate used. The lifetime predictions for the simulations were however similar. The Sand Engine is estimated to be sufficient to protect 10 km of coast for a period of about 50 years. The tool is furthermore used to simulate many cases with different wave climates, nourishment dimensions, cross shore profile shapes and sediment sizes. Using these results several conclusions are drawn. The redistribution rate is predominantly determined by the wave energy. A larger directional spreading and wave steepness also slightly increases the redistribution rate. The spreading of the nourishment is found to be less sensitive to different shapes of the cross shore profile and grain sizes larger than 250 $\mu$m. For smaller grain sizes the redistribution however rapidly increases. The erosion rate calculated by the tool can only be used as an indicative estimate. Based on the model results several empirical relations and a design graph are derived to estimate the redistribution and the lifetime of a mega nourishment. These equations can be used for an initial design of a mega nourishment. To obtain an accurate lifetime prediction it is recommended to pay sufficient attention to the quality of the wave data and the estimation of the shoreline erosion.","Mega nourishment; Sand Engine; Lifetime","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","NUS-TUD Double MSc Degree Programme","",""

(mentor); Hultink, H.J. (mentor)","2015","In this report you can read about the development of a luxury watch brand. The development of a luxury brand is different than that of a normal brand. A luxury brand has to deal with difficulties between ubiquity and exclusivity in fields of branding, marketing and product development. Whithin the luxury segment different types of brands and consumers are possible. A choice should be made which direction to follow. The report follows the direction of the ‘classic brand’ (Berthon et al. 2009) and that of the patrician consumer (Han,Nunes, & Drèze, 2010). In the report the brand building that is discussed is about authentic branding (Beverland. 2009) and iconic branding (Holt, 2004) both ways of brand building will eventually be used in the De Rijke brand.The competition in the watch industry is fierce, there are numerous watch brands competing for a place in the market and on top of this we see a lot of new brands trying to gain a share. In order to deal with this competition the De Rijke brand will be one of the first brands that focusses on the segment of the so called driver watches. It is new and distinctive for a brand to focus on this segment. Next to this, the De Rijke brand will focus on service and special orders. The service will be part of an innovative sales/distribution tactic; the De Rijke watches are solely sold via their webshop where clients are all helped individually and personally. It is possible for the De Rijke brand to offer special orders because the brand strives to produce as much as possible in house. The concepts that are developed in this report are watches that take inspiration for its design from the automotive world. The watches also have certain specific features for people who drive classic cars and/or motorcycles. The concepts are named the Amalfi Series and the Pamir Series, both named after famous roads in the world. The Amalfi Series is a series of beautiful watches that are focussed on people who take out their car in the weekend or holidays (ocasionally), whereas the Pamir Series is a series of watches that is named after the Pamir Highway, this series is focussed on the adventurous side of motoring. The Amalfi Series is a sort of plain dress watch and the construction of the watch is quite simple. It exists of a lathe turned base with two brackets that function as caseholders and the lugs of the watch. The concept of the Amalfi Series has been worked out in detail. In order to do this, a research was done in order to understand how a watch is constructed and how al the parts connect together. The final part of this report is focussed on making a prototype of the watch. In order to make a prototype, research was done on how a lathe works and how chisels are made. Understanding how this works is essential to make a proper prototype. For the making of the chisels certain angles of the chisel are essential to make it work. After this process I was able to make my own prototype watch case. Together with a lasercutted and laserwelded dial, a swiss Soprod movement and glasses from watch part suppliers a prototype watch was made.","luxury brand; development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Department of Industrial Design - Design Aesthetics","","","",""

Therefore it is time to start thinking about new ways to bring nature back to people. This happened at Natuur op je Muur, a start-up company working on a vertical gardening system for school yards to enable children to learn about the origin of vegetables and herbs and enable them to grow it themselves. Due to the missing balance between cities and nature, they saw there also is high potential to expand their business to the consumer market. Therefore an attractive, easy to use and sustainable low-tech vertical gardening system for outdoor usage is designed. This design focusses on usage in small city areas, like balconies, since that is where a product like this is most needed. The final design of a vertical vegetable garden for usage in small city areas is the TOM, Tuin Op Muur. The TOM consists of a panel that enables people to vertically grow 4 to 6 edible plants. A removable water reservoir and wicks ensuring a stable water flow in the form of a low-tech solution. In every season the water supply can be adapted easily to create the optimal living circumstances for the plants. The users will have access to a platform of advice. This way they are taken along through the process of buying, installing and using the TOM.

(mentor); Dirkx, D. (mentor)","2015","Access to space is now more important than ever. For the last few years, smaller and smaller satellites are acquiring the capacity to do what was previously only possible with large platforms. Currently, most small countries can build a small satellite, but most cannot afford to launch one by themselves. Air launching rocket vehicles has been touted as a possible solution to reduce the cost of both the launch vehicle and its operation, especially for the launch of small payloads. Most research in the field looks into solid rockets, here, however, hybrids are investigated. Hybrid rocket vehicles work by burning solid fuel with liquid oxidizer. Unlike solid rockets, hybrids can be re-ignited, are safer, and have a potentially higher orbital injection accuracy and specific impulse. To study the feasibility and performance of such a solution, a Multidisciplinary Design Optimization tool was used. The tool is an improvement upon a previous software package that only supported solid rocket technology. It addresses trajectory computation, estimation of vehicle dimensions and propulsion performance and launch simulation. The tool was developed in C++, and is now capable of handling multi-stage solid-only rockets, hybrid-only rockets and mixed configurations. It consists of performance and dimension estimators for individual rocket stages, these are integrated into a launch vehicle whose launch is simulated and analysed. The tool has been used to optimize the configuration of a rocket vehicle designed to attain a circular orbit (eccentricity < 0.01) at 780 km altitude. By iterating on the design using an optimization process known as Particle Swarm Optimization, it attempts to reduce the take-off weight of its solutions. The tests allow one to compare hybrid propellant rockets to solid ones in both air and ground launched scenarios. Based on the assumptions made, it was found that air-launch reduces GTOW by about 70 % when compared to an equivalent ground launch. It is also found that, in general, hybrid rockets have a GTOW similar to, or higher than, their solid counterparts. The research also tackles whether mixed configurations (with both solid and hybrid stages) allow one technology to strengthen the other. Results are also shown on the launch performance of existing engines, to both validate the models and offer insight to manufacturers into how their vehicles will perform once launched.","hybrid rockets; air launch; design optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Systems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Zijlema, M. (mentor); Meirelles, S. (mentor); Henriquez, M. (mentor)","2015","The cross-shore sediment transport is of great importance in the coastal water since it may lead to significant change of coastal profile. Many researches have proved that the sediment transport is proportional to velocity moments. In this study, the velocity moments under wave action in the perpendicular direction to the coastline are studied by means of a non-hydrostatic model SWASH and a decomposition technique. The purpose of this project is to perform the velocity moments which contribute to the cross-shore sediment transport with a numerical analysis and the most significant components can be found through the comparisons. These contributed flows to the velocity moments, namely the asymmetric oscillatory flow, wave grouping-induced flow and undertow, are the major objects to be studied. A set of measurements of wave flume experiment are adopted to evaluate the feasibility of the method developed in this study. Firstly, a series of sensitivity analysis of wave decay and mean velocity are presented to investigate the influence of varied settings in SWASH, including the vertical resolution, boundary imposition, bottom friction, discretization schemes for advection terms and water depth in velocity points. The results indicate that predictions of SWASH with proper settings are in good agreement with measurements in terms of wave decay and vertical velocity. Furthermore, a detailed analysis is subsequently conducted with regard to surface elevation, wave decay and undertow. Most of the SWASH predictions are in relatively good agreement with the measurements, but some deviations occurred after wave breaking. This is probably associated to the absence of the production of turbulent energy due to surface roller. A signal decomposition technique is applied to separate the signals with different frequencies. Through the decomposition process, the long and short wave flows are separated by means of filtering out the other part. The SWASH predicted central odd moments of long wave flows is relatively underestimated while the long wave flow variances and the central odd moments of asymmetric flows agree well to the observations. This may correspond to the loss of signal information after decomposition. By summing up the contributions of undertow, wave grouping-induced long wave flow and asymmetric oscillatory flow, the total odd flow moment is easily acquired. Generally, the offshore-directed undertow is the dominant component, the shoreward asymmetric flow is of secondary importance and the contribution of long wave flow is relatively small. As a consequence, the resulted total flow carries the sediment transporting seaward. In overall, SWASH is capable of simulating the wave decay and vertical flow structure correctly. However, some deviations near the breaking point implies that, the implementation of breaking-induced turbulence in SWASH is of great importance.","SWASH; undertow; decomposition; cross-shore velocity moments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

In collaboration of Oorzaak (a Dutch company) and the Faculty of Humanities of Leiden University, Centre for Linguistics this research has been developed. The main topics are communication between hearing impaired (HI) and hearing (H) people in a meetings context and automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology. Since Oorzaak is developing a tool (augmented reality (AR) spectacles) that help POD in every day’s communication. This topic is also taken into account. For this research it is important to understand that the group of hearing impaired (HI) people is divided in pre-lingual (PED): people who born deaf and did not learn the spoken language. They use sign language (SL) and post-lingual (POD): people who became deaf after the age of six which means that they learned to speak and read well. For this project special attention to PED that can read and talk well and POD people was taken into account. The main goal of this project is about improving communication between HI and H people in meetings, using automatic speech recognition technology. Accordingly, the project was divided in a research phase in which the social aspect, the needs of the user and their experiences are important insight to determine design guidelines. And a design phase which main goal was to design a product-concept that uses voice recognition technology and helps to improve communication between POD and hearing people (H) in meetings. The final concept is MEETING UP a product composed by Meeting Point (a physical device) and Meeting App (an application) is intended to improve communication between POD and H people in meetings by creating structure, order and awareness. Meeting Point a product which is placed on the center of the table is intended to provide order during meetings, its main tasks are: (1) managing the ASR system with array and wireless microphones, (2) provide WIFI connectivity with external displays (iPads and AR spectacles), (3) create order in meetings by providing feedback about who is the speaker and (4) create awareness by controlling the speaking speed and avoiding multiple speakers at the same time. On the other hand Meeting App is intended to provide more structure to the meetings by: (1) providing a chairman responsibility, (2) guiding him to create a more structured meetings by preparing the meeting before hand, creating an agenda, being aware of time, creating responsibilities for participants and providing all participants with the text of the main conclusions at the end of the meeting.","deafness; speech recognition; inclusive design; meetings; communication; post-lingual; hearing impaired","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","In the region of the Riau Islands of Indonesia fresh water scarcity is one of the challenges the local community is facing. In order to increase the catchment of fresh water the choice is made to turn Bintan Bay, part of the Riau Islands, into a fresh water reservoir. Hereby collecting the fresh water runoff from local rivers. It is however unknown where the reservoir, and thus dam, will be positioned and whether the closure can be constructed with sand. This thesis focusses on those two topics. Based on an investigation into the hydraulic boundary conditions six alternative dam locations are defined. To weigh the alternatives a preliminary cost-benefit analysis is carried out. The outcome of the analysis is that the alternative in which the whole bay is turned into a reservoir can be considered most favourable. However, underlying assumptions and simplifications need to be verified in order to assess the effects on the outcome of the analysis. One of these assumptions is that a sand closure is constructible for all alternatives. This implies that additional effort, in terms of the required capacity of the dredgers, and sand losses are not included. To investigate these assumptions a more detailed research is carried out into the sand closure. The principle of a sand closure is fairly straightforward: the supply of sand has to be larger than the losses due to erosion in the closure gap to be able to close the dam. Since the sand losses are directly linked to the flow velocities in the closure gap a one-dimensional flow model has been created. This shows that maximum flow velocities at Bintan are higher than the limit according to a rule of thumb provided in literature. Therefore, the closure seems difficult, if not impossible. However, since a spring-neap cycle is applied a worst case scenario is simulated where also the critical closure stage is during springtide. This can be considered an overestimation of reality since it is common practise to close during neap tide. By introducing a sediment transport function and a sand input, the closure gap area is made time dependent. With this upgraded model, more realistic scenarios can be simulated where the critical closure phase is executed around neaptide. After optimizing, the maximal flow velocities showed a significant reduction while the production rate is high compared to other closures, but not unrealistic. The one-dimensional closure model has limitations in describing the flow velocities and erosion. Therefore, an additional two-dimensional model is set up in FINEL. The applied erosion function was already calibrated on the recent closures at the Maasvlakte 2, and is therefore regarded to provide more accurate results. Various simulations are conducted to recognise sensitivities and to identify the differences between the one- and two-dimensional models. The comparison shows that the original erosion function applied in the one-dimensional model indeed highly overestimates the sand losses. Because of this, new simulations are performed in the one-dimensional model with calibrations based on the MV2 closures. A comparison shows that for the identical dredger capacities the sand losses are significantly reduced. Therefore, a successful closure proves to be achievable with half of the original production capacity. Since all computations are conducted for the most favourable alternative, a final comparison is conducted with the other alternatives. This results in the conclusion that solely the sand losses will not result in another alternative to become more favourable in the cost-benefit analysis. However, dredgers that can achieve the required production capacity should be available in the area. If not, other alternatives might be cheaper to execute since these can be closed with smaller dredger capacities and thus smaller vessels.","sandclosure; sand closure; modelling; closure dam; alternative study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","In this project a start has been made in the conceptual and practical development of a hydrogen peroxide catalytic micro expansion engine. The liquid fuel convertor is designed specifically to mechanically actuate a resonant body flapping wing micro air vehicle of approximately 4 gram. The actuator functionality is devided in several sub functions which were analysed using knowledge of scaling, boundary conditions and previous research. This resulted in a functional design descripition. (Chapter 2, 3) The design description was used to make a working concept, critical components and functionalities were defined. The components to provide fuel delivery and reaction were selected for further developement. (Chapter 4) Capillary action is a very interesting phenomenon to provide fuel transport and accumulation at the reaction site. It can repeatedly provide a fuel volume with a sufficiently high flow rate. The size of channels have to be in the order of 1mm, surface tension can also provide a back pressure. Uncertainties are encountered when integrating the system with batched reaction. The amount of fuel transfered/reacted is a complex function of time, shapes and material properties. (Chapter 5) Production of manganese oxide material was performed on aluminium plates to find a light and practical substrate for the catalyst. Fabrication parameters were varied to optimize the robustness and activity of the layer.

(mentor); Taale, H. (mentor); Vu, H.L. (mentor); Wiggenraad, P.B.L. (mentor)","2015","Bad traffic conditions can be improved by regulating traffic demand and network capacity. Dynamic Traffic Management (DTM) systems allocate temporal and spatial utilization of infrastructures and vehicle fleets by means of dynamic signals. By timely response to changing traffic conditions DTM goals, in terms of effective, safe and reliable use of the infrastructure, can be met. Two important trends in the field of DTM are: a shift from local control measures towards network-wide control; a shift from collective traffic information towards individual advice. Individual advice can be transmitted via in-car technology, however, up until now in-car systems are typically used to improve the (route) choice of the individual road user, whereas DTM aims at improving the network performance as a whole. Network-wide traffic control is complicated by the dynamic nature of traffic itself and the dynamic effects of control measures, especially if the network and DTM structure is complex. Route guidance can make a significant contribution to network-wide DTM. Using in-car navigation to transmit individual directions, it is expected to improve the network performance (better use of the available capacity, higher throughput and stability, and less spill-back), and reduce the travel time for the individual road user as well. Finding the right route guidance configuration is a complex task, that should take potential unfavourable effects and coordination into account. Moreover, integrating traffic signal control at intersections with route guidance is a logical step. Considering the complex nature of the problem and the need for (real-time) responsive control actions, a simplified traffic control model is suggested. The concept of back-pressure control has recently been applied to the problem of controlling a network of signalized intersections. The development of a route guidance algorithm based on back-pressure control, integrated with a back-pressure model for signalized intersections, is to be considered. The main research problem in this thesis is to determine the feasibility and potential benefits of such a system. The main objective of this thesis is to develop a framework that integrates route guidance and signal control based on the back-pressure principle, and determine its feasibility and potential benefit. Conditions that further specify the objective include a focus on network-wide control, on optimizing network conditions (and secondarily find a trade-off with road user benefits), on real-time control, and on a generic approach. The literature review starts with a brief overview route guidance. Applying route guidance has advantages and pitfalls. Route guidance can be modelled as a way to manipulate route choice. Often route guidance is used to minimize the travel time of the individual road user, using route guidance to improve the conditions for the network and road users as a whole isn't often done in operational route guidance. The back-pressure control methodology originated from communication networks, where it is applied to the problem of delivering data packets via a network of nodes and servers. The back-pressure algorithm assigns the servers to be activated and the data they should transfer, based on server capacity and queue differences (queues for specific data groups). The main strengths of back-pressure control are maximization of throughput and network stability. The basic back-pressure algorithm can been extended to cope with finite queues and delay. On the application of traffic signal control back-pressure control has been used in literature. The concept aims to activate the signalling phase that has the highest total weight, a summation of the weights of the allowed traffic streams. The weight is the product of pressure and service rate (saturation flow). The pressure of a traffic stream is the difference between the queues at the incoming link and outgoing links (weighted by proportion). There are several variants to this basic model. In communication networks the use of routes is a result of the algorithm, whereas for traffic signal control the route choice is used as an input from a separate process. The back-pressure concept can however also be used as a method for route guidance. Instead of determining the right phase to be activated, the task is to determine the ratio to direct traffic to following links. Route pressure values can be formulated to expresses how filled up the route is. Route pressure and service rate are less straightforward to define than for the intersection control. A choice model is to be used to determine the ratio of routes, based on the product of route pressure and service rate. The chosen control approach is a traffic control loop in which the traffic process is monitored, controllers for traffic signal control and route guidance calculate new settings which are implemented to the traffic process by means of the traffic signalling system and in-car navigation system. The traffic signal controller can be fed by route guidance information to improve the estimate turn probabilities. The model is a reactive feedback control type. The research approach includes a list of design choices and limitations for traffic signal control and route guidance, as well as requirements related to the experiment to be conducted and the simulation tools. A general back-pressure algorithm for traffic signal control has been designed, with two main variants: one with a fixed cycle time that assigns phase durations for one or more cycles, and one with short time slots that repeatedly activates the dominant phase. Pressure values are based on representative link densities, are normalized to the jam density and can be extended by a power function that increases the relative weight of higher pressures. The necessary turning probabilities are based on measurements or on route guidance settings, which integrates traffic signal control and route guidance. For route guidance a general algorithm has been proposed as well. As a first attempt of service rate, the link capacity of the first outgoing link of the route is used. Furthermore a number of variants for the algorithm have been considered. The first variant is simple but myopic and observes only the first link of each route, which also limits the number of routes that need to be considered. An important limitation of this variant is that congestion on links further downstream is not taken into account. Other variants observe complete routes (from the en-route position). A path size logit choice model is used to determine the proportions for each route. A pressure value that represents the whole route needs to be determined. This can be done by taking the (weighted) average of the link pressures, or by a method that takes outliers specifically into account. Travel time as a measure of user satisfaction, allowing road users to use the shortest routes, can be incorporated into the method. The overall utility function of a route can be written as: $ \text{BP}_r = \alpha_1 P_{\text{route},r} + \alpha_2 P_{\text{firstlink},r} + \alpha_3 P_{\text{user},r}$. The three terms represent the (total) route pressure, the pressure of the first link, and the travel time value. The simulation environment is based on the macroscopic simulation model DSMART. It uses a kinematic wave model, based on the fundamental diagram, space and time discretization. Aggregated flows carry traffic along the links and System Class Dynamics (SCD) ensure the separation of changes in traffic composition and correct handling of traffic dynamics at the nodes. Periodically, traffic controllers are called to update the activated control strategies, based on the proposed traffic control and route guidance algorithms. Traffic signal control objects directly influence the traffic flow and route guidance is enforced by manipulating turn ratios at intersections and diverges. The simulation experiments are divided into three parts: case 1 examines traffic signal control, case 2 focuses on route guidance, and case 3 combines traffic signal control and route guidance. For traffic signal control, back-pressure control is a good way to generate high throughput at the intersections, while keeping the queues evenly distributed and within boundaries. Back-pressure signal control based on time slots is more effective than the cycle time based version. Some aspects of the algorithm and its practical use require special attention. For route guidance an optimal use of back-pressure has not yet been found, as the results are on a most part lacking compared to the standard route choice model. Two main aspects are the definition of a representative route pressure, and the capacity of routes related to the assignment of (destination specific) traffic to each route. The performance is expected to be better if the pressure were (partly) based on the critical links, instead of on average density. Yet the basic algorithm that was formulated works to some extent, and so far the simulated effects can be understood and are up for improvement. It was also found that a `pressure' function that includes not only route densities, but also travel time can give good results. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates the possibility to create a methodology, based on back-pressure control, that integrates traffic signal control and route guidance. Traffic signal control based on back-pressure control performs well in the simulations, especially the variant with time slots. Throughput is high and queues remain within reasonable boundaries. It is difficult to fully integrate traffic signal control and route guidance, contrary to the straightforward algorithm in the field of wireless communication networks. A modest step of integration is to use route guidance settings to determine the necessary turning probabilities at the intersection. Using back-pressure for route guidance requires (artificial) design choices. The challenge is to define a representative function of route pressure or utility, and to combine this with a service rate value, in order to obtain a high throughput and stability with minimum delays. Several ideas have been presented. The average density has turned out not a good measure for route pressure. It is possible to combine factors of pressure based on density and travel time, in order to use the shortest routes in case of low traffic, and shift to the routes with open capacity if needed.","route guidance; traffic signal control; back-pressure; dynamic traffic management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Broere, W. (mentor); Bakker, K.J. (mentor); Azzouzi, S. (mentor); Jaspers Focks, D.J. (mentor); Bijnagte, J.L. (mentor)","2015","The subject of this master's thesis stems from a lack of design rules in the current regulations for dolphins located in sloping ground. Dolphins are very common objects in Dutch waterways, of which a large part are located in sloping ground. The lack of design rules causes difficulties between clients and contractors, possible unfavourable designs, and a potential inefficient use of steel, the material of which dolphins are mostly constructed. In other words, a better understanding of the behaviour of a laterally loaded pile in sloping ground, as a dolphin can be schematized, may save money in the future. The master's thesis starts with a literature review. The literature showed that previous studies already carried out research to laterally loaded piles in sloping ground. Four full scale tests have been conducted, several model scale tests have been performed and three studies carried out finite element analyses. These studies all conclude that reduction of the confining soil, due to a sloping ground, decreases the lateral capacity of the pile. Parameters that influence the amount of capacity's decline are the slope angle, the soil parameters, the pile properties and the roughness of the pile-soil interface. Moreover, in all full scale tests the formation of a gap was observed. This gap indicates that the size of the passive wedge and its offered resistance determine the pile-soil interaction. The method suggested by literature to account for sloping ground in engineering practice, is the reduction of the p-y curves by a multiplier. Several p-multipliers are suggested by the different studies. Georgiadis and Georgiadis are at the most advanced stage with their research, they have developed new p-y curves for the undrained lateral pile response in sloping ground. To better qualify the influencing parameters within the pile-soil interaction of a laterally loaded pile in sloping ground, a parametric study has been conducted. The starting point for this analysis were the conditions of Dutch waterways, to which the varied parameters are connected as much as possible. First, the software programs had to be validated. Nimityongskul's full scale test and Mezazigh's model have been modelled in D-Sheet Piling, D-Pile Group and Plaxis 3D. It has been demonstrated by this validation that the HSsmall model is most suitable in Plaxis 3D to model a laterally loaded pile. In contrast, the Mohr-Coulomb model is not suitable. In the parametric study performed in Plaxis 3D two different soil profiles have been considered; a homogeneous profile consisting of medium dense sand and a layered profile of a clay layer underlain by a deeper sand layer. Two different slope angles with infinite slope have been assessed, 1:3 and 1:4, and 3 different soil parameter sets for both profiles. At the end, an analysis has been performed with a finite slope, where the pile is located at the crest, in the middle and at the toe of the slope. The most important observation of this analysis is the fact that the capacity of a laterally loaded pile in a sand slope is much more affected by the angle of the slope than the capacity of a laterally loaded pile in a clay slope. This difference can be explained by the fact that the strength of sand is stress-dependent and the cohesion of clay is not. The influence of the sloping ground is qualified with the help of normalised curves derived from the load-displacement curves and p-y curves. The normalised curves lead to specific p-multipliers for the conditions in Dutch waterways. Finally, a design recommendation is proposed for laterally loaded piles in sloping ground. A flow chart with 4 design steps is recommended in Chapter 5. First, the original p-y curve for a laterally loaded pile in horizontal level ground need to be selected. Hereafter, an appropriate p-multiplier need to be defined with help of the normalised p-y curves obtained from the Plaxis 3D analysis. The original p-y curves can then be combined with the selected multiplier to form new p-y curves to determine the pile-soil interaction of piles located in sloping ground.","laterally loaded piles; sloping ground; P-Y curve; Plaxis 3D; D-Sheet Piling; D-Pile Group","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Civil Engineering","","Geo Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2015","The goal of this thesis is to obtain local response due to slamming loads. The main problem is that there is no satisfactory 3D slamming model, so a strip approach is applied. Slamming loads are included in hydro-structure interaction models when fully non-linear wave loads are applied. The slamming model used is the generalized Wagner method (GWM), which is based on wedge entry in water and uses potential ow assumptions. The structural analysis is done by using _nite element analysis and an impulse response spectrum based on blast loads. The calculation procedure uses a 3D ship geometry and its motions to obtain 2D strips with their relevant velocities. These 2D strips are analyzed using GWM and pressures are calculated on the 2D strips for each element on the 3D hull. To use the pressures obtained, a temporal and spatial interpolation is applied. The resulting loads are analyzed using a quasi-static finite element model and checking whether the modes are excited near their natural frequencies. From a convergence study on a general cargo ship, the structural loads converge with increasing the number of slamming strips and decreasing time step size, this means that loads can be obtained accurately. The slamming loads are very local, a linear spatial interpolation method proved to converge faster than nearest neighbor interpolation. The number of Gauss points on the hull proved to be not important, since the mesh is already relatively _ne. The inclination angle proved to lead to an increase in velocity, but when more realistic ship motions are analyzed the sensitivity to inclination angle proved to be not so big. Quasi-static structural analysis is used to find response of the structure. Using a triangular impulse response spectrum and Fourier analysis on the loads showed a significantly large static load component to justify the quasi-static analysis.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Ship Hydromechanics and Structures","",""

These ship-type offshore units, however, cannot have regular dry-docking as they have to be on field sometimes even for their entire lifetime. This is the reason why structural monitoring systems may play an important role in the safety of these units. The MONITAS JIP was started in 2005 in order to continuously monitor the fatigue lifetime consumption of FPSO. However, these extensive measurements can be used for other purposes as well. In this work, the strength reassessment of a corroded FPSO tank has been addressed. For this purpose, thickness measurements coming from the inspections and the loads measured by the MONITAS system have been combined in a new probability-based model, which is able to calculate a probability of failure for the inspected structure. Different failure criteria (yielding, elasto-plastic buckling, brittle fracture) have been identified, and for any of them a closed-form limit state function has been written down. To write down the limit state functions, analytical models (simple beam theory, large deflection analysis, membrane stress-based method and others) and empirical formulae (Johnson-Ostenfeld formula) have been used. The structural reliability analysis has been run using the Monte Carlo simulation method. The results is a reassessment tool which can be used by FPSO operators in order to avoid unnecessary maintenance of a corroded plate, to optimize repair intervention or to justify extra-maintenance.","FPSO; structural reliability; corrosion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-02-25","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime Technology","","Ship and Offshore Structures","",""

(mentor)","2015","Despite the recent technological improvements, the cost of off shore wind energy has not yet reached competitive levels. Optimization tools designed to reduce the overall losses in off shore wind farms (OWFs) may reduce its cost of energy. Hence, fast and accurate loss models are necessary for the optimization of the OWFs design. The aim of this thesis is the development of such models to calculate the power losses in the OWF cables, transformers and converters of the collection and transmission systems (HVAC or HVDC). The models need to capture the main steady-state loss sources while being computationally light for the optimization process. All the proposed models consider the main sources of losses during steady-state operation as well as their dependence to temperature. The cable model considers the type of soil surrounding it whereas the converter model takes into account the IGBT datasheet information to compute the power losses. A 640 MW OWF situated at 50, 100 and 150 km from shore is designed and employed to showcase the joint operation of the models and assess the impact of different variables such as the type of soil or the voltage level of the collection system to the power losses. In addition, the proposed models are compared against standard models (in which temperature dependence is not considered) for both the HVDC and HVAC transmission schemes. The higher precision of the proposed models means designers may better predict the OWFs profitability.","Offshore Wind Farm; Submarine Power Cable; Modular Multilevel Converter; Losses; Transformer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Identity theft and identity fraud are serious problems, leaving thousands of Dutch citizens with debts and damages each year. MijnID aims to improve detection by providing users with insight on what is happening to their personal details as they are stored in government databases. This early detection is key to mitigate damages. In this report we discuss the problem, project aims, project outcome and further development. The core functional features for the app consist of verifying user identity with DigiD, logging in to the application with a PIN, viewing personal data and safely reporting changes in a database to the user. The project focuses on the security and privacy of data during transport and as it is shown to the user. We use scrum and test-driven development to guide the development process. Unfortunately the MijnID app will be a target for numerous types of attackers and attacks. We map these attacks, define a scope and base security requirements on the threats within that scope. Functional requirements are derived from the wishes of various parties involved. The design process is one of constant adjustment as changing requirements and limited experience play a large role. We design and implement the application as well as a dummy environment, which consists of a server and a database. This dummy environment mimics the behaviour of the real environment in which the app will function. Furthermore, we interact with the testing environment of DigiD. Automated and manual test outcomes are used to evaluate the requirements. We manage to meet 80% of all requirements and over 85% of the security requirements. Challenges the team faced are discussed as well. These challenges range from implementation issues to ethical considerations.

(mentor); Hultink, H.J. (mentor)","2015","Secrid is a successful company born in 2009 that used their award-winning Cardprotector as core for developing modern wallets. With over million sales in over 50 countries and counting, many fans worldwide love showing theirs through word of mouth. However, as product awareness is present, brand awareness is not. Especially now as the brand is planning to expand their category from wallets to that of pocketwear. Throughout the years, Secrid hired external advisors for help, which, unfortunately, all couldn’t hit the nail on its head. This led the company to develop its own brand model based on the owners’ spirituality, merging chakra philosophy with branding theory. The purpose of this brand perception model is to shape a long-lasting deep relationship between brand and the consumer, creating loyalty beyond reason and even love. Therefore, this new model - which hasn’t been used before - is used as the common line in this assignment of developing a Brand Book for creatives, inspiring them in bringing the (new) brand to life. To be able to fill in this brand model on its four layers and use it as basis for the Brand Book and further recommendations for the future, a literature review, internal and external analysis had been done and brought together as pieces to a puzzle to form a brand proposition and core communication principle - to be spread across the whole model. After defining the brand values, one was shaped where Secrid turned its ‘secret’ association from privacy protection to that of hidden self-expression. A (dis)balance, built on the notion of discovery, that holistically connects the products and brand crusaders, while shaping characteristic unique associations, keeping product orientation and the founding spirit. Continuing on the latter, the core communication principle was defined by applying ‘hidden self-expression’ to the situation of the owners, which was depicted as their inner bravery and modest expression outwards. In this sense, together with the feasibility of broadening for design guidelines, the core communication principle - again a (dis)balance - was called: brave in, modest out. Applying this, together with the other insights of analyses, led to the fulfilment of the whole brand perception model. This included altering, emphasising and reconstructing current stories, while new ones could be defined. Also, three idioms - humanely functional, luxuriously simple, and imaginatively urban - were defined, forming a strong description of Secrid’s (future) imagery. By defining the new brand perception in its totality, especially on the first layer, guidelines were able to be made for communication creatives. These were given on the aspects that had sufficient creative freedom, such as photography, graphics and tone of voice, without being too concrete and diminish the creative talent of the people using it. Some notions (e.g. main colours and typography), however, did need to be explicitly defined to form a base of recognisability. The brand perception’s content that wasn’t covered by these guidelines, was still left with potential for further brand building. Hence, recommendations, with accompanying examples, were made. These included ways of involving the consumer and retailers with the brand and enhancing the brand’s authenticity through communication showing a look behind the scenes. Another example involved crafting rich personalities and stories around new collections and offering the consumer better portfolio guidance. All together, these, in combination with the developed Brand Book for creatives, give a good direction the brand needs to be heading in and how this can be achieved.","Brand identity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Andrewartha, T. (mentor)","2015","Today’s increasing attention to offshore wind turbines as a renewable source of energy leads to new problems from the logistics point of view. As a consequence of new generation wind farms being built and planned to be built further offshore, as far as 150-200km from the shore, current transportation concepts that are used for wind turbine maintenance are considered to be less efficient. Among others, KNUD E. HANSEN A/S has developed a new transportation concept as a solution to this problem. This concept makes use of several vessels of which only one of them, namely the crew transfer vessel (CTV) with a length overall of 30 m is handled in this report. The CTV is to be docked onboard of a larger service operation vessel (SOV) with a length over 100m. The concept all together is expected to reduce the operational costs and increase the accessibility of wind farms for maintenance operations. As a part of the concept, design requirements are set for 3 operational conditions, where the first is calm water operations, prioritizing maximum design speed; the second is poor weather conditions up to 2 meter significant wave height prioritizing low level vertical motions, where the vessel is still operable for crew transferring; and bad weather conditions with sea states higher than 2 meter significant wave height, where the requirement for high range and reserve provisions for 1-2 days sailing is of high importance. Hull form, general arrangement, propulsion system and onboard equipment are examined closely to provide a design that fulfills the requirements. Especially large waterplane area is found to be crucial to minimise the vertical motions. Furthermore a docking arrangement and crew transferring equipment are designed. Aside the shorter wave periods in the region of 3-4s, the vessel fulfills all the operability requirements in transit stages, which is set at 2 meter significant wave height, as demonstrated by the seakeeping analysis. As suggested in the report, the performance can be improved by following the recommendations of this report. Furthermore, proposed novel designs for launching and retrieving mechanism in the dock of the bigger vessel has been demonstrated to be operable up to sea conditions with significant wave heights of 2.5 m, as desired. The proposed wind turbine access system is expected to be operable up to sea conditions with significant wave heights of 2 m by further improving the design according to the design suggestions, which are made as a result of the time domain analysis. The concept design study demonstrates that it is feasible to improve the current design by following the work, results and recommendations that are described in this report, in the following design stages into a final product. This can be used successfully as a part of the transportation concept in order to improve the overall efficiency of the offshore wind farms, increasing the interest for energy companies.","Concept Design; Crew Transfer Vessel; Ship Design; Ship Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-02-11","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","Ship Design","",""

Different filters such as lowpass filter, notch filter, Kalman filter (KF), extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and square-root unscented Kalman filter (SRUKF) are introduced and discussed in this thesis. The square-root unscented Kalman filter is proposed for the fusion of measurements, wave filtering and state estimation based on kinematics while the Kalman filter is used as an observer for the estimation of the state vector of a vessel mathematical model for dynamic positioning operation.

The results of the simulation show that the errors of low frequency position and heading prediction are below 0.2m and 0.3 degree respectively which is accurate enough for DP operation. The dead reckoning starts automatically as soon as the reference system fails and the error of the dead reckoning increases gradually overtime. The position error in dead reckoning is about 5m after 1800s in simulation, which means the DP system is still able to estimate the position of the vessel without any position measurements in certain time, avoiding collision caused by the sudden position loss.","dynamic positioning; Kalman filter; unscented Kalman filter; sensor fusion; observer; dead reckoning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-02-25","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime and Transport Technology","","Ship Design Production and Operation","","52.001070, 4.371861"

In this thesis it is assessed whether it is possible to estimate the real time sea state at a vessel, without using any instruments deployed in the water. As a matter of fact, in-situ measurements are not always possible, for example during pipeline installation, the vessel sails a few kilometres a day, therefore the options are restricted to methods which do not include in-situ instruments. To test and validate the methods developed in this thesis real time measurements were performed on the Audacia, a pipeline installation vessel belonging to Allseas, one of the world leaders in pipeline installation. The Audacia was laying pipe nearby the coast of Australia, close to wave buoy in the Julimar Field. Methods to extract wave field information from conventional nautical radars have been developed. It is possible to estimate a directional wave spectrum by using a temporal sequence of radar images, and following, statistical data representative of the sea state, such as the significant wave height and wave direction. However there is no unique relation between the radar images and the amount of energy in the directional wave spectrum, which result in an inaccurate signififcant wave height. In order to improve the directional wave spectrum estimations given by the X-Band radar used on board of the Audacia (Wavex from Miros), the possibility of using an extra measuring instrument to calibrate the energy is investigated. Two measuring devices are considered. - A down looking radar, recently installed below the helideck of the Audacia, measuring the single point surface elevation in vicinity of the vessel. (Radac WaveGuide) - The MRU sensors, which measure the wave induced vessel motions. (Ixsea Octans) It is investigated whether combining the data measured by one or the other device to the Xband radar data result in an improvement of the radar estimated directional wave spectrum, and which combination gives the best results. Method 1: Use the down looking radar measurements. The one dimensional wave spectrum given by Radac is combined with the directional wave spectrum given by Wavex. Since the Radac measurement are performed close to the vessel, the water surface is disturbed. In order to use the Radac to improve the estimated wave spectrum these disturbance have to be taken into account. It is possible to determine a frequency dependent ratio between the amount of energy in each frequency band of the different instruments. This frequency dependent ratio is used to correct the estimated amount of energy at each frequency of the directional wave spectrum. Method 2: Use the vessel motion measurements. In this method the measured wave induced vessel motions measured by the MRU are combined with the directional wave spectrum given by Wavex. To be able to calibrate the amount of energy in the directional wave spectrum, the radar wave spectrum has to be converted into vessel motions spectra.1 Since the responses are assumed to have a linear relation with the incident wave, the ratio between the measured energy and the expected energy in the responses can be used to correct the energy estimation in the directional wave spectrum in a linear way.After correcting the estimated directional wave spectrum with the two methods described above, the significant wave height was calculated and compared to the significant wave height given by the wave buoy in the Julimar Field.The significant wave height based on method one has a strong correlation to the significant wave height measured by the wave buoy in the Julimar Field. Method two showed that the significant wave height obtained by combining the wave field information from the nautical radar with the measured vessel motions has a less strong correlation to the significant wave height measured by the wave buoy. However, the wave spectrum given by the X-Band radar can be significantly improved in the frequency band in which the vessel responds to incident waves.","sea state","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-02-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","offshore and dredging engineering","","floating structures","",""

(mentor); Annema, J.A. (mentor); Van der Lei, T. (mentor); Van Wee, G.P. (mentor)","2015","The Netherlands has the goal to have 14% of the total energy production in 2020 generated in a sustainable way. In order to achieve this goal, onshore wind turbines need to have a combined capacity of 6000 MW and the offshore capacity needs to be increased to 4450 MW. The onshore wind industry is however quite saturated. Experts forecast that the onshore energy target will not be achieved due to the lack of space and heavy conflicts with local residents. Even if the target can be achieved, there is little to no space left for more large wind farms. Fully dedicating and shifting the wind energy development to the offshore sector is not without risk. Social cost benefit analyses show a wide array of different outcomes for the construction of large offshore wind farms. The net results range from losses of 5 billion euros to profits of 12 billion Euros. The Dutch government has decided to continue research and development of Dutch offshore wind projects. However, instead of completely focusing on the offshore sector, new potential onshore wind solutions could be investigated as well. The small wind turbine industry is also part of the onshore wind sector and has been well developed over the past decades. Over millions of small- and micro turbines are part of the onshore wind industry across the world. Small wind turbines are integrated into buildings or used as wind batteries. One new potential application could be to use the space along highways to install small wind turbines. Both the natural wind as the turbulence created by traffic could feed the generators to provide electricity to the grid or local applications such as street lighting or electric charging stations in the future. The report investigates the feasibility of this new concept by using the Prins Bernardweg Zaandam to Bolswarderbaan highway in the Netherlands as a virtual case study. The case study analyzes how and if the concept can be constructed and explores the impact of possible implementation. A combined technical-, stakeholder-and social cost benefit approach comprise the most essential components to make a careful assessment and recommendations. Multiple experts and stakeholders participated in interviews to provide expertise and validate information used in the analyses. The technical analysis showed that using the conventional vertical axis wind turbines from Windside grant accurate, reliable data to be used in the study and no inescapable technolocial barriers to turn up. An important unknown factor remains how the windside turbines affect the air resistance for ongoing traffic. Even though experts indicated that the effect is most likely in the favor of the traffic participants, if the project turns out to increase fuel usage the project cannot be launched. This was the main outcome from the stakeholder analysis, where both representatives from Rijkswaterstaat as the ANWB indicate a no go when drivers face additional travelling costs by driving on a highway filled with wind turbines. When this is not the case, the stakeholder analysis showed that there are no stakeholders who are likely to seriously threaten or influence the project in a negative way. All critical stakeholders can be convinced to support the project or stay neutral. These outcomes would have paved the way for the concept of wind turbines along the highway, if it was not for the social cost benefit analysis showing excessive negative social costs. Even in a best case scenario the net value of the project over the course of time touches a negative amount of over 700 million euros, with costs of over 3600 euro per Mwh. The preceeding answers the research question: To what extent can the concept of converting traffic turbulence and regular wind to useful energy be implemented in the Netherlands? The answer is that the concept can be fully implemented, but at as for now excessive costs. It should not be implemented yet on a medium- or large scale. Implementing the concept on a small scale could be worthwhile to investigate several matters. First, the effect of traffic passing wind turbines should be investigated. This knowledge can be used to inspire highly customized wind turbines which could potentially be cheaper and more efficient. The research is also needed to replace the assumptions made by the report with empirical evidence. Secondly, the potential reduction of both noise pollution and blinding effects by a row of wind turbines need to be researched. When these effects are substantially positive the use of wind turbines along highways might yet become interesting again. Third, the complete potential of wind capacity along all the highways in the Netherlands needs to be mapped. This provides an indication of the extra capacity that could be installed onshore using this method. In the future this capacity could be called upon when other options turn out to have a more negative net value, or the net value of this concept changes to an acceptable value. The last recommendation is to expand the concept to researching the installment of wind turbines along railroads. The electrical infrastructure is in place and trains come and go when it is not winter time in the Netherlands.","Wind power; small scale wind turbines; traffic turbulence; onshore wind market; wind power development; economics of wind; technological evolution; future prospects; Social Cost-Benefit Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy, Water and Industry","","System Engineering, Policy Analysis and management","",""

(mentor); Van Wee, G.P. (mentor); De Haan, A.R.C. (mentor)","2015","Together Amsterdam Airport Schiphol airport and KLM form the largest chunk of the Dutch air transport industry. As the market for air transport in the Netherlands itself is too small, KLM developed a worldwide route network with many transferring passengers. Schiphol facilitates connecting passengers with the best possible experience. During prosperous times this business model can create leverage in growth for an airline network. But due to the small margins in the air transport market, this business model is proving vulnerable during failing times. New carriers from the Gulf region have copied KLM’s business model. Significant cost advantages (and some critics even claim state aid), have allowed these carriers to grow rapidly. Thanks to additional advantages, the Gulf carriers can outcompete legacy European carriers, including KLM. The social and economic effects of air transport are many-sided: direct, indirect and catalytic it stimulates a nation. This research elaborates on the air transport system, with a focus on the Dutch situation, with the main question “How do the Gulf carriers influence the economic contribution of air transport to the Dutch society?”. Using a mixed method approach, most issues are addressed with a small quantitative analysis, though the underlying structure is unravelled with a qualitative approach. Various methods are used, emphasizing on the various aspects of this research: a theoretical framework on influences and change, a study of the contribution of KLM to the Dutch society and the possible futures for the Gulf carriers. Theoretically the air transport system consists of three sub systems: technology, market size and regulation. All sub systems are equally important, and have contributed to the evolution of the system into its current form. This structure is constantly subjected to changes, from both an endogenous and exogenous nature, resulting in temporary and permanent systemic transformations. The changes in market size of the various air traffic markets (Europe, U.S., Asia) over the years (due to globalisation) have fundamentally altered the air transport system, and enabled the Gulf carriers to take a key position in the system, as intermediaries between the old economies and Asia. Technology- and regulation-wise the Gulf carriers are docile to the old economies, although on the latter aspect early signs of trying to take a substantial role are visible. The Dutch government considers KLM as very valuable for the Dutch GDP, both in a direct sense as well as indirectly via Schiphol airport, as a large employer and connector to the world – for tourists and business alike. Over half of the operations currently undertaken at Schiphol airport are attributable to KLM. However given the abovementioned trend in air transport, it is questionable whether KLM is irreplaceable. Wider effects of this possible event – for example de- or re-hubbing of Schiphol – are uncertain, partly due to a missing political vision. Looking at examples of re-hubbing at Brussels, Budapest and Zürich airports, volume wise the impact of a defunct airline on the hub-function of an airport is limited. But in terms of connections and network, multiple visions are possible. When the Gulf carriers are analysed, one cannot but conclude that they employ similar business strategies. Emirates uses large, high-capacity aircrafts and high frequencies to forge its own airline network. Etihad buys airlines all over the world to create an equity alliance. Qatar resembles the more traditional strategy, cooperating in one of the old alliances. Looking at this strategic differences is interesting, as they can lead to different outcomes, when costs become an issue more than they do now, for instance due to a decrease in government funding of air transport. Emirates seems to have the most stable financial outlook, with reasonable ticket fares and a stable network. The other two might be more dependent on external sources of funding (i.e. government money), which could undermine a part of their business model. The research concludes that there is a possible future perspective which the Gulf carriers are a threat to KLM, eroding the profitability of its network – especially transfer passengers from the UK. This can be reflected in the operational volumes at Schiphol, and thus the Dutch GDP. However this assessment is dependent of the political vision used. De-hubbing theory and practise show volume wise a ceasing hub airline is not significantly affecting an airport. But in another perspective , for instance connectivity, de-hubbing can lead to a significant decrease in destinations, and thus network quality. Without government interaction it is likely the Gulf carriers will evolve to a role that is comparable with other competitors of KLM at Schiphol. Currently their operations at Schiphol do not erode KLM’s network. Consequently, it could be concluded that the Gulf carriers are a valuable addition to the Dutch air transport system that increases the network quality and connectivity, without derogation of KLM at Schiphol. Despite this seemingly comfortable conclusion, there is a point of attention. Currently the Dutch government does recognise the importance of a strong network, but has no policies in force to ensure the current network quality. Without a clear vision and policies by the Dutch government on the role of air transport, it is not possible to answer the question of the effects of the Gulf carriers to Dutch society, as answers cannot be interpreted.","change assessment framework; cyclic system behaviour; gulf carriers; resilience; air transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","","",""

At the same time the capacity of containerships has grown from several hundreds of containers in the 1960s towards today’s 19,000 TEU carriers. In order to achieve efficient operations of these large containerships, container carriers require high handling speeds and low handling costs when visiting container terminals. This development stimulated continuous innovations at container terminals, resulting in growing automatisation of terminal operations. Where minimisation of costs has always been a key performance indicator for terminals, over the last decade the environmental performance has become another important performance indicator. This environmental performance is enforced by governments and port organisations as well as carriers who demand less emissions for handling their containers at a container terminal to improve the green image of their company and products. In order to save costs and to reduce the greenhouse gas emission (especially CO2) at container terminals, more terminal equipment gets powered by more environment-friendly energy sources like biodiesel, hybrid systems or electricity. Nowadays most modern container terminals are even fully electric. With a focus on higher handling speeds, the peak capacity of terminal equipment (i.e. number of terminal equipment that are operating at the same moment) increases. Because of the high price that is paid for the highest observed peak demand (leading up to 20-30% of the terminals’ energy bill), it is beneficial to keep the peak demand as low as possible to reduce handling costs. To investigate the opportunities for container terminals to reduce their peak demand, an energy consumption model is developed to visualise the energy consumption of terminal equipment at container terminals. The energy consumption model visualises the energy demand (kW/s) by focussing on the different movements that are executed by terminal equipment. This focus is important, since the energy consumption differs per movement. Hoisting a container consumes up to ten times more energy than a horizontal gantry movement. Based on the energy consumption model a simulation model is developed to test rules of operation (i.e. changes to the business operational procedures) that reduce the peak demand of terminals. Two rules of operation are tested to analyse their effect on peak demand and handling time: 1) limiting the number of simultaneously lifting quay cranes; 2) limiting the maximum energy demand per second. The potential reduction in peak demand is around 50% against an extra handling time of less than half a minute per hour. This can be achieved by reducing the maximum energy demand by 50%. By reducing the number of simultaneously lifting quay cranes the peak demand decreases up to 40%, which is lower than for limiting the energy demand per second. In this case the impact on terminal operations is also bigger, which makes it a less optimal solution. When reducing the peak demand by 50%, a container terminal with eight quay cranes is able to reduce their peak related energy costs with about 249,000 per year; a major potential saving for container terminals, which shows the opportunity for peak shaving the electricity demand at container terminals.","peak shaving; container terminals; electricity demand; energy consumption; terminal equipment; quay cranes; STS cranes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport & Logistics","","","",""

(mentor); Jepma, E.J. (mentor); De Lange, D. (mentor)","2015","This master thesis focusses on the future of television for RTL XL. RTL XL is the digital platform for RTL Nederland, a Dutch broadcasting company. The design anticipates on the future television viewing behaviour of the RTL (XL) user. In the anlaysis phase, first the company RTL (XL) was anlaysed, after which a context analysis was performed by doing a literature and research review regarding the linear and video on demand (VOD) context. Next, a context mapping session was held as an inspiration tool to get insight into the expectations of the user regarding the future of television. The user research phase started off with extensive field research in order to research what viewing behaviour takes place on the sofa; observing the viewing behaviour of different Dutch user groups, while watching television. The field study showed four types of viewer states can be distinguished when looking at the viewing behaviour of different user groups (a family, a couple living together, someone watching alone and a group of friends). Moreover, the factors influencing in what viewing state the user is, were determined. The factors could be categorized into mainly two types of need states: the need for enhancement, which means the user looks for content related information, or to discuss the content with others; and on the other hand, the need for distraction, which is the need for other input when the content does not seem interesting enough; including the desire to watch other content at the same time, scroll social media and contact friends for random information. A remarkable insight gained from the field study, is the big role the smartphone plays in meeting both the need for enhancement as well as the need for distraction. The four viewer types differ in the extent to which the user is focussed on the content or the context. The laid back enjoyer is the least focussed viewer type, enjoying the context and doing many other things at the same time. The social distractor viewer type rather has social contact with friends than diving into the program and initiates a lot of smartphone usage. The engaged viewer type enjoys the content very much, but at the same time likes to share opinions with friends. The content diver does not want to miss out on any of the content and usually is a fan of the program; the smartphone is only used during commercial breaks. The performed user research, together with a literature review of the linear and VOD landscape resulted in the following design brief: Design an enriching personalized TV-experience, by creating a seamless interaction, between the user, TV screen and the RTL XL application; fitting the user’s viewing state. The ideation phase, in which a personal, external and internal brainstorm session was held, resulted into three design directions, translated into three different concept directions: watching content together, personalized content based on the user’s interests, and a social feed of following RTL stars and programs. In the final design, two of the concept directions were combined into one: personalized content together with creating a social context of enjoying content together. Based on the research performed, the new way of watching television – the view on the future of television – was described as a combination of linear and VOD video, both combined in one application and evenly easy accessible. In this new way of watching television, the device (smartphone or tablet) is the smart device, which is controlled by the user and streams content towards the television screen. The final design is an application designed for both personal and social usage. The personal environment provides the user the content he/she likes, using a recommendation engine; and in the social environment friends can be invited to enjoy content together. The user can watch both popular content that would fit his/her interests, as well as content selected specially for the user. Next to the general personalized content, the user can select a genre he/she would be interested in, which filters the content and provides video’s fitting the users interest in that particular genre. At any moment the user can invite a friend to watch a video together. Adding friends asks the user to first select a preferred genre, in order to see what friends match in this preference. After choosing a/multiple friend(s), the application switches to the social environment, providing a feed fitting both users’ preferences for a genre and their combined recommendations. The users can stay in touch very easily via chat or the microphone option. At any time an extra friends can be added. The design anticipates on both the need for enhancement as well as the need for distraction, by providing personal content as well as a social (virtual) context.","user experience; future of television; video on demand; application design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Van den Broek, C. (mentor)","2015","The Internet continues to grow exponentially with proliferation of devices and users being connected to it along with an exploding demand for various resource and performance intensive network services like multimedia content distribution, security, mobility, and machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. However, the current TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) based Internet architecture, which was developed over 40 years ago and was not prepared nor designed to successfully meet such explosive demands of today, is leading to the growing ossification of the Internet with its increasingly closed, complex, and rigid state. Thus, limiting innovation in such networks and their corresponding services. To overcome this ossification problem of the Internet coupled with a lack of innovation in provisioning and management of network services, more and more service providers and network operators are embracing the concept of virtualization for their networks. This trend is largely inspired by the recent success of cloud-based service models along with their chief enabler virtualization in addressing similar problems in the computing and storage fields of Information Technology (IT). Although recent advances in the field of networking are witnessing new virtualization enabling network technologies being proposed, it is still a challenge to logically combine a set of them to realize cloud-based service models for service provider networks. This situation is mainly due to the concerns over these proposed technologies in terms of scalability, reliability, interoperability, and disruptive nature. In this thesis, an evolutionary approach to implementing the Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) cloud-based service model for service provider networks is proposed with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) as its key virtualization enabling network technologies. In essence, the proposed evolutionary approach realizes the major benefits of network virtualization such as vendor-neutrality, simplicity, and flexibility while successfully addressing the stated concerns over SDN and NFV technologies in the proposed NaaS architecture. Furthermore, a proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation of the proposed NaaS architecture on a physical network testbed is demonstrated along with an innovative provisioning and management of basic network connectivity services over it. Finally, the proposed evolutionary approach is validated by an experimental performance evaluation of the PoC physical network testbed along with the recommendations for improvement and future work.","Network Function Virtualization; Network Virtualization; Network-as-a-Service; Service Provider Networks; Software-Defined Networking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-02-20","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Network Architectures and Services Group","",""

(mentor); Korkiakoski, V.A. (mentor)","2015","The wavefront of the light from objects in space gets distorted by the atmosphere around the Earth, decreasing the image quality of the telescope. Compensation for these rapidly changing wavefronts results in more detailed images of objects in space. The discipline of science that deals with this kind of compensation is called Adaptive Optics (AO). Thepyramid sensor (PS) can used in telescopes to measure these wavefront aberrations.The high sensitivity and its ability to work under low light conditions make the PS an interesting wavefront sensor, especially useful for the imaging of exoplanets. Besides the aberrations that can be measured by the PS, there are also unseen aberrations present affecting the image quality. These so-called non-common path aberrations (NCPAs) are located outside the control loop, in the path to the science camera (SC). This thesis focuses on the performance and the control aspects of the PS when compensating for these NCPAs. In the first part of my thesis, the nonlinearity, aliasing and the loss of sensitivity of the PS are investigated which all have their effect on the compensation of non-common path aberrations (NCPAs). This loss of sensitivity is caused by the high spatial frequencies which are present when convergence in closed-loop has taken place. Due to these high spatial frequencies the PS becomes less sensitive for lower spatial frequencies; a property that has to be taken into account when compensating for NCPAs. It has been proven that the nonlinearity of the PS is causing the PS to lose its sensitivity. An algorithm is proposed to deal with the loss of sensitivity when compensating for NCPAs. The algorithm estimates the loss of sensitivity based on the seeing conditions and the NCPA, which is assumed to be known.This information is taken into account for the compensation mechanism, referred in the text as partial compensation. The second part of this thesis consists of numerical simulations testing the algorithm and investigating the potential performance improvement. It is shown that the algorithm does not improve the performance of the PS, it even decreases it due to overestimation of the partial compensation. However, closed-loop simulations have shown that the performance of the PS can be dramatically improved by the use of partial compensation. To put the performance of the PS in perspective, the same simulations are executed for the widely used Shack-Hartmann sensor (SHS). It is shown that the performance increase is similar to that of the SHS. However, the SHS outperforms the PS when the amplitude of the NCPA increases.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

The goal of the project was to adapt this technique, in order to design a pre-fabricated, easy to assemble aquaponic system that can be scaled to fit the needs of the end user. The project took place in Chandigarh thanks to the collaboration with Sahib Aquaponics (Florida, USA) and India Aquaponics (Punjab, India). Five months were spent on the field, collecting insight on the context, translating this knowledge into preliminary concepts and ultimately manufacturing a functioning pre-production prototype for the company.

(mentor); van Heur, R. (mentor)","2015","Executive Summary “Talking is ordinary and anyone can do it, yet strategic conversations are as priceless as diamonds when running a business” This statement is essentially summarizing the solution and the problem of Hilti’s loyalty problem with consumable customers in one sentence. Hilti’s biggest resource to gain momentum, trust and loyalty with customers is its sales force. Yet achieving strategic conversations is different than small talk and needs to be beneficial for both parties. This thesis explores the problem and provides solutions towards the loyalty problem with consumable customers by delivering solutions focused on the short and long term. As it is Hilti’s ambition to be the worldwide leader in fastening technology, Hilti’s will need to provide customers with continuous innovative products to engage consumable customers in the long term. In the short term Hilti will need to provide the construction application market with innovative dust- free products. This thesis provides prototypes to show Hilti, ideas that are promising. However, launching these new products on the market will only create short term competitive advantage and not the desired sustainable competitive advantage in the long run. For that an stronger relationship between Hilti’s sales force and consumable customers is needed and within this thesis referred to as long term solution as it will take time to develop to its full potential. To understand the current position of Hilti MO NL in the Netherlands, an internal analysis has been performed to understand Hilti and an external analysis to analyze the market, industry and trends [PESTEL] for Hilti’s environment. Furthermore customer research has provided valuable insights by observing and interviewing customers. All these insights have been carefully analyzed and transformed into strategic factors as input for the SWOT analysis. The resulting SWOT confrontation matrix has provided three strategic directions which have been used in an creative session with students from the TU Delft to converge the project into two main directions. The first strategic direction focuses on delivering solutions for the dust-free anchoring market by tackling the bore hole cleaning procedure before anchor installation. Two prototypes have been developed which focus on dust-free bore hole cleaning. The first prototype is called the hollow brush bits [page54]. The hollow brush bit can be connected to Hilti drilling tools and simultaneously suck away and brush dust particles (necessary step for chemical anchoring applications). The hollow brush bits can be marketed as an family extension line of the Hilti TE-CD /TE-YD Hollow drill bits. The TE-CD / TE-YD are marketed by Hilti as automatic cleaning drill bits which can drill holes from 12 mm till 32 mm without the need to clean holes afterwards. The hollow brush bits can be marketed as semi-automatic cleaning bits as it cannot drill holes rather make hole cleaning more convenient and faster. The second prototype is an manual hand pump and has been designed as a result of construction workers complaining about dust particles in their face during anchor hole cleaning procedures. Manual hand pumps are still the most common method for cleaning anchor holes. They are cheap, fast and easy to transport. The prototype is called automatic cleaning hand pump and it sucks away the dust particles at the source. If desired, the prototype is designed in such a way to be usable with or without connecting to vacuum cleaners. The hollow brush bits and automatic cleaning hand pump prototypes presented are good ideas to further strengthen Hilti’s brand image as a company which strives for continuous innovative dust free solutions. The other two strategic directions have led to an strategic networking tool which can be used as an supporting tool for the master TS [experienced Territory Salesperson] to increase the networking effectiveness with consumable customers. This tool can be used to create truly meaningful relationships between customers and Hilti’s sales force. This networking tool incorporates an app which is part of the amplified community [page73]. In this community the master TS can further developing his/her skills towards becoming the strategic networker for Hilti and for customers. The customer receives three benefits by joining this community. First benefit is the geo tracking notifications intended on informing the customer that the master TS is nearby and the possibility to request a meeting. Second benefit is offering trade specific discounts only collectible within the app and in person with the master TS. The third benefit is networking within the amplified community app, finding easily specific industry experts within their trade, meeting other amplified community members in their area and possibly even meeting potential business partners to grow their professional network in the future. To conclude this thesis, an implementation plan consisting of financial estimations, strategic roadmap for development of the proposed solutions and a project evaluation of the entire project has been given.","Strategy; Amplified community; Customer journey map; External analysis; Internal analysis; Hilti; App","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

The local frequency response and accompanying mode shapes of this drum were successfully imaged under three different actuation mechanisms: 1) electrostatic actuation by using a gate electrode at the bottom of the cavity; 2) optothermal actuation by periodic heating from an actuation laser, inducing periodic thermal contractions and expansions; and 3) by thermally induced Brownian motion. The mode shapes of the graphene drum under electrical actuation and Brownian motion were consistent and resembled those predicted by membrane or plate theory, but their eigen frequencies did not match up with either of these regimes. This might be an indication that the drum is in a cross-over regime. It might also be explained by impurities in the drum surface, supported by an atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of the drum surface. The mode shapes of the graphene drum under optothermal actuation had different features, but this might be caused by the fact that the actuation laser was scanned along with the measurement laser in this scheme.","mode shapes; graphene; microdrum; NEMS; laser interferometry; spatial scanning; Brownian motion","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2016-01-01","Applied Sciences","Quantum Nanoscience","","Molecular Electronics and Devices","",""

(mentor); Heemink, A. (mentor); Jansen, J.D. (mentor)","2015","This thesis addresses the problem of permeability estimation of an oil reservoir using oil production data, a process known in the oil industry as computer-assisted history matching or data assimilation. Zilko (2012) compared the well-known Ensemble Kalman Filter method for data assimilation with the Non-Parametric Bayesian Beliefs Network (NPBN) approach to recover a permeability field in a 2D reservoir model. Due to computational limitations of the NPBN method, this earlier study estimated the permeability field in separate regions, resulting in an image with discontinuities between the regions and avoid these discontinuities by using interpolation. We test the application of NPBN in the Egg Model, an ensemble of 100 channelized, 3D reservoir models often used for history matching studies. Because the NPBN methods requires many more model realizations than the available 100, we use the Stanford Geostatistics Modeling Software (SGeMS) and its algorithms, including the SNESIM algorithm, to generate additional realizations. Thereafter, we perform a twin experiment, where the MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST) of SINTEF is used for two-phase fluid flow simulation. We test several interpolation methods for the permeability field: Cubic, Spline, and Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (PCHIP) techniques. To measure the performance of the NPBN and interpolation in recovering the permeability field, we use the root mean square error between the “true” and the recovered permeability fields. We also compare the change in liquid production/injection profiles. Visual observations of the results of the data assimilation do not show entirely impressive result for the Egg model with the number of wells and Gaussian noise that are used in this project. The NPBN method produces a permeability field which is not identical to the truth, and the forecasted production profiles of the estimated models also do not match the truth. They are different by the factor of, approximately, two. The addition of new measurement at later times does not improve the permeability field. As the correlation of the measurement and the state variables is very high at the first time step, the addition of more wells in the system is thought to be more significant than performing more measurement over time. The interpolation using the Spline method and the PCHIP method give very little difference to recover the remaining, unassimilated permeability field. However, at the peripheral area, where the extrapolation is conducted, the PCHIP method gives a better approximation, as indicated by a relatively lower absolute difference.","Non-Parametric Bayesian Network; Data Assimilation; Reservoir Simulation; Parameter Estimation; Computer Assisted History Matching; Interpolation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Petroleum Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

Since the square meters in sky are one of the most expensive ones of the world, an opportunity is seen in a redefinition of the cargo hold. Within this redefinition several passenger seating configurations are created in which both the passenger experience-, and (technical) feasibility are taken into consideration. To achieve this several critical safety measures are taken. In addition, solutions which positively influence the passenger experience due to the lack of installed windows and limited cabin dimensions are found and adopted to the proposed concepts. I.a. the installation of a window replacing technique and the (partial) removal of the technical floor of the cargo hold enable airlines to increase the density of their cabins without given sacrifices when it comes to passenger comfort.

(mentor)","2015","Offshore sand waves of several meters high and hundreds of meters long are formed in shallow seas due to the tidal currents. These sand waves can, amongst others, influence the burial depth of cables of offshore wind farms and obstruct navigation channels. For the Far Large Offshore Wind programme (FLOW), one of the goals of Deltares is to increase the knowledge on sand wave growth and behaviour. Since only a limited amount of bathymetrical data is available in these offshore areas, numerical models can give some insights to predict sand wave development. So far, all numerical models used to estimate the growth of offshore sand waves predict unrealistic values for either the sand wave height or the sand wave length. These values are highly overestimated. Most models initially predict a sand wave length that is realistic under the modelled conditions. This is the length of the fastest growing mode (LFGM). However, when extending the model simulation time, the sand waves grow up to the length of the entire computational domain. When limiting the length of the domain to one sand wave length, the sand waves become extremely high. No model has yet been able to correctly predict both the wave length and the wave height. The main objective of this study was to understand the processes behind sand wave growth and modelling the sand waves up to an equilibrium state. The effects of two different aspects on the growth of offshore sand waves in a sand wave field were studied. First, the impact of the bed slope effect was assessed, since in previous studies the influences of this parameter were not studied in much detail. The bed slope effect is the (numerical) phenomenon where sediment grains are transported downhill more easily than uphill. This parameter is very important under the applied conditions and has a strong influence on the model predictions. Secondly, the influence of different initial bathymetries on the growth of the sand waves was determined. Both initially random and large sinusoidal beds were used. Long-term model simulations (morphological time > 200 years) were run to assess the impacts of the studied aspects on a potential equilibrium. Equilibrium is found for growing sand waves, when the bed with sinusoidal perturbations equal in length to the LFGM is applied. With these sinusoidal perturbations, the bed slope effect only influences the growth rate and the shape. The equilibrium height found is similar to that predicted with other numerical models where the domain has the length of one sand wave and is, thus, overestimated. In both cases, the equilibriums are forced. The sand waves cannot grow further in length and have reached a maximum height for the corresponding wave length. Model simulations with other initial beds led to even larger and longer sand waves. Though, at some point during the simulation, a mean wave length of approximately the length of the fastest growing mode is dominant in the sand wave field. Eventually, after the modelled 750 years, no equilibrium is found with these initial beds as the increase in wave length or wave height is on-going. This suggests that essential processes are not taken into account or are modelled incorrectly.","sand waves; numerical modelling; modelling; North Sea","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","The Royal Netherlands air force (RNLAF) has been coping with a low availability of F-16 aircraft. It has been acknowledged that increasing the availability of avionics components is most beneficial to increasing fleet availability. Especially for F-16, rich database information is available including past operations and maintenance dating back to 1996. Improving the methods which are used to forecast the demand of avionics components is an important precondition to decrease multiple lead times in the F-16 supply chain. The readily available database information should be used to this goal. The research objective of this research project is hence as follows: Develop a novel spare parts demand forecasting method in order to increase F-16 avionics component availability by (1) evaluating state-of-the-art spare parts demand forecasting methods with the RNLAF time series demand data and (2) applying RNLAF data of component technical characteristics and component operational exposure in conjunction with the original historical demand data to improve selected method(s) Academic literature clearly stipulates that the methods of Croston, Syntetos, Babai and Teunter should be used to forecast intermittent demand. However, no literature has been found on how to improve these demand history based methods by using other data inputs like maintenance and operational history. Also, only limited literature was found about the extraction of demand drivers from databases. In short: A research opportunity is present. The developed conceptual model consists of five parts: Input (of demand, maintenance and operations data), steering variable (SV) generator, forecast method applier, stock level simulator and error minimizer. It is expected that stock level performance for avionics parts can be improved by (1) selecting the optimal forecast method, (2) selecting the optimal smoothing constants, (3) applying an SV deducted from installed base and/or FHRS per month variables. First, an optimal method and settings are established “in sample”. This ‘best fit’ is subsequently tested “out of sample” and compared to RNLAF stock levels to validate its performance. The installed base and FHRS per month variables are computed by combining two datasets and establishing install-removal intervals for a set of 110 unique components. The variables are translated into normalized and smoothed variables which are used to momentarily damp or gain the next estimate of the selected forecast method. Both installed base and FHRS per month variables are related to the utilization of components. An increase/decrease of the installed base (the total amount of installed components of a specific type at a specific time) or FHRS in a specific month for a component is expected to result in more/less defects of and hence demand for that component. A forecast optimization tool is built to implement the conceptual model. Enabling ease of experimentation by including many adjustable parameters and visualizing outputs to gain insights was of high priority throughout the development. The tool is capable of optimizing forecast methods and settings for all component demand inputs (110) in batch mode. The main output of the tool is exported in spreadsheet format. Analysis of the output of the forecast optimization tool resulted in the general conclusion that forecasting performance of the included forecast methods can be increased by using maintenance and operational data of the components, but the overall performance gain is small. In specific: SV information is used to generate better “in sample” forecast fits for approximately 50% of the components demand forecasts for which installed base information was available. In those cases, the mean performance gain in relation to the conventional forecast mode is 17.7% for installed base SV mode and 12.4% for FHRS SV mode. For aperiod of six months out of sample, a percentage of 50.0% of the optimized installed base SV forecasts and 47.9% of the optimized FHRS SV forecasts still perform best and are therefore robust for the demand pattern of the specific components. The out of sample robust SV powered forecasts lead to performance gain for 20.9% of the components. The mean performance gains are 47.7% and 21.3% for installed base SV and FHRS SV modes respectively. The research project succeeded in the development of a model and method for forecast optimization using multiple sources of information in parallel to demand history. The research project addressed two novel aspects not yet covered in academic literature: (1) Batch optimization of the choice for a forecasting method and parameter settings in relation to the specific demand patterns. (2) Operationalize multiple predictive variables from maintenance and operations databases and integrate them in the forecasting method. The provided platform is not perfect but will confidently serve as a starting point for further innovative research.","forecasting; spare parts; data mining; demand drivers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Air Transport & Operations","",""

These distract the driver from their driving task. What is the implication on driving safety? How is the car following behaviour influenced by distraction? Can this be described by a car following model? The multiple resource model tells us that there is limited resources to perform a task. Consequently when a driver performs a secondary task it is expected that its performance decrease. The car following model should be able to capture this behaviour. In this study data from a simulator experiment performed by IFSTTAR is used. Participants drove with and without a visual secondary (VST) task. The obtained driving behaviour is then modelled using the Helly and IDM model. With a traffic flow model, the influence of distracted driving on traffic flow is studied. Analysis of the simulator data showed that against expectations the subjects with VST drive closer to the lead vehicle with less speed difference. Their car following performance increased. This behavior can be explained by assuming an underload situation, where performance is suboptimal, when driving without VST. The Helly model can be used to describe the different conditions by using different parameters. The subjects are more vigilant when performing a secondary task. This better car following performance leads to an increased road capacity for the visual ST condition.","distraction; car following; simulator experiment; traffic flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

This may cause catastrophic consequences for environment, economy and even lives of people. Therefore, the mechanical assessment of crack-like defects is of great importance in engineering practice. For non-linear problems, application of cohesive zone models (CZM), as an alternative approach, has become more and more popular over the past two decades or more. From different respective to fracture mechanics, the concept of CZM regards the fatigue crack process as a result of material deterioration with damage concentrated at the cohesive zone. As a essential part of the CZM, several Traction-Separation Law (TSL) has been developed. Needleman proposed an exponential TSL in 1990 to describe micro damage. This model has been applied for parameter calibration for metals such aluminium [and stainless steel. There application for pipeline steel, specifically X65 is yet to be explored. From literature, similar simulation has given suggestions for the cohesive parameter calibration for structural steel. The commercial software ABAQUS has provided a triangle-shaped TSL. It is interesting to study about the feasibility of the provided triangle TSL in simulation of crack propagation in pipeline steel under monotonic and fatigue loading. Will the cohesive parameters calibrated depend on the choice of TSL? If yes, to what level will the difference be and what is the reason for this? On the other hand, through a series of parametric study and comparison with experimental data, it is necessary to have a deeper understanding on the influences of the cohesive parameters on the crack propagation applying the triangle-shaped TSL. Also there is a debate on whether the initial stiffness will place an effect on the simulation on the crack propagation and this issue is also addressed in this project. Meanwhile, in recent two decades, cohesive zone model has also been adapted for fatigue simulations, referred to as the cyclic cohesive zone model. Specifically, Silitonga et al applied a cyclic cohesive zone with a certain damage accumulation model to simulate the fatigue crack propagation in Aluminum specimens via a Subroutine UEL. Also they managed to show the potential of cyclic CZM in predicting overload effect by looking into the decreasing interface separation. However, this model considered only separation with positive values and so as the applied load. While the plasticity induced crack closure effect could have an impact on the fatigue crack propagation, a numerical simulation accounting for this effect involves a separate implementation of a contact algorithm for loading cases with overclosure of the crack interfaces. In this project, a variety of load cases including compression is considered while implementing the user element in to the ABAQUS code.","cohesive zone model; crack propagation; pipeline steel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Steel and Timber Constructions","",""

The goal of this thesis was summarized in the research question: Is it possible, and if so how, for the DelFFi satellites' temperatures to be controlled by passive means? The answer to this question was found through thermal modelling, testing and thermal control system designs. A detailed thermal model was created in ESATAN-TMS software. To verify critical model parameters, a set of 7 component level tests was performed. PC/104 conduction and mid-plane stand-off conduction in particular proved to be critical model data, with a significant deviation from their calculated theoretical values. With use of the model, three different thermal control system designs were made. All designs employ very low conductivity spacers and stand-off's, to reduce coupling with the cold structure. Also, a combination of aluminium, Kapton and tarnished copper thermal tapes are used. Concluded was that the batteries and the thruster unit were the thermally critical subsystems. The battery temperature range cannot be made small enough by passive means only, so it is advised to employ a heater for safety. The thruster unit propellant should be allowed to freeze, or its freezing point should be reduced by the use of ammonia or alcohol. With these adaptations to the thruster and battery, the thermal requirements of the satellites are met. This confirms that with these measures a working thermal control system can be implemented on the DelFFi satellites.","thermal modelling; thermal design; satellite thermal control; DelFFi; Delfi space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-02-16","Aerospace Engineering","Space Flight","","Space Systems Engineering","","52.01, 4.22"

(mentor); Groenleer, M.L.P. (mentor); Bierens, R.H. (mentor)","2015","In recent years, information technology (IT) has grown from an enabling technology to an important technology we depend on in our everyday lives. For example, IT is required for the proper functioning of personal devices that store our personal information, but is also present in the on-board computers in pacemakers and systems controlling nuclear reactors. Next to the diversity in ways in which IT can be applied, interconnectivity of devices is also an important characteristic in the IT world. This is because interconnectivity between devices allows geographical distance to be immaterial for activities taking place in cyber space. The extent to which we have incorporated IT into our society, is illustrated by events in which incidents damaging IT structures have led to serious consequences for individual, organisational or even international Internet users. Recent information technology (IT) incidents like the Heartbleed bug illustrate how having the same Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (or TSL/SSL) protocol vulnerability can result in serious consequences for these previously mentioned Internet users. Similarly, if incidents such as Diginotar had become widespread, the use of eGovernment services would have been put to a stop. This would have been done in order to protect the public from hackers, who would have used this opportunity to obtain personal information. Thus, cyber security now extends beyond physical borders because of the important place IT holds in influencing today’s society and the direct interdependence between different kinds of users and IT. The after effects of crimes and exploitations on the Internet harm individual users as well as government agencies, (non-) commercial industries and international institutions. Yet, because instances such as Stuxnet have not led to high impact incidents, the importance of IT security may not be evident to many of us. Although most incidents do not become widespread, protecting cyber space is still seen as a great challenge. This is mainly because the IT environment could be seen as a vital nervous system that has strong connections with the various IT components. Currently, there are several different types of approaches to ensure protection of cyber space. These can be categorized on an individual, organizational, industrial, national and international level in order to provide security. Examples of such approaches come from articles published by the media, but also from consultancy agencies who present this information in trend reports and security methods. Subsequently, the term “methods” used throughout this thesis is derived from these approaches in the form of international standards, best practices, and national security regulation in the form of strategies, industry guidelines, and company security models. ? While each of the different approaches and methods highlight the importance of proper protection against cyber threats, they focus on mitigating risks in the immediate environment of the respective stakeholder. Thus, each of these approaches only lends itself for proper protection of a single party, not cyber space in its entirety. Another limitation is that current methods originate from the field of information security, which is technology-driven and thus focuses on individual risks. This leads to inability of the resulting models to address the challenges of socio-economic aspects of cyber space. Our problem analysis thus shows that there is a gap between what society expects and what technology delivers. This is highlighted by the lack of an overarching framework that attempts to address mitigation of systemic risk extending beyond the individual stakeholder’s area of interest. In order to overcome this gap, this thesis aims to give an outline of requirements for an analytical model that enables multi-actor cooperation to jointly secure cyber space. To understand the complexity of the problem, the first step is to analyse which types of stakeholders are active in cyber space and how they secure themselves and their assets. This is analysed in Chapter 2. In chapter 3, desired properties are provided which will deliver an outline for a model to support multi-actor cooperation. This is done by identifying the actors and methods from literature and practice to support various security approaches. Interviewing practitioners in turn contributes to show which theories are still widely used and motivate method choices in Chapter 4. Ultimately through these various analyses, this research provides an outline of a model that enables multiple actors to collaborate and coordinate security within the various domains of cyberspace. The result of our work is a collaboration model to bridge the gap, shown in detail in Chapter 5. It provides a new perspective of how various stakeholder groups could work within a network setting. Key features of this multi-actor cyber security collaboration model are:  Identifying roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders in cyber space, varying from individual users to global players;  Combinations of interacting with external actors in order to jointly resolve an incident or crisis. The Diginotar case study in Chapter 6 was used to conduct thought experiments that validated our model’s analytical perspective and provide key investigations for further research. Limitations of time and available sources meant that this thesis is just a starting point for analysing the possibilities of integrating the perspectives of various actors into one close entity. A complete analysis and integration will in future enable us to coordinate efforts in jointly securing our cyber space. Because our designed model briefly touches upon these complex subjects; further studies could look into initiatives within each level to find more details e.g. roles and responsibilities, as well as actions that could help collaboration and seek out the effectiveness of interaction within every level.","analytical model; IT risk management; cyber space; information security; multiple stakeholder perspectives","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","ICT Section","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor)","2015","This research was done in the field of renewable energy and its future projection. The world Today is focused on changing its energy mix and rely more on renewable energy. Many obstacles face the continuity of the current mixture. Problems such as security of supply which includes; sustainability of current resources and insurance of trade between countries, are raising alarm for decision makers. The environmental concerns are also motivating countries to rely on cleaner sources of energy. The breakthrough in research in renewable energy technologies has motivated countries to make effort in raising its market share. This comes in times were many conventional power plants are reaching the end of their life time cycle and need replacement. The main problem that motivated this study is that renewable energy is not a cheap easily accessible energy as thought. Renewable energies such as solar and wind are intermittent and cannot be relied upon for base load supply. These sources are often more expensive and has much less energy density than conventional power plants. Many countries still face many problems overcoming these obstacles. The main objective of this thesis is to give a projection of the current situation of renewables. The study was to show the current situation and the obstacles, then present the solutions and real life case studies. These would serve as a guide to better understand why we stand at the point we stand currently at. It would also help answer the question of the future share of renewable energy in the market and whether it’s expected to reach 100% as hoped. The hypothesis made by the general public rather than the author was that; the world could solely rely on sun and wind energies to supply energy for the entire globe. From this hypothesis come ideas like covering parking lots with solar panels and flooding seashores with windmills. The hypothesis of this thesis however is the contrary. In fact this hypothesis wasn’t reached until half way along the research. In the beginning it was a matter of asking “can we rely solely on renewable energy as our main source of energy?” In order to investigate this hypothesis, a research was conducted among OECD countries that have already developed a decent share of renewable energy in its grid. The plan was to research for the opinions of academic researchers and policy makers regarding the future of renewable energy. The thesis was based solely on descriptive research not modelling. However some of the academic papers referenced were based on models themselves. The data taken were based on realistic scenarios rather than optimistic or pessimistic ones. And reliance was always on recent data as it’s a very volatile market.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering and Policy Analysis (EPA)","","Erasmus Mundus Joint Master program of Economics and Management of Network Industries (EMIN)","",""

(mentor)","2015","In order to obtain a modal shift from car towards public transport, the quality of a public transport journey has to be increased. The transfer is the least valued part of the journey where a traveller perceives one minute of waiting as three minutes. By improving the least valued part, the overall quality of a public transport journey increases. There are three strategies to add value to the transfer at a transit node: accelerate, condense and enhance. In order to determine where these strategies need to be applied, the node-place model is used. The node-place model assesses the quality of transit nodes by focusing on the node and place characteristics of a transit node. The potential of transit nodes can be indicated by classifying them in twelve transit node typologies. However, the node-place model only indicates where it is needed to accelerate and condense. Therefore, in this thesis the node-place model is extended with the experience value in order to provide insight into where enhancement is needed. By doing a literature review, the criteria for the experience value were determined. An MCDM, the Best-Worst Method (BWM) was used to derive the weights for the criteria. The input for BWM was obtained by conducting a survey among 160 respondents. Finally, the node-place model and the transit node typologies were extended with the experience value in order to assess the quality and indicate the potential. A case study in Rotterdam was used to apply and illustrate the method. The method was evaluated by comparing results from the new method with the node-place model and it was concluded that the new method shows more accurate results.","public transport; transit nodes; experience value; node-place model; BWM; Rotterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure & Logistics","",""

(mentor); Rots, J.G. (mentor)","2015","This Master of Science thesis depicts the research done on geodesic dome structures and tensile bolted bamboo connections. The report includes a parametric structural analysis of bamboo geodesic domes assessing the influence of openings, local and global stability, geometrical non-linearity, and the maximum possible dome diameters for domes constructed with Guadua angustifolia and Phyllostachys pubescens. The considered load cases are selfweight and a point load on top of the dome; the latter includes the option of incremental load application and geometrically non-linear analysis. Rules of thumb are derived indicating boundary conditions under which global buckling of half-spherical icosahedron-based geodesic domes does not occur. Furthermore, a comparison of geodesic domes and half-spherical shells is conducted with respect to stability. One of the main challenges in bamboo structures is the design of tensile connectors that exploit bamboo’s tensile strength, avoid splitting, and provide a predictable, ductile failure. In the context of the design and strength prediction of a bolted axial bamboo connector, experiments assessing the dynamic Modulus of Elasticity and compression strength of Guadua angustifolia and Phyllostachys pubescens were conducted. For both properties a significant correlation with density was found. Additionally, the behaviour of bolted connections was simulated by testing the bolt bearing and splitting strength of Phyllostachys pubescens in a single bolt test with square and round bolts. It was found that square bolts result in ductile embedment failure with large displacements. Special focus was paid to the influence of nodes on strength and stiffness; a 3D scan and electron microscopy of the nodes of Guadua angustifolia and Phyllostachys pubescens were made. Findings from microscopic investigation matched findings from experimental testing: Nodes had a positive influence on embedment and splitting strength and an overall negative effect on full-culm compression strength and compressive Modulus of Elasticity. Last but not least, the insights gained in this research were combined in a case study of a bamboo geodesic dome with elliptical door opening. The case study adopts a probabilistic safety concept and partial safety factors in the style of the Eurocodes.","bamboo connection; geodesic dome; bamboo node","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Mechanics","",""

(mentor)","2015","Angiogenesis1 is the biological mechanism by which new blood vessels sprout from existing ones. It differs from vasculogenesis, which is the de novo growth of the primary vascular network from initially dispersed endothelial cells (ECs). Vasculogenesis is predominant in embryonic tissue whilst new vasculature in the adult body arises mostly from angiogenesis. ECs, lining the inside of blood vessels, react to different angiogenic stimuli and inhibitors. Among the stimuli is the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which is up-regulated in tissue where the vascular structure is damaged or insufficiently developed to meet oxygen demand. The identification of the processes involved in angiogenesis is quite recent and has stirred increased interest in therapeutic and clinical applications according to Carmeliet et al. [1]. One can think of tissue repair in wound beds, inhibition of growth of tumorous tissue or vascular reform during the female reproductive cycle. Rossiter et al. [2] showed that VEGF induced angiogenesis is crucial for wound healing in an experiment where wounds were inflicted upon normal and VEGF-deficient mice. New vasculature ensures supply of oxygen and lymphocytes and disposal of carbon dioxide and lactates, accelerating wound healing and tissue reconstruction. The increased creation of new vasculature around tumorous tissue is believed to follow the same process and inhibiting angiogenesis is therefore an important topic in clinical studies on cancer treatment. Biochemical laboratory experiments can be hard, time consuming, expensive or unethical. Computational models can be used to provide an easy, quick and cheap way to get insights that would otherwise require laboratory experiments. The understanding of biological processes needs quantification and in this sense mathematical formulation of the relations involved becomes useful. Their mathematical interpretation and experimental verification is an iterative process resulting in better understanding of the process itself. Computer simulation will never make laboratory experiments obsolete, but it can provide guidance in targeting viable hypotheses before conducting in vitro or in vivo experiments. Mathematical modeling of biological cellular processes dates back to the simulation by Glazier and Graner in 1992. They describe natural sorting behavior of different cell types [3] and different re-arrangement patterns driven by the differential adhesion hypothesis [4]. This hypothesis states that cells of different types have specific potential energies upon adhesion, driving sorting behavior. In these simulations, the cellular Potts model2 (CPM) is used. A CPM for vasculogenesis based on this work was made byMerks et al. [5, 6] in which a layer of partial differential equations (PDEs) models the chemoattractants. Later, Merks added Vascular Endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) caused contact-inhibited chemotaxis to simulate angiogenic-like sprout formation [7]. From an initial clump of ECs in the model sprouting behavior appears. Merks postulates that both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis must be driven by the same principles. To produce these results, a generic library called the Tissue Simulation Toolkit (TST) was written in C++ starting from 2004 modeling the CPM described by Glazier et al. [4] in a generic way. Merks [7] extensively describes the advantages of a cell based approach over a continuum approach that is widely used in mathematical biology. Although his CPM is a nice method that increases insight in the angiogenic process, it is computationally heavy, limiting the scalability of the tractable problem domain. Vermolen and Gefen [8] described tissue behavior using a semi-stochastic cell-based formalism to model the migration of cells in colonies in the context of wound healing, tumor growth, bone ingrowth and contraction formation. Movement of cells is assumed to be the result of a strain energy density working as a mechanical stimulus. Like the CPM, the model tracks displacement and viability of individual cells. The aim of this study is to adapt this semi-stochastic cell-based formalism to describe angiogenesis, hence connecting this modeling approach to the subject ofMerks’ work. The need for such a model is clearly stated in the discussion of Vermolen’s work [9]. Thanks to the computational less heavy character in comparison with the CPM, we hope to be able to simulate larger areas to get a better glance at large scale behavior whilst still being able to benefit from the cell-based character of the model. We also improve the biochemical model for the degrading of the substrate by the cells and formulate all relevant parameters based on local properties. The challenge is to translate the advantages of Merks’ CPM, like cell shape specific behavior, tracking of elongation patterns and cell-cell contact behavior, to this new formalism without compromising the computational simplicity. To verify our simulation results with biochemical experiments, this study is performed in collaboration with the Dermatology Department of the VU Medical Center. This department does in vitro laboratory research on many processes that occur in the skin, for example the role of endothelial cells during skin wound healing. The first aim of this research is tomimic their in vitro angiogenesis sprouting assay using our computational model, simulating the response to different chemical stimuli like VEGF. Formulating a way to visually and numerically compare the laboratory work to the simulated results is key to making the model applicable in practice.","Angiogenesis; Wound Healing; Semi-Stochastic Cell-Based Modeling; Vasculogenesis; Cellular-Potts model; Substrate dependent","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","Numerical Analysis","",""

DAEs arise naturally and have to be solved in a variety of applications such as the mathematical pendulum and a reheat furnace model, both of which are used in this thesis to demonstrate the application of numerical methods and the arising difficulties. Working towards the prospective development of an applicable NMPC algorithm with DAEs as system models, this thesis is mainly concerned with the analysis and numerical treatment of DAEs. A particular focus is put on the topics of the strangeness index, an iterative procedure for determining all hidden constraints, regularisation techniques and numerical methods for solving DAEs.

Normally, these filters are geometrically closed, to prevent winnowing of the base material through the filter. However, geometrically closed filters are expensive and difficult to realize in the field. Geometrically open filters can serve as an alternative. Within an open filter, the pores of the filter material are large enough for the base material to move trough. The philosophy behind this concept is to reduce the hydraulic loading within the filter, in order to avoid initiation of the base material. This research focusses on open filters. A design formula for open filters was established by Hoffmans (2012). This formula is recently validated for uniform flow (Van de Sande, 2012) and for flow with additional turbulence by a sill and a pier (Joustra, 2013). The applicability for wave loading - although suggested by Hoffmans- is not yet confirmed. No validations study was carried out in which Hoffmans formula was validated for wave loading. In this research, the use of Hoffmans formula for horizontal filters under wave loading was evaluated. Laboratory experiments are carried out in a wave flume. For several configurations, the critical wave height was determined for a wave period of 2.0s, 2.5s and 3.0s. The critical wave height is defined as the height for which incipient motion of the base material occurs. The filter material was stable during all tests. The depth above the filter was held constant for the tests. Together with an older dataset from Halter (1999), the results were analyzed. With the introduction of several assumptions, insight was gained in the damping of the hydraulic load inside the filter. The analysis showed that the Hoffmans formula cannot be applied in the same way as for uniform flow, since no constant value for the load damp coefficient alpha is found under wave loading. Two hypotheses which were stated for the applicability of Hoffmans formula under wave loading by Hoffmans & Verheij (2013). For the experimentally obtained results, these hypothesis did not give accurate results. It is speculated that the hydraulic gradient should be included in Hoffmans formula. In the original formula as proposed by Hoffmans (2012), this term was neglected.","open filter; geometrically open; waves; scour protection; bed protection; Hoffmans","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Aim of this research is to answer questions from a technologic point of view (developers of travel demand models and travel surveys) as well as from a policy-making point of view (transport related decision-makers). To this end, three travel production models are developed, run, and compared. These are (1) a trip-based model based on aggregate data, (2) a tour-based model based on disaggregate data, and (3) an activity-based model also based on disaggregate data.

The research gives various recommendations for further research by academic or commercial model developers. In addition, the quantitative results of this research confirm many of the theoretical advantages described by activity-based authors. Compared to the other developed models, the activity-based production model provides the most accurate and realistic outputs. It, however, also requires more effort in development, implying that net benefits of ABM still need to be mirrored to the purpose of the model study.

(mentor)","2015","Dit verslag behandelt een wiskundig model voor het gedrag van het immuunsysteem gedurende de genezing van wonden. Het model wordt geanalyseerd naar stabiliteit van evenwichten. Bovendien worden er simulaties uitgevoerd op basis van Eindige Volume Discretisatie van de partiele differentiaalvergelijkingen. In een Matlab omgeving is programmatuur ontwikkeld om de oplossingen van de partiele differentiaalvergelijkingen te benaderen. De implementatie is tot stand gekomen voor twee gevallen: een 1 dimensionaal geval wat biologisch gezien kan worden als een snijwond en een twee dimensionale vierkante wond. Verwacht wordt dat het model de werkelijkheid kwalitatief goed weer zal geven, waarbij er duidelijke resultaten kunnen worden verkregen over de situatie in de wond. Dit project kan uitgebreid worden om het nog realistischer te maken en de werkelijkheid beter weer te geven. Vervolgens kunnen de resultaten gebruikt worden door biologen om beter te begrijpen van wat er in een wond gebeurd. Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat de meeste wonden goed kunnen genezen. Dit dankzij het immuunsysteem met de witte bloedcellen. Ook is duidelijk gebleken dat het erg voordelig is voor het lichaam om overal haarvaten te hebben. Dit zorgt ervoor dat de leukocyten het gebied goed kunnen bereiken, zodat de wond sneller en beter kan genezen. Tot slot voorspelt het model dat een geïnfecteerde wond niet meer geheel kan genezen als de bacteriën een te sterke concurrent zijn in de competitie met de broblasten. Het is dus voor het lichaam erg belangrijk om een goed immuunsysteem te hebben. Dit zal ervoor zorgen dat wonden kunnen genezen, zelfs onder moeilijke omstandigheden.","Immuunsysteem","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","Numerical Analysis","",""

(mentor)","2015","Sub-meter resolution satellite imagery serves a more and more important role in applications ranging from environmental protection, disaster response and precision farming to defence and security. Earth Observation at these resolutions has long been the realm of large and heavy telescopes. The costs of building and launching such systems are enormous, which results in high image costs, limited availability and long revisit times. Using synthetic aperture technology, instruments can now be developed that can reach these resolutions using a substantially smaller launch volume and mass. In this thesis, a conceptual design is presented of a deployable synthetic aperture instrument. The instrument can reach a ground resolution of 25 cm from an orbital altitude of 500 km. In terms of resolution, the system is compliant with current state-of-the-art systems, such GeoEye-2 and Worldview-3. With an estimated mass of 75 kg, the system is significantly lighter than conventional solutions. The thesis covers the optical and mechanical design of the instrument as well as the calibration strategy and required image processing techniques. The optical design of the deployable telescope is based on a Korsch Three Mirror Anastigmat. The entrance pupil of the instrument consists of three rectangular mirror segments that, when deployed, span a pupil diameter of 1.5 meters. To ensure that the telescope can deliver a deliver a diffraction limited performance while operating in a harsh and dynamic space environment, the telescope features a robust thermo-mechanical design, aimed at reducing mechanical uncertainties to a minimum. In addition, the system will feature an in-orbit calibration system. Following the launch, actuators beneath the primary mirror segments will correct the position of the mirror segments to meet the required operating accuracies. During operations, a passive phase diversity system will be used. This system can retrieve residual wavefront errors and use that knowledge to restore the image with a Wiener deconvolution filter. Using this approach, an almost diffraction limited image quality can be achieved in all operating conditions.","Synthetic Aperture; Deployable Telescope; High Resolution; Earth Observation; Optics; Opto-mechanical Design; Image Processing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Systems Engineering","","","",""

This model is denoted as partial differential equations for the CDS legs. By means of an additional Monte Carlo approach we are able to extract continuous implied recovery and default intensity term structures. These structures can then be used to assess the historical recovery assumption.

(mentor)","2015","In the context of the project ""Widening of the Juliana Canal"" a bottom protection layer is designed by dredging contractor de Vries & Van de Wiel Kust en Oeverwerken. Because part of the channel is embedded in gravel type soil layers and lies above ground water level, a water repellent function of this layer is necessary to prevent seepage.In the proposed design, the water repellent function is provided by a bentonite mat. A layer of rockfill is placed on top of this mat to protect it, among other loads, against damage done by dropping and dragging anchors. Little previous research has been carried to investigate the penetration behaviour of anchors in rockfill. Anchor penetration has mainly been investigated in sand and clay. Because of the significantly different intrinsic properties of rockfill compared those smaller grain sizes, the penetration resistance will likely vary. The available literature on the subject of cutting rockfill was concluded to be insufficient to determine the amount of anchor damage by either drop or drag in the design phase of the bottom protection of the Juliana Canal. To validate the proposed bottom protection, full scale model tests were executed. In this thesis, these field tests will also serve as a method of verification for penetration depth and holding capacity of anchors in different types of rockfill; several models were created and existing models are conformed to comply with the anchor shape. The combination of the prediction of penetration depth formula (Crum (2015)) and the cutting model of Kranendonk (2011) is then likely to give a good approximation for the holding capacity of anchors in different types of rockfill.","anchor; rockfill; cutting model; Juliana Canal; holding capacity; Kranendonk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-02-10","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","50.959812, 5.729537"

This paper contributes to a novel, compact solution that describes the complexprogression of vessel hulls by means of a parametric model. Furthermore, this solution includes controllability and serves the plausibility requirement. Our model achieves a significant level of diversity and scalability. This method consists of an off-line training and on-line generation approach and is therefore applicable for on-the-fly vessel hull generation. Based on an elaborated validation research, we found that our method is capable of generating plausible vessel hull instances with reasonable detail within 5 milliseconds a piece. We also developed an mixed-initiative interface to manipulate vessel hulls by hand. Moreover, we extended our research on hull generation to complete vessel generation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Computer Graphics and Visualisation","",""

The aim of this project is to increase the technology readiness level of a system developed in Delft for converting the kinetic energy of wind into electrical energy. To do so, a tethered airfoil is used to drive a generator on the ground by reeling the tether off a drum while flying the foil in crosswind patterns in the downwind area of the ground station. The introductory chapter of the document at hand takes a closer look at this concept and briefly discusses its advantages and disadvantages. The subsequent part deals with the individual system components in detail. A special focus is put on certain software components such as the flight control system, the realtime simulation environment and its mathematical models. After their introduction, the most important components are assessed regarding the effect on the entire system in case of their failure. For this purpose a Failure Mode and Effect Analysis as well as a Fault Tree Analysis are performed. On the basis of these methods the faults and failures of further interest for this thesis are defined. In order to enable the system to recognize certain failures and initiate appropriate countermeasures a health supervisor is implemented and its abilities are discussed. Furthermore its two core classes are presented and their methods for fault detection are described. Another major part of this thesis is the development of the above mentioned automatic countermeasures. Chapter 5 presents these procedures and deals with their behavior in detail. Finally using simulations the health supervisor’s ability to detect failures as well as the countermeasure’s effectiveness is discussed. The very last chapter draws a conclusion and gives an outlook to possible future developments.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

As a result, one in five of KLM’s flights has a hand luggage surplus, where the amount of hand luggage that appears at the gate exceeds the limited stowage capacity of the airplane. The only way to deal with a hand luggage surplus is by gate checking: stowing hand luggage in the cargo hold minutes before departure. Gate checking leads to unsatisfied passengers and delays costing an estimated 1.5MM. Direction A strategy of preventing hand luggage surpluses was pursued. It was analysed how hand luggage inflows (the amount of hand luggage per passenger) could be minimized, how hand luggage outflows (checking hand luggage voluntarily and checking oversized hand luggage involluntarily) could be maximized and how the stowage capacity of KLM’s fleet could be maximized. Solutions A variety of solutions and recommendations were formulated. Most importantly: Decrease hand luggage inflows, by offering passengers to choose either checked baggage or hand luggage. Maximize hand luggage outflows by implementing a fair way of enforcement, where oversized hand luggage has to be checked, but only against a fee when it is also overweight. Prevent futile gate checks, by implementing a tool that accurately predict the size of any hand luggage surplus.","hand luggage; baggage; KLM; service design; aviation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

One of these service quality aspects is the travel time reliability of a public transport service. However, the monetization of travel time reliability is still a topic of debate since it is unknown how travel time reliability (TTR) should be measured. The implementation of travel time reliability in the route choice behaviour of transport models is still not very common in practice. This research considers five model alternatives (or generalized cost functions), all based on literature, which are estimated from observations of a stated preference survey. These model alternatives mainly differ in the use of the TTR indicator; standard deviation of travel times and the reliability buffer time. The latter is defined as the amount of time a passenger has to take into account to arrive on-time in 80% of the trips. From the model estimation it is observed that it might be worthwhile to estimate a latent class model, since multinomial logit models segmented on observable characteristics or models with randomly distributed parameters, were not able to significantly estimate TTR related parameters with the correct sign. An incorrect sign means that the respondents reacted contrary on what is expected; a more unreliable route alternative is more attractive. A latent class analysis was performed, since there was a suspicion that different perceptions exist regarding TTR. This analysis showed that not every individual took TTR into account in their route choice behaviour or they had difficulties in considering TTR, transfer and frequency at the same time in their trade-off. The resulting different perceptions on TTR, estimated in the latent class model, could not be captured by segmenting on observable characteristics, such as trip purpose. From the results of the model estimations it is concluded that a model with scheduled travel time and reliability buffer time, as a TTR indicator, showed the best results regarding route choice behaviour. The preferred model alternative will be implemented in the regional traffic model of Utrecht, called the VRU-model. The implementation of this model is not trivial and many difficulties are encountered. Therefore, several implementation approaches are described.","travel time reliability; latent class model; stated preference; public transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

The goal of the first part is to numerically implement the Cahn-Hilliard equation in one dimension both explicitly and implicitly. This will be done using Matlab. The goal of the second part is to validate the coupled Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equation and the dynamic boundary condition for moving contact lines of (Carlson et al, 2011, p.9) by considering a two-dimensional spreading droplet case. This will be done using the CFD software OpenFOAM. In Chapter 1, the theory of positive and negative diffusion, including the normal diffusion equation and the Cahn-Hilliard equation, are discussed. Some background is given regarding the thermodynamics of the Cahn-Hilliard equation and its steady-state solution. After that, the theory of the coupled Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equation, the dynamic boundary condition for moving contact lines and the case which is implemented in OpenFOAM, are discussed. In Chapters 2 and 3, the diffusion equation and the Cahn-Hilliard equation are implemented in one dimension, using the Euler Forward scheme. In implementing the Cahn-Hilliard equation, two different discretizations are used, of which only one gives the desired results. Next, an extensive stability analysis is done, using a linearization of the Cahn-Hilliard equation as well as numerical experiments. The stability condition is increasingly severe with increasing interface width. Regarding the results of the evolving interface, a qualitative analysis is done which discusses three subjects: the deviation of the solutions with the steady-state solution, the interface width for different parameters and grid sizes and the interface overshoot, which is an unphysical appearence. In Chapter 4, two semi-implicit methods and one implicit iterative method, are discussed. The implementations of the two semi-implicit methods, Implicit-Explicit (ImEx) and Modified Furihata, are succesful and their stability conditions are better than the stability condition of the Euler Forward scheme, for most interface widths. The results regarding the evolving interface are nearly identical to the results of the Euler Forward scheme, therefore the qualitative analysis is also similar. The implicit iterative method, which involves the use of the G\^ateaux derivative, has not been succesfully implemented, eventhough two different discretizations are used. The results regarding the evolving interface are behaving in a positive diffusive way, which results in a flattening interface with time. In Chapter 5, the coupled Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equation and a dynamic boundary condition for moving contact lines are used to model a spreading droplet on a flat surface. The implemented model is validated using different cases in which the steady-state contact angle and the friction factor of the surface varies. Next, parametric studies are done regarding the interface width, the surface tension and the ratio of the surface tension and the friction factor. The conclusions are that the modeled system differs too much from the system in literature to make an absolute comparison but, qualitatively, the model behaves as expected.","Cahn-Hilliard; Numerical Methods; non-linear partial differential equation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Chemical Engineering","","Transport Phenomena","",""

(mentor); Bastiaans, L. (mentor); Hogeweg, A. (mentor)","2015","This thesis is conducted for Royal IHC and Witteveen+Bos. Royal IHC is a Dutch ship builder and Witteveen+Bos an engineering consultant. Both companies have encountered the problems of water hyacinth. Water hyacinth, Eichhorni Crasippus, is an aquatic weed which is widespread throughout the tropics and subtropics. It is an invasive species in most parts of the world and has a large impact on the local ecology, economy, livelihood and safety of people. Water hyacinth can be controlled by mechanical harvesting. Once the plant is harvested the biomass can be used as a resource. The aim of this research is to assess the potential value of the water hyacinth as a renewable resource and determine if it is economically feasible to process water hyacinth on an industrial scale, more than one hectare harvest a day. In order to assess the economic feasibility of water hyacinth usage, a literature study was conducted to evaluate the characteristics of the plant and define the processing options. Secondly a canvas business model and a cost-benefit analysis were made to assess the value chain and the theoretical feasibility of an investment in a large scale water hyacinth processing project. The final and third step was a business case based on a field trip to Kenya, to validate the theoretical business model and cost benefit analysis. Water hyacinth is a very fast growing plant which reproduces both sexually and vegetativly. The plant is so successful because it can adapt easily to its environment. The plant thrives in eutrophicated and polluted water bodies. In these water bodies heavy metals are taken up by the plant and these have to be taken into account for usage of the biomass. The biomass of water hyacinth can be used for three purposes 1) energy 2) agriculture and 3) industry. The biomass is least valuable when it is used for its minerals, for biogas and energy production. Based on the literature review it was found that water hyacinth can best be used for the production of 1) animal feed 2) biogas and 3) fertilizer. The business models for these three products were assessed because of the high value of the end products and the feasibility of production in developing countries. For the processing of water hyacinth into animal feed, the leaves and the roots should be separated as animal feed can only be produced from the leaves. The roots and shoots can be separated during harvest by specialized equipment. A business canvas was used to describe a business model for a company processing water hyacinth. The business models can vary because the location and water bodies where the weed grows are different. It was found that large scale processing is mostly feasible in big lake structures because of the availability of biomass. To evaluate if an investment in water hyacinth processing facilities is feasible the Net Present Value (NPV) was calculated. From the theoretical cost benefit analysis it could be concluded that water hyacinth processing is feasible for the production of animal feed, biogas and fertilizer. The production of electricity and compost is not economically feasible because of low prices and low efficiency. To validate the assumptions made for the theoretical business model a business case was conducted in Kisumu, Kenya. For the business case, market data was assessed on local markets and all main stakeholders were interviewed. The market prices found are variable. A Monte Carlo simulation was therefore conducted. It is concluded that a water hyacinth processing plant is economically feasible. The internal rate of return determined in the business case was higher than found in the theoretical model. This can be explained by high demand and prices for animal feed and cooking gas. There is a large milk deficit in the case study area and dairy projects are likely to be started. Animal feed is however a constraint in the area. Local governments are therefore interested in production of animal feed from the weed. The local authorities are also interested in removal of water hyacinth because of the negative impacts of the plant, in particular the blocking of waterways. There is however no budget for removal of the plant. Water hyacinth usage is not propagated by the national government because of concerns that the problem of water hyacinth will increase if a commercial use is found. The plant is not abundant throughout the year in Lake Victoria because it infests the lake in cycles. It is concluded that it is economically feasible to process water hyacinth into animal feed, biogas and fertilizer. Using water hyacinth to produce agricultural products will stimulate agriculture development and use nutrients to the best potential. Year round availability of water hyacinth for processing is however a problem. Cultivation of water hyacinth and alternative biomass sources need to be assessed. The processing of water hyacinth into animal feed is particularly recommended because it is the most valuable product. There will also be opportunities in the future for animal feed because of expected scarcity of animal feed. More research is needed for adapting harvesting equipment. For a pilot project a partner has to be selected as water hyacinth processing is not the core business of IHC or Witteveen+Bos. Partnerships with corporates in the feed and dairy industry should be evaluated. The whole value chain can then be established by processing water hyacinth into animal feed.","water hyacinth; biomass processing; canvas business model; biogas; animal feed; aquatic weed harvest","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Resource Engineering","",""

Because rainfall ground measurements are not available all over the world one has to look for other data sources for a large part of the world. For those areas, remote sensing rainfall products can offer good rainfall estimations for those basins. But with several ground measurements on the market the question is which of the open access remote sensed rainfall products is the most accurate? In this research 13 remote sensed rainfall product are validated and compared for the Nile Basin for a yearly and a monthly temporal resolution between 2000 and 2010. Also a 14th product is made with the use of the relative errors estimated with the triple collocation method. The results showed that the CHIRPS v1.8 product has the best correlation and root mean squared error, and the TRMM 3B43 product showed the best bias.","Remote Sensing; Water Accounting; Triple Collocation; TRMM; Nile Basin","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Water Resources","",""

Case study: Day River Basin","Hagedooren, H.P.; Keyzer, L.M.","Ertsen, M.W. (mentor); Rutten, M.M. (mentor)","2015","This thesis is about the development of a study area for the Hanoi University of Natural Resources and Environment (HUNRE). This university has chosen the Day river basin (next to Hanoi) to use as a study area for Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) education. This thesis will focus on two courses of the bachelor program of HUNRE: Water Resources Monitoring (WRM and Water Resources Systems Modelling (WRSM). The first objective of this thesis is to explore the study area. The data and information which will be collected during fieldwork, a literature study and analysing the available data will be collected in a database. This data will be the input data for the models of the course WRSM. The second objective is to develop a practical site for the course WRM. At this practical site students will measure the cross section (water depths) and flow velocity. With the flow measurements the students can calculate the discharge. With the information/data from the first objective it will be possible to select a measurement location, measurement methods and equipment. After some trial measurements a guideline will be written, so the students can follow this guideline during the practical. The study area exists of two tributaries of the Red River; the Tich River and the Day river. The characteristics of these rivers are different. The Tich River is a natural river, with its origin in the Ba Vi mountain range. The Day river is now a ‘’dead’’ river. This is caused by the two control structures (Day dam and the Van Coc sluice) upstream. This results in a flow velocity of nearly zero. This is also the reason why the Day river is much more polluted than the Tich River. At the moment the government is constructing a new channel from Cam Dinh to the Day River which will supply fresh water to the Day River. After some fieldtrips a measurement location at the Tich River is chosen which met all requirements to function as practical site for students. At this location an irrigation company has built a stair from the dike until the water surface. With this stair the river is easily accessible and this stair can be used as a reference for reading the water level. The next step was to select measuring methods for this location and select equipment to for these methods. A staff gauge is chosen to measure the water depth. The velocity area method is chosen to measure the discharge at the measurement location. The flow velocity which is needed for this method is measured by a propeller current meter. The last phase of the fieldwork existed of trial measurements at the measurement location. At the moment of the trial measurements it was dry season, this means a low water depth and a low discharge. After the trial measurement a guideline for the course Water Resources Monitoring is written. This guideline contains background information about the study area, explanation why this location is chose to measure, an description of the methods and equipment, a step for step guideline to measure the water depth and flow velocity and some questions about the practical and theory behind the measurements. The final recommendations for the total study area are:  Monitor the influence of the new Cam Dinh channel. This channel can alter the characteristics of the study area drastically.  Keep the database up to date The final recommendations for the measurement location are:  Collect more information about the measurement location from the Day irrigation company, they have precise information about the location of the reference level  In the future it is useful to develop a second measurement location.  The practical site can be used for more measurements of other courses, for example water quality measurements or meteorological measurements.  Monitor the water level with a continuous water level recording device like a diver The final recommendation for the course WRM and WRSM are:  Collect missing input data for the models of WRSM  Improve the guideline after the first students are finished with the practical","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Recources Management","",""
