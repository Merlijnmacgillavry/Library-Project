(mentor)","2011","The existence of mediated communication is inevitably changing our paradigm of ways to communicate with other human beings. It enables us to connect with others over a distance without having to present at the same location or the same time. This growing field of mediated communication leaves room for explorations of the possibilities of future implementations. Many companies nowadays are developing communication applications defined by sophisticated technology. From my point of view, the future application is not necessarily defined by the most advanced technology. The opportunity could occur by the experience it delivers for the users. Technology has to enhance the value of communication as our essential human need—to connect with each other—where emotional experience is an important part of it. For Wacom, the exploration in this rapidly growing field will be useful to reach broader potential target market. The analysis phase was performed in two parts: (1) The emotional enrichment, to gain basic understanding about emotions, to find out about the occurrence of emotions, and to define the term of rich emotional experience for this project, and (2) Emotional richness in mediated communication, to find the factors that influencing emotional occurrence in mediated communication. The results of the research were summarized in the insights and were reformulated by defining the vision. In the final concept, called Bamboo Card, people are given the space to share, co- experience, and com¬municate with their closest circle. The idea is that the application should enable people to send and receive visual messages with their loved ones in their personal space. We use the picture as a media to explain a certain situation or condition without having to write for pages. People could take a picture, annotate it, and send it directly to other person within the app. In this case, we tweak the traditional use of pictures, from “send to” or “display” into “share with”.","emotional design; experience design; iPad application","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-09-30","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Aesthetics","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2011","Individual Pitch Control has been a topic of study in the field of wind turbine engineering for more than a decade. It has been shown that a load reducing controller can be designed that makes use blade root moment measurements. Various authors have performed simulations to estimate the extent to which Individual Pitch Control can reduce fatigue damage for rotating components. More recently, the application of IPC to reduce fatigue damage of fixed frame components has been investigated. One effective method is to extend the IPC algorithm to harmonics of the rotor frequency. While the effectiveness of IPC control is acknowledged by many authors, there has been little published on how to use the fatigue reductions to reduce the cost-of-energy for a wind turbine. In this thesis, an attempt is made to formulate a design methodology for higher harmonic IPC, to capitalize on the fatigue reductions by making design changes to the turbine, and finally estimating the potential profit of these changes. The wind turbine model used in this work is the Upwind 5.0 MW onshore conceptual wind turbine. It was implemented into the aeroelastic wind turbine simulation software FAST. The software of FAST was interfaced with the software package of Simulink which allows for intuitive control design. A combination of Linear Time Invariant control design, and time-marching simulation analyses was used to optimize the various controllers used in the simulations. The reductions of fatigue obtained for the baseline turbine, were around 18% for the blade root flapwise bending moment, and 15% for the analysed moments of the fixed frame components. Based on the fatigue reductions obtained through the controller implementation, three redesign cases were formulated: - Upscaling of the rotor diameter - Reducing the weight of the rotor blades - Increasing the power rating of the turbine Simulations of the redesigned turbines were performed to see if the redesigns were viable. For the cases which were considered viable, the upscaling and weight reduction case, a cost analysis was performed. This cost analysis provided an estimated 1.6 million $ added profit over the turbine lifetime for the rotor upscaling case, and an estimated -130,000 $ loss for the weight reduction case.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","DuWind","","","",""

(mentor); Kester, L. (mentor); Van Eijndhoven, P. (mentor)","2011","Smurfit Kappa Group is a world leading company of paper-based packaging and is the largest waste paper trader and consumer in Europe. In Smurfit Kappa Specialties Division, Bag-in-Box has been one of the successful packaging solutions for the past 10 years. It is nowadays widely used in the wine industry. However, the wine market is becoming saturated. This has raised two questions for the Bag-in-Box development. 1. What kind of packaging applications can be used with Bag-in-Box in the market? 2. How can Smurfit Kappa increase or create market share of the Bag-in-Box application in a certain market segment in addition to wine? Meanwhile, with the growing trend of sustainable business development, some current clients of Smurfit Kappa are looking for a more sustainable packaging to replace their blow-molded bottles. The cost of blow-molded bottles is, however, very competitive. By using a new technology recently developed by Smurfit Kappa, Form-Fill-Seal, the costs for Bag-in-Box could be lowered enough to become competitive with blow-molded bottles. When looking into potential marketing segmentation, the laundry detergent market is found to be the largest in market size and is seen as a highly applicable area for the Bag-in-Box application. A couple years ago , Smurfit Kappa unsuccessfully tried to introduce Bag-in-Box into the liquid laundry detergent market. The failure was due to a lack of integration of the consumer’s needs and preferences. To learn from these mistakes, primary research (interviews, observations and a focus group session) was performed to gain insight from Smurfit Kappa’s clients and their respective consumers. From the results, three important factors are summarized which will determine the success of the new BIB. They are: 1. Winning the “First moment of Truth”, 2. Maintaining the “Second Moment of Truth” and 3. Sustainability & Cost. Based on these factors, the Bag-in-Box for Laundry Detergent (BIBLD) has been re-designed. An optimized design is selected and should be discussed with SKG’s clients. The final design is provided in two sizes, 1.5L and 2.5L, to fulfill the need of different concentrations of laundry detergents. It has similar or better features and functionality than BMB. These include a larger printable area, a drip guard, a window indication, a measurement indication, an easy grip handle and improved recyclability. Meanwhile, as BIBLD is mainly made of waste paper it is significantly more environmentally friendly in terms of CO2 emissions, especially on material use and recycling. Furthermore, a business case is provided with the short-term implementation strategies that are based on the Marketing Mix of Product, Price, Place, Promotion and People. Long-term implementation strategies are also suggested for an expansion of the product portfolio and in terms of business with private label companies. To help SKG on making a final decision, three case scenarios concerning “Benefit or Risk?” are created. These three scenarios show three levels of risk of the project and include: 1) an Optimistic scenario, 2) a Realistic scenario, and 3) a Pessimistic scenario. Finally, some recommendations for the company in terms of innovation and future product development are suggested.","Bag-in-Box; Blow molded bottle; packaging; Form Fill Seal; new product development; new market launch","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-09-30","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Mugge, R. (mentor)","2011","Introduction An often-recurring subject in branding assignments in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) packaging industry is ‘what is “premium.”’ Marketing and Brand Managers of FMCG brands brief packaging designers (such as Cartils, see paragraph 1.2) that their new packaging must have a premium character. Although one might have an idea of what premium is; it is not sure what it exactly means, there is no coherent definition. Furthermore, it is not clear what characteristics a packaging needs to have to be perceived as premium. This project aims at researching and clarifying the aforementioned for packaging design. Problem statement and project setup The scope of this project is to develop a tool that is applicable in the assistance of creating premium branding in packaging design. To reach this goal the project is divided into five phases: (1) Literature research and expert consultation (chapter 2); (2) Packaging design features research in three categories (chapter 3); (3) Consumer and expert research through focus groups (chapter 4); (4) Research results synthesis for tool development, a methodology for future premium packaging design (chapter 5); (5) Redesign to test perception of tool based packaging (chapter 6). The first research phase is described in the following chapter (2), the meaning of the term ‘premium’ packaging is researched and explained through literature; it is determined where this class of packaging stands compared to others (classification) and which elements play a role in consumers’ premium perception of brands. Next, the analyses of all relevant design features from three FMCG product-packaging categories are reported (water, chocolate and body lotion) and design patterns in high priced products are mapped (chapter 3). Based on these results, three Focus Group sessions have been conducted with premium target group consumers and packaging design experts to discuss and research premium holistic designs, design cues, (cross-) category general premium characteristics and individual rating (chapter 4). This ranking is discussed, redesigned upon and tested in chapter 6. Chapter 5 will concern tool and methodology development for future packaging design projects, stating final conclusions, managerial implications and limitations of this project. The original Verkade packaging was heavily criticized (chapter 4), three redesigns have been made based on the premium packaging creation tool (chapter 5): evolutionary, progressive and revolutionary, each with a higher level of premium packaging properties. The premiumness of the designs, and with that the validity of the tool), was tested on consumers through four online surveys. Results have been statistically analyzed. Results from ranking with other brands show significant differences between the mean of revolutionary design 4 compared to other designs and the other brands, and it is equal to Lindt 99%, which is considered very premium (chapter 4). Design 4 is also perceived as significantly more premium on the level of the three elements (chapter 2). Design 3 is perceived as significantly more expensive than design 1; and design 4 as more expensive than design 1 and 2. Design 2 is trustworthier than 3 and 4. Design 4 is the least recognizable as chocolate of four designs. There is no intrinsic illustration and the ecru color makes it harder to recognize as chocolate. It is also considered more detailed than the others, although it seems more sober. This suggests detailing is more in the finishing of the packaging, and in the subtlety and the effort. The contradictory qualification of innovative and retro or classic character is clearly due to the nostalgic but novel, unprecedented design. Price, elements and holistic types, which relate to increased premium perception, strengthen each other in correlation with increasing price. Recognizable as chocolate shows a strong negative relation with all (except trustworthy) due to the lack of intrinsic product information and the differentiated packaging color. Trustworthiness is not correlated to recognizable as chocolate, which indicates that a higher reference to product expectation does not necessarily increase trustworthiness. This makes sense because lower priced packaging often has more intrinsic illustrations. Trustworthy also has a weak correlation with innovative, as something unprecedented has no reference in a consumer’s mind. Regression pointed out that high quality is the most important element, as perceived by consumers, in predicting dependent variable price. The perception of high quality significantly predicts a higher perceived price. Concerning holistics, exclusive and exclusive-subtle are the two holistic types that significantly increase price perception through regression. From factorial analysis unfolds the friction between innovation and recognition (negative regression), see the aforementioned for more examples. Virtually all of the elements and high price are all related to each other as expected, acknowledging the validity of the design, the test, the respondents and the tool. Small improvements are still worth to consider, as well as implications, final conclusions and recommendations for future research, as is done in chapter 7.","premium; packaging; design; authenticity; high quality; differentiation; perception","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","Product Innovation Management","",""

What are the requirements that the product lifecycle places on the supply chain? 2. How can supply chains be reconfigured by incorporating flexibility to respond to the requirements of the product lifecycle? To answer these questions, a theoretical framework is first developed based on the relation between product life cycles and supply chain management in the literature. As the research involves an exploratory approach, the case study method was determined to be appropriate and four case studies are developed based on data collected from literature, company documents and interviews. From the cases and literature on supply chain flexibility, possibilities for reconfiguration over the product life cycle are presented.","strategy; flexibility; framework; network structure; product routing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-10-30","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport and Logistics Organisation","","Management of Technology","",""

Recently, there has been work on a receiver tracking algorithm that makes use of X-ray pulsar signals. However, a system based on this would not find use on celestial bodies where an atmosphere blocks the harmful X-rays. This thesis is directed towards building a navigation system in hardware that makes use of `radio pulsars'. The navigation system may allow a receiver observing radio pulsar signals to determine its position with respect to a reference, possibly with the receiver being anywhere in the universe of interest. The system is initially intended for estimating a receiver's coordinates without a prior knowledge of the receiver position, pulsar locations relative to the receiver, as well as the expected pulsar signals. This thesis lays down the feasibility and the limitations of the system that would use radio pulsars. The work presented includes: defining the fundamentals of radio pulsar based navigation, selecting suitable signal processing algorithms, analyzing system usage scenarios and related SNR enhancement by subsystems, constructing the system architecture, and discussing a hardware prototype based on FPGAs. Another objective (which has been successfully completed) is to rate the methodology of automatic RTL generation from Simulink models.","pulsar navigation; radio pulsar instrumentation; simulink to RTL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-10-11","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Microelectronics","",""

(mentor); Van Timmeren, A. (mentor); Houben, L.J.M. (mentor)","2011","Plants can fulfil various functions. Plants provide places for playing, sports and recreation, establishing social contacts, isolation and escape from urban life, aesthetic enjoyment, viewing buildings from a distance and so on. Vegetation and plants on roofs and façades is one of the functions of plants most with respect to the built environment and horticulture. The presented report contains a general description of vertical greening systems (plants or vegetations against a façade) and their behaviour in relation to air quality improvement, aesthetics, energy saving, biodiversity, mitigation of the urban heat island effect and its social impact. Vegetation in relation to moisture transport and a life cycle analysis (LCA) for two living wall systems are particularly extensively explained. Vertical green or “green walls” is at the moment a popular item of sustainable development for a better environment related to dense urban areas. Vertical greening can be divided in three main branches, namely: - green façades; (traditional use of climbing plants against a façade from the ground or from planter boxes), are the easiest and cheapest manner to cover the vertical surfaces with vegetations. Green façades that are available until now can be classified in to two main categories, namely plants rooted into the ground and plants that are rooted in artificial substrate at grade with watering system. Green façades can be applied directly to the wall and also indirectly to the wall with a supporting structure such as net system or cable and wire net system. A large variety of plants can be used for making green façades. Especially Hedera plants (common ivy) are the most common ones. - wall vegetations; (spontaneous growing of plants on structures), are growing without any human intervention in a natural way with irregular patterns. This type of vegetation can be typically found on older buildings and monuments. Concrete panels with large pores variety are a new development to create green structures within a short period of time (1-2 years). These panels are also a type of façade which are suitable to plant vegetation on them. - living wall system (LWS); (pre-vegetated “prefabricated” modular panels or in situ applied panels), is a relative new application form of vertical green using modern technology. A watering system and nutrients distribution are always required and the modular panels are replaceable. There are various types of living wall systems which are already applied and applicable. Living walls are distinct from green façades in that they support vegetation that is rooted in substrate attached the wall itself, rather than being rooted at the base of the wall, and as a consequence have been likened more to vertical living systems. Living wall systems can be used either outdoor or indoor. A large verity of plants as herbs can be used on the living wall panels. A few examples of living wall systems that are described in this report are LWS based on planter boxes, LWS based on foam substrate, LWS based on mineral wool and LWS based on felt layers. Vertical greening systems have a range of advantages and disadvantages, which are summarized below. Advantages of vertical greening systems include: - filtering air particulates to improve air quality. - reducing (mitigate) the heat island effect (UHI). - providing sound insulation. - moderating a building's internal temperature via external shading. - creating a microclimate, which will help to alter the climate of a city as a whole. - providing biodiversity and a natural animal habitat. - protecting the wall against graffiti. - improving the insulation properties in summer and winter. Disadvantages of vertical greening systems include: - chance of damage on façade in case of green façade directly to the wall. - maintenance of vertical greening systems. - costs of vertical green systems, especially living wall systems. - irrigation systems. An experimental setup called ‘hotbox’ is made to test a number of vertical greening systems to determine the moisture transport through it. The hotbox is made of plywood (thickness 18 mm) and EPS-SE insulation material (thickness 200 mm). The hotbox has a dimension of (3000 mm x 1800 mm x 1800 mm) and has two compartments for indoor and outdoor climates. The principle of testing in the hotbox is to determine under steady state conditions (laboratory condition) moisture transport through a test specimen (bare wall) placed between a warm and a cold enclosed enclosure and to compare this with vertical greening systems hung on the wall under a variety of climate conditions (summer and winter). The test specimen used for the experiment consists of a wall with a surface of 1 m2 (made in Dutch building system). The test specimen has a (inner leaf + insulation + air cavity + masonry). The measurements are performed with thermocouples and hygrometers through the complete system of a bare wall with greening systems on it. As it is mentioned the behaviour of different vertical greening systems according to building physics and sustainability aspects are also discussed in this report. A start was made to determine the black spots within the thermal behaviour aspects of vertical greening systems. In a number of experiments some vertical greening systems (Hedera helix directly to the wall, Hedera helix, indirectly to the wall, LWS planter boxes system, LWS foam based system, LWS mineral wool based system and LWS felt layers system) have been tested in a test setup called ‘hotbox’. The results of the performed tests show that the vertical greening systems which are calculated for determining of moisture transport (Hedera helix directly to the wall, Hedera helix indirectly to the wall and LWS based on planter boxes) have no negative influence with respect to moisture transport and condensation on the surface of the wall. It became clear that vertical greening systems on the façades in the winter cause condensation. The summer measurements show that with a normal relative humidity of about 75% the condensation cannot take place in any layer of the structure. Condensation is occurred at all measured greening systems with freezing temperatures. According to Glaser method the condensation in all cases does not exceed the limitations. This means that the absorbed moisture by the structure in the winter (60 days) should evaporate back in the summer (90 days). There is not a vapour diffusion resistance figure (µ) for greening systems in the literature and therefore it is needed to assume a vapour diffusion resistance figure (µ) for vertical greening systems to calculate the condensation. For all condensation calculations a vapour diffusion resistance figure (µ) of 1.5 is assumed for vertical greening systems, which corresponds with the regulations that (µ?1). It is important to notice that the relative humidity outdoor and indoor, vertical greening system type, outdoor and indoor temperatures play a major role in determining of condensation and vapour diffusion. Living wall systems have a more or less airtight texture and they are protecting the façade better against direct sunshine and (heavy) rains. The materials used for living wall systems can ensure that the moisture transport does not take place easily. To realize vertical greened surfaces, it is necessary to take in to account that manufacturing of for example supporting structures can have a negative environmental effect, which is in struggle with sustainability. Sustainable construction could be described as a way of designing and constructing building that support human health (physical, psychological and social) and which is in harmony with nature, both animate and inanimate. A system is sustainable when the environmental burden is lower than the environmental benefit profile. The results from the conducted life cycle analysis for living wall system based on mineral wool and living wall system based on foam substrate provide insight in the environmental impact of the studied vertical greening systems. - the LWS based on mineral wool has one of the high environmental burdens due to the materials used. The aluminium supporting structure forms largely the effect since the materials affect positively the thermal resistance of the system. - the LWS based on foam substrate has also high influence on the total environmental burden, but the foam substrate (biodegrable) itself is a sustainable product. - for the living wall system based on mineral wool and living wall system based on foam substrate in both climate types (Mediterranean and temperate) the environmental burden profile is higher than the benefits gained for heating and cooling. - both LWS based on mineral wool and LWS based on foam substrate have almost the same contribution to the energy savings for heating but, for the Mediterranean climate, a higher influence was noted for the cooling properties of the plants which are to recognise for all 6 vertical greening system tested in hotbox.","sustainability; green facades; living walls; building physics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Materials and Environment","","Sustainability","",""

(mentor)","2011","In-Situ Combustion (ISC) is a thermal enhanced oil recovery method. Therefore, air or oxygen-enriched air is injected in the reservoir. The oxygen reacts with part of the hydrocarbon forming heat and combustion products. The released heat increases the temperature locally in the reservoir and lowers the viscosity of the oil. Formed gaseous products additionally enhance the oil production due to miscible and immiscible gas drive. Although worldwide the application of ISC is limited, research on the underlying processes is extensive. In particular, discussions focus on the question whether it is better to describe oil recovery by ISC as thermal recovery method with minimal description of the occurring chemical reaction or if it is crucial to include more detailed descriptions of the occurring chemical reactions. Most ISC research focuses on the description of reaction kinetics and lacks the description of other phenomena involved, e.g. gas phase reactions, the influence of porous media and the effect of flow. The focus of this experimental study is to determine the relevance of chemical reactions in the gas phase for the success of ISC and to get a better understanding of the temperature influence on ISC. For the experiment a vertically-positioned stainless steel tube filled with a mixture of sand and oil was heated to a desired temperature. From below air was injected, oil and exhaust gases are produced from the top of the tube. The outlet gas was analysed with the help of a gas chromatograph. Liquid produced from the tube was collected and characterized with the help of refractive index analysis. The sand was retrieved after the experiment and categorized based on visual observations. Additionally, the organic content in the sand after the experiment was determined by weight loss by heating the sand gradually to 500°C. Thermal Gravity Analysis under nitrogen and air atmosphere of oil, sand and oil+sand samples was performed. The determined weight loss as function of the temperature together with the analysis of the outlet gas helped to identify the occurring chemical reactions. The experiments showed that gas phase reactions should be incorporated in the description of ISC processes. The actual gas phase combustion could not be proven unambiguous, typical ISC temperature profiles were not seen and the reactions were not self-sustaining. It was shown that reactions occur in the gas phase. For a pure component oil cracking and recombination in combination with combustion was behaving similar as the crude oil in ISC, although the temperature range for these reactions are wider for the crude oil. Initial low oil saturations have no impact on the general chemical combustion behaviour; the position of oxidation products depends on the initial saturation. At low temperature the formation of solid components was due to oxygenation and not to anaerobic cracking. Still a number of underlying processes occurring during ISC are not completely understood. In particular, the effect of pressure on the chemical reactions, on the occurrence of a gas phase and the resulting outlet gas need further investigation.","in-situ combustion; gas phase reactions; temperature; cracking; oxidation; saturation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Section Petroleum Engineering","",""

These substances are capable of storing and releasing large amounts of heat. There are several applications for PCMs, none of which have penetrated mass markets. Energy efficient and sustainable buildings are becoming an emerging trend that is likely to grow in the future, and PCMs can play an important role if properly marketed. Using diffusion of innovation and patterns of innovation approach an analysis of existing niche applications in the market adaptation phase is conducted to describe the relevant actors and explain which factors stand in the way of mass application. Several research labs, companies and start-ups have invested in technological and market development for PCMs. They would like to see the PCM applications they developed gain greater market penetration. Six factors were identified which are currently impeding the development of PCMs. These were based on review of literature and summaries of interviews. Overcoming these barriers will influence market development. These factors are Marketing and increasing awareness, Economics, Regulations, Complementary technologies, International standard, and Ease to work with. We also identify gaps in the value chain which provide potentially promising opportunities for techno-starters to enter. These opportunities are to develop a new material which will make PCMs cheaper, or deliver better benefits. Another opportunity is to develop production processes which would make it cheaper to produce PCMs, especially in encapsulated form. Also, techno-starters could develop a new product based on PCMs and bring it to the market directly. One such techno-starter, Artica Technologies, successfully introduced decentral air ventilation unit based on PCM. Their device can be used instead of or as a complement to traditional HVAC systems.","Phase Change Materials (PCMs); pattern of innovation; diffusion of innovation; techno-starter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Innovation Systems","","Technology Strategy and Entrepreneurship","",""

(mentor)","2011","Alternative energy sources, including wind energy, are often subject to scepticism. In general, society has a dual feeling about it, on the one hand the need is realised on the other hand a ‘not in my backyard‘ feeling is experienced. This combined with the ever changing attitude and approach of national and international politics, the renewable energy industry has difficulties to find its place in society. On a long term vision however the necessity of renewable energy sources is very clear since the supply of fossil fuels will, whether it is a sudden drop or a slow decline, eventually run out. The debate of which renewable energy source will eventually dominate in the long run is still ongoing. Looking back on the developments over the last decades wind energy has seen a dramatic increase in both the number of installed wind turbines and the amount of power produced by each. Wind turbine design has seen major changes developed by wind turbine manufacturers which increase the market potential by minimising the production, transportation, installation and maintenance costs. An effective way of reducing the costs of a wind turbine is to reduce the amount of material used for the production. This weight reduction could result in increased flexibility of the components which could introduce localised dynamic behaviour of the components, which in turn can lead to increased loading and wear and reduced reliability. Therefore an important aspect of the wind turbine design is adequate knowledge and prediction of its dynamic behaviour. A versatile modelling technique to determine this behaviour is that of dynamic substructuring and model reduction. The general paradigm of this technique is to divide the large and complex structure into smaller and less complex component models which are individually reduced or simplified. These reduced models are then assembled to form a model which can be used to obtain the global dynamic behaviour in a computationally efficient way. One of the difficulties often encountered using traditional reduction methods such as the Craig-Bampton and Dual Craig-Bampton methods is the accurate representation of the response to forced excitation of a component model, either via its interface or from an external force. In this thesis the modal truncation augmentation (MTA) method is proposed to overcome these limitations by augmenting the mentioned reduction methods. By doing so the reduction basis of component models are a priori enriched using special load dependent vectors. One of the more general difficulties encountered in dynamic substructuring and model reduction is to determine how to create the smallest possible reduced model which still is adequately accurate. This is determined by choosing the level of refinement of each component model. A higher level of refinement in general increases the accuracy of the model but also increases the simulation time and required storage space. To overcome these issues error estimation techniques based on a posteriori knowledge are proposed. These techniques use a conservative estimation of the error without knowledge of the exact response and can be used to determine which component models are to be refined to efficiently increase the overall accuracy. In addition to general wind turbine optimisation a trend is observed of ‘going offshore‘ where massive wind farms are installed producing large amounts of energy. This extension of the realm of wind turbines also gives rise to new engineering challenges. The structures used to support the turbines introduce a complex dynamic coupling between it and the turbine. This combined with the constant wind and wave excitation further increases the need for an accurate dynamic model. In line with this trend of going offshore an investigation is set up to apply the augmented reduction methods to the dynamic model of a jacket support structure which is attached to an 5 megawatt (MW) offshore wind turbine. By analysing the time varying wave loads applied to the jacket structure using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method, spatial force shapes are extracted and used to enrich its reduction basis with load dependent vectors. Using the same POD method, the dynamic response of this reduced model can be compared to that of the unreduced model and reduced models obtained using traditional methods. By doing so it is shown that the dynamic response using the augmented reduction methods gives improved results. In addition to this comparison the error estimation techniques are applied to the same model to test its usage in wind turbine engineering. It is shown that both the error on the dynamic response to an external harmonic load based on wave loads and the global eigensolutions can be conservatively estimated. Furthermore, the models are iteratively reduced to obtain an optimal level of refinement for each component model. This work shows that opportunities still lie in the development of a practical tool and further theoretical development of the error estimation techniques. Furthermore, combining the best of both worlds by using error estimation techniques combined with the MTA method could lead to more optimized wind turbine design, making wind energy a worthy contender in the battle for the new world energy supplier.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-11-25","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Dynamically reconfigurable architectures have demonstrated superior performance in comparison to the general-purpose processors. This thesis describes a generic approach for Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) of a reconfigurable platform, connected to a general purpose system through a high-speed interconnect. Thus, the system can dynamically install and execute hardware instances of software functions (bitstreams) on-demand. Furthermore, the thesis also serves as a starting point for accelerating multiple software functions concurrently on the hardware. To achieve DPR, system calls are inserted into the original program. The host processor of the system, thus manages the hardware reconfiguration and execution through a Linux device driver. Accelerating multiple software functions is achieved by implementing multiple accelerators on the hardware, managing their interfaces for communication, and providing memory consistency for read and write requests. To do so, the driver provides support for non-blocking execution of multiple software functions. The above system is implemented on a general purpose machine providing a Hyper Transport bus to connect a Xilinx Virtex4-100 FPGA, an AMD Opteron-244, and 1 GB of DDR main memory. The efficiency of the system is evaluated using audio processing and encryption workloads. The proposed system achieves a 12x speedup over software with audio processing workload and 13x speedup when the workloads were accelerated concurrently.","HyperTransport; dynamic partial reconfiguration; HTX; multiple accelerators; general purpose reconfigurable computing; hardware acceleration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

Did the EU reform plans indeed increase efficiency and effectiveness in Europe’s railway sectors? Israel’s railways possess a much shorter history than its European counterparts. The current organizational structure of Israel Railways presents a number of issues in adequately managing infrastructure and transport operations. Israel is interested to learn from experiences in European railway sectors if a renewed organizational structure might increase overall performance.

It was generated a simple 3D basin model. The Southern DCG experienced a strong subsidence during Kimmeridgian with tilted fault blocks forming the three most important mini Basins of this area: Rosa, Poul and Igor. There was a uniform subsidence along the entire basin during the Late Kimmeridgian while the salt structures started to form in the Salt Dome Province. A large progradational system from south to north is seen, with minor retrogradations. The subsidence rate diminished during the Volgian period and a fast regression was recorded. The Volgian is very condensed or absente in the Salt Dome Province where the salt structures pierced in a passive way. The main HC expulsion took place in the Rosa and Poul Basin. The latest Jurassic Bo Member is not the principal source rock in the Southern Central Graben because it is immature. In this area the Lower Kimmeridgian is the main oil generator. The Basin Modelling software calculates the maturity in the top surface of each package, and it was found that the HC expulsion rose up 40% of volume with the two artificial intralayers per package .

(mentor)","2011","Many firms are nowadays engaged in strategic alliances for their success and survival and are therefore determined to maintain or even increase their performance. Various strategy scholars focused on the impact of business strategies on performance; whereas network scholars examined the impact of the network position of the firm on its performance. However, there is a need to integrate both research streams to gain an in-depth insight in the strategic behaviour of firms, network position and firm performance and in how they are related to each other. This may help firms mainly operating in networks within high tech industry sectors to achieve competitive advantage over competitors. This indicates that research aimed at gaining and providing insight in how to investigate or determine if and how strategic behaviour and network position are related and influence the firm performance is needed first. The motivation for this case study research came from that need. The first objective of the research is to focus on whether insight in the strategic behaviour, network position and performance of a focal firm can be obtained from case studies; and if and how strategic behaviour and network position are related and impact the firm performance over time. The second objective is to determine and propose a comprehensive research design for future researchers who may attempt to conduct a case study research to into the possible relationships between strategic behaviour, network position and performance of the firm. To meet the research objectives, a case study approach has been undertaken. A multiple-case study design was chosen, since it allows cross-case analysis and may also enhance the validity of a study. The two sources of evidence included documents and archival records. From the preliminary analysis of available cases for the course MOT9592, two cases were selected based on the selection criteria for cases. The two cases were: (1) Apple iPod vs. Microsoft Zune; and (2) SACS vs. DVD-A. Both cases were about high tech firms within their networks, engaged in technology standards battles with competitors during the technological life cycle of a high tech product category. The aspects of strategic behaviour, network position and firm performance that had to be obtained from the case studies were established after the literature review. From the results obtained from the case studies it became evident that the research outcomes were influenced by practical difficulties, such as research approach, data limitation, bias and theory problem. Therefore the research focus shifted towards determining and proposing a comprehensive research design (research protocol, research scenario and “stylesheet”). This research design includes all recommended steps for successfully undertaking a case study research. From an academic perspective this exploratory case study research contributes to an increase in knowledge, by providing valuable insights in the core concepts strategic behaviour, network positions and firm performance and the possible relationships between those concepts. This research also has social relevance, since it determined and proposed a comprehensive research design, including a research “stylesheet”, which can be used by future researchers who may attempt to conduct a case study research to into the possible relationships between strategic behaviour, network position and performance of the firm. Nevertheless, there were also limitations in this research, which were all related to the research design. Therefore, in further research it is recommended to use the proposed research design.","strategic behaviour; network position; performance; technology life cycle; case study research; research design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-09-28","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy & Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

The foreshore rises and the wave height decreases. Subsequently the wave-induced water level setup increases. Seawalls do not erode. The waves in front of the seawall remain high throughout the storm and the wave-induced water level setup hardly changes. Over a dune-dike connection a water level gradient drives a current which transports sediment from the dunes to the seabed in front of the seawall. The loss of sediment to the dike causes the foreshore of dunes near the connection to rise slower resulting in more erosion. The amount of additional erosion near structures depends on the angle of wave incidence w.r.t. the shore. Dunes situated downstream of the connection experience a significant increases in erosion. Near the upstream connection sediment is deposited on the seabed in front of the structure. Sediment will pile up against the structure resulting in less erosion near the connection. The influence of structures on dune erosion was investigated in a series of experiments and were aimed at 4 different connections between a dune and a structure. Two configurations of dunes and structures were investigated with 2 different wave periods. In XBeach the erosion in a dike breach is a function of the breach width and the wave period. The erosion increases for a smaller breach width and an increasing wave period. XBeach underestimates the erosion above the dune revetment. The erosion in the revetment breach is predicted well. For experiments V1 & V3 the predictive capabilities of XBeach in dune sections are very good. The performance of XBeach for experiments V2 & V4 is relatively good. The effect of the wave period for 2DH models with a large depth scale (nd = 60) is not properly simulated by XBeach.","dune; dike; connection; XBeach; validation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Morphology","",""

This is achieved through an extension to the GCC compiler which in addition inserts system-calls to the device driver controlling the reconfigurable device.

They claimed that they are in need of a practical tool, which would help them to communicate better with hearing people, especially in the healthcare context. Following this claim, the iteration research team has been trying to find a practical way to deliver effective communication for Deaf people in South Africa. In the current project, the research team decided to design a communication tool for a simpler dialogue tree in the pharmacy context. As part of the team, the author combined “Vision in Product Design” and “Human Centered Design” to design feasible communication tools for the pharmacy context. Interview, storyboard, and role play were a few of the main techniques used to unfold the users’ needs and wishes. The investigation revealed that Deaf patients clearly need to understand their medication requirements from the moment it is prescribed by the doctor until the time the medicine is dispensed by the pharmacist. As Deaf people commonly use mobile phones, the communication aid named, “SignSupport v3” was designed to be stored on the phone and it will serve as a portable interpreter when the Deaf patient communicates with healthcare practitioners independently. The researcher made recommendations about the properties required to make a mobile phone an ideal tool for Deaf people in communication. Other recommendations concerning certain features, which will enhance the performance of the SignSupportv3, were also made. A message and queue notifying system was also proposed to prevent Deaf patients from missing their turns in public hospitals, as this was one of their main complaints. The evaluation of the efficiency of SignSupport v3, as stated by the Deaf people and the pharmacist, in assisting pharmaceutical communication was satisfactory. All the message outputs of the SignSupport v3 were clearly understood by the Deaf participants and they were happy to test such a product. However, there are some aspects of the product, which can be improved and some further research should be done before the communication tools will be ready to be launched.","communication tools for Deaf users; South African Deaf people; South African pharmacy context; Deaf and pharmacy context; Deaf peoples cognitions; Deaf user interface; role play; group interview; storyboard","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

With the rise of online social networks such as Twitter and Facebook, researchers got the opportunity to access the data of social behavior of millions of people, whereas in the past it was limited to hundreds of people. For these researchers and marketeers it is of great interest to find communities within these large networks, as this is one of the opportunities to see how people behave in groups on a large scale. The most common approach of analyzing community structures in online social networks is to gather the network by downloading the user profiles one by one (crawling) and afterwards partition the network into groups or communities by community detection algorithms. However, crawling an entire social network is very time consuming and analyzing the networks with community detection algorithms can be computationally expensive. To overcome these problems, in this thesis a method is proposed for crawling nodes using the community structure of a network. It enables the researcher to start the analysis before completing the crawl. This new method performs between 66% and 480% better than existing crawling techniques such as Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS), because a smaller portion of the networks has to be crawled in order to crawl entire communities. The computer-generated networks used in this thesis were created using a new network generator which uniquely combines three features; it creates networks with explicit community structure, arbitrary degree distributions and adaptable community strength.","online social networks; crawling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-09-28","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Telecommunications","",""

As one of the leading companies worldwide in juvenile products industry, Dorel wants to take its social responsibility by committing to the well being of babies and young children living in a BOP (Bottom of the pyramid) situation. The purpose of this graduation project is to investigate the life of migrant workers and the living conditions of their baby and young children in big cities in China and design a product that supports the mobility and convenience in their life with their kids in big cities. Therefore, the most important parts of this project are the field research in China and developing the final design concept. From the literature study, it shows that China is now experiencing the largest mass migration of people from the countryside to the city in history. An estimated 230 million Chinese (2010) have left the countryside and migrated to the cities in recent years. There are also 20 million children of migrant workers living in the cities with their parents. These so-called migrant children are facing the problems of lacking parental care and struggling to integrate into urban life. It also takes a lot more efforts and causes more inconvenience of the parents to work and take care of their children at the same time. Based on the literature study, a field research is done in China to get deep insights of the life of migrant families in big cities. The research lasts for one month in four cities: Beijing, Shanghai (two megacities with populations of 19.6 million and 23 million), Hangzhou (a big city with more than 8.7 million people) and Kunshan (the location of Dorel China). Five typical cases of migrant worker families’ life are analyzed on the topics of general context, daily life with children and baby stroller in use. More than 15 baby products shops are visited to get an overview of current baby stroller industry and market in China. From the case studies, it is found that self-employed families and migrant workers who rent rooms in some migrant workers community or normally communities are the most potential target group for this project because of the comparably stable condition than other migrant workers (such as manufacturing workers and construction workers). The most possible usage contexts are new workers community (so called villages next to cities), markets, hybrid communities and public transportation (seldom in bus, but once a year in average by train). An extra interesting finding is that shopping trolley is getting popular (some examples of using shopping trolley to transport kids are seen) among the target group. The outcomes of the field research are synthesized into a main design goal (Design an aspirational product in an affordable price with high performance for migrant workers who have babies (0-3 years old) to support the convenience and mobility in their daily work and life with babies in big cities, as well as enhance the parental care and comfort for the babies’ healthy growth), stakeholders needs and idea generation guidelines. A physical design guideline is listed according to the conclusion from report of Ergonomic Requirements to Car Seats and Strollers, July 2007, by Daams Ergonomie For Dorel Juvenile Group Europe. By analysing the price of a current baby stroller Quinny Buzz from Dorel, some strategies of lowering the cost is made for further conceptualization. The final concept is developed from three preliminary concepts. The design intends to make a harmonious combination among the functionality of baby stroller, shopping trolley and transporter. The main functionality as a baby stroller is emphasized by the fresh color fabric, while the shopping trolley function is indicated by the mesh material and the function of a transporter is hidden under the fabric. When the fabric part is taken away, the frame itself gives a natural indication of a transporter. Then tensioned appearance gives the consumers a high quality impression of the product. User improvisations are encouraged in the product with some detailed use cues. Different positions for the baby to sit or lie in the stroller can be realized by the telescopic system on the back frame. Different from most of the strollers on market, the stroller is using a two dimensional folding to lower the production cost but still in a compact way to be stored in the limited living space. According to the weight and cost estimation, the product is less than 5 KG and the production cost will be less than 15 euro. A working prototype is made based on the Solidworks model. In the prototype, most of the functionalities and features are demonstrated.","migrant worker; China; baby stroller; BoP; emerging market","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-09-27","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2011","The deep foreshore is the part of the cross-shore profile that is between 8 m and 20 m deep. Indications exist that this area might be deepening. In this report the long term morphological consequences of this possible trend on the sandy coast of Holland (the stretch between Hook of Holland and Den Helder, excluding artificial defences) are discussed. It is assumed that the deep foreshore is deepening at a rate of 2 cm a year. Two scenarios, representing the hypothetical situation after 50 and 100 years, namely, scenarios where the deep foreshore has deepened 1 metre respectively 2 metres, are compared to the scenario where the deep foreshore does not deepen – more or less the actual situation. Six locations, spread along the sandy coast of Holland, are subjected to calculations to determine the effect that deepening of the deep foreshore has on the sandy coast of Holland. The focus is on three morphological aspects: 1. Dune erosion and extent of area of offshore deposition of sand storm surge. The process-based DurosTA model is used for calculations. The sandy coast is subjected to a storm surge with wave heights and water levels reaching maximum design values. The calculations show that dune erosion during storm surge does not significantly increase as a result of the deepening of the deep foreshore. The area of deposition – the extent to which sand is deposited offshore during a storm surge – increases slightly due to deepening of the deep foreshore. 2. Longshore transport The impact of deepening of the deep foreshore on the Dutch coast is determined by calculating the longshore transport created by two wavetypes, that together form a couple that is representative for the morphologically relevant wave types along the sandy coast. The process-based Unibest LT model is used for calculations. The Van Rijn formulation of sediment transport is applied. Increases of longshore transport vary between 3 to 8%, depending on the waveheight and angle of incidence. The increase of longshore transport is assumed to be proportional to the increase of longshore transport gradients along the sandy coast of Holland. 3. Cross-shore transport The process-based Unibest TC model is used for the calculations. Unibest TC is capable of simulating the various processes that contribute to sediment transport such as streaming, wave asymmetry, undertow and long bound waves. Deepening of the deep foreshore leads to an overall clear seaward shift of calculated transport rates in the order of several cubic metres per year per running meter (m’) of coastline. General conclusion: altogether, these effects are limited when put into the perspective of the yearly volume of suppletions that are required now and in the future. However, they would be lasting and would endure many decades. Student: Thomas van Walsem; Graduation Committee: Prof. dr. ir. M.J.F. Stive (Delft University of Technology), ir.

(mentor)","2011","In the field of Error Correcting Coding (ECC), the concept of ''stopping set'' recently became a hot topic. A stopping set for a parity-check matrix is the set of bits which would cause the iterative decoding progress in Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) to ''stop'' when it is erased. It has already been proved in several papers that the decoding performance under iterative decoding algorithm of any linear block code in BEC is determined by their stopping set performance, in particular, their size and number. And it is commonly assumed by the coding researchers that those codes which have better stopping set performance would also perform better in other channels. In this thesis, the decoding performance of linear block codes, in particular, Hamming Codes, the original LDPC code proposed by Gallager and FG-LDPC codes is studied in Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) and Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. Three iterative decoding algorithms, respectively Bit-Flipping algorithm, Weighted Bit-Flipping algorithm and Sum Product Algorithm are used. To emphasize the influence of stopping set property, the parity-check matrix for each code is modified by adding linearly dependent rows to the original parity-check matrix, or removing rows from it. These modifications are made in order to change the stopping set property of the codes. The performance of the modified parity-check matrices is thus analyzed, by comparing them to the original ones, using both theoretical analysis and simulation. The results show that the stopping set performance of linear block codes is not a crucial factor to their performances on other channels as it is in BEC. Sometimes the linear block codes of a better stopping set property do perform better in other channels, but sometimes the performance barely changes or even degrades. More precisely, the decoding performance of a certain parity-check matrix is determined by the type of codes, the type of channel and the decoding algorithm, rather than its stopping set property.","Stopping Set; Iterative Decoding; LDPC Codes; Hamming Codes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Wireless and Mobile Communication Group","",""

(mentor); Hanssen, R.F. (mentor)","2011","Permafrost in high-arctic regions has been very much influenced by global warming. Many thousands of square kilometers of permafrost are under certain degree of thawing. Site measurements have provided useful data for researchers. However, these ground-based measurements are usually site-specific with poor spatial coverage. Here we apply Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) to measure the surface deformation over permafrost north-east Greenland during the past two periods 1995--1999 and 2006--2009 to infer permafrost behaviors. We have found a considerable rate of surface subsidence occurring with respect to a relatively stable area. Over the whole study area, during 1995--1999, we find a surface subsidence rate of 0.3--2.4 mm/yr and a seasonally varying displacement of 0.4--6.1 mm with subsidence occurring during the thawing season of each year. While in period of 2006--2009, we find the overall surface subsidence rate goes up to 0.8--2.7 mm/yr and the seasonally varying displacements increased to 2.3--7.4 mm within the thawing season. Comparing with the two periods, we find a general accelerating trend in subsidence rate of 4.5 x 102 mm/yr2, which indicates a acceleration in permafrost thawing rate. We also find a general increment in surface seasonal varying displacements of 1.9 mm, which indicates a thickening trend in the active layer. In total, by applying MT-InSAR technique over the 5000 km2 study area, we have found a permafrost area 506.1 km2 of that is under thawing and the general magnitude of permafrost thawing rate is 17.0±8.4 cm/yr during 1995--1999. During 2006--2009, we have found 633.9 km2 of permafrost area is thawing with a magnitude of thawing rate about 24.0±12.0cm/yr. We have also estimated the total volume loss of permafrost as (2.1±1.1) x 108 m2 and (3.0±1.5) x 108 m3 in each corresponding period. Further, assuming the linear relationship between the thawed permafrost and the released methane fluxes observed during 19-Jun-1997 to 18-Aug-1997 at Zackenberg valley, we apply this relationship to the whole subsidence area. We estimate the total magnitude of methane fluxes released from the study area within this period, which is about 1081.7±398.5 T.","permafrost; InSAR; Deformation; Thawing; Methane","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Mathematical Geodesy and Positioning","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Pater, C.J. (mentor)","2011","Shale gas became an important source of natural gas in the United States and is expected to contribute significantly to worldwide energy supply. This has been the main motivation for the research and development on shale gas. Shale gas is found in extremely low permeable organic rich formations that are either a source rock or a reservoir. Such formations are porous and contain gas, but have almost no matrix permeability. Shale gas reservoirs from different places have significant differences in structural environment, mineralogical composition, in depth of deposition and in the thickness of the productive layer. Besides, each of the shale gas properties vary substantially within the same producing area. The variability of shale gas properties greatly influences the well performance that should be taken into account for optimizing gas production. The focus of this thesis is to investigate the main factors influencing well performance in shale gas reservoirs: the complexity and conductivity of the fracture network, the proppant distribution within the complex fracture network, the impact of closure stress on un-propped and partially propped fracture conductivity, and finally the factor which is intrinsic to shale gas reservoirs -adsorbed gas. Based on a literature survey, the most important factors prioritized and numerical simulation models constructed for further investigation of prioritized factors. The main challenge in development of shale reservoirs is that in order to reach economically viable production it is indispensible to implement stimulation treatment, such as artificial hydraulic fractures to connect the natural fractures within the shale rock and to create pathway for gas to flow into the wellbore. Shale gas reservoirs are typically comprised of two distinct porous media: the shale matrix containing the majority of gas storage in the formation but with a very low permeability, and the fracture network with a higher permeability but low storage capacity. The gas in the fractures is produced immediately, the adsorbed gas is released as the formation pressure is drawn down by the well. The aim of this thesis work is to conduct theoretical research of the influence of above mentioned factors on well productivity, to prioritize the most crucial factors, and then numerically model them for two different real cases from shale gas reservoirs of North America, in order to investigate the effect of specific parameters on well performance, with the further prospective to model European shale gas reservoirs, as found in the Vienna basin, Northern Germany, Poland, Southern Sweden , the UK, Brabant, Netherlands.","Shale gas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Applied Earth Sciences","","Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences","",""

(mentor)","2011","Electrical grids are extremely large, highly complex and dynamic systems. The depletion of natural resources used for power generation has led to the facelift of the traditional grid system to a more efficient and smarter grid system. Smart grids aim at better energy utilization, right from generation to consumption. The electrical grid is similar to the computational grids in many ways where the issue of resource utilization has been researched upon. In a computational grid the resources are usually CPU time or storage space and the producers and consumers of the resource are the computers themselves. In an electrical grid, the resource is the electricity, a house (a neighborhood, a city, a country) can be considered as the network, the producers are generation stations & distributed sources and the consumers are the various appliances at home. In the present scenario all the appliances connected to the grid have unrestricted access to electricity, meaning that all devices can consume electricity at will. This setup on a global scale is very expensive to maintain as a high reserve capacity is required to meet the dynamic and unanticipated demand which is inefficient. In this thesis, a market based approach is proposed for efficient allocation of limited resources. The introduction of a consumption limit in the system leads to a more optimal and efficient grid which helps in load forecasting, reduction in the amount of spinning reserves and dynamic pricing. By using a combination of producer pricing policy (perfect competition and monopoly) and agent bidding strategies (prioritized bidding and budgets limits) we are able to achieve a suitable level of resource utilization and device utilization pertaining to the needs of the end consumer. By achieving a satisfactory level of operation at a household level when a consumption limit is introduced, we can achieve better resource management and stability at the higher system levels.","smart grid; continuous double auction; resource distribution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Bosch-Rekveldt, M.C.G. (mentor); Cunningham, S.W. (mentor); Van de Schuur, F. (mentor)","2011","In high-tech industries, projects play a central role in the development of new products and processes. Since these projects can be quite complex, it would be useful to look at where complexity in projects comes from and how these complexities influence these projects. The research project described in this thesis aims to increase the understanding of this topic in a company in the semiconductor industry, NXP Semiconductors. Products that are produced in the semiconductor industry play an increasingly important role in our lives. Products ranging from mobile telephones to cars to lighting are all equipped with semiconductor products and the performance of these products is steadily increasing with time. Therefore, the development of these products and the processes, which are needed to produce the products, are becoming more complex. The research project To describe the complexities that are encountered in the process engineering industry, a framework (the TOE framework, where TOE stands for Technical, Organizational and External) was developed earlier. The TOE framework consists of 47 elements (which are categorized into the three aforementioned categories) that describe aspects that can contribute to a project’s complexity. To understand the complexities that are encountered in the semiconductor industry, this research project has applied the TOE framework to this industry. The goal of this research project is twofold: firstly, it aims to understand where complexities in projects in the semiconductor industry come from; secondly, it would be useful for the company if the company would be able to understand which complexities could play a role in a future project and this could be used to come with the right measures to cope with these complexities. The main research question that this research project aims to answer is: What benefits does the application of the TOE framework provide for projects at NXP? This question is answered by doing a combination of desk research and case studies on projects in the company. In the desk research phase, the current practice related to development projects at NXP is investigated and a tool is described that calculates the design complexity of a new product design: Numetrics. Case studies To understand what complexities play a role in NXP projects, 16 projects have been investigated. The projects that are studied are from a wide variety of departments within NXP, but all projects (except for one) involve development of a new product or process. From each project, one person (the project manager) was interviewed. During the interviews, these project managers were asked to explain what the project entailed, which complexities were encountered during the projects, what influence these complexities had on the project and how the project managers coped with the complexities. The project managers were asked to indicate too which degree the complexities in the TOE were applicable to the project and if any complexities were missing in the framework. The complexities in the TOE framework that scored highest on the TOE scoring list are: - Involvement of different technical disciplines - Technical risks - High project schedule drive - Level of competition These high scoring complexities reflect the image that development projects in the semiconductor industry require multidisciplinary teams, that technical risks are often high (since it is not always known whether certain solutions will provide the required functionality), that there is high drive to develop new products quickly and that there is a high level of competition on the market. Next to the complexities that are directly related to the TOE framework, interviewees were also asked to share their views and experiences with the Numetrics system. A number of observations and recommendations with respect to this system are presented in this thesis. Adaptation and application of TOE From the original TOE framework, five elements were considered to be not applicable to the projects by the interviewees. These elements are not present the adapted version of the TOE framework for use at NXP. The interviewees also indicated that a number of complexities were missing or not precisely enough described in the TOE framework. In total 13 elements are added to the existing framework (4 technical, 5 organizational and 4 external elements). These adaptations lead to a new version of the TOE framework, that is modified to meet the situation at NXP. A preliminary version of a score chart is made, on which a project manager can indicate which complexities could be present in a project that is under planning. However, further research would be needed to successfully implement the application of TOE in practice. A possible way of applying TOE would be to use a similar approach that is taken by Numetrics – a tool that is currently being used at NXP to assess the design complexity of product developments. Since the relevance of Numetrics is limited to product development projects, the TOE approach would have an added value by also addressing other types of projects, such as process developments. Next to the version of TOE that is adapted to meet the needs of NXP, a suggestion is made for the inclusion of four new elements, which were the result of the case studies that were performed in this research project. Conclusions The research project shows that the possible application of the TOE framework could have benefits for NXP. As the case studies show, complexities can have a large influence on the project’s execution and success. Therefore, a tool that can assess the complexity and sources of complexity of multiple types of (development) projects would be of value to the company. Recommendations Towards the company, a number of recommendations are given. Firstly, although the BCaM framework is of much value to the company, one of the outcomes of the interviews was that the time between gates can be quite long. This can have a negative effect on the focus in the project team and including more steps into the system would increase the focus in the team. Secondly, we believe that the implementation of TOE in the planning phase of projects can add value by giving the project manager insight into the types of complexities that are expected to be encountered in the project under planning.","semiconductor industry; projects; project management; complexity; case study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-10-27","Technology, Policy and Management","Delft Centre for Project Management","","Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","",""

(mentor); Marchau, V.A.W.J. (mentor); Hoogendoorn, R.G. (mentor)","2011","In the past, several field studies have proven the technological feasibility of ISA-systems. Most of these studies used warning or assisting ISA-systems to influence drivers. Until now, studies that focused on a restricting (closed) method have only been executed on relatively small testing areas with slow speed zones. This report presents the results of a field test with restricting ISA on public roads with multiple speed zones. During a period of 3 weeks, 10 taxis used a system that is referred to as Context Aware Intelligent Speed Adaptation (CAISA). The system matched the vehicles’ maximum speeds to legislated speeds of the roads they were driving on. Additionally, vehicles were limited in the maximum amount of revolutions per gear. The objective of this report is to gain insight into the acceptance, commercial application and map updating possibilities of CAISA. In order to do so, driving behaviour, in terms of acceleration and speeding, of 18 chauffeurs was monitored. The test results indicate that CAISA generally leads to slower accelerations. A comparison between the logged speed before and after the installation of CAISA showed that the system can reduce the amount of speeding-kilometres with at least 18[%]. The acceptance, safety and impact on driving behaviour of CAISA were determined by means of a questionnaire that was filled out by the participants before and after the field test. Although the sample group was too small to provide statistically significant conclusions, the results of the research indicate that the acceptance of CAISA under taxi drivers is low. After the trial, acceptance decreased even further. According to the subjective opinion of chauffeurs, CAISA decreases traffic safety, whereas the objective results of the field test indicate that CAISA improves traffic safety. Chauffeurs indicate that CAISA enforces slower acceleration, less use of the gas pedal, less breaking and a lower average speed. The economic feasibility of CAISA was determined by calculating the profitability based on the determined fuel savings. CAISA proved to be profitable if a vehicle drives more than 91,287 [km/year]. Under the experimental conditions CAISA decreased the fuel consumptions by 6.24[%]. Vehicles that experienced only engine revolution limitation saved 14.25[%]. However, theoretically an enforced maximum speed is not likely to cause extra fuel usage. The collected data show a change in gear switching behaviour when CAISA was active. This could provide an explanation for the found differences. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis. An analysis of the involved stakeholders, available techniques and a set of predefined criteria led to the conclusion that currently digital speed maps could best be updated by an independent low-tech process. The system that was considered most suited to be implemented has got the following features: ‘Collection of legislated speeds through manually driven GPS-cars’, ‘determination of a vehicles position by making use of inexpensive GPS-receivers’ and ‘map updating through location based WIFI’. The results of this experiment can be regarded as a proof that CAISA is technologically feasible on a local scale, without the support of costly (inter)nationally-coordinated systems.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Van Dobbelsteen, J.J. (mentor); Van Gerwen, D. (mentor)","2011","Purpose: An accurate needle or catheter placement is essential for the success of many procedures like regional anesthesia or biopsy taking. The accuracy of the needle or catheter placement could be increased by application of a rotational motion, which reduces the tissue indentation and required insertion force. Materials and methods: A catheter (5F/1.67 mm Pig angiographic, Boston Scientific) was pulled through muscle tissue (pork tenderloin) over a distance of 125 mm in directions parallel or perpendicular to the muscle fibers. Insertion velocities of 1, 10 and 50 mm/s were applied in combination with 0,114 and 572 RPM. The friction force between the tissue and catheter was measured by the use of a force sensor (Futek Lsb200, 2.5 N). In total 576 measurements were obtained using 16 tissue samples. Results: The results show that the fiber orientation has no effect on the amount of friction. Also the insertion velocity on its own has little effect on the steady friction force. However, a higher insertion velocity normally result in higher maximum insertion force. An increased rotational velocity normally results in a reduced maximum. The steady insertion force is reduced when the tangential velocity is higher than the insertion velocity. A larger ratio results in a lower amount of friction. Conclusion: We conclude that friction forces between instrument and tissue can be reduced by application of a rotational. Hence, rotation of needles and catheters might reduce the effect of indentation and tissue movements and therefore increase the precision of needle or catheter placement.","friction; catheters; needles; fiber orientation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-11-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Bio","","BME","",""

Third, the humid and hot climate makes crops perish fast and other off-grid forms of cooling with evaporation unsuccessful. The specific choice of West-Bengal was also dependent on the location of a viable partner for the research, which was found in ONergy in Calcutta. To further specify the research question, from literature review and case studies the assumption was made that a product service system was needed to effectively implement the product in the market. This was because low-income (BoP) people that have little to spend might need personal economic value creation by buying the product to be able to afford it. What further came out, was that affordability and desirability was something different: a study into what people actually wanted to spend their scarce money on was also needed. All of this was summarized into the graduation assignment: Develop a locally valued product service system and supply chain for the Solarbear cooling technology in rural West Bengal, India. In seven weeks of local research seven potential target groups with value chains were identified, of which two were chosen for further concept development. In contrary to initial assumptions there was a direct demand for domestic fridges without having to set up income generation around it, and this was in fact a very attractive market. The other chosen group was small farmers, typically owning 0,5 to 1,5 hectares of land and producing different kinds of crops. Because of the lack of cooling now 30% of harvests perish because of lack of cold storage. Furthermore they are dependent on the prices offered by middlemen on the day of harvest, which makes them vulnerable to low prices and lacking a good bargaining position. Since from the on-site research also appeared that products have to be thoroughly tested with the users, it was chosen to develop both systems up to the level they could be technologically developed further and prepared for pilot testing. As a result a modular system came out of which parts will be produced in a factory and installed locally by the micro entrepreneurs that will be trained by ONergy, the local distributor. The modular system consists of a vacuum collector for on the roof, a pipe to connect collector and the rest of the system, and the cooling system itself. For the domestic fridge the refrigerator room consists of an existing fridge housing with a bigger condenser and evaporator built in. For the cold storage room the same collector and condenser and evaporators are used, but the amount will vary and the room will be built according to the required volume. A local installer will build it with the locally used clay walls but build an extra isolated cold chamber within with Styrofoam boards. The investment needed for this installation will come from a microloan with micro finance partner VSSU. By enabling people to have personal access to cooling, their quality of life will change, whether it be in health, time use or increase of income. The mission of the Solarbear is therefore bringing personal cooling to the base of the pyramid. Recommendations are to develop the product according to the requirements and start early field trials as soon as possible. When successfully developed, a pilot can be set up in Lakshmikantapur using VSSU facilities for warehousing and repairing. After evaluation sales can start with promotion campaigns and by training micro-entrepreneurs together with ONergy.","Product Service System; BoP; India; Solar refrigeration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2011","Automatic analysis of facial expressions is a complex area of pattern recognition and computer vision with many un- resolved problems, one of which is the distinction between posed and spontaneous expressions of emotions. Previous psychology research indicates that the temporal dynamics in the face are essential for distinguishing between posed and spontaneous smiles. There are six temporal characteristics which are important: morphology, apex overlap, symmetry, total duration, speed of onset and speed of offset. In this work, we propose to distinguish between posed and spon- taneous expressions by using Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) to model the temporal dynamics. The DBN provides a suitable framework to represent probabilistic relationships between and within the various types of temporal dynamics. Based on the temporal phases of four different Action Units (onset, apex offset and neutral of facial actions) and the six temporal characteristics from the psychology research, we build several DBN models to distinguish between posed and spontaneous expressions. We present experimental results from 50 videos displaying posed and spontaneous smiles. When the DBNs trained on the temporal characteristics are combined to provide a joint classification, we attain an AUC of 0.97.","dynamic bayesian networks; facial expression recognition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","In this work we developed a numerical model for channel flow on a pore or micro scale. A straight channel was simulated with a flow regime of Re=0.03 and Re=0.3 (comparable to typical fluid flow in petroleum reservoirs) to visualize the characteristics of flow and dispersion up to the Fickian limit. The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of the dilute assumption on the channel averaged longitudinal dispersion of glycerol in water flow and to qualitatively assess the specific contribution of the diffusion, viscosity and density of the solute. In all cases a mixture with a concentration of 200 mol/m3 solute was injected into the channel. The ideal tracer flow model was verified by comparing it to theory. A literature study on the properties of glycerol-water mixtures was done to incorporate the correct property behaviour for variable glycerol concentration. In addition, the creeping flow assumption was tested. Detailed analysis of the changes in flow velocity components and concentration distribution was performed. The dilute, non-dilute and creeping flow models have also been tested and analysed for a tenfold increased velocity. For the base model (with Re=0.03), diffusion showed to be the main contributor to a different dispersive behaviour, followed by viscosity and density respectively. Viscosity and density variability caused changes in the velocity profiles of the flow. Longitudinal dispersion appeared to be 0.35% higher when all variability was included, compared to an ideal tracer flow simulation. Higher flow velocity (Re=0.3) appears to increase the dispersion differences, mainly caused by viscosity variability.","dispersion; channel; glycerol; water; dilute; pore scale","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Petroleum Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","The frequency synthesizer, which functions as a local oscillator, is a critical block in the transceiver. It needs to meet very stringent specifications and consume as less power as possible. Design of a traditional charge-pump PLL as the frequency synthesizer in the advanced CMOS technologies in the transceiver of advanced communication systems proves to be not an easy work and is becoming difficult due to the supply shrink. The ADPLL system, which defines every essential block with digital interface, proves to be an excellent alternative. This thesis deals with the system level design of ADPLL for the WiMAX standard. The architecture of the ADPLL is presented, with the functional illustration for every building block, like DCO and TDC. The ADPLL system is modeled and described in Cadence using Verilog-AMS/Verilog. The performance of the system is analyzed in s-domain. Some advanced algorithms have been applied to the ADPLL system. The spur mechanism in the near-integer N cases is proposed and verified. The phase rotation algorithm and the FREF dithering algorithm have been adopted to effectively suppress these spurs. The top level issues of ADPLL are tackled, with emphasis on the test plan and the operation modes of the system. The behavior level simulation results of the system are presented and the performance summary is given. The transistor level design of a basic DPA is presented. The layout for the important blocks is done and the practical concerns of the DPA design are discussed.

(mentor); Mink, A. (mentor)","2011","Menstruations are surrounded by taboo in Indian society. The taboo is caused by the religious credence (Hindu, Muslim and Christian) that the woman is considered to be impure and cursed by God during those days. This belief has over time affected the culture in perceiving this natural event as something dirty and contaminated. Therefore, women, in the current rural Indian society, follow certain restrictions while having their period, such as avoiding: to cook, to bring water, to attend religious practices, to touch and to be touched. These restrictions are not the only consequences of Indian rural society’s belief about menstruations, in fact there are other connected effects. The biggest one is women’s shyness about the topic, and especially about menstrual symptoms. Their reluctance to discuss the event because of uncomfortable surroundings lead to issues, such as lack of education and lack of knowledge about their own body. In fact Instead of visiting a doctor when a symptom persists, the women prefer to wait for it to cure itself. This is done even if they do not know how to handle the symptom or judge the seriousness of it. The current product used by rural Indian women while having menstruations is a cotton cloth, folded and kept for few hours. After usage the cloth is washed separately and left to dry either hidden below dupattas or placed on the roof of the house. Using the cloth has two main problems: the lack of running water and proper drying. These conditions make the cloth become unhygienic for being worn and being in contact with the private and delicate parts of the female body. The cloth’s material aggravates the situation because it creates bruises due to its texture and does not prevent leaking since it has a low absorptive capacity. The result has two consequences: on women’s health conditions, because it is proved that the use of cloth facilitates the development of vaginal inconveniences and on social conditions, because the women are restricted to their domestic walls in order to change the cloth often to avoid leaking. The sanitary napkin is a known product but not pervasively adopted, because of many reasons: its high price (a package costs between 35 and 55 Indian rupees), the explicit packaging, the lack of compatibility to users who do not wear undergarments and the gender of the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper of the store where the item is usually available is always a man which does not match with the taboo related to the topic. These are the starting points of this graduation project, which took place in Vadodara (India) with the collaboration and support of Deepak Foundation. In order to achieve solutions to solve the issues listed earlier, a user and a context research has been conducted in loco, the definition of the concepts has been achieved through user participatory design, the evaluation at the end has been done by either stakeholders’ and users on prototypes of the solutions. The graduation project solves the problem related to the lack of education by raising awareness about vaginal symptoms. The goal is achieved through an educative game, played by women with an audience of adolescents. The game’s main subject is the divulgence of knowledge about the most common symptoms related to menstruation. Due to the dynamics of the game the women are led to discuss, share their own opinions and gain new knowledge about the symptoms. In addition to the group approach, there is a personal tool giving the same information of the game. This personal tool allows each woman to have a more direct and private approach to the educative material. The graduation project also optimizes the life cycle of the sanitary napkin, in order to propose to the customers a more fitting product to the Indian context and culture. Among the phases of the sanitary napkin life cycle, the information and promotion, the packaging and the product (with a focus on offering a solution for those users who do not wear undergarments) are developed as a complete redesign. The distribution, the making and the disposing are elaborated as further recommendations. The information and promotion shows the comparison between the use of cloth and sanitary napkin, underlining the positive aspects on a health and social level of the latter one. As the packaging has no direct link with menstruations, it offers a discreet way for carrying it in the village, without feeling ashamed. The product gives the right to users who do not wear undergarments to adopt a sanitary napkin, having the comfort and the confidence of moving, with no fear of losing the product and leaking. The educative game and the sanitary napkin life cycle optimization empower rural Indian women by creating awareness about their own health through learning while having fun, and by improving their physical wellness and mobility.","menstruations; rural; India","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Amongst the reasons for this failure are a lack of end-user involvement, communication problems and insufficient validation and iteration of requirements. In this thesis, a new model has been designed by using a set of argu- ments and requirements that was derived from current methods and models. This model uses both a structured, goal driven, and unstructured, demand driven, method to elicit information requirements. The requirements meth- ods that are incorporated into the model complement each other. Extensive prototyping and iteration is included in the model to validate the set of re- quirements. The process that is supported by the model is focussed on communication, transparency and stakeholder involvement. The proposed model was validated by performing a case study at De Bi- jenkorf e-commerce department. The case study confirms the need for user involvement, communication and validation in the early phase of the busi- ness intelligence development lifecycle. The model has shown the ability to support stakeholders in the collection and analysis of a correct set of requirements of sufficient quality. The model can be further developed by adding project management and documentation to get more transparency and to reduce complexity with regard to the process.","information requirements; business intelligence; requirements analysis; analytics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-10-11","Technology, Policy and Management","ICT","","ICT/Business Intelligence","",""

(mentor); Christiaans, H.H.C.M. (mentor)","2011","Energy is considered by the United Nations as central to sustainable development and poverty reduction affecting all its aspects - social, economic, and environmental - including livelihoods, access to water, agricultural productivity, health, population levels, education, and gender-related issues. As such, energy can be seen as a positive stimulus for sustainable development. However, it is expected that the world population will increase from 6 billion to 9 billion people in 2025. In parallel, a large part of the world population is moving from poverty to middle class. This combination of an increase of population and income may lead to a remarkable rise in purchase of consumer electronic products and consequently energy consumption. If changing efforts are not taken, the increase in residential energy consumption in emerging economies will bring the world to severe environmental and social problems such as greenhouse effect, lack of access to affordable energy resources and air pollution. If kept the usual track for growth, the environmental or economic crisis is still to come. To have a numerical reference, Lomborg (2007) states that the developing world that now responds annually for about 40% the global carbon emissions, is likely produce 75% by the end of the century. The main question addressed by this research project is “How to reduce the energy consumption of consumer products by residential consumers in emerging economies by means of product alterations (hardware) and change in consumer behaviour (software)”. From this perspective at first instance for BRICs, exemplified by Brazil and China (large emerging market economies), a literature research was carried out after the current and expected increase of residential energy consumption. In parallel, present actions to reduce energy consumption were mapped and critically analysed. The final outcome is a strategic conceptual framework that integrate the actors and drivers of consumption to design energy efficient products in promotion of energy efficient (hardware) and contextualized behaviour (software) in order to reduce residential electricity consumption in emerging economies.","Design for Sustainability; Emerging Market Economies; Energy Consumption; Electricity Consumption; Strategic Design Framework; Brazil; China; Hardware; Software; Behavior; Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2011","Planar scaling of semiconductor ICs for achieving higher integration seems to be on the brink of saturation. As an alternative solution, three-dimensional (3D) integration follows a more than Moore strategy in which circuit layers are stacked vertically. Although, 3D integration technology has moved from Lab to Fab, a complete supply chain is yet to fall in place. Due to the lack of a fully automated 3D IC design flow, realistic performance estimation at an early stage becomes imperative to ensure an efficient end-to-end design cycle. In this paper, an approach is shown for early performance and cost estimation of a 3D stacked IC in order to allow critical technology parameters to influence system design decisions. A novel methodology is proposed which explores Through-Silicon-Via (TSV) placement topologies for a 2-tier vertical interconnect across two performance corners of the TSV technology. It estimates electrical performance and TSV area penalty which are then translated to system design metrics. The methodology is applicable to digital ICs and offers flexibility in selection of the CMOS technology node and the 3D stacking granularity. Its implementation in SystemC efficiently achieves parameterizability and enables its integration into a high-level system simulation framework. By applying the methodology to a case of a 7-port 3D router it was found that, the most preferred TSV placement topology in terms of performance and cost is Isolated for 45 nm technology node and Shielded for 32 nm technology node.","3D IC; TSV; SystemC; simulation methodology; interconnect topology; 3D chip stacking; TSV modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-09-24","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Circuits and Systems","","Microelectronics","",""

By focusing on domain concepts, there is a little need to care about non-essential details during software development process. One non-essential aspect that developers are mostly willing to dispose of is a target platform on which the application is to be executed. Ideally, the task of porting a software system to different platforms should be completely hidden from the developer’s point of view. Consequently, the DSL compiler is responsible for generating codes in different target languages that are compatible with different platforms. This problem is known as DSL re-targetability. The goal of this thesis is to explore DSL re-targetability challenges to find out how the characteristics of a DSL associated with the target platform can determine the degree of portability. To achieve this goal, mobl (a DSL for mobile web applications) has been chosen as a source DSL. As a new target platform for mobl, iOS native applications especially for iPad have been selected. Afterwards, a compiler to transform mobl to Objective-C (which is Apple recommended programming language to develop iOS applications) has been designed and implemented. Now, a great number of applications written in mobl for web backend can be compiled to Objective-C backend with minimal changes in their source code. The resulting iOS applications meet the iPad applications standards suggested by Apple. However, to have real iPad style applications, some adjustments in the source code are recommended.","DSL; Re-targetability; mobl","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Engineering","","Computer Science","",""

Case study: Togo","Rutten, G.L.","Van Paassen, L.A. (mentor)","2011","Beachrocks are lithified coastal sedimentary formations which form inside the beach body on short time scales, possibly within a year. Beachrocks can play an important role in the evolution of a shoreline as they fix the normally loose sediments. On the other hand, the evolution of a shoreline could play an important role in the genesis of beachrock and their preservation. A better understanding of these interactions will aid their use in science, to understand their genesis and to reconstruct paleo-climates. The knowledge derived is also useful for coastal engineering practice, to evaluate the response of a coastline to beachrock exposure. This study evaluated the interactions between beachrocks and shoreline evolution both from a theoretical point of view as well as in a practical case study in Togo, West Africa. In the theoretical review, the variability of shore and shoreline has been related to the diagenetic environment of a beachrock. Furthermore, existing literature was reviewed in order to assess the existing knowledge on shoreline response to the exposure of beachrock. A 2-month field campaign was carried out in Togo to gather data on beachrock characteristics and shoreline development. Finally, a synthesis was made of the theoretical findings and the results of the field campaign. The process of beachrock genesis and the controls on this process are not fully clear. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed but cannot be confirmed for all reported occurrences of beachrock. It is thus likely that no single process is responsible for the formation of beachrock. The availability of carbonate and the temperature of the beach water are likely to be among the controls on beachrock formation. It has been proposed that the stability of a beach is another control, as agitation of beach particles would not allow cementation to develop. This proposition does however not properly consider the variability of shore and shoreline. The results show that short term variations of shore and shoreline (hours to decades) are likely to be a control on beachrock genesis. The variability of the diagenetic environment related to these variations determines the cementation characteristics of beachrock. Shoreline variations thus determine the diagenetic history of a beachrock, which in turn influences the rock mass properties of the beachrock. Longer term trends in shoreline evolution are probably not linked to the genesis of beachrock, thus limiting its paleo-environmental significance. This theoretically derived conclusion needs to be confirmed by further more detailed investigation in the field. The analysis of shoreline variability related to beachrock genesis can be used to further evaluate the different mechanisms of formation that have been proposed. Analysis of weathering patterns can be the next step in increasing the paleo-environmental significance of beachrock formations. In the case study of Togo, the impact of a very large outcrop of beachrocks on shoreline evolution was investigated, by defining an approach that could be applied in similar cases. The beachrock in Togo can be divided into two formations: a main formation which shows high continuity and strength, and effectively blocks cross-shore sediment transport along major parts of the coast of Togo. Another less profound formation is found adjacent to the main formation. The beachrock in Togo fulfills a role similar to hard engineered structures which are often used in coastal engineering to protect sandy coastlines. The placement of these engineered structures in the nearshore zone triggers a certain response that is adequately understood and can be predicted using modeling software or engineering guidelines. The retreat of a sandy coastline with buried discontinuous beachrock formations poses difficult questions that have not yet been accounted for in science. The complex coupling between sediment transport and hydrodynamic conditions in the nearshore zone is not well understood, and the activation of non-erodible elements inside or as a continuous part of beaches has received only minor attention. Furthermore, beachrocks differ fundamentally from engineered hard structures as they exhibit a large natural variation in cementation characteristics and thus rock mass properties. Whereas for engineered structures the mechanical properties are known and can be used to calculate the life time of the structure, for beachrock a more thorough understanding of the genesis needs to be developed. The dominant mode of weathering of the main formation appears to be undercutting by scouring around the seaward base of the beachrock. The response of a retreating sandy coast to buried beachrock formations can be qualitatively analyzed using the Phased Retreat Model presented in this study. This model uses equilibrium shoreline profiles to determine different phases in the process of retreat. Longshore processes play a dominant role in the retreat of a coast behind a beachrock barrier. Starting from locations where the beachrock barrier has been breached, erosion landward of the beachrock travels in the opposite direction of the longshore current seaward of the beachrock. The Phased Retreat Model can be used to further analyze and predict shoreline development along the coast of Togo. Using a more data-driven analysis and by investing in structural solutions. the Togolese government can upgrade their shoreline protection policy to the philosophy of Integrated Coastal Zone Management. Furthermore, the presented model could be used in similar cases elsewhere. Lastly, the Togo case can be used for further generic research on morphodynamic response to barriers in the near-shore zone.","beachrock; coastal geomorphology; togo; bight of benin; coastal erosion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-03-14","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

(mentor); Herder, J.L. (mentor); Tolou, N. (mentor)","2011","This paper presents the first zero stiffness six degrees of freedom (DoF) compliant precision stage. To deal with problems like backlash, friction and lubrication for performing ultra-precise positioning in a vacuum environment, a novel compliant structure is proposed. All six degrees of freedom are statically balanced (i.e. near zero stiffness) to balance the gravity force and cancel out the stiffness due to the compliant design of the structure. Cooperative action of post-buckling behavior of bi-stable beams and constant stiffness of v-shaped beams, arranged in three units in a triangular configuration, are proposed for out-of-the-horizontal-plane motions. The in-plane motions are achieved by three flexible rods loaded near their buckling load. An investigation on adjusting the design parameters to minimize the residual actuation force is also performed. A prototype was manufactured and finite element modeling was performed to evaluate the concept. Experimental evaluation showed that the design is successful: for the case study a gravity force of 34.4N was balanced with a residual stiffness of 1.75N/mm in a domain of 2mm for the out-of-plane translation, while the out-of-plane rotational stiffness was less than 18.5Nm/rad, caused by parasitic torsion of the bi-stable beams and v-shaped beams. The stiffness for in-plane translations and rotation was 0.4N/mm and 2Nm/rad, respectively. Near zero stiffness 6DoF positioning can thus be achieved. The novel mechanism or the principle may be extensively applied in several applications in precision engineering or in other relevant fields, such as vibration isolation.","zero stiffness; six degrees of freedom; precision stage; gravity equilibrator; static balancing; compliant mechanism; flexible structure; vibration isolation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

The VPP-controller stabilises the torso by applying a hip torque such that the Ground Reaction Force (GRF) is directed at a fixed point on the torso. The objective of this simulation study is to compare the performance of the VPP-controller against the PD-controller. Performance is quantified by the maximum allowable disturbance for which the simulation model can continue running. Computationally demanding simulations are performed on a simple running model and accurate results are acquired on a realistic running model. Results show that PD control outperforms VPP control in all tested situations.

(mentor); Mooi, H. (mentor); Cunningham, S. (mentor)","2011","Project portfolio management is the act of maintaining control over a variety of projects, balancing conflicting requirements of projects, and coordinate the portfolio to ensure optimal organizational benefits. It is a manner for companies to analyse and manage a group of projects to harvest benefits that would not be available if projects are managed individually. One of the problems identified in project portfolio management is the alignment of projects with the business strategy of a firm. Project portfolio management still lacks coordination of the portfolio and link this portfolio to the strategy. This study will investigate the problem of a missing link between projects and business strategy. The aim of this study is to explore the conceptual link between business strategy and projects in project portfolio management in practice. This conceptual link will include managerial tasks such as project selection, project steering, project assessment, and project prioritisation. This study raises a challenging research question: To what extent do multi-project based organisations realise their business strategies through project portfolio management? The overall goal of this study is to explore a better understanding of where project portfolio management currently stands within organisations with respect to realising their business strategies. To achieve this goal and answer the research question, five research objectives are formulated. A literature review was then conducted for better understanding of obstacles, pitfalls, challenges, and recommended improvements for project portfolio management. Based on these findings, this study develops an analytical framework where strategy realisation function as the core variable of project portfolio management. Around this core variable, a portfolio establishment variable and a portfolio steering variable is designed as well. The foundations of project management is also included in this framework, but does not function as a core variable in project portfolio management in this research. The core variables strategy realisation and foundations of PM are both connected with business success. In the design of this framework, it is proposed that the relations between these variables are positively related. Proposition 1 and 2 assumed a positive relation between portfolio establishment with strategy realisation, and portfolio steering with strategy realisation. Proposition 3 assumed a positive relation between strategy realisation with business success, and proposition 4 assumed a positive relation between foundations of PPM with business success. To test the validity of this framework, a survey is developed to collect quantitative data from the current practice of project portfolio management. The instrument in this survey is a comprehensive questionnaire. It covers aspects and factors that are considered as relevant for strategy realisation in PPM i.e. selection, assessment, prioritisation, monitoring, evaluating, and steering of projects. The outcome of this survey is a sample size of 35 organisations in four different industries from different backgrounds. The result from descriptive statistical analyses indicate that the collected sample scored an average of 3.46 out of 5 points for their practice of project portfolio management. It is also evident that several essential aspects in the questionnaire scored remarkably low. This shows that the current practice of project portfolio management - in the context of strategy realisation - is not performing as good as the score indicates. This analysis made clear that the current practice indeed recognises the link between business strategy and projects, and optimal realisation of this link in practice has not been achieved yet. Structural equation modelling analysis ascertain that the relations between portfolio establishment with strategy realisation, portfolio steering with strategy realisation, and strategy realisation with business success are significant positive. Remarkably is that the relation between foundations of PM with business success is insignificant. The model fit indices of this analysis show that the fit of the framework and the data can still be improved substantially. With these results, proposition 1, 2, and 3 are supported in the framework, and proposition 4 has been declined. Correlation analysis depicts several correlations between questions addressing strategy realisation. These correlations confirms again the recognition of a link between strategy and essential processes in portfolio establishment and portfolio steering. A regression analysis of strategy realisation with individual questions of portfolio establishment and portfolio steering confirms there is a ‘good’ fit between these variables and the collected data. It is concluded that the current practice of portfolio establishment indeed applies mechanisms and methodologies for initial aligning and screening of potential projects. Business case assessment happens according to standardised methods, and organisations do consider their strategy on regular basis when accepting a project. Portfolio steering in the current practice still lacks specific methods or procedures for monitoring and assessing deviations of objectives in projects. Current practice also indicate that business strategies are communicated and translated to projects in a good rate. As for their current project management business, the majority of the sample is familiar with project management tools and possesses sufficient project expertise. With this conclusion, the research question has been explored. It can be questioned whether this extent of the current practice is true. What can be concluded with high certainty is that at least there is definitely an awareness of the link between strategy and projects in project portfolio management. The proposed framework is an attempt to simplify and organise strategy realisation in project portfolio management. The framework leaves the choice to the decision-makers and business leaders for any implementation of specific aspects or factors into their organisation. The framework is still in conceptual development and can form a basis for further development of aligning projects with strategy in project portfolio management. The general managerial implications are mainly focused on more development in portfolio establishment and portfolio steering. All levels of management should agree on the importance of strategy realisation in project portfolio management, and provide the right person with the right authority to run their portfolio. Tight and clear communication will generate valuable information that helps the management of a portfolio. One major remark is that there needs more in-depth research on project management itself when it is included in the process of project portfolio management. Nevertheless, this study bears some limitations. Due to the small sample size, the current finding cannot be generalised for a larger practice. There is also a potential bias in the data, since respondents do not want to put their business in a negative light and have the urge to respond more positively. The reliability of the survey is also questionable, since it targeted a large diversity or organisations with different goals and objectives of doing project portfolio management.","project portfolio management; strategy realisation; strategy implementation in projects; multi-project management; framework in portfolio management; portfolio management; strategy alignment with projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Project Management","","TSE","",""

These small satellites, with sizes of about a milk carton, are easy to build and much more adordable, promising great advantages for future space missions. Up until today no reliable mid-resolution Earth observation instrument has been build that can be operated on such a small, low cost satellite. In light of these events this years Design Synthesis Exercise group 9 developed such a camera system which is called the Advanced Nano Telescope (ANT) providing a novel instrument that can be carried as payload by nanosatellites. The novelty lies in the applied principles of miniaturization and intelligent distribution in order to compete with a single large scale instrument. The strength of the instrument developed lies in the fact that it can take images with 7.5 meter resolution, requiring a volume of only 10 x 10 x 15 cm at an estimated cost about EUR 100,000. The small dimensions allow it to ft into half a standard 3 unit CubeSat such as the Delfi-n3Xt. The resolution is achieved by limiting the system to sense a narrow band around a single color, making use of a well designed combination of lenses and mirrors folding the light path enabling a long focal length. The thermo-mechanical design is designed such that the instrument functions in the hostile space environment from altitudes of 540 to 1440 km altitude. ANT has a smart modular structure that allows a mission designer to simply purchase the instrument and plug it into a satellite. Since all required electronic components are already present in the instrument the host satellite only needs to provide power and pointing capability to be able to achieve a fully functional system. One ANT by itself can take mid-resolution mono-chromatic images, but its real value will show when it is launched in a constellation, something which the low cost per unit allows. Multiple constellations of ANT's can outperform single satellites systems with similar ground resolutions in terms of development time, construction costs, operating costs and revisit time, enabling color composite imagery and promising improved availability at a lower price per image. Furthermore dedicated relay satellites can be added to achieve higher data rates. Overall catastrophic failures are eliminated as multiple satellites performing independent tasks are present offering redundancy and the possibility of replacement. The conclusion is that the system developed holds a promising future with a wide range of possible applications. The instrument itself is striking due to its apparently simple but intelligent and robust design enabling Earth observation without the need of expensive large scale satellites. For future work it is recommended to further develop the concept in order to prototype and test the actual performance of the ANT instrument.","telescope; miniaturization; nano; mono-chromatic; satellite; nanosatellite","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2014-02-06","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Bachelor Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Silvester, S. (mentor)","2011","This Integrated Product Design master thesis comprises a report of the process of designing a water transport hub concept for Stadshavens Rotterdam, based on the experience of travel and transfer. It was executed for Gemeentewerken Rotterdam. ASSIGNMENT The inital assignment was to create a ‘climate-neutral transport hub’ for the future Stadshavens: a new city centre district around the Maas with sustainable, high end working and living facilities. Exploratory research showed that rephrasing the assignment into creating a ‘sustainable transport hub’ offered more possibilities for designing a sustainable product from the core and a broader perspective. Fitting this goal, the design approach Vision in Product design was used, in which a vision is created on context, interaction and product level. ANALYSIS The analysis phase consists of a background and exploratory study plus deconstruction in the domain of ‘sustainable transport hubs’. Conclusions lead to a vision on past and current context, interaction and products. The most important findings are that hubs are efficiency-focussed, users are unaware and time-focussed during their travel and sustainability remains a vague concept on what is ‘good’ or ‘bad’. VISION The second phase concerns creating a vision for the design. First, a context vision was created, based on factors generated together with project stakeholders during a workshop. The three pillars for the future Stadshavens context were: ‘travel as an enrichment of daily life’, ‘to rediscover the unknown in the familiar’ and ‘engaging in a relationship with the environment’. The goal (i.e. statement) for the new transport hub is to LET PEOPLE FEEL CONNECTED WITH THE(IR) ENVIRONMENT, BY LETTING THEM REDISCOVER THE ESSENCE OF THINGS. This translates in a modest, carefree and timeless product-user interaction, to establish a user-environment connection. The product should be reassuring, not distracting and scaled with respect to its surroundings. CONCEPT The concept development lead to a double-layered concept, that provides this reassurance and connection of the user to the environment by integrating the ferry into the hub (eliminating the fear of missing the transport means) and creating an encounter with the elements of the environment in the places where users retreat and try to isolate themselves. CONCEPT DESIGN The concept design embodies the vision and concept, and elaborates on several aspects involved, such as: orientation, location, design, interaction, engineering, facilities, information, materials, reference projects and economic advantages. It is supported with impressions and guidelines for further development. Recommendations are made concerning network expansion, traffic of goods, further development of the ferry and process progression. EVALUATION Concluding, an evaluation is given in which the vision and design is proposed to one of the creators of the project development plans for Stadshavens. The product vision complements the structural vision for the area and the design is seen as appropriate. Further user evaluation is needed to test the interaction and judgement of anticipated users.","Vision in Product design; public design; mobility; sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Probe vehicle data provides an interesting alternative although experimental studies have been confined to small datasets.

The measurements are compared with loop detection traffic counts and delay estimation from stationary sensors. Probe data from consumer GPS navigation devices provides a suitable data source for the determination of route choice and delay at two test case intersections if a sufficient sample size is available. Route choice is measured with an average error of 1.35% to 3.76%.

The project aimed at commuters; a group of frequent drivers, who did not feel appealed by current navigation solutions TomTom offers. Commuters, who are familiar route drivers, showed no need for turn-by-turn instructions. Current TomTom personal navigation devices were assumed to be too directive and not tailored to the commuters’ needs. TomTom recognized this challenge. The objective of this project was to find out the latent needs of the commuter and to design an appealing user driven concept solution. A user research was performed utilizing the method of contextmapping to capture the latent needs of this target group. The final outcome of this user research contained five key latent needs: The need for relevant information, for timely information, to keep on moving, for mutual trust and for a streamlined day. These latent needs represented the wishful situation for commuters. To be able to design a concept driven by these wishes, a design vision was formed: ‘My design will transform a challenging commute into a desired ritual.’ This vision served as a translation of the user needs into design and as driver for idea generation. From a variety of user driven ideas, three were selected based on relevancy to the user and company. The concept that was developed by merging the strengths of the ideas was ‘TomTom Impulse’. TomTom Impulse is a unique prior to travel service, that offers automated notifications and expectations about the commuters daily route on smartphone and connected TV. TomTom Impulse represents an innovative and informative concept, aiming to delivering relevant information, on a personal and timely base. Commuters benefit from this solution in the way that the information is provided before departure, rather than during travel. The user’s ability to anticipate is maximized by relevant and predictive information from TomTom. Combining the external information with own knowledge, commuters can choose to adapt their journey according to the information and ultimately increase control over the journey. This project covers the front end of the product development process. The conclusion of this report consists of several recommendations for further development. Keynote here is the recommendation to validate the findings and test the concept on a larger scale, before making further steps in the development process. The contribution to TomTom with this study is realized on various levels. With this research, it has been proved that a substantial opportunity exists for new solutions in the prior to travel phase. It is a yet unsaturated and non-competitive environment, that shows a perfect opportunity for establishing the TomTom brand in this uncharted ground.","Concept; Front End; Latent Needs; Commuters; App","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Aprile, W.A. (mentor); Mason, J.D. (mentor); Aliakseyeu, D. (mentor)","2011","Currently there is no market for adaptable personal luminaires in the office environment. The investments would be too high and this while there are no evident benefits. However in the future, with the rise of LEDs and increased knowledge on the effects of lighting on humans, this all may change. LEDs will become more affordable and consume less energy than the current solutions, leading to better return on investment times. In addition, Philips is expecting to prove that adaptive lighting can positively influence the productivity of office workers. If Philips is able to prove this benefit, then companies are likely to invest in adaptive lighting as this investment represents a small percentage of a company’s costs and is an investment that will benefit the company’s greatest asset: its employees. When this happens the flexible office worker should get control over a personal luminaire, since the ideal lighting conditions may vary significantly from person to person. Automating the choice or lighting is not possible as there are simply too much determinants in the choice of light, leading to a complex situation. The participants of the first study indicated that they would like to control the light intensity, colour temperature, size and location of the spotlight. Controlling the personal luminaire should be simple and fast as people want to focus on their work and not on their light, as indicated in the second user study and theory. The second study also showed that the majority of participants would like to control these lighting parameters individual from one another to create their personal preferred light setting, thus not based on pre-defined scenes. Additionally the majority of participants wanted to be able to save their setting into a personal preset, so that they can easily re-use their light preferences. This also complies with earlier research presenting that in time people home-in on the setting they like best. For the flexible office worker an important addition is that the saved personal setting can be loaded from any desk. Solely providing the office worker with control over a personal luminaire, will probably not result in increased productivity. The average office worker does not know what proper lighting is and how it affects him or her, which might result in improper choice of light settings. Therefore it is important that office workers will be educated to ensure that the most optimal settings are chosen based on their knowledge as well as their personal preference. This might sound exaggerated, but for people that work about 40 hours a week at a desk, this is not a trivial matter.","lighting; task; desk; lamp; luminaire; flexible; office; hot-desk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","ID  DCC; Design Context and Conceptualization","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The VSF is deposited in a eustatic transgressive phase and has a dispersed distribution in the northern Netherlands, which is not very well understood. This study produced a depositional model and a thickness map for the VSF, based on available wells, biostratigraphy, cores and seismic data. The area of investigation is the northern part of the onshore Netherlands: Groningen, Friesland, Drenthe, the Wadden area. Regional tectonics and faulting determined the formation of the depocentres: the Vlieland and Lower Saxony basins. Subrosion and halokinetic effects in the Zechstein strata affected the paleogeography and influenced the deposition of VSF. In the early transgressional stage (Ryazanian, Valanginian), the basins are probably separated by the Friesland Platform, which is probably flooded during the Late Valanginian. Sandstones deposited at the end of the transgression (Hauterivian, Barremian) are found on the Friesland Platform and in the Lower Saxony Basin. Most VSF on the platform is reworked and the preserved sandstones represent mainly lower shoreface facies. This study shows that previous depositional models are outdated and comes up with a new depositional model and thickness map of the VSF.","Cretaceous; Vlieland Sandstone Formation; Vlieland Basin; Friesland Platform; Lower Saxony Basin; paleogeography; depositional model; thickness map; Ryazanian; Valanginian; Hauterivian; Barremian","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Applied Earth Sciences","","Section Applied Geology","",""

(mentor); N-Gan Tillard, D.J. (mentor); Van der Schrier, J.S. (mentor)","2011","More than the half of the Netherlands is under the high level of sea and rivers. Therefore, evaluating the safety of dykes is primordial. A specific interest is given to peat dykes safety which suffer of a lack of knowledge which manifested recently by some peat dykes failures (Van Baars 2005). The behaviour of peat is also of interest in others countries, for assessing peat slope stability for instance (Long and Jennings 2006). Due to its high anisotropy and fibrosity, peat cannot be tested with any device in the laboratory. The direct simple shear test is routinely used since it can mimic several in situ conditions and provides conservative results for peat dyke stability evaluation. Furthermore, it does not show the inconvenience of triaxial testing with peat (Landva 1980). Larger samples than for usual testing are desirable to investigate the effect of fibres on tests results. The Direct simple shear testing devices remain imperfect since it is unable to provide additional shear stresses on the sides of the specimen. As consequence, non uniformities develop on all the faces of the specimen, in particular compression in the obtuse corners and tension in the acute corners. In practice, thin samples are used (height over diameter around 0,2 to 0,3) to limit the nonhomogeneities to the sides and leave the major part of the sample in an homogenous state of stress. Testing peat at low vertical stress, remains a challenge and necessities the development of adapted devices (Boylan and Long 2009). A series of tests has been performed on a wood and sedge peat with the Geonor device in order to compare the effect of two boundary conditions on tests results. The first one is a classical reinforced membrane (Bjerrum and Landva 1966) and the second is an unreinforced membrane enclosed in a stack of rings. The vertical stresses applied during the tests varied between 10kPa and 120kPa. The results show small differences when the Mohr Coulomb parameters are determined. The comparison is limited considering the variability of the material tested. A more accurate calibration of the stack of rings would be desirable. Some improvements are needed on the actual apparatus to test peat at low vertical stress. Removing the membrane between the soil and the rings would give more accuracy in the results. A direct simple shear prototype has been developed in order to test larger samples (with height over diameter ratio of 0.5) at low vertical stress. The effect of two innovative rough boundaries on the stress-strain homogeneity of the sample has been investigated. The sidewalls of the device are transparent and make possible a visual assessment of the deformation of the sample. The Particle Image Velocimetry analysis is also considered to assess the shear strain homogeneity in the sample. The results show an improving shear strain homogeneity and reduced tension forces in the acute corners. Slippage is also observed between the top cap and the sample and the normal load could not be measured. Further research is needed to validate the utility of this prototype. Stress-strain curves obtained from the three boundaries should be compared to quantify the improvement of rough boundaries. A finite element analysis of the prototype boundaries has been performed with two models (Mohr Coulomb and Soft Soil Creep model). The boundaries considered were perfectly rough at the top and bottom and perfectly smooth at the sides. The presence of strips and even more the presence of vanes increase the stress – strain homogeneity inside the sample with both models. Reliable stress – strain curves as measured in classical devices could not be obtained with such boundaries. Interfaces should be preferred to model more realistic conditions.","direct simple shear; peat testing; prototype; stress-strain homogeneity; finite element modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Engineering Geology","",""

(mentor)","2011","The working dynamics of energy sector are changing rapidly as ever before. The environmental concerns, unsustainable energy model based on fossil fuel and consumer behavior, all are raising challenges for the sector. Our electric power infrastructure has served us so well for so long but it’s rapidly running up its limitations. Our lights may be on, but systemically, the risks associated with relying on an often overtaxed grid grow in size, scale and complexity every day. One of the components in electric power sector, the Distribution system delivers power to ultimate user’s meter, has a key role in reliability and efficiency of the whole system. There is growing agreement among policymakers, business leaders, and other key stakeholders, around the idea that a Smart Grid is not only needed but it’s well within reach. The idea of integration is at the core of smart grids, as its integration if electric system with telecom and IT systems. Integrating automated metering infrastructure AMI with distribution management system DMS can bring many operational and working benefits to the utility. But materializing these benefits is only possible if appropriate regulatory regime is available to support them. The three main areas where such an integrated solution can really enhance any utility efficiency are Load Management, Fault Management and Network operations. Load management can be performed effectively by utilising automated metering infrastructure. The very basic idea of smart grids that consumers can take part in load management actions can be accomplished efficiently by such an integrated solution. The way utilities manage an occasion of fault. The way they identify, isolate, clear fault and recover electric supply can be improved effectively by integration of DMS and AMI. And finally, the non-technical losses and technical ones can be reduced significantly by this integration. To achieve massive deployment of smart grid solutions, smart meters etc, and to accommodate the penetration distributed generation and efficiency ideas which get birth from smart grid solutions, role of regulations which define each actor’s part and his benefits contains crucial importance. This report first discusses the idea of integrating AMI and DMS and provides short overview of regulatory issues related to smart grid deployment.","electric power; smart grids","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","EPA-EMIN","",""

(mentor)","2011","Directive 2009/73/EC of the European Parliament and Council introduces the obligation for Member States to review the use of smart metering, whose implementation may be subject to the outcome of an economic evaluation of costs and benefits. Consequently in July 2010, by Order ITC 1890/2010, the CNE is responsible for conducting a study on the use of smart meters in the field of supply to domestic and commercial consumers of natural gas. The decision to implement gas smart meters needs to be based on a comprehensive economic analysis that reflects a balance between costs and benefits of all stakeholders in the gas supply chain to calculate whether their implementation is beneficial for the whole society. In order to know the effects resulting from the future implementation of smart meters in Spain, a study was conducted using the cost benefit methodology suggested by EUROGAS. This methodology compares the marginal costs and benefits from the project of smart meters for gas. To carry out this study an investigation of the current state of Spanish metering equipment and current technologies for gas smart metering has been done. Benchmarking have also being conducted from studies in France, UK and a study commissioned by NARUC / ERRA for the Licensing Committee / ERRA competition. Research shows that the status of smart metering technology is still immature and the behaviour of consumers has not been studied deeply. But measures such as awareness campaigns on issues of energy efficiency and use of new technologies to achieve the same appear to be a good support policy. The result of the cost-benefit analysis is negative, in which case supports the no-go decision with the project. The benefits are mainly for distributors. For consumers the benefit is less and is directly related to changes in their behaviour with respect to gas consumption. However, it is considered that the implementation of smart meters will be carried out independently by the distributors, due to the benefits it brings like improvements in the gas network management. This can happen now or in later stages as a result of advancing technology. It is therefore important that the regulator is aware of these developments, which also may be beneficial to them, and intervene to ensure competitiveness in retailers (interoperability), protect the rights of consumers, promote the participation of consumers and encourage distributors to innovate.","smart metering; Spain; gas; cost benefit analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Dragon-Lab is capable of detection, identification, and temporal and spacial localization of Internet backbone anomalous states based on two end-to-end metrics, packet delay and packet loss, and traceroutes information of the measured Internet paths. The anomalous states or instabilities are: congestion, queue building up and link failure. This is a new approach in the field of network troubleshooting and management. It is a bridge between methods focusing mainly on delay analysis and root cause analysis methods focusing on harvesting huge amounts of routing data in order to identify and localize network problems. Dragon-Lab is based on a three months measurement study conducted over the Internet between Norway, China and New Zealand. Relying on the Principal Component Pursuit processed data to identify anomalous delay changes and on general network knowledge, the unstable network states are identified and implicitly temporally localized. Further analysis is performed by processing instabilities into cumulative distributed functions of duration of instabilities, time between instabilities, charts of the distributions of instabilities per path, and per type of instability, in order to study instabilities impact on Internet paths. Moreover, general metrics have been defined in order to give an overview of the impact of the combination of instabilities on paths. The metrics are: availability, fatigue or stability of the Internet path. Further Dragon-Lab is improved by geo-localization of the instabilities. The research aims to use available data to pinpoint the source location of instabilities on the Internet paths, in essence to find the problem hop on the path by IP. This is achieved by combining reconstructions algorithms from the Compressive Sensing domain with Dragon-Lab knowledge on instabilities. The approach presents provides a solution bounded by certain conditions and having a few limitations and also a spacial localization algorithm.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-09-12","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Department of Telecommunications","","Electrical Engineering Masters - Telecommunications Track","",""

One of the main initiators of geothermal energy production in the Netherlands is the Delft Geothermal Project (DAP).

The Distributed Fiber-Optic Temperature-Sensing (DTS) technique represents a new physical approach for temperature measurements in the geosciences and environmental sciences. It is based on optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR). DTS is a promising new technology, continuously measuring the temperature profile along the whole length of the glass fiber in the borehole. Profiling the whole well is an improvement compared with the conventional methods, because it is also showing temperature losses within the well. Knowing more about these losses within the system is essential to design strategies to increase the cost effectiveness. To add a different view on the use of the DTS technique in geothermal doublets an experiment is executed as well. This experiment will show the ease and dexterity of the use of optic fibres and will teach us more about the hardware and additional software used.

(mentor); Stappers, P.J. (mentor)","2011","This master thesis report with the topic “participation and co-creation in the public domain”, represents the final project of the master Design for Interaction at the faculty Industrial Design Engineering, University of Technology Delft (TUDelft) and was executed for the STT Netherlands Study Centre for Technology Trends in The Hague (STT). The project is introduced in chapter one where the design brief, involved parties and project process is elaborated on. The goal of the initial design brief was “design a means that facilitates people with the possibility to participate and co-create, with other citizens and authority, in the Dutch public domain of 2030”. To reach this goal a process similar to the VIP method was followed. First the current situation was deconstructed, whereupon the future situation was constructed and a concept was designed. Chapter two investigates on the term crowdsourcing, the topic of the initiating exploratory study of STT and the starting point of this thesis. There was investigated how the method of crowdsourcing currently is applied in the following sectors: private internet organisations, commercial businesses, design teams and in the public domain. In these various fields similar processes and guidelines were differentiated. Chapter three maps the current situation of the public domain. Roughly five parties were differentiated: authority, citizens, media, commercial companies and public private parties. Current policy-making procedures and the influence of citizens in every step were investigated. Due to lack of accurate information and feedback, which is in large extend caused by the media, communication in these procedures falls short. The majority of citizens is willing to participate, yet does not see how they are able to make a difference. The several motivators and barriers to stimulate or stop people from participating were mapped. Finally there was concluded that authority can learn from commercial companies and public private parties. Organisations in which crowdsourcing and end user participation already are applied on larger scale. In chapter four there has been decided to solely focus on citizens and their personal needs and wishes. In order to do so, six personas were made for this thesis. These personas were based on literature and represent Dutch society. These personas were the starting point for chapter five, where was investigated which factors people need to participate. This investigation was split in two parts: a generative research and a research on existing initiatives. Both researches focussed on four factors: participation, ability, motivation and satisfaction. The generative research was done with a focus group of six participants. Who first were sensitised and in a session were asked to collectively brainstorm about their neighbourhood and collectively choose a situation to work out in a 3D Lego play collage. The steps of the generative process, resembled the steps of a policy-making process. After the generative session, twenty eight, existing participatory initiatives were examined. Some of these initiatives had potential and their aspects were instructive, while the majority of the initiatives was more suitable to find out what should be avoided in the future. In chapter six the result of the both researches were compared and concluded on. The results of the generative session gave insight in the needs and wishes of people, while the results from the research on existing initiatives gave insight in the process and the perspective of authority. From these results it was concluded that people consider participation as the continuous interaction with others in their daily life. They are especially motivated to participate when they personally take interest in a situation. However in order to do so, they need to be enabled to participate. Six enabling participation parameters were found: certainty, communication, freedom, responsibility, sympathy and support. During and after a participation process the level of success gives people a feeling of (dis-)satisfaction. Together these findings formed the main framework and guidelines for the construction phases of the thesis process. Chapter seven describes an interaction vision based on these insights. In this vision the desired interaction and future context of the to be designed means was determined. The vision was used to frame the design space and draw inspiration from. Chapter eight starts with a foundation for idea sketching, where more information was searched on the parameters sympathy and support. In an individual creative session, ideas were sketched and later on clustered in three phases. Four concepts were derived from the final morphological clusters and were elaborated on. After which a confrontation matrix was used to map the strongest points of each of the concepts. Chapter nine describes a first iteration in which the four concepts were merged together. Resulting in a personal document, a cloud-computing structure, with gestural operation and a 3D holographic display to participate directly there and then, in a variety of every day situations. The four participation paths were developed in the form of scenarios, flow-charts and interface frames. Chapter ten evaluates the first iteration of the concept with an evaluation study, executed in the city centre of The Hague. The interface frames were presented on an Ipad and this prototype was accompanied with the scenarios. Eight participants were observed and interviewed, from which valuable conclusions were drawn and recommendations were made. There was concluded that the concept currently could facilitate people with the possibility to participate and co-create. Although there were several aspects that needed improvement. Especially regarding the interface design, falling under the scope of the parameter communication. The recommendations were adopted in chapter eleven, where a second iteration is described. The co-creation paths were merged and a organisational path was added. The interface position was changed, icons were made more elaborate and a new menu structure was designed. While the context and interaction, as described in chapter nine, remained the same. Chapter eleven reflects on the last iteration done for this graduation project and results in the final concept of this master thesis. In the final chapter, chapter twelve, there is reflected on the thesis results from a project perspective and a personal perspective.","participation; co-creation; public domain; future study (2030); interaction design; context mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Despite the recommendations that were written, full legislative coverage of high strength concrete remained unavailable. The new Eurocodes are also valid for high strength concrete, so the question rises how high strength concrete can be used in the civil engineering sector. This Master’s thesis is therefore aimed at the question which (combinations of ) cross sections can be used to create an optimal design for cast in situ high strength concrete bridges. From a consideration of the dominant loads on a concrete plate bridge, it followed that for bending moments the governing cross section is required over a small length of the entire bridge. This also applies to shear forces. It was also found that the self weight of the bridge forms a large part of the total load on the bridge. Research into the optimal cross section for the three main actions (normal force, bending moment and shear force) learned that for normal and shear forces solid cross sections are optimal. For bending moments on the other hand, I profiles perform best since the material is concentrated at the top and bottom of the cross section. Attempts to improve the performance by including a high strength concrete in a normal strength concrete cross section yielded little success, mainly due to the small difference in stiffness between both materials. Both investigations lead to the development of two strategies for optimisation of the solid, flat plate bridge. The first strategy is to vary the cross sectional height along the length of the bridge. This reduces the bending moment capacity at the locations where the maximum capacity is not required. The other method is to apply the optimal cross sections at the positions where the demand for the corresponding capacity is large. Using the I section at positions where bending moment capacity is required yields a plate with rectangular voids in longitudinal direction. After the benchmark design (the solid flat plate) is optimised, the designs for each strategy were optimised as well. During the optimisation process, as much material as possible is removed while maintaining the designed shapes, until the first structural check failed. The optimal variant that scored best was a one metre high plate with 20 voids. Compared with the initial cross sectional area of the bridge, 33% is replaced by voids. When comparing the cross sectional area with the benchmark design, the reduction is almost 40%. Due to the reduction of the plate thickness by 100 millimetres, the span to plate thickness ratio is increased from 35 (rule of thumb) to 42. During the tender process the durability and sustainability of designs becomes more important. Hence the MKI method as used in Rijkswaterstaat’s DuboCalc software is used in order to assess the environmental impact of the various designs. This method incorporates a number of environmental factors and translates this to environmental costs for each construction material (MKI value). Compared with the benchmark design, the optimised design reduces the MKI value by 37%.","high strength concrete; optimisation of plate bridge design; optimisation of cross sections","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2011","Summary Part I - Optimization of the maintenance scheduling Resource management in the industry is an important feature to make the most of the production, particularly in maintenance field where the availability of people is a very important condition to minimize losses. An optimized maintenance scheduling is of a crucial importance for wind farms. There is great potential to reduce costs by optimizing maintenance for project profitability. We propose here a methodology that will supply us a schedule for resource allocation for the maintenance of wind turbines. Our goal is to create a decision-making tool allowing us to allocate resources annually for maintenance of wind farms of the company (or a number determined by the user), while minimizing production losses by taking advantage of production forecasts. Concerning a short-term maintenance (weekly), interventions have to be led to optimize the use of wind farms and their efficiency. For that purpose, a graphic interface was built for the benefit of the user based on weekly production forecasts offering an alternative to the former planning of interventions established in terms of efficient combination between production and maintenance. Summary Part II - Green Certificates The valuation of production also passes by green certificates. Indeed, the liberalization of energy market has created various instruments compatible with the introduction of competition, such as markets for green certificates that represent a financial instrument for supporting the development of green electricity as adapted to the constitution of liberalized markets. However, in France the process is voluntary and benefits are still low, but an increase is felt from businesses looking to promote their products through that mean in one hand and the purchasers who show interest in renewable energy. The actual efficiency to create a stable framework and incentive for investment is to be measured by current experiments in the EU member state.","Optimization; Maintenance; Wind turbines; Green certificates; Scheduling","fr","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","EPA-EMIN","",""

(mentor)","2011","To meet traffic demand predictions, the global air traffic management (ATM) system needs to be changed. Several visions on future ATM operations exist. A commonality between the different visions is 4D Trajectory management. This function enables plan-based operation as opposed to the state-based approach of the present system. Plan-based operation enables the optimization of traffic flows by generating 4D trajectories. A part of the traffic flow generation process is scheduling. The research presented in this thesis focuses on these scheduling opportunities. In this research the scheduling opportunities for departure traffic at a runway are investigated. A study of the existing literature showed that the most common scheduling algorithms currently available can be divided into four categories: first come first served, brand-and-bound, greedy search and genetic algorithms. A simulation environment is designed for evaluation of the departure scheduling algorithms using various input parameters like traffic situation, airport map and algorithm. The four algorithm categories are evaluated on output aspects like delay and robustness of the schedule and are compared with the current method of traffic scheduling. The evaluation of the scheduling algorithms shows that the performance of the current method of scheduling departure traffic performs well in comparison with the tested algorithms. In case of no disturbances the genetic algorithm performs slightly better than the current method, but the other algorithms do not have a better performance. When disturbances are taken into account, a bigger performance increase can be obtained by using scheduling algorithms.","avionics; scheduling algorithms; departure scheduling; simulation environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Group of Microwave Technology and Systems for Radar (MTSR)","",""

(mentor); Strijker, G. (mentor)","2011","The behavior of naturally fractured reservoirs is very different from that of conventional reservoirs. In order to develop a successful production strategy it is important to understand this behavior. Golder Associates developed a software package to model heterogeneous and fractured rock masses. FracMan generates three-dimensional fracture networks based on fracture parameters that are specified by the user. The fracture network exposed in the Cambro-Ordovician sedimentary succession in southwestern Jordan was modeled with this software. Parameters from the multi-scale data set that Strijker et al. (subm) acquired from high-resolution satellite imagery and field measurements were used to generate a stochastic fracture network. With a special feature in FracMan the connectivity of the network was analyzed. The sensitivity of the fracture connectivity to variations in parameters was tested as well. The results were embedded in the context of percolation theory. The two- and three-dimensional percolation thresholds were determined after constructing cumulative distributions for the probability of percolation as a function of the fracture intensity. The results are consistent with the theoretical Nc,2d ? 0.5 and Nc,3d ? 0.249 (Stauffer, 1985). The probabilities of percolation for the stochastically generated fracture networks are N2d ? 1 and N3d ? 0.99, which are both far above the percolation threshold. This means the connectivity of the fracture network is good and therefore fluid flow in reservoirs with a comparable network to the Petra succession should be possible. The sensitivity of the fracture connectivity was tested by varying three different pa- rameters: fracture orientation, fracture polygon shape, and the aspect ratio of these polygons. A standard deviation was introduced for the orientation. This had a positive influence on the fracture network connectivity; the probability of percolation increased. The greater the number of sides of a polygon, the lower the probability of percolation. The probability of percolation and the total number of polygon sides are negatively correlated. The aspect ratio had the greatest impact on the percolation probability. With an increasing aspect ratio the two-dimensional percolation probability grows (? +0.30), while the three- dimensional probability declines (? -0.33). It is therefore an important parameter with a great impact on the fracture network connectivity.","percolation theory; fracture network; fracman; fracture connectivity","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Applied Geology","","","",""

(mentor); Voncken, J.H.L. (mentor); Dalmijn, W.L. (mentor); Van Ruitenbeek, F.J.A. (mentor); De Ruiter, J.J. (mentor)","2011","Los Bronces is an open pit mine located on a large porphyry copper-molybdenum deposit near Santiago, Chile. Annual production is around 240 000 tonnes of copper and 2 700 tonnes of molybdenum. The extracted ore has a relatively low average copper grade of around 0.6%. This results in relatively high processing costs and creates the need to search for solutions to reduce the costs for ore processing at Los Bronces. Sorting by sensor technology may be a solution to decrease these processing costs. Sensor based sorting is a technique where singular particles are mechanically separated on certain physical properties after determining these properties by a sensor or detector. Sensor based sorting is of relatively low cost compared to other concentration methods. It is an evolving technology that is reaching the requirements for implementation in ore processing operations. However, sensor based sorting is completely dependant on an appropriate sensor that allows distinguishing between sub-economic and economic ore material. The applicability of a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic sensor was investigated on a set of 150 mill pebbles from the Los Bronces processing plant to asses the feasibility of sensor based sorting. The NIR spectroscopic sensor allows characterisation of the reflected electromagnetic radiation from solids along the NIR wavelength regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (350-2500 nm). Mainly due to the vibrational effects of certain molecule bonds in these solids, absorption bands of lower reflected radiation are present around characteristic wavelength locations. These absorption bands can therefore be diagnostic for certain mineral presences in a solid. Copper minerals do not cause any characteristic absorption bands in the NIR region. Various hydrothermal alteration minerals that are associated with the formation of porphyry copper systems on the other hand do. These minerals include muscovite, illite, chlorite, tourmaline and kaolinite. Assessing the applicability of NIR spectroscopy for sensor based sorting of the Los Bronces mill pebbles was therefore focused on finding a relation between the copper grade and these alteration minerals. From general geological models it is known that copper mineralisation can be associated with certain zones of hydrothermal alteration. However, in practice the alteration zones and copper mineralisation usually form very complex systems due to several periods of intrusion, brecciation and overprinting of the pre-existing hydrothermal alterations. The test work showed that no direct correlation between the copper grade and a NIR spectral characteristic was present. However, it did prove to be possible to classify the mill pebbles based on the NIR spectral response and mineralogy determined from petrography and x-ray diffraction. This resulted in several groups of pebbles that proved to be identifiable by NIR spectroscopy and contained different average copper grades. One group of low grade pebbles was particularly interesting. This group contains 30% of all pebble samples with an average copper grade of 0.29%. This group can be easily identified with NIR spectroscopy by a high depth ratio between the 1900 and 2200 nm absorption feature and presence of an absorption feature around 2350 nm. These spectral features are caused by a low crystallinity of mica minerals and presence of chlorite respectively. It was shown that it is technically feasible to make some discrimination on the copper grade of the Los Bronces mill pebbles by the response from a NIR spectroscopic sensor. However, because the discrimination possibilities are limited to only one group of pebbles, a detailed economical analysis still has to prove the economical feasibility of NIR spectroscopy as a sensor sorting application for the Los Bronces mill pebbles. A preliminary economical analysis already showed that the economical feasibility is mainly dependant on the copper price and the processing costs of the ore.","Los Bronces; NIR spectroscopy; sensor; based; sorting technology; copper ore","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-09-13","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Resource Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Post combustion CO2 capture is the process to capture CO2, typically using solvent through the chemical absorption, from the flue gas stream in a power plant. Previous studies showed that crystallization may occur in the CO2 capture system utilizing high concentration of certain amino acetate. This condition gives the disadvantage because of slurry formation in the absorption system. However, this crystallization offers the opportunity of higher CO2 capturing capacity. In this thesis, an aqueous sodium taurate solution was chosen as the solvent. Experimental works were carried out in order to define the solubility of taurine in aqueous sodium taurate solution at different pH. Data from these experiments are important to define at which conditions crystallization occurs when the solvent captures CO2. Other experiments using Crystalline equipment were done to define the regime/zone (taurate solution concentration and temperature) at which taurine crystallization may occur during CO2 capture. The crystallization process and when it starts can be observed during the experiment. The experiment results show that the higher solution concentration and lower temperature give a better chance for crystallization. A set of thermodynamic models were built based on the experimental data in order to understand the effect of crystallization on the CO2 capture process. These were the models of: solubility of taurine in the NaOH solution; the starting point of crystallization during CO2 capture process; and the end point of CO2 capture at which no more CO2 can be absorbed by the solution. The modeling results show that a higher CO2 loading can be achieved when the crystallization occurs during the CO2 capture.","amino acid; sodium taurate; CO2 capture; crystallization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","IRS","",""

(mentor); Annema, J.A. (mentor); De Haan, A.R.C. (mentor); Taebi, B. (mentor)","2011","When making decisions on transport projects, decision makers ought to take into account most (if not all) of the possible consequences of the different possible alternatives. A common way of evaluating transport projects ex ante is by means of Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA). CBA allows for a clear comparison of different consequences, by describing all effects in monetary terms. In the case of long-term effects however, there are two aspects of CBA that do not allow for full consideration: CBAs are usually performed for the length of a few decades and secondly, discounting diminishes the value of long-term effects. As a consequence, long-term effects barely have an effect on the outcome of CBAs in terms of Net Present Value (NPV). This implies that if future generations will value these effects, their voice is not heard in current day choices. The findings of this study are therefor of interest to those who have chosen to represent the interests of future generations: either explicitly (e.g. politicians, civilians or interest groups stating the importance of the rights of future generations) or implicitly (scientists, policy makers or transport CBA practitioners). This thesis focuses on two specific long-term transport effects that are greatly influenced (in terms of quantities) by transport: the depletion of fossil fuel and CO2 emissions. In current Dutch transport CBA practice, the depletion of fossil fuels is completely ignored and, in terms of their long-term intergenerational consequences, CO2 emissions are not properly taken into account. Intergenerational effects being an element of the ethical theory of intergenerational justice, this leads to the first research question: Why are the long-term transport effects of fossil fuel depletion and CO2 emissions considered important from an ethical point of view? Ethical literature states that, by not taking full consideration of these two long-term effects, the current generation possible causes injustice towards future generations. When depleting resources or by causing climate change, current behavior narrows the opportunities of subsequent generations. By narrowing opportunities without creating possible compensation, the current generation causes distributive injustice. Justice being one of the first principles of morality, the long-term effects of fossil fuel depletion and CO2 emissions are not properly taken into account from an ethical point of view. This being a purely analytical argumentation as to why the effects should be taken into account, the next research question posed in this thesis is one of more practical sense: What is the perception of people on the long-term consequences of the depletion of fossil fuel and CO2 emissions? In order to find these perceptions, a so-called Q-analysis is performed. The analysis aims to find the common element in people their opinion on the matter of the long-term (intergenerational) effects of fossil fuel depletion and CO2 emissions. Three perceptions are retrieved, together explaining over half of the difference in people their opinions. The perception (or factor, as it is called) that explains most of the differences between people their viewpoints (i.e. variance) underlines the importance of considering the two long-term effects. The second factor however showed that although people care, they presume that the problems will be solved when they arise. A third factor shows ambiguity, possible being a flaw in the analysis or in the viewpoint of people. The analysis thereby provides reasons as to why (predominantly by means of factor 1) the long-term effects of fossil fuel depletion and CO2 emissions should be incorporated in ex ante transport project evaluations. The next research question answered, aims at the matter of how to incorporate the long-term effects of fossil fuel depletion and CO2 emissions in CBAs: How can the before mentioned long-term transport effects be incorporated into CBAs? Based on literature from the areas of transport, economics and ethics, methods to incorporate long-term effects in CBAs in general were retrieved. These methods are specified for the two specific effects (fossil fuel depletion and CO2 emissions) by asking five experts from the different areas for their opinion on the matter. Five methods are described in detail, which are considered serious possibilities to overcome the hampering effect of discounting on long-term effects: - Using a lower discount rate for the two long-term effects, combined with the use of an infinite time horizon for the project evaluation. - Instead of using one discount rate for the two long-term effects, the project length is divided in two periods: the first lasting several decades, the second starting at the end of the first and having an infinite length. The discount rate used for the two long-term effects is lowered in the second period. - Instead of a fixed discount rate, the rate used for the two effects declines from the start of the project to a set lowered value. - Combining the two previous methods into one leads to a two-step declining discount rate, for which in the first period the discount rate is fixed and declines in the second (again: only for the two long-term effects). - Countering the effect of discounting but not by means of the discount rate itself, this final method increases the value of the price tags of the two long-term effects. By countering the inability of CBA to consider long-term effects due to the current practice of discounting, these methods allow for a full consideration of the long-term intergenerational effects of fossil fuel depletion and CO2 emissions. Now that the how question is answered, the next research question aims at the consequences of implementing the long-term effects of fossil fuel depletion and CO2 emissions: What are the consequences when taking into account the afore mentioned long-term transport effects? By implementing the five methods into a fictitious CBA (based on the actual CBA performed for the extension of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol), quantitative outcomes are calculated. Although the impacts of the different methods differ, the overall conclusion is that, in terms of Net Present Value (NPV), taking the societal costs of fossil fuel depletion and CO2 emissions into account clearly influences the CBA outcome of a project. Sensitivity analyses show that input parameters do however have an important role in the overall outcome (especially for the price tags of the two effects), but the turning point of the CBA (where the NPV goes from positive to negative) is clearly influenced when incorporating the societal costs of both the depletion of fossil fuels and of CO2 emissions. Although having a significant effect on the outcome of the hypothetical CBA, there are several elements to this research that ought to be taken into consideration before the conclusions can be implemented in general practice. Three considerations are discussed, and areas for further research are mentioned: - The performed implementation methods require further attention. More methods ought to be tested in a more elaborated fashion, and some form of ranking should be applied in order to choose one specific method. - The performed analysis into the societal perceptions on the matter ought to be extended: the used statements have to be verified for their completeness and the respondent sample should be checked for representation of all possible viewpoints. - The reasoning behind the used price tags for the societal costs of fossil fuel depletion and CO2 emissions can be made more explicit, showing a more reasoned willingness-to-pay of the public. These recommendations for further research show several steps considered necessary before the conclusions drawn in this thesis can be extrapolated (by for instance transport policy makers) to general conclusions on the inclusion of long-term transport effects in CBAs. However, when these recommendations were to be performed, the conclusions (possibly: depending on the findings of to-be performed research) lead to possibilities to incorporate long-term transport effects in CBAs, providing a standard practice for dealing with long-term transport effects in CBAs.","cost-benefit analysis; transport; long-term effects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Tranport and Logistics","","","",""

The graduation project is focused on the interaction for effective feedback (what, how and when) between the system and the athlete and coach. According to the literature research the combination of stride frequency and stride length are most important for a good sprint technique. Field research showed that focus points are used throughout the training to improve technique. With the use of literature research, explorations in the field and a test with the available technology, it is determined to give feedback on the track, during the training session. Then, athletes can improve their technique on the spot, which is an important conclusion from the research. The stride frequency and stride length are measured with a GPS integrated three dimensional accelerometer. The conclusions of the analysis phase are used as input for a design vision and for inspiration throughout the project. It was chosen to develop a concept in which the user can preset a goal to focus on one or more particular focus points. After the athlete has performed a sprint run, the measured data is transferred to a computer. Then, feedback is available in three separate screens. In the first screen feedback is displayed about the time, average speed, top speed, average stride frequency and average stride length. The results are compared to the goal and can be compared to the previous run as well. Furthermore, it is possible to review the course of the performed runs in the second screen. The results per segment of the race are displayed in line graphs, one for each parameter. In this screen the segment results of last run can be compared to the segment results of the two previous runs. In the third screen all results are presented in a table for a complete overview of the performances of several runs. In the final phase of the project, the design is evaluated with a user test. Therefore, an interactive prototype is built, in which the real results of a run performed by the participant are displayed. Several athletes participated in the evaluation test to find points of improvement.

(mentor); Bauer, P. (mentor); Hamoen, T. (mentor)","2011","The objective of this thesis is defining the feasibility of using an Inductive Wireless Power and Data transfer system (IWPD) as sounding rocket umbilical. An Umbilical is used to supply power and communicate with the rocket in the last moments before launch. The power is used to keep the batteries fully charged and the communication is used for arming and disarming procedures. An IWPD system uses magnetically coupled coils, or inductors, to transfer power and data. This principle is used in transformers where a magnetic core creates a high coupling. In the umbilical the coils cannot be placed around a single core. This comes from the fact that one coil is outside the rocket and one coil is inside the rocket. Coupling of two coils separated by air is obtained by the magnetic field they produce. The coupling is defined as the magnetic field shared by the two coils in reference to the field that only passes one of the coils. To determine the coupling a simplified model was made which allowed the coupling to be plotted to the distance between the coils. The power transfer between a pair of coupled coils is dependent on the coupling between the coils. The magnetic field will not dissipate energy unless it goes through conductive materials. This means that magnetic energy is stored in the field and can be reclaimed. Making the inductors resonate with the addition of capacitors keeps the energy in the circuit. This resonance makes the power transfer non linear to the coupling of the coils. Circuit calculations are presented to determine the transfer of the IWPD in respect to frequency, supply and load conditions. The transfer is then used to determine the best setup to be used for an IWPD umbilical. The resonance of the system is used as frequency response of an oscillator. This oscillator is used to overcome the frequency shift of the system. The proposed system is compared with a more conventional umbilical. This comparison is made in three fields. Performance, Interference and Safety. In Performance an IWPD is as suited for the task as conventional system. Both will be able of supplying sufficient power and date. In Interference the IWPD is much better. It separates the umbilical from the skin and structure of the rocket. For Safety the results are balanced. The conventional systems perform better on electromagnetic interference (EMI). While the IWPD performs better on Electrostatic discharge (ESD). The IWPD might perform less on EMI this however does not have to be a problem. Increasing the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of the electronics and the distance to dangerous materials in the rocket will create a safe working situation.","IWPD; sounding rocket; wireless power","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-25","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Micro Electronics","",""

The active role of the consumer is desired when it comes to individualization and the fit of products, being able to make a sustainable difference themselves. A large difference in product development can be made by sending bits instead of atoms around the world, using repurposable ‘waste’ materials for new products. Co-creation can offer guidance to consumers to create their own products, making it fun, and enables to share it with others. The misfit of standardized mass-fabricated products, has been taken as a starting point to define a product design area, ideally resulting in perfect-fit products. Flip-flops have been chosen since the lack of individualization can result into serious health problems, caused by the unnatural way of scrunching one’s toes, while walking. Personal Fabrication allow creators to design and produce their own products using readily available machines/methods. To embody this innovative principle in combination with sustainable entrepreneurship. Within this area, two design directions have been explored. First of all, 3D printing perfect-fit flip-flops seemed to be an interesting approach. The individuals’ foot dimensions could be used to build up a flip-flop layer by layer. However, after an in-depth materialization, it turned out that 3D printing would be too expensive, the high functional requirements of flip-flops could not be met and the sustainability advantage was not clear. Using this technology might be possible in 5-10 years (depending on the market developments) and was therefore rejected during the course of this project. A second direction focuses on creating an open-source framework, with which people can co-create their own flip-flops from ‘waste’ materials. It focuses on the challenge to design and produce high-quality flip-flops from waste material, using locally available materials, tools and machines. Besides, it has to answer the question if everyday consumers are able to do this and if so, address to the information and conditions they need to do so. In fact, this Do It Yourself (DIY) framework has to create revenues for an Enviu spin-off. 3 concepts are developed for the Personal Fabrication of flip-flops. One of the concepts has been chosen, using a layer-wise build up of a flip-flop inside a mold. Ideally creators can throw inside the mold whatever waste material they can assemble, literally step inside the mold to create a personal 3D foot profile, take the flip-flops out of the mold, and enjoy their fully individualized perfect-fit flip-flops. Potentially the fit can reduce scrunch while walking, eliminating discomfort. A proof of principle has been carried out and shows a potential of this direction’s concept. A variety of challenges remained, addressing to a high functionality, appearance and easy creation method. To address to these challenges, in-depth embodiment research has been carried out in 4 phases. In phase 1, empirically, 12 flip-flops have been created, with a mold as a constant factor, varying creation principles, techniques and materials, firstly focusing on the 3D layer and connection layer. The research describes that designing and producing high quality flip-flops is finding a compromise between the directly related functionality, appearance and creation method. Furthermore, in order to meet the elaborate (often conflicting) requirements of footwear, flip-flops need to consist of different layers, nevertheless have to function as one unity. The ideal principle of throwing in whatever materials is not feasible, creators will be guided by example flip-flops, using their own materials to create sustainable awareness and be able to customize. The outcome is a feasible flip-flop, with an accurate foot bed, which is easy to create. Next, the question if other people can recreate the chosen flip-flop with their own materials has been answered, provided with instructions. 2 subjects created successfully 2 flip-flops of similar quality to the instruction flip-flop. The subjects mentioned that it was fun to create your own flip-flop. The collection of materials proved to be difficult, creating a threshold for the concept. Building forward on this, the materials should be collected at a central place (e.g. Scrap in Rotterdam) and a workplace with the right tools, machines and space (e.g. Fablabs) should be part of the plan. The flip-flop and mold functionality and appearance have been further improved in phase 3, using the input from the previous phases. Two functional and appealing flip-flops are the result. It turned out that the increase of quality is at the expense of creation ease. The framework will offer 3 example flip-flops that range in quality vs. creation effort. In phase 4 the functionality and appearance of the 3 selected flip-flops has been tested in consultation with an orthopaedic shoe maker. Especially the last created flip-flop scores high. Some requirements are not met for the 3 flip-flops and this phase addresses to the points for improvement for future research The framework will be offered on a website, which is exploited by an Enviu spin-off. The website offers, in different awareness levels, all the information users need to create flip-flops, generating revenues from selling instructions. A set-up for offering the information has been made and an implementation plan is suggested. Next, a critical concept review reflects on the prior challenges and the output of the project. In the final chapter conclusions and recommendations are provided. The product proposal offers a great market opportunity for Enviu and suits to their vision. However, the willingness of the intended consumers has to be tested further. If not potential, other opportunities are described using the project’s proposals teachings.","Flip-flops; sustainability; personal fabrication; upcycling; decentralized manufacturing; 3D printing; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Badke Schaub, P.S. (mentor)","2011","This thesis investigates how co-creation can be a suitable strategy for product development. It resulted in a product innovation strategy where co-creation is the core strategy and will lead to several tasks and steps needed to take in order to develop new products. The product innovation strategy is designed for the company We Beat The Mountain (WBTM). WBTM is a small idealistic company that develops products from waste. WBTM considers an organizational structure where companies work smart together as a given future. In this way companies can develop and focus themselves on what they do best, while working together, in other words: co-create. Co-creation has gained the interest of more companies in the past few years as an interesting method to do business, though co-creation a is a complex matter in which many variables influence the success of co-creation. To understand the complexity of co-creation and apply this into product innovation the main research question is defined as: How can We Beat The Mountain develop a product innovation strategy, based on co-creation, with other companies while keeping her brand image strong? To be able to answer the main research question the research is split in three parts. The first part focuses on the co-creation theory, the process steps and the necessary needs of the co-creation team. This results into a co-creation model defining the necessary needs that should be developed in a co-creation process to become a success. The process is translated into 7 practical steps. The needs that should be developed are than related to these steps. The second part analysis the company and the third part will describe how co-creation can play a role in product innovation and specifically within the company WBTM.","co-creation; product innovation; strategy; co-operation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Hultink, H.J. (mentor)","2011","Project context and scope The launch of the Marketing Led Organisation (MLO) in Syngenta Seeds in 2010 marked, in effect, the start of an adoption and diffusion process with the purpose to spread the MLO throughout the Vegetables EAME organisation. The way to diffuse the MLO was using a dedicated group of carefully selected employees, called Multipliers, who would receive training and act as change agents to implement the new ways of working required by the MLO throughout the organisation. The project sought to answer the question: How effective was the diffusion process of the MLO and the utilisation of Multipliers for that intent, and how can that process be improved? For Syngenta the project served as a formal evaluation of both the MLO and the Multiplier program. The assessment used adoption and diffusion theory. Adoption refers to the decision any individual or organisation to take up, use or incorporate a product, idea or innovation, while diffusion relates to the spreading of the innovation in the market, organisation or social system and the amount of users (Rogers, 1995). Methodology Two data collection methods were used over a five month period: studying internal company documents and conducting semi-structured interviews. In total 22 interviews were conducted with internal stakeholders with different levels of involvement with the MLO. The findings from the interviewees were compared to the findings from the literature review, conducted in the domains of adoption and diffusion, and launch strategy. Results from analysis From the analysis it emerged that there were four main phases in the diffusion process: the set-up of the diffusion process, the diffusion to the Multipliers, the diffusion to the rest of the organisation, and sustaining the diffusion process. The set-up was among the most successful parts of the diffusion process and facilitated the other phases. The structure set-up was effective for a diffusion process because it took advantage of the interpersonal network to aid the diffusion. By nominating Multipliers at different hierarchical levels and having them locally anchored, the changes could be adapted to fit the business needs and wording. Furthermore, with the setting up of the Multipliers, an organisational infrastructure was put in place that was capable of continuously diffusing new elements of the MLO. The diffusion to the Multipliers and their subsequent adoption was vital since the diffusion of the MLO was to be cascaded through the organisation through them. The Multipliers’ adoption was successfully facilitated by the launch of the MLO. Especially the close co-operation between management and the Multipliers was key in the success of the launch and in the Multipliers’ adoption. The Multipliers acted as change agents that engaged in a fairly successful diffusion process towards their teams. Consequently, the logic behind the MLO has been understood and implemented to a degree in the organisations everyday work. Nevertheless, the reasons for adoption were less strong for the team members compared to the multipliers. The fourth and last phase was the most challenging phase. The diffusion of the MLO was slowed down by the announcement of a large re-organisation within Syngenta. Even before this, difficulties in sustaining the diffusion process had emerged that were related to the lack of a suitable roadmap, that an intended transition of initiative did not occur, and that the Multiplier did not become a true community. Proposal: Initiate a Virtual Community of Practice From the results, it is evident that the setting up and launch of the MLO was done mostly successfully, but the most crucial challenges were in sustaining the diffusion process. Especially the re-organisation meant that existing practices would not continue. Consequently, the project proposed to initiate a Virtual Community of Practice (VCoP). “Communities of practice [CoPs] are groups of people who share a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a topic, and who deepen their knowledge and expertise in this area by interacting on an ongoing basis” (Wenger et al., 2002). The value of the VCoP was that it offered a new way in which the Multipliers and the MaSE Leads (Multipliers in Crop Protection) could be united in a common community and begin to generate and diffuse the new integrated offers. By using a VCoP, the process of developing offers, sharing them and introducing them in several territories/countries would be facilitated, meaning that developed offers would have the potential of getting a larger market opportunity. Detailing The literature review regarding VCoP identified that the two most critical roles initially in cultivating a VCoP were management and the coordinator. The detailing of the proposal therefore sought to ensure that both roles would buy-into the proposal. A management proposition was made to convince them of the merit of the VCoP for the organisation. The proposition described the potential value of the community to the organisation and the rationale for supporting it. In addition, the responsibilities of management were covered, of which the selection of the leadership team was explained in depth as this was the connection between the two stakeholders. For the coordinator, the small number of VCoPs in Syngenta implies that any coordinator with the necessary skills in marketing to function as a coordinator would most likely not have any experience in coordinating a VCoP. A way to offset this lack of experience was to provide the coordinator with guidelines on how to set-up, launch, cultivate and sustain a VCoP within the new organisation of Syngenta. The guidelines were developed by compiling literature, results from the analysis and existing internal tools and best practices in a way that fitted with the new organisational context. Evaluation The evaluation of the management proposition and coordinator guidelines was conducted by the project supervisor. In her opinion the proposition of creating a VCoP was good and highly valid for the new organisation. The guidelines were also positively evaluated. They would reduce the amount of re-invention in Syngenta, provide the future coordinator with valuable help, and were clearly structured and understandable to use.","adoption; diffusion; virtual communities of practice; marketing led; launch strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-08-22","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","The following is a graduation project, it is a meticulous study that uses “Actor-centered institutionalism” as a theoretical framework as well as “game theory” and several “policy analysis techniques” to analyze and study Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). It presupposes a hypothetical problem owner, “The United Nations Compact Initiative” (UNCI). The thesis starts with argumentation as to why, an improved version of the currently working model of CSR, would benefit the UNCI. These benefits revolve around establishing a link between business and development. The author’s hypothesis states that an established link between business and development would further improve the possibilities of achieving the “Millennium Development Goals” (MDG), and that the way to establish this link is through an improved version of the CSR model. CSR is a complex issue and many approaches have been used to study it, a literature background review on the subject was performed to clarify values and arguments. These values and arguments were later used as input to design a theoretical game model. These models are highly sensitive to the subjective input of the modeler. The policy analysis techniques along with the simplification tools of ACI provided transparency and a degree of objectivity to the assumptions made in order to design and develop the model. The non-cooperative game model developed is descriptive in nature, it listed the possible outcomes that can be reached given the constraints of the rules put in place. The model and the literature review led the author to conclude that an improved model of CSR would entail: easy access to information, skilled labor in the domain of CSR, and a mixture of self and government regulations to govern corporate industries. Future recommendations to improve the model are making the model more specific as it is a very general and highly aggregated model designed to aid in the identification of the knowledge gaps and domains where macro-policies should be improved. A cooperative game theory approach is suggested as the next step to analyze factors that were not studied in depth in this dissertation. These factors are those of specific coalitions and side-payments.","Game Theory; Actor-Centered Institutionalism; Corporate Social Responsibility; Self-Regulation; Networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Slob, E.C. (mentor)","2011","Elastodynamic and electromagnetic processes are coupled together in saturated, porous media, by a phenomenon known as the electrokinetic effect. In horizontally layered media, the seismoelectric system, which contains the coupled elastodynamic and electromagnetic systems, can be separated into two independent modes of propagation: SH-TE and P-SV-TM. The SH-TE mode contains horizontally polarized shear waves coupled with transverse electric polarized electromagnetic waves. In the P-SV-TM mode, both fast and slow compressional waves are coupled with vertically polarized shear waves and transverse magnetic polarized electromagnetic waves. In this thesis, the P-SV-TM mode of the two-dimensional seismoelectric system was expressed in the form of both the two-way and one-way wave equations. The principle of normalizing energy flux across boundaries was applied, improving the matrix amplitude balance of the system and allowing for the implementation of one-way reciprocity theorems. We carried out full-waveform modelling of the flux-normalized P-SV-TM seismoelectric system in a 2-D fluid-saturated, horizontally-stratified, porous media. Both one-way and two-way wavefields were modelled, allowing the composition of one-way wavefields into two-way wavefields to be clearly observed. We investigated both the generation of electromagnetic fields due to the propagation of a seismic pertubation and the generation of seismic waves due to the propagation of a diffusive electromagnetic wave. Reciprocity of the wavefields was verified by applying reciprocity theorems to both one-way and two-way wave vectors. The electromagnetic field that is created when a seismic wave traverses a contrast in medium parameters is rapidly attenuated during propagation. To mitigate the decay in the amplitude of the signal with distance, we modelled a Vertical ElectroSeismic Profiling (VESP) survey, in which receivers could be placed in near proximity to the target layer. In another model, the sensitivity of the seismoelectric method to pore fluid contrasts was tested by simulating the influx of contaminants into an aquifer. It was observed that a small change in the conductivity of the aquifer led to a significant change in the strength of the electromagnetic signal that was generated at the top of the aquifer.","seismoelectric; electroseismic; psvtm; flux-normalization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Applied Geophysics and Petrophysics","",""

(mentor)","2011","Efficiency is becoming nowadays more and more relevant. The more efficient people can perform tasks, the better it is. This is also the case for doing research. The main purpose of this thesis is to gain a permeability- porosity relation of the Delft Sandstone using cuttings, that were gathered during exploration drilling. Cuttings are irregular pieces of rock that are transported to the surface by drilling fluid during exploration drilling. The permeability gives an indication of the flow ability through a rock, while the porosity gives an indication of the storage in a rock. Porosity and permeability measurements on core’s usually need more than one practical work (e.g. flow through a core for permeability determination and Pycnometer measurements for porosity). But on cuttings, only one way of practical work can provide information about the porosity and permeability. By only using image analysis as practical work, porosity and permeability of the Delft Sandstone is obtained in this thesis, which results in a permeability- porosity relation. 3 options are described and used to determine the por.- perm properties. By first selecting sandstone aggregates, photographs were made in order to see the grains. Afterwards the grain length and breadth were measured in order to determine a sorting coefficient. This coefficient gives an indication about the porosity. With this porosity and the Carman- Kozeny relation, permeability’s can be obtained. This leads to a por- perm relationship. So the essence is turning length and breadth into sorting and then using this to estimate porosity’s and afterwards permeability’s.","porosity; permeability; image analysis","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

The main reasons are reducing noize, emissions and congestion on the roads, creating a much more pleasant urban environmment. For TNT Express these developments pose problems for their deliveries and pickups, but as a very environmentally concerned company these problems provide a driving force to innovate in their processes in a sustainable way. Project City Logistics consists of multiple concepts regarding innercity deliveries. The focus is not exclusively on sustainability, but finding ways to retain access to the innercity and being flexible in deliveries and pickups. This project is about innercity deliveries using electrically assisted tricycles. The subject of this thesis is the development of a mobile depot, to be situated between TNT’s hub at Brucargo and the centre of Brussels. It will provide a storage and sorting centre for TNT parcels and the loading place for the tricycles. The tricycles will then be used to transport the parcels the ‘last mile’ to the delivery addresses in the inner-city. This way the tricycles’ supply is very effective, and reduces distances greatly. The mobile depot will also offer ‘value added services’ for the customer, such as the possibility for drop-off and pick-up at the mobile depot. The project consisted of defining the requirements for the design. These were set by multiple departments regarding safety, work environment, security of consignments etc. The advancing insight eventually led to a concept proposal. The concept is presented in 3D CAD renders and an animation. The drawings will be used to build the first fully functional Mobile Depot for a pilot in Brussels.","express; logistics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""
