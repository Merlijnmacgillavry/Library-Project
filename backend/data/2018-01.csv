(mentor); Kuiper, Coen (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Wind energy from the North Sea is one of the solutions to achieve the climate goals of the Paris agreement. The Dogger Bank, a North Sea sandbank, has a lot of potential for wind energy due to the relatively shallow location and good wind conditions. An artificial island creates even more opportunities, because alternating energy can be converted here into direct current. An island will also make the construction and maintenance of the windmills cost-effective. The Dogger Bank, however, is part of Natura2000 area, for which strict legislation applies. To design a stable island coastal defence, which contributes to the North Sea ecology, it is researched how natural value could be added to make the island licensable.<br/><br/>The flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) has been chosen as an umbrella species, a species that creates an environment in which a large group of other species can benefit. The disappearance of the present ecology by building an island can be counteracted by restoring an oyster habitat. To obtain the boundary conditions for a successful oyster bed, research was done into the relationship between the bed shear stress and the historic presence of oyster beds. The shear stress boundary condition for the highest significant waves was 119.8 N/m2 while the shear stress due to the average significant wave climate must stay between 2.5 and 10.3 N/m2. The orientation of the coastal protection, the depth, the profiles (as the presence of a reef or foreshore) and the chosen material are decisive factors for success of oyster beds. Concluded is that opportunities are available in the coastal defence. In typical cross-section are only few areas suitable. For the most exposed side (330-360ºN), it is opportune for oyster beds to grow around the toe and foreshore when located in water deeper than -25.0 m MSL. At the least exposed side (120-150ºN) this is -18.0 m MSL. Reefs and prolonged foreshores are expected to be efficient for creating larger nature enhancing surfaces.<br/><br/>The design and three-dimensional consequences of the suggested measures are recommended to study into detail. In addition, the biotic factors and the method of initiation of oyster beds will have to be further investigated to obtain more information about successfully creating oyster beds around an island on the Dogger Bank.<br","North Sea; Artificial island; Nature Based Design Element; Oyster reefs; Coastal defense","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","55.00, 3.70"

An investigation of social and spatial processes outlines the ever changing society and urban space of Malmö within the large context of globalisation, migration and urbanisation. The city has been transformed from an industrial city towards a knowledge society with a focus to become an attractive, environmental friendly city. On the other hand, the city struggles with challenges related to ethnic and cultural diversity, increasing inequalities and a changing political climate. These contradictions are felt in the collective urban life in public space with increasing segregation and exclusion. A prospect to foster an inclusive city is shaped highlighting the process and design aspects of inclusion and a transition towards a ‘participation society’. A development model shows the aspects of an inclusive public space which links public space to a public culture. An inclusive design is developed between Hyllie, Holma and Kroksbäck, with the conceptual reinterpretation of a political metaphor ‘people’s home’. It takes the spatial aspects of a home literally, by creating a modular structure of ‘rooms’ which is continuously in transition. It builds up over time and many people and organisations have to participate. Creating this place in between two fundamentally different areas and social groups is an idealised scenario of the future, where inequality is reduced and perceptions about others are changed. It is a way to imagine a city where people have learned to live with each other.","Inclusion; Public space; Social inequality; Welfare state; Process thinking; Malmö; Hyllie; Holma-Kroksbäck","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","55.569035, 12.978050"

River training measures can be implemented in order to mitigate these problems. An alternative to conventional river training works is the closure of a channel within the braided network. Until recent there has been no systematic research on channel closure and guidelines or recommendations were absent. Recent simulations with numerical models on sand-bed braided rivers investigated both the effects of channel closure around the island and on the braided network. The results of these studies have their limitations and validation with physical models or pilot tests are necessary. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to obtain a better understanding of the local morphodynamic effects of interventions aiming at channel closure in braided rivers.<br/><br/>This has been done by conducting flume experiments with a simplified section of a braided river with gravel-bed similarity. At first the laboratory experiment was designed such that a stable and reproducible planform developed. A section, consisting of an upstream fixed Y-shaped confluence followed by an alluvial island surrounded by two channels and fixed outer banks, was used to systematically study the local effects of channel closure. The obtained results were analyzed and compared with the numerical studies of Ostanek Jurina (2017) and Schuurman et al.

Since the Canadian north is to more than 98% untouched, uncontrolled growth of traditional building complexes must not destroy nature as is already did in the south. The concept suggests combining two aspects of Canadian past with one of the future. The declared goal is not to destroy any more nature by infrastructure of insensible build-ings for tourism. The site of the Diavik Diamond Mine has been chosen for two things: First, to re-naturalize the area by money made from tourism. Second, to build an invisible starting point for Eco-Tourism in this area. The huge holes, which have been the result of a process called open-pit-mining, are a perfect spot to implement a building on a site from which nature was already banished. Another main point is to use the old airfield as infrastructure for tourism. No additional streets need to be built. The aim is to create a resource efficient and fully autocratic building complex for arctic Eco-Tourism. This complex will mainly offer temporary accommodation for tourists.

Composites are considered highly versatile materials that offer great tailoring on their design. Synthetic fibers and resins are already quite popular especially in applications where low weight, construction speed and high performance are the objectives. However, environmental concerns over the disposability of non-recycle composites is driving the engineering world towards the use of natural composites. Certain natural fibers appear to be advantageous not only in terms of mechanical properties but also in terms of sustainability compared to synthetic ones. However, environmental performance of bio materials is difficult to assess and predict due to their large natural variability. Durability assessment through literature review and optimization of the superstructure of an FRP bridge, accounting for failure modes mostly deriving from high concentrated vertical loading (wheel loading), are the main objectives of this report. In order to deal with the large number of variables and constraints for the design according to existing structural standards, advanced optimization algorithms are employed. In addition, due to lack of analytical formulas for local buckling resistance prediction, Finite Element (FE) analysis is used since it offers a better insight into buckling failure of composite laminates. Finally, an optimization workflow is developed that accounts for all variables and constraints and minimizes the objective, which in this case is the weight of the superstructure. The obtained results form recommendations for the optimum design of a flax and glass FRP bridge, regarding the thicknesses and orthotropy of the cross section’s laminates with L/300 and L/500 maximum deflection requirement, providing a deck slenderness L/16 and a spacing of the web sw = hSP /3. The assessment and the optimization reveals that flax or BioMid FRP could be promising candidates in replacing synthetic fibers for a bridge application as they can compete in performance and weight the synthetic glass FRP for the case of single span bridge and a span range of 10 - 30m.","Bio-based; FRP; Bridge; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This can cause reservoir compaction, subsidence, fault reactivation and / or seismicity. As these effects may greatly influence society it is of importance to find accurate methods to describe them so they can be predicted or even better, mitigated.<br/><br/>This thesis discusses a new analytical approach to calculate stress in the subsurface which incorporates the effects of differential compaction on the initiation of fault reactivation. This new approach is named Differential Compaction Loading (DCL) and the reason for its development is due to discrepancies observed between calculations using the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, also known as Poro-elastic Loading (PEL), and field observations.<br/><br/>Geomechanical modelling was performed to assess fault failure sensitivity to a range of geometrical aspects as well as reservoir and fault properties. From this analysis, focusing on the reactivation pressure at which failure first occurs, an empirical sense of sensitivity was established. It was found that for the examined variations in the geometry the fault dip angle resulted in the largest spread in reactivation pressure. For the examined reservoir and fault properties, the friction angle was found to have the largest sensitivity.<br/><br/>With these results it was possible to improve the estimates of essential parameters within the analytical approach, yielding a better fit between analytical and modelled solutions. These solutions lie closer to field observations. Hence, the new method of DCL shows a great improvement in calculation of stresses in the subsurface, compared to the method of PEL. This calibrated analytical approach allows for a quick assessment of the fault stability within a reservoir. Additionally, through the results from the geomechanical model new insights were obtained into the way stresses change and behave when a reservoir is depleted. The rotation of the principal stresses for each level of depletion was quantified and a new definition of the critical fault angle, the dip angle which will fail first, was derived. This links the depletion pressure and related rotation angle directly to a value of the new critical fault angle when DCL is present.<br/><br/>Ultimately, these new insights into fault failure behaviour of boundary faults could be a useful tool in the step towards prediction and mitigation of production or injection related seismicity.<br","Differential Compaction; Fault reactivation; Fault failure sensitivity; Analytical approach; FEM with Plaxis; Depleting Reservoirs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

This allows us to represent controversial or split opinions much more accurately than previous systems, so the user can select which opinion is more relevant for them to find a similar item.

Insight in the location and daily rhythms of users within the building form valuable input for many decision-making processes within campus management. Unlike the outdoor environment, where the position is easily obtained through omnipresent satellite-based positioning systems such as GPS, the use of these systems in indoor environments is limited. Various implementations of indoor positioning systems try to fill this gap and provide indoor positioning capabilities. However, the complex indoor environment presents its own challenges regarding positioning. The effectiveness of current implementations varies depending on techniques and methods used, while often being limited to function only within small test bed environments. Privacy, cost, scalability, ease of integration in the environment and many other decisive factors steer the choice for certain indoor positioning systems. Within this research the focus is on the development of a non-intrusive network-based indoor positioning system using Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi has clear advantages over other measuring techniques in that these systems are ubiquitous, cost-effective and their use is multi-faceted. Now over 85% of the users carry a smartphone. These off-the-shelf, unmodified smartphones and other Wi-Fi-enabled mobile devices can be used as mobile stations to indicate user locations through an iterative positioning process. Besides the mobile stations, existing Wi-Fi infrastructures and networking equipment can be re-used with minor adaptations. The following research question was addressed in this research: 'To what extent can indoor Wi-Fi positioning be used for indoor localisation in order to determine occupancy rhythms and movement patterns within and between rooms to support campus management?'. The research question was approached starting with exploring the different techniques and methods suited for indoor positioning or localisation. The case study was used to review and develop a system suitable for indoor campus environments. As the case study requires a non-intrusive and low-cost solution that functions without active user participation a signal propagation-based technique was chosen. Distances were estimated employing the signal strength metadata extracted from various 802.11 management frames originating from user mobile devices. Various influences on the Wi-Fi signals were identified and a solution to counteract those influences was designed in the form of a differential Wi-Fi system using a grid of interconnected reference stations. With the use differential Wi-Fi correction parameters the positioning improved by mitigating for temporal environmental influences that are continuously present in indoor environments. Next, based on a comparison of different methods, a multilateration method was developed as the core of the positioning system. The multilateration algorithms combined with various filtering algorithms provide for a highly maintenance-free system with minimal manual set-up required. As the environment changes new training data is automatically acquired for ready-use. All algorithms were designed to work both in (near) real-time as well as non real-time, with configurable processing delays of at least 10 seconds. The longer delays allow for more observations, while the shorter delays are better for moving users and fast updates. Accuracies of 2 meters at the lower bounds are reported, ranging up to the 10 meter mark due to Wi-Fi characteristics. Various filtering and post-processing mechanisms were designed to generate accurate mappings from mobile devices to user counts. Furthermore, in the preparation phase different geometries were tested with reference stations 10 to 20 meters apart from each other. Preferred spatial geometries were matches as closely as possible for the deployment of the system in a real-world test case scenario. The designed reference stations were deployed in the Architecture faculty building to monitor occupancy and movement patterns before, during and after a fire drill. Ground truth was acquired using BLE wrist bands and manual counting. The fire drill had different elements: counting the number of users per m2 and per room, the occupancy rhythms over time and the movement patterns. Overall during 48% of the uncontrolled testing a 100% match between BLE wrist band equipped user counts and Wi-Fi counts was achieved. In 77% of the cases there was a 1 person difference in counting, where in more than 95% of the cases the maximum difference was 4 persons. In conclusion, with this localisation system the occupancy rhythms and movement patterns of users can be measured to a large extent to aid in the various tasks of campus management, e.g. planning, and safety evacuations.","indoor localisation; indoor positioning; Wi-Fi tracking; campus management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

A mechanical signal (pulling) from a cineplastic site or a harness system (e.g. shoulder harness) is used to control a prosthetic device. These signals are often too weak to comfortably control the prosthesis leading to fatigue and discomfort. The goal of the thesis was to develop a prosthesis supplying supportive force allowing amputees to use smaller input forces to operate the device. A prototype was realized as a cable-controlled voluntary closing device with an external power support for the force amplification. Easily manufacturable designs and cheap commercial products were preferred while designing the prototype. The mass, pinch force, input cable force, input cable excursion and locking mechanism efficiency were measured using different configurations, and then compared to each other and to commercial products.<br/><br/>The support system was able to reduce the necessary input force needed to pinch 15N by 60%, and increase the achieved pinch using a 50N input force by 340%. The system performance was highly dependent on the control gains and the input cable speed. Increased controller gains and decreased input velocity had a similar effect resulting in a higher output force while degrading controllability. After a short training session (30 min) using a prosthesis simulator I was able to use a pair of tweezers to pick and place pieces of wire. The system showed very promising results allowing to decrease the needed force for operating the device; however, the force amplification system has an effect on the feedback quality which should be investigated before making any definitive conclusions. The device can serve as a basis to investigate the effects of control methods on assistive body-powered prostheses.","prostheses; body-powered; Upper-limb; cineplasty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-31","","","","","",""

In the past, the focus has been on optimizing the shell. Due to the increasing regulations placed on the shell design, the scope for manoeuvring in this area is greatly limited. This increases the necessity to focus on the less explored option of propulsion in rowing. The propulsion is caused by the momentum transfer from the rowers to the water with the help of oar blades. The design of these oar blades has also been extensively studied. However, knowledge on the effect of the air-water interface on the drag force on the oar blades is still lacking. Therefore, visualizing the flow around the oar blades will lead to better understanding of the flow structures, which would help in optimizing the drag force acting on the oar blades. <br/><br/>In the present study, a simplified scenario of a rectangular flat plate moving normally to its plane along a straight line and parallel to the free surface has been studied using hydrogen bubble visualization and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Using a 4-axes industrial robot and a force/torque transducer, the effect of the air-water interface on the drag force on the plate has been studied at a Reynolds number, based on the longest edge of the plate, of 6×10<sup>4</sup>. The analysis of the drag force profiles at different plate depths led to the identification of a high drag case, which occurred at a plate depth <i>h</i> of 20 mm. The hydrogen bubble visualization indicated that in this specific case, the high drag was related to the formation of a compact wake behind the plate.<br/><br/>Hydrogen bubble visualizations were also performed at two other plate depths,<i> h</i> = 0 and<i> h</i> = 100 mm, to determine the effect of the air-water interface on the flow structures and ultimately on the drag force acting on the plate. The visualization of the deep water case (<i>h</i> = 100 mm) captured the formation of a vortex ring, which was found to have unique effects on the drag force. The presence of the air-water interface was found to significantly influence the drag force on the plate. Additionally, an extensive decomposition of the drag force profile showed a time-dependent added mass force and a decaying force acting on the plate.<br/><br/>Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements were carried out in the horizontal mid-plane of the plate. The tracking of the starting vortex and its disintegration has been identified using the swirling strength analysis. Finally, combining the hydrogen bubble visualization and PIV results, the formation and the development of the starting vortex was identified.","Flat plate; Drag; Air-water interface; Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV); Hydrogen bubble visualization; Rowing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

This paper presents an experimental research to study the coordination behavior of multiple actors using an ecological interface, known as the Solution Space Diagram (SSD), for the Conflict Detection &amp; Resolution (CD&amp;R) tasks. To judge the performance of humans, an automated conflict resolution algorithm, known as the Modified Voltage Potential (MVP), was used as the baseline.Several multi-aircraft scenarios were designed and simulated in a human-in-the-loop experiment. Results show that humans using the SSD display for the CD&amp;R tasks operated safely for the designed scenarios. Compared to the resolutions of the MVP algorithm for the same scenarios, the humans depicted a safer and less efficient approach than the automated algorithm. For future research, attention was brought to aspects participant training in multi-actor experiments.

In addition to the growing demand, new forms of air transport are entering the market. Although a distributed control strategy seems unavoidable to cope with the introduction of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Personal Air Vehicles, research on how this distributed control should be organized has not yet reached consensus. Prior research has demonstrated that structuring airspace into layers results in a lower conflict rate compared to an unstructured airspace. The principles of aircraft dispersion and relative velocity reduction in the layers have a positive effect on airspace capacity, and these principles are further explored in this research. In a large-scale simulation experiment with a mix of different Personal Air Vehicles, the value of defining lateral zones in a departure/arrival area was investigated. By comparing the zones concept with an unstructured airspace concept, it was found that structuring the airspace can act as a conflict prevention mechanism. The added value of the zones becomes more apparent at higher traffic densities. Different zone configurations were evaluated and compared. Simulation results show that a configuration with a higher number of zones results in the lowest overall number of conflicts, at the cost of a slight efficiency loss.","urban airspace; structure; lateral zones; airborne separation assurance; conflict prevention; self-separation; Modified Voltage Potential; Personal Air Vehicle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The method to find trim states is based on interval box consistency. At low speed the method is capable of finding interval enclosures of single trim points with a high accuracy if the minimum number of required control effectors is used. At higher speeds the found accelerations are larger. When looking for a full trim set the method finds continuous bounds on the control effectors for the entire input range in one run. This is a good demonstration of the advantages that interval analysis has over conventional methods that generally can only find one trim point at a time. The found bounds are a maximum of 1 deg wide for each control effector, but despite this the remaining accelerations can be up to 0.5 m/s^2 for linear accelerations and up to 10 deg/s^2 for rotational accelerations. Because of these large accelerations the found solutions are not acceptable as trim conditions. On the other hand the potential that interval analysis has as a trimming method is demonstrated, since continuous bounds on trim sets have been found in a single run. This is a feat that no other trimming method has yet accomplished. Further research is needed to exploit the full potential of interval trim methods so that the results can be used for other purposes such as flight envelope prediction.","Interval analysis; Innovative Control Effectors; Aircraft trim","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Due to their unique feature, the crane, failure of the vessels results in large financial consequences. Previous experience showed that these costs could be mitigated with easily/timely available spare-parts. The main aim of this study was to increase the reliability of Mercurius Shipping Group's container-crane vessel MKS Mercurius by proposing an optimized spare-part inventory. Subsequently, by doing so, reducing the total costs of operating and maintaining the vessel and ensuring profit maximization for MSG. Cost models have been developed to quantify the reduction in financial risk of failures, by having spare-parts directly available, and to determine the costs of keeping a spare-part inventory. As a result a list of spare-parts is proposed based on a comparison between the reduced failure impact/costs (benefit), with a spare-part in inventory, and the corresponding annual inventory costs. The results showed that a cost-effective improvement to vessel reliability, due to a decrease in vessel downtime, can be achieved with direct availabiltiy of spare-parts kept in inventory. Currently equipped with two container-crane vessel the optimum inventory consists of 13 components, requiring an investment of €50,000 and leading to an improvement to the vessels financial performance of €13,000 per year. In case MSG decides to relocate one of the container-crane vessels, the impact of failure increases. In this case the recommended inventory should be expanded to 28 components, requiring an investment of €137,000 and leading to an improvement to the vessels financial performance of €55,000 per year.","Inland Shipping; Reliability; Maritime; Crane","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-21","","","","Marine Technology | Shipping Management","",""

The method proposed in this paper uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) algorithms for estimating the degradation level of the crossing and suppressing deviations caused by various inputs so that defects on the crossing can be detected in the early stage. The method is evaluated using a real-life dataset from a crossing located in Amsterdam. Different architectures are proposed and tested. With one of the architectures (ConvNet), the degradation level of the crossing can be estimated with minimum deviations (2.03 \% MSE). Other architectures performed in the range of 3.49 to 3.05 \% MSE.

A big advantage of it is that surrogate models (models based on these techniques) offer reliable results by being computationally cheaper than other candidate models. The savings in computational time is usually paramount for problems that involve a lot of variables and parameters and many iterative processes. <br/><br/>In the wind energy industry in particular, the design of the best layout of the wind farm is a problem that has been presented in the literature as an optimization problem; that is, a problem to optimize the wind farm layout in respect to some objective the modeler deems appropriate. More often than not, maximizing the expected power of the layout is mainly considered as this objective. The layout's expected power is -- among other things -- heavily dependent on the layout and the wake interactions between the turbines. The iterative search among many layouts to find the best one can be done with the help of a well-known optimization tool, the binary genetic algorithm. However, this tool cannot work alone, it solely facilitates the search over an adequate number of candidate solutions. To make it work, the modeler should provide it with some model that assesses how good in terms of the objective that has been set.<br/><br/>In this thesis therefore, the theory, the development and the use of two models of interest are investigated: Gaussian Process Regression (a surrogate model) and the Monte Carlo Method (a method based on random sampling). Great care was given to compile the theoretical basis of these models in order to be a good reference point for the non-experienced reader. The nature of these two models differs quite a bit, but they both can be used by the modeler to yield interesting results. These results will be compared to each other and against a third model's results, a specific wake model. This third model is the Original Model which the Gaussian Process Regression model and the Monte Carlo Method model utilize and compare against. The reliability of the results and computational speed will be the measure of success and ranking for these three models.<br/><br/>Finally, the comparison of the three models continues in how potent they are to propose an optimized layout for a wind farm. Each of the three models is coupled with the binary genetic algorithm that is developed specifically to connect with them. Afterwards, the proposed best layouts are discussed. The results show that the Gaussian Process Regression model performs reliably and very fast in comparison to the Original model. On the other hand, the Monte Carlo model, although also fast when it is used to find an optimized layout, could not be verified that it performs reliably and therefore, its results cannot be trusted without going into further investigation. After the comparison, further discussion follows with some recommendations for future research.","Gausssian Process Regression; Surrogate modelling; Monte-Carlo; Genetic Algorithm; Layout Optimization; Stochastic Process; Offshore wind turbines; Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

It can be used for production history matching, performance forecasting and field development. A common Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) method is the injection of miscible gases. With the injection of gas into an oil reservoir, the system has to be considered as multiphase and multicomponent. Compositional simulation gives an accurate representation of the physics of multiphase and multicomponent systems. Solving the system at a high resolution with the compositional description is computationally very intensive. Simulating at a lower resolution with a coarse grid reduces the computational loads, but it becomes less accurate. Upscaling procedures are used to convert the high resolution, fine scale simulation parameters to lower resolution, coarse scale simulation parameters. <br/><br/>In this research, an upscaling procedure is examined that uses a thermodynamic non-equilibrium correction to keep a high accuracy for the coarse scale compositional simulation. This non-equilibrium phenomena is represented by a source term in the thermodynamic equilibrium equation. This source term is obtained from a fine scale simulation and upscaling the phase compositions. The source terms are tabulated against the composition and are used in the coarse scale simulation. An isothermal system with number components and number of phases is considered in this research. The capillary and diffusive effects are neglected as well as the chemical reactions and adsorption. For the fine scale, a 2D grid of 102x20 is used and the coarse scale grid is 1D with 102x1 cells. The fine scale simulation is run using Automatic Differentiation General Purpose Research Simulator (AD-GPRS) and the coarse scale simulation is run with an IMPEC simulator written in Matlab.<br/><br/>To quantify the accuracy of the coarse scale simulation a misfit value is calculated between the coarse scale saturation distribution and the upscaled fine scale saturation distribution. <br/>Comparing the coarse saturation distribution with the upscaled saturation distribution shows that this method allows high accuracy results to be maintained with non-equilibrium upscaling of the compositional flow. <br/><br/>A correlation is made between the source term and composition and used in a coarse simulation instead of the tables created from the fine scale simulation. This reduces the accuracy compared to the fine scale, but it still gives a satisfactory improvement of coarse scale results. To improve the accuracy of the simulation using the correlation, an optimization procedure is performed. The optimization improved the accuracy to the level of the accuracy of the simulation using the full source term tables. With a correlation between the source term and composition, the global fine scale compositional solution is no longer necessary for the coarse simulation.<br","Upscaling; Compositional; Non-Equilibrium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Zoos are both loved and despised by people. Loved for their ability to bring people closer to exotic wildlife and despises for the ethics of keeping exotic animals in captivity. The existence of zoos is more and more challenged by animal right activists, yet today a zoo can be found in almost every big city and are annually visited by millions of people, but will this be the same in the future? Although many people regard them as a primary recreation attraction, modern zoos are also valuable conservation, education, and research centres.<br/><br/>The research focusses finding a method for sustainable exotic wildlife exhibition within our urban environment. This is achieved by developing a Zoo Evaluation Tool, to give insight in the complex system that the zoo is and to analysis for each zoo how it is preforming on various aspects or components. The tool doesn’t propose or implies a perfect or ideal future zoo but helps to indicate what the current conditions of a zoo are.

The objectives of the zoo can be evaluated in four aspects education, research, conservation and research, from which conservation will be of prime importance for the future zoo to be viable in or society. The urban fabric has been broken up in the aspects of edge, mixed functions and accessibility. Currently the zoo is a gated community within the urban environment, the future zoo needs to open to the urban environment to allow a mutually beneficial dialogue between city and wildlife. The lay-out of the zoo and method of exhibition tells a lot about the relationship humans have towards wildlife and nature. On macro, meso and micro this influences the animal welfare and visitor experience. The future zoo needs to allow the animal to live as free and natural as possible and offer the visitor a trip to this imported wilderness within the city. <br/><br/>To change the current zoo into a future zoo, based on the Zoo Evaluation Tool, guidelines and design principles have been proposed. In a case study design for the Rotterdam Zoo the tool, guidelines and design principles have been applied.

However, one of the problems Amsterdam encounters is the fact that the housing stock appears to be scarce. Especially for the low- and mid-income group it is very difficult to find suitable housing. The main reason why more and more people are looking for rental property in the middle segment is because this group of people do not qualify for social housing and are locked out of home ownership, due to a lack of income and savings. The mid income group is therefore large and diverse, consisting of singles, couples and families that strongly contribute to the socio-economic power of the Metropolitan region of Amsterdam.<br/>The so-called ‘Woonagenda 2025’ (Housing Agenda 2025), a framework and directional document for residential policy in Amsterdam until 2025, finds great shortages in mid-sector rental housing. Therefore the municipality of Amsterdam is committed to realizing more affordable housing for the middle class in the price range of € 710, - and € 1.100, - per month. As a result Amsterdam strives to build 20.000 new mid-sector rental homes by 2025. This new development in the mid-rent sector reduces the pressure on the housing market and increases the success rate for the middle income group. This leads to a more differentiated, attractive and undivided city of Amsterdam, in all parts of the city. Another advantage is that, moving people with middle income from the social sector to suitable middle-class sector creates opportunities for new entrants in the social housing sector.<br/>Availability of suitable living space for employees in the business sector and public sector (teachers, nursing staff, assistants, etc.) promotes the business environment and the quality of the city and is thus the basis for further economic growth.<br/>The aim of my graduation project is to develop housing for the free market rental segment with a rent between € 710 and € 1,100. The project mainly focusses on housing young professionals (people in their 20s and 30s who are employed in a profession), by designing affordable dwellings which meet the needs of mid-income households.","Mid-income; Rental Housing; Affordability; Amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.37871, 4.878822"

Although bigger curvatures can be achieved with hot bent glass, it requires non-reusable moulds in the fabrication process, whereas cold bent glass does not. This can lower investment costs. This is especially interesting for high strength thin glass, because high curvatures are easily reached by the elastic (cold) bending technique.<br/> To bend flat glass into a double curved shape, the glass can be twisted, resulting in two curvatures in the opposite direction (anticlastic). The technique that is currently used to twist glass is based on a metastable position which depends on the capability of sustaining compressive forces. The thinner the glass, the earlier compressive stresses cause a buckling phenomenon. The radius of the anticlastic curvature reached with the current technique depends therefore on the thickness of the glass. <br/> Replacing conventional glass by high strength thin glass results in a single bent curvature, instead of an anticlastic curvature. Considering the high amount of prestress, high strength thin glass is capable of transferring high tensile stresses and an alternative twisting technique might be more appropriate, that is based on a high tensile stress capability, instead of a low compressive stress capacity. This research explores the great potentials of high strength thin glass by applying an alternative technique that adds tension to the twisting, which in this research is referred to as ‘three-dimensional tensioning technique’.<br/> This study starts by analysing differences in material- and mechanical properties between high strength thin glass and the familiar glass (thicker and less tempered Soda-Lime-Silicate glass) commonly used as a construction material. Currently, the twisting technique that is used appears to be insufficient because of strong membrane behaviour in the high strength thin glass. <br/> Structural performance of high strength thin glass is tested for pure in-plane tensile strength. In this experimental analysis a non-standard test method is used and compared with currently used methods for materials that have ductile or brittle mechanical behaviour. <br/> Several connection methods are illustrated that enable an anticlastic curvature. From a SWOT-analysis it is concluded that the connection needs to be characterized by a discontinuous elastic modulus, or stiffness, along the edge surface, that is able to transfer high tension, yet is strainable to fill the gap-tolerance when creating a hypar (hyperbolic paraboloid) surface. <br/> In this research an optimisation is carried out of a side supported glass element based on an FE-analysis that shows the capability of high strength thin glass used as tensile membrane structure.","Thin Glass; High strength; Chemically Strengthened; Cold bending; Stiff Structural Fabric","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Analysing how flood-proof the spatial plan is, therefore becomes more important. Since most spatial planners have limited knowledge concerning flood risk, the Netherlands’ Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management commissioned the creation of an instrument that can be used by planners to gain a better insight into the flood risk. However, this instrument is used inadequately. This research focuses on the question: What are design requirements for an instrument that helps to assess flood risk during spatial planning processes? And, what does this set of requirements mean for the design and use of the current MLS Explorer?<br/><br/>This resulted in the findings that lead to a programme of requirements, the main findings were:<br/>(1) The best moment to use the Explorer is early in the spatial planning process; (2) The Explorer is most interesting for local government organisations such as municipalities and water boards; (3) The information that is presented must be understandable and useful, a list of information items is distilled from flood risk analyses that were found in the different case-studies; (4) Finally, the presentation format should be adjusted into a more visionary way to make the Explorer easier for spatial planners to use. On the basis of these results and the interview findings, a programme of requirements was compiled. The instrument should:<br/>1. Be accessible and rapid to use<br/>2. Provide understandable output<br/>3. Be flexible<br/>4. Be credible<br/>5. Be easy to use for communication purposes and official planning documents<br/>6. Provide sufficient information for a decent flood-risk assessment<br/><br/>The current Explorer was assessed on these six requirements. Its overall score was insufficient, but the gap between the current version and the ideal version is not very large. The Explorer received the best score on the first and last requirements, since it is accessible (requirement 1) via the internet and it takes about 5 minutes to analyse one geographical area, and it presents sufficient information for a decent flood risk assessment (requirement 6). However, for the remaining four requirements, improvement is possible. The understandability (requirement 2) for spatial planners could be increased by using terms and figures that are commonly employed in that field. Increased flexibility (requirement 3) would serve two purposes: making the instrument more interesting for users with varying degrees of background knowledge, and making it more suitable for exploring an area by testing different scenarios. The Explorer’s credibility (requirement 4) should be improved by fixing bugs that make the instrument unreliable. The instrument’s suitability for communication (requirement 5) between parties at the beginning of the spatial planning process could also be enhanced. Such adjustments would facilitate meaningful conversations instead of first needing to wait for the release of research reports. <br/>Based on these requirements, this thesis gives a suggestions for a new design in order to give a concrete idea for adjustments that could improve the quality of the MLS Explorer.<br","Multi-Level Safety; Flood Risk; knowledge management; Information Management; RAKID; DIKAR; spatial planning; Flood risk management; design process; instrument","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

It should be designed to melt if an accident occurs, allowing the MSFR to drain before it incurs structural damage.<br/>Two freeze plug concepts have been considered in recent years, in which the plug is melted either through the decay heat produced in the core, or through heat generated by special heating rings and stored in steel blocks adjacent to the freeze plug. Variations consisting of both a single freeze plug, and multiple smaller plugs contained in a metal plate, have been proposed. This work seeks to evaluate the feasibility of these designs and study how parameters such as the sub-cooling of the plug affect melting times. Additionally, an alternative, wedge-shaped freeze plug design is proposed for increased reliability. <br/>Simulations performed in COMSOL showed that the decay heat plug melts within 600 s only if placed within 0.01 m of the mixed core flow. Because such a placement makes the plug vulnerable to temperature and velocity fluctuations in the core during regular operation of the reactor, this design is considered unfeasible and is not recommended for further study. On the other hand, melting times under 600 s were possible with the heating ring design for a range of sub-cooling amounts and plug configurations, suggesting that this<br/>design is promising. A thin frozen layer was shown to form on top of the metal grate in the multi-plug configurations, preventing heat transfer through the top of the plate. Although the melting behavior of this layer warrants further investigation, its insulating effect was found to generally cause the single-plug designs to melt faster than the multi-plug designs.<br/><br/>A simplified, isothermal model of the wedge-shaped plug was simulated using the enthalpy-porosity approach to account for convection. To model the sinking of the wedge, an extended Darcy term approach was developed based on an analytical solution which was validated experimentally, with good agreement. This model shows that melting of the wedge is unsteady, and that melting times depend linearly on the wedge angle and sub-cooling. Unfortunately, melting times of the wedge plug could not be estimated with realistic, non-isothermal, time-dependent boundary conditions.

Many algorithms have been developed to accelerate this operation, some of which use accelerators such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). However, most of the previous work was focused on computation-intensive operations such as (de)compression, because the interface between the FPGA and the host can only provide relatively low bandwidth.\par<br/><br/>However, new generation high-bandwidth, low-latency interfaces to interconnect host processors and accelerators such as the open coherent accelerator processor interface(OpenCAPI) provide FPGAs with new opportunities to accelerate database operations. In this thesis, we explore the potential of using OpenCAPI-attached FPGAs to accelerate multi-way joins. Via the OpenCAPI, the FPGA can obtain a high-bandwidth communicating with CPUs and the main memory at 25.6GB/s. We first investigate the previous research in software-based multi-way joins and observe that this operation is limited by the bandwidth of main memory. Thus, the main challenge of designing the accelerator emerges as avoiding unnecessary memory accesses. We partition the build relations into the size that can build a hash table in Block RAMs (BRAMs), and avoid multiple-pass memory accesses. In our design, the intermediate join phase is pipelined with a partition phase to reduce the size of the intermediate results. The proposed design is configurable for the attached bandwidth, and it can achieve a throughput of 5 GB/s when a 25.6 GB/s bandwidth is provided.","Heterogeneous acceleration; FPGAs; Hash join; Multi-way Join; The relational database; TPC-H; OpenCAPI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","","51.998758, 4.373626"

This thesis studies one such accelerator, a decompressor for Parquet files compressed with the Snappy library. Our design targets reconfigurable logic (FPGAs) attached via the open coherent accelerator processor interface(OpenCAPI) at 25.6GB/s. We give an overview of the previous research in hardware-based (de)compression engines and present and analyze our design. Much of the challenge of designing the decompression engine stems from the need to process more than one token per cycle. In our design, a single engine can process two tokens per cycle. A Xilinx KU15P FPGA is expected to support multiple such engines. The input throughput and the output throughput ranges of a single engine are 3.9$\sim$6.3 bytes/cycle and 8.3$\sim$15 bytes/cycle, respectively. Based on the implementation results, a single engine of the proposed design could work at 140MHz, meaning 0.51$\sim$0.82 GB/s input throughput or 1.08$\sim$1.96 GB/s output throughput. The Parquet format enables the parallel decompression of multiple blocks when multiple units are instantiated. With the latest generation of FPGAs, we estimate at most 28 units can be supported leading to a total input/output bandwidth of 14.28/30.24 to 22.96/54.88 GB/s. Because the output bandwidth can exceed the interface bandwidth if multiple engines are supported, the design is especially effective when combined with a filter engine that reduces the output size.","FPGA; Snappy; Parquet; hardware decompression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

These models are used in various applications, from which many expects a homogeneous Level of Detail (LoD). Validating the accuracy of the LoD of a model requires the inference its LoD class and its conformance to the real-world object. This process quickly becomes infeasible for large models when done manually. Yet there is no automatic method for LoD inference and validation. Therefore the thesis proposes a method to automatically infer the geometric LoD (LoD0-2.3) in 3D city models.<br/><br/>A central aspect of this work is the use of machine-learning to classify building models based on their LoD. It follows the assumption that a process is possible where a classifier trained in a synthetic 3D city model containing all LoD classes, and applied in real city model. Therefore ten geometry measures (features) are computed from the objects and tested with six classification algorithms. The six experiments the transferability of a classifier from the synthetic city model to the real one, multi-class (LoD0-2.3) and binary (LoD2 or not) classification, and the effect of LoD class imbalance by introducing various amounts of LoD1 objects into the LoD2 model. Furthermore, by using a point cloud as ground truth, this explored the possibility of validating the inferred LoD classes.<br/><br/>The results indicate that the classifier is not transferable to the real data set when trained on the synthetic city model, which is probably due to the significant difference in object shapes between the two models. Binary classification outperforms the multi-class case and it is favourable for LoD validation where the main question is whether the model conforms the stated LoD or not.

Offshore vessels must survive all weather conditions over its lifetime. In heavy storms, waves and ship motions become so large that water flows onto the deck, It is referred to as Green Water and is a serious challenge that needs to be considered in designing offshore vessels. The methods for making green water prediction are limited. More data needs to be collected to ensure safe navigation and operation.<br/><br/>ComFLOW is a numerical tool in the field of Offshore Engineering used to study these non- linear and complex green water phenomena. ComFLOW is a Navier-Stokes solver with Volume of Fluid(VOF) for free surface motion, It has been used for simulation of dam break flows as a model for green water flow on deck and falling objects in calm waters. In this research, it is used to generate dam-break waves along with simulations involving regular and irregular waves leading to water on deck. It is used to evaluate whether dam break model is a complete model for studying green water loading on deck. A grid convergence study for ComFLOW is conducted along with a verification of ComFLOW for 2 dimensions. Optimum grid cell size is advised for accurate and stable results in ComFLOW for 2 dimensions. Dam break simulations are performed on an idealized deck to observe changes from that of a regular domain boundary.<br/><br/>Wave prediction and it’s impact on the topside facilities due to regular and irregular waves is the objective of this research. Absorbing boundary conditions are used to prevent wave reflections. Non-breaking waves are generated for irregular waves. Impact of water on the structure on deck is of primary importance. The wave height is an important parameter in dealing with such green water events. The role of wave height along with the distance of structure on deck is studied in this research. The input parameters such as dam height and distance of the structure from dam height are varied. Localized impact pressures are considered and changes in impact pressure are observed. A structure in regular and irregular waves is also compared with a dam break model. The main conclusions are:<br/>• Variations in dam break loads compare well to theory.<br/>• The dam break is not a complete model for assessing green water loads.","ComFLOW; green water","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The construction sector is also growing, which means that there is also room for starting architects to benefit from this. However, the crisis caused that projects are scarcer than before, which forces starting architects to enter the market with a more commercial attitude. Professionalization and commercialization in the already ‘established’ architectural firms is nothing new, but it is still relatively unknown how starting architects deal with this. This research explored what the business model of starting architectural firms characterizes in the Netherlands. With a questionnaire, insights have been gained regarding the explicit characteristics of starting architectural firms in the Netherlands. According to six case studies the business models of these firms have been studied. Three important characteristics emerged from this research. Firstly, starting architects are often strongly focused on the value proposition and client aspect of the business model. Defining a market position with an appropriate customer profile appeared to be difficult for these firms. Secondly, the epic center (starting point within the business model where change occurs) often lies in the client aspect. In the start-up phase, the business model is mainly determined by what the client demands and less from the value proposition of the firm. The latter characteristic describes a mis-match within the business model of starting architects. Often starting architects have a certain vision and mission, but they generate most of their income with projects that do not fit. With time, experience and an increasing professional network, a transition takes place in the above-mentioned characteristics. This shift indicates a transition from start-up to scale-up. The advice to starting agencies is to consciously draw up a business model. This improves goal orientation and effectiveness, which are important factors in the start-up phase. In short, making a creative new idea a reality requires more than just the idea. A business model contributes to the strategic realization of this, which also makes the agency stand out in the current market.","starting architect; start-up; architectural design management; business model; business model canvas; starting architectural firms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","FuturA",""

Using the incompressible 3D Navier-Stokes equations solver for multiphase phase flows, the so-called interFoam solver un- der OpenFOAM framework, two different models are set up for tackling the two problem statements.<br/><br/>The interFoam evaluation model addressed the issues of computational mesh types which affect the simulation results, and the methods for regulation of water level at the downstream boundary. The two types of the meshes which are used in the research are structured non-orthogonal mesh and unstructured more-orthogonal mesh. The benchmark test is the flow over the weir in the flume. The use of a non-orthogonal mesh could simulate the flow separation which is found downstream of the weir. However the unstructured meshes which are composed of more orthogonal parts and less non-orthogonal parts, could not reproduce the flow separation in 2D simulations correctly for high and small specific discharges. For the 3D simulations, the unstructured meshes apparently simulate the correct flow profile for low specific discharges. In this interFoam evaluation model the control structure or gate is used for maintaining the water level at the downstream boundary. In other words, it uses the physical method of water level boundary condition.<br/><br/>The weir-groyne comparison model is developed with different settings from the former model for the assessment of the differences between weirs and groynes in open-channel flumes. The water level is regulated by a trial-and-error discharge adjustment method making use of inlet and outlet tanks. The mesh type used is the unstructured more-orthogonal mesh in 3D simulations since the severely non-orthogonal meshes introduce numerical artifacts. A variety of weirs and groynes with different slopes are simulated for the comparison of energy losses and streamlines patterns. From the simulation results, the streamlines of the flow over the weir and the groyne are found to be different and the energy head losses also differ between these two structures.<br/><br/>For recommendations, to evaluate the skill of the interFoam solver the 3D simulations for unstructured meshes should be carried out to make sure that they can reproduce the flow sep- aration correctly. The use of a mathematical boundary condition for defining the water level is recommended to avoid the extra computational power for the control structure. To acquire the knowledge of flow around groynes and weirs, the experimental set-ups are recommended, and well-proved non-linear k − ε and k − ω turbulence closure models should be applied in the numerical modellings.","interFoam; groynes; weirs; CFD model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This exponential growth is expected to continue, while it is unsustainable if the power consumption associated with it will grow at the same rate. This calls for better power efficiency, which can usually be found in polar power amplifier architectures. This thesis focuses on the feasibility of a power RF-DAC, with as main focus to seek improvement in power efficiency. As all information up to the RF output is in the digital domain the design will be frequency agile, meaning that operation frequency is only dependent on the external matching network.<br/>As starting point an existing LDMOS technology is considered to implement a power Digital-to-RF-Amplitude Converter (DRAC) with a dedicated CMOS driver. As first demonstrator these two chips could be connected using flip-chip bonding. The proposed combination allows a maximum operation frequency of 3 GHz, providing a peak fundamental output power of 16,6 W with a drain efficiency of 64,4 % at the maximum operation frequency. Since the CMOS driver operates in Class-D a significantly lower average driver power consumption is expected compared to an analog system where a Class-A or Class-AB predriver would be used. This promising concept can change the way how future transmitters could be constructed. In conclusion a performance outlook will be given if a dedicated high power silicon technology that can feature the CMOS drivers would be available for 4G/5G applications.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Cavity buffeting noise is the main contributor to discomfort in sky-dive tunnels. Low frequency noise, generated by self-sustained cavity shear-layer oscillations, similar to automotive sunroof-buffeting noise and side-window buffeting noise, is observed in sky-dive tunnels. Typical low frequencies are not conventionally audible to the human ear: registration of this phenomenon occurs due to the high strength of the oscillations felt on the inner-ear. Long-term exposure to high intensity low frequency noise can be experienced as fatiguing and annoying. A design Study of Streamlines Design BV has shown a fully effective design solution by simulation, which proved to be ineffective in real-life. The current study deals with validation of a different numerical set-up and the analysis of various retrofit designs for the reduction of sky-dive buffeting noise.<br/><br/>Existing literature has shown the promising results for the use of compressible computational fluid dynamics solvers, combined with detached eddy simulation for similar problems. The computational cost of detached eddy simulation has been found within the computational resources for this thesis, opposed to large eddy simulation or direct numerical simulation. For this thesis, the delayed detached eddy simulation model has been used. For the acquisition of validation data a Scanivalve DSA3217 pressure scanner has been used. For computational fluid dynamics and experiments, pressure has been probed at the same location in the cavity. Four retrofit designs have been proposed for analysis in this thesis: trailing edge extension, wall normal cylinder, span wise cylinder and a wing. Simulations have been conducted for one specific tunnel velocity and experiments for a full range of operating set-points.<br/><br/>Simulations have shown reductions of 6.0 dB and 2.6 dB for respectively the trailing edge extension and the wing in sound pressure levels of cavity buffeting noise. Furthermore an increase of 3.6 dB and 1.5 dB have been observed for respectively the span wise cylinder and wall normal cylinder. A reduction of the wake by 5.2% has been observed for the trailing edge extension, where the other designs increased the wake.<br/>For the clear reduction in sound pressure level, introduced by the trailing edge extension, the formation of a larger scale vortex has been delayed downstream compared to the current situation. Visualising the vortices in the case of the span wise cylinder, it has been found that the formation of the large scale vortex has been triggered further upstream compared to the current situation, possibly due to interaction with cylinder vortex shedding. <br/><br/>Comparison of simulation and experiment data has shown errors of 11.8% in sound pressure level for the current situation and 17.6% when the trailing edge extension is employed. The reduction in experiment has been observed to be stronger than in simulation.<br/><br/>An evaluation experiment has shown the effectiveness of the trailing edge extension for all tunnel velocities at which high sound pressure levels have been observed. Reductions between 7.7 dB and 22.6 dB have been observed. Over the whole range of tunnel velocities, the sound pressure level has been reduced to 130.1 dB and below.<br/><br/>Concluding on the thesis work, the numerical model is able to predict a reduction. Following the simulation work the trailing edge extension is most effective in both reducing the noise and maintaining tunnel performance. Furthermore, the trailing edge extension has proved effectiveness for all critical tunnel velocities in experiment.","Buffeting; Sky-dive tunnel; Cavity; CFD; Self-sustained oscillation; Noise; Comfort; Experimental; Validation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Vardon, P.J. (mentor); van Houwelingen, Andries (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","By increase in knowledge and complexity of the projects, worldwide, more attention towards safety provision in projects is being paid. With growth in waterway traffic the need of safety provision for structures crossing navigable waters increases. Especially bridge piers and immersed tunnels on the see floor or at tunnel approaches are at bigger risk of being hit by ships which have lost their navigational course due to any reasons. Therefore availability of collision protective systems is essential. A number of different methods are being used worldwide as protective systems while for the full frontal collision, protective berms are the most convenient systems. This research investigates the possibility of calculations for these berms using numerical modelling tools such as Finite Element Method (FEM) and Material Point Method (MPM). FEM is a well-known and proven tool in engineering world while MPM is a newly developed tool that is considered as an update of FEM. In MPM the material state and stresses are stored in material points that can freely move though the mesh. This tool is highly useful for problems with high expected deformations or dynamic calculations where FEM is not considered as an ideal tool and could fail. Furthermore, also, a simplified analytical method has been presented in this report.<br/>At present MPM is being developed around the world. Plaxis, which is a well-known software developer especially for Geo-Engineering applications, is currently developing software that provides MPM modelling. For this research, the Plaxis 2D software has been used for MPM under confidentiality terms. As mentioned, the software is in its development stage therefore some issues where expected. The FEM models are also created using the internationally used Plaxis 2D FEM version. <br/>The reliability of the MPM and also FEM models in dynamic calculations was analyzed in this research allowing for a better understanding for the final model which represents the ship-berm collision problem. Two models (static and dynamic) were created in both FEM and MPM which then verified and compared. Therefore it was concluded that MPM can be considered as a reliable tool for dynamic calculations since the obtained results were similar or comparable with FEM and analytical solutions. <br/>The final models in both FEM and MPM however, did not provide the required results that could help to understand the ship-berm collision mechanism and/or the stress situations within the soil (only partial results were obtained). The FEM model showed very unrealistic and inaccurate results. The constant predefined contact area between the ship and berm is considered to be the main issue in this model; on the other hand, due to encountered issues with MPM, the MPM simulation could not be fully performed in terms of minimum required time steps. Nevertheless the partial simulations with a limited simulation time, were found to be realistic and in accordance with expectation, suggesting the capability of MPM for dynamic calculation after the necessary developments. <br/>As conclusion, this report does not recommend the usage of FEM for such a modelling and considers MPM a good possible tool to be used after the necessary developments in the near future. Meanwhile the presented simplified analytical method could provide a rough estimation for required berm length. In addition a FEM model has also been suggested in this report allowing for the user to have an insight on the stress propagation within the soil.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

First a comparison between different control methods is made, and sensorless FOC is decided as the method to be used. Then the implementation of FOC is discussed. The Texas Instruments InstaSPIN™ technology has the preference for this implementation. This because it has all the elements of the control embedded in one microcontroller, along with a software estimator which eliminates the use of expensive sensors like a shaft encoder. Also the ease of use and the familiarity of TU Delft staff with this technology played a big part in this decision. With this technology, a simulation set-up was made as a proof of concept, which can also be used to teach the NUON Solar Team members the basics of motor control. After that the connections from the controller to the inverter are discussed, so it can be connected to other inverters in the future. In the controller, a CAN-interface is also implemented, which is essential for using it in the Nuna car. With the information presented in this thesis, the NUON Solar Team can continue the development of a controller.

The main target is to find methods that have the potential to be practically applicable. These methods are characterized by the fact that they use data that is collected by smart meters, since smart meters are more and more the standard in Western households. Appliances are modeled by Hidden Markov Models and households are modeled by super-state Hidden Markov Models or Factorial Hidden Markov Models. These models are<br/>trained by iterative K-means or expectation maximization, where iterative K-means turns out as the superior training method. Basically three disaggregation algorithms are researched: the Viterbi algorithm, the particle filter, and the newly proposed Global Transition Minimization (GTM).<br/>The disaggregation algorithms are tested on a synthetic dataset of 6 appliances and on part of the Dutch Residential Energy Dataset (DRED). The results on the synthetic dataset vary between an accuracy of 81% for the GTM and 95% for the Viterbi algorithm. On the DRED the highest accuracy that is achieved is 77% for the particle filter. It turned out that the accuracy of the particle filter is not always improved by increasing the number of particles when real-world data is considered.<br/>Improvements for the disaggregation algorithms by using time information data and by using reactive power as extra input data are proposed. However, both suggestions do not lead to more accurate disaggregation results.

(TU Delft Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science)","Hofstee, Peter (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","A new class of accelerator interfaces has signi cant implications on system architecture. An order of magnitude more bandwidth forces us to reconsider FPGA design. OpenCAPI is a new interconnect standard that enables attaching FPGAs coherently to a high-bandwidth, low- latency interface. Keeping up with this bandwidth poses new challenges for the design of accelerators, and the logic feeding them.<br/><br/>This thesis is conducted as part of a group project, where three other master students investigate database operator accelerators. This thesis focuses on the logic to feed the accelerators, by designing a recon gurable multi-stream bu er architecture. By generalizing across multiple common streaming-like accelerator access patterns, an interface consisting of multiple read ports with a smaller than cache line granularity is desired. At the same time, multiple read ports are allowed to request any stream, including reading across a cache line boundary.<br/><br/>The proposed architecture exploits di erent memory primitives available on the latest genera- tion of Xilinx FPGAs. By combining a traditional multi-read port approach for data duplication with a second level of bu ering, a hierarchy typically found in caches, an architecture is pro- posed which can supply data from 64 streams to eight read ports without any access pattern restrictions.<br/><br/>A correct-by-construction design methodology was used to simplify the validation of the design and to speedup the implementation phase. At the same time, the design methodology is doc- umented and examples are provided for ease of adoption. With the design methodology, the proposed architecture has been implemented and is accompanied by a validation framework.<br/><br/>Various con gurations of the multi-stream bu er have been tested. Con gurations up to 64 streams with four read ports meet timing with an AFU request-to-response latency of ve cycles. The largest con guration with 64 streams and eight read ports fails timing. Limiting factors are the inherent architecture of FPGAs, where memories are physically located in speci c columns. This makes extracting data complex, especially at the target frequencies of 200 MHz and 400 MHz. Wires are scattered across the FPGA and wire delay becomes dominant.<br/><br/>FPGA design at increasing bandwidths requires new design approaches. Synthesis results are no guarantee for the implemented design, and depending on the design size, could indicate a very optimistic operating frequency. Therefore, designing accelerators to keep up with an order of magnitude more bandwidth compared to the current state-of-the-art is complex, and requires carefully thought out accelerator cores, combined with an interface capable of feeding it.","OpenCAPI; FPGA; Streaming; HPC; Heterogeneous; Low-latency; High-bandwidth; Streaming-based","en","master thesis","","","","","","ISBN 978-94-6186-886-2","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

The Ayeyarwady River has a dynamic character, caused by the significant discharge difference between the dry and rainy season, and the related suspended sediment transport. Point bar formation in inner bends causes flow deflection towards the opposite riverbank. This causes local instability with as a result the banks to retreat. Vegetation contributes to the strength of riverbanks, by increasing the shear strength of the soil through roots and increasing hydraulic resistance, reducing flow velocities near the bank. However, to what extent the vegetation on the Ayeyarwady riverbanks contributes to this stability is debatable. Therefore it was the objective of this thesis to obtain a better understanding of the effects of vegetation on riverbank stability. By means of a fieldwork photo material of the river reach between Mandalay and Pakokku was collected, which was used for the NDVI validation. NDVI is the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index and is a remote sensing indicator for the ‘greenness’ of vegetation on satellite imagery. More vegetation means a higher NDVI value, hence it provides information about the livelihood of the vegetation present on the subsoil. In combination with determined bank retreat rates from a yearly comparison of satellite images in Google Earth, it was examined whether higher NDVI values, obtained with the Google Earth Engine, resulted in reduced bank retreat rates and therefore if NDVI can be used as a bank stability parameter. <br/>Nine regions of bank retreat were both altogether and separately examined, but the graphs showed no definite answer of retreat rates being dependent on NDVI. Therefore, the results of the riverbank retreat analysis were categorised based on location, erosion mechanism, the slope, and vegetation classes. The areas where fluvial entrainment was the primary erosion mechanism showed a clear trend. When NDVI was smaller than 0.2, maximum bank retreat rates appeared to be 200 meters per year. When NDVI was higher than 0.2, bank retreat rates did not exceed 80 meters per year. On satellite images, vegetation was not observed in these areas, so the influence of vegetation remained questionable. In areas where mass failure caused bank retreat, no reduction in bank retreat was found. The results showed considerable scatter, although much more vegetation was present on these banks. Water level variability played a crucial role in the evaluation of the net effects of vegetation on riverbank stability. During low water, vegetation cannot provide the positive impacts, especially on steep river banks. <br/>It is not possible to identify vegetation types from NDVI records only. NDVI also does not show which erosion mechanism takes place. This makes riverbank stability difficult to predict by using NDVI only, and therefore, NDVI does not seem to be an appropriate estimator for the additional effects of vegetation on riverbank stability. However, it can be used in combination with other remote sensing techniques to identify healthy vegetation areas and to make roughness estimations in river planform analyses.","Ayeyarwady River; Vegetation; Riverbank stability; NDVI; Bank retreat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21.984679, 96.055263"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The chaotic nature of turbulent flows combined with the diverse scales present within turbulent flows makes these flows very challenging to accurately simulate. Since turbulence is a phenomenon that cannot be avoided in real flows, a good understanding and accurate representation of turbulent flows would help to advance in the technical front in a sustainable manner. Over the years, LES and DNS have come up as different methods by which this problem of turbulence could be solved, to an extent. DNS resolves all the relevant scales thereby providing the most accurate option. However, it can only be used for flows with low Reynolds number. LES is a less costly option but it requires a wall model in order to represent the wall-bounded flow with practical computing costs. An attempt was made by Thijs Durieux as well as Matthijs Beekman to create such a model for the 1D burgers equations, with the help of Artificial Neural Networks(ANN). In both cases, the ANN was used to find unresolved scale model coefficients that are the closest fit so that the results of the LES are close to the ones obtained by a DNS. In order to do this efficiently, a training error measure(TEM) was developed which was used by the ANN to obtain the correct model coefficients. This worked well, but only one form of unresolved scale model (algebraic Variational multiscale model) was used and the cases considered were easily handled by that particular model.<br/><br/>The aim of this thesis is therefore to examine the effectiveness of the procedures used so far for alternative subgrid scale forms of the unresolved scale model and more challenging test problems. In particular, the ANN calibration of the Orthogonal subgrid-scale model and the Dynamic Orthogonal subgrid-scale model are considered using test cases of constant forcing, periodic forcing, and a Stochastic forcing. The stochastic forcing case would provide an initial idea of how the results for Navier stokes would look like. Response surfaces for both the training error measure(TEM) as well as the simulation error measure (SEM) were also plotted to further investigate the performance of the ANN.<br/><br/>It is shown from this thesis that the ANN model is able to work with different forms of the unresolved scale model and different forcing functions. Additionally, the potential gains resulting from spatially varying coefficients are demonstrated. It was also found that the training error measure(TEM) used to train the ANN is able to work efficiently only if there exist model coefficients that would fit the reference data correctly. In a scenario where these coefficients do not exist, the training error measure(TEM) can behave very differently from the simulation error measure(SEM) which results in the ANN producing results that are very different from what is required. A major conclusion is therefore that while the TEM is a good measure to qualitatively analyze the situation, in challenging cases it would be worthwhile to consider a slightly different approach.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The purpose of this study is to investigate possible causes of this poor navigability and to come up with an improvement to the current situation. The influence of bars and scour holes around bridge piles are seen as hypothetical problem causes. A bar mode analysis shows that, for the examined river section, the river contains one alternate bar over the years. It is plausible that the construction of the bridge has induced changes in flow conditions in such way that the original alternate bar started to erode and eventually totally disappeared. Therefore, it is highly possible that the construction of the bridge forms the main reason for the shift of the thalweg. The scour holes around the piers of the Yondó Bridge that were approximated by the empirical method of Melville and Coleman. These scour holes are incorporated in the Delft3D-model to assess their influence by adapting the initial bed elevation profile. From the model simulation it turns out that the presence of the holes does result in more erosion in the vicinity of the bridge.<br/><br/>Three possible solutions (null-solution, groynes and guide bunds) have been weighed using Multi-Criteria Analysis. Based on this analysis the guide bunds appeared to be the most suitable solution. The structure was implemented in the Delft3D-model and some additional simulations proved that the effect of this structure on the hydro and morphodynamic conditions in the river is twofold. First, the guide bunds improve the distribution of the flow over the cross section of the river. More flow is forced through the right side and indeed the flow velocities turn out to be higher at that location. Moreover, the flow velocities on the left side decrease, as expected. However, the structure has an opposing effect on the cumulative erosion and sedimentation. More sedimentation takes place at the right side of the channel, whereas the left side of the channel gets deeper. It can be concluded that the best way to improve the situation in Barrancabermeja, is the construction of a guide bund structure in the vicinity of the Yondó Bridge. However, more detailed (physical) model tests should be performed to gain better insight in the effect of the guide bunds.<br","Colombia; Magdalena River; sedimentation; bridge; scour","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","MP222","7.0, -73.5"

With the use of material properties and photon particles, charges can be produced which, in combination with electric circuitry, transform into information understandable to the human eye and eventually the brain. When a photon particle hits a silicon photodiode, an electron-hole pair forms. By using readout techniques optimized for noise, area and power, images of different quality can be read out. Imaging concepts such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio, Dynamic Range, Resolution, Contrast and more can be used to describe the quality of the sensor. These concepts of quality are of interest when designing an imaging sensor. Throughout this thesis, design methodologies are applied to both the field of Optical Tomography and Neural Networks. <br/><br/>Optical Tomography is an imaging technique capable of detecting the internal structure of a subject with the use of image sensors. Various Optical Tomography techniques exist such as Diffusion Optical Tomography, Optical Projection Tomography and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). Optical Coherence Tomography is of special interest due to published papers which show the potential of the use with CMOS image sensors. The technique is based on the Michelson interferometer which is used in order to retrieve data of micrometer resolution. A feasibility study was conducted on OCT which shows potential for future research due to its recent development using CMOS image sensors. A review of state-of-the-art solutions is presented. With the most recent publication on a CMOS image sensor in OCT, with a dynamic range of 66 dB and a frame rate of 730 frames per second, showed the possibility of retrieving OCT images of higher quality compared to conventional sensors. <br/><br/>Artificial Neural Networks are inspired by the complex structure of our brain. By using its unique way of parallel computation, algorithms are capable of teaching our electronic devices human capabilities such as speech and face recognition. Artificial Neural Networks are identified by neurons and synapses in analogy to the nervous system. In this thesis, pixel design concepts are applied to neural networks where the pixel structure is modelled as a neuron. As a part of a larger project, low power design cells are collected into a combined library and presented. The library, in the end of development, will be used for finalizing and optimizing the complete neural network. One of the project’s challenges was to design a novel absolute value filter. The filter’s importance is presented as a part of a learning algorithm where it takes an absolute value of the difference between two signals. The resulting filter is operational and has the low power dissipation of 87 nW. The area was minimized and includes 10 transistors and a current mirror. The signal gain is around -13.2 dB which shows attenuation of the signal. The amount of gain required for this structure, as part of the learning algorithm, is not yet determined. Future work includes improving the circuit’s gain with a gain boost technique and minimizing noise levels with the use of larger transistors and new technologies. <br","Optical Coherence Tomography; Absolute Value Filter; Imaging Sensors; Optical Tomography Principles; Neural Networks; Learning Algorithms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

(mentor); Ludema, M.W. (mentor); Hombergen, L.P.I.M. (graduation committee); Bork, S (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Nowadays, a worldwide urbanisation trend can be observed. In the Netherlands, it is expected that the population of the four largest cities will be increased with an average of 15% in 2030. In total, these four big cities will accommodate a third of the Dutch population in 2030 (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek &amp; Planbureau voor de Leefomgeving, 2016). The growth of urban populations will generate a need to further develop cities, which will lead to a significant increase in construction work in cities. Because of the change from building in greenfield areas to brownfield areas, more people will experience the accompanying nuisances the increase of construction work brings. The accompanied nuisances relate to emissions and the reductions of the liveability and accessibility of cities during the execution of construction projects. To ensure the reduction of nuisances caused by construction tasks are reduced, a number of smart solutions in construction logistics have been developed. These solutions relate to the actions municipalities, contractors, wholesalers, and several other stakeholders can take. The smart solutions, among other things, provide concepts related to reductions of the amount of traffic. It is in the municipalities’ interest that feasible, effective and efficient solutions in construction logistics are further developed and applied on a larger scale, as this will help them to achieve their stated sustainable ambitions and increase the liveability and accessibility of urban confined areas during the construction phase of projects. However, on an operational level, municipalities do not sufficiently know how to stimulate the implementation of smart solutions in construction logistics in order to minimise nuisances caused by the construction sector. In order to respond to this shortcoming, the objective of this thesis is to provide a supporting tool to enable Dutch municipalities to stimulate market stakeholders to implement smart solutions in construction logistics in their projects. Because of the many different roles municipalities can play (client, licensor, coordinator, and owner of ground), the various types of projects municipalities conduct and the diversity in contract types is the Design Statement more specified than the objective of this thesis. The Design Statement can be read as follows: ‘Developing a tool that will give support to employees of municipalities working on the realisation of UAV-GC (Uniforme Administratieve Voorwaarden - Geïntegreerde Contractvormen) procured civil works, helping them to stimulate market stakeholders to implement smart solutions in construction logistics into projects.’ In order to respond to the Design Statement, a design of a supporting tool is developed. Prior to this, a number of Design Requirements that the design must satisfy are articulated. This requires, among other things, conducting research focusing on three aspects, being firstly, municipalities their deployable instruments to stimulate smart solutions in construction logistics, secondly, the process steps in municipalities its procured UAV-GC civil works projects and thirdly, the specifications of the deployable instruments. Through researching seven different subjects, namely a literature study on smart solutions in construction logistics, the smart solutions in construction logistics that are implementable by market stakeholders or by municipalities, the influence that municipalities have on the implementation of smart solution that can be implemented by market stakeholders, the level of applicability of smart solutions when implemented in civil projects, the specific related market stakeholders, obstacles and incentives that market stakeholders face and actions that municipalities can take, the deployable instruments were found. These instruments are: Procurement, Communication, Material agency, Contract management, BLVC, and Coordination department. The second research focus has resulted in a flow chart of the UAV-GC process that is divided in four phases and contains 23 process steps. From the third research focus, a list of contributors and obstructers that occur per instrument relating to the stimulation of smart solutions in construction logistics was developed. In addition to the Design Requirements that relate to the three research aspects, are also other Design Requirements formulated. They are derived from the scope, objective, and interview sessions with future users. The requirements are used as a starting point in the design phase of the tool for which different iterative design steps are taken. The final version of the tool represents a Project Roadmap It is presented as a small booklet printed in A5 size. The booklet is primarily made out of two parts, being a graphic and an explanation text. The icons displayed on the traffic signs represent the actions that take place during each intersection. The traffic signs are shaped in two different forms, being a diamond and square, representing respectively actions that can be taken in order to reduce construction related nuisances and actions that only consist of process step explanations. Finally, it has been decided that the created tool satisfies all mandatory requirements. Furthermore, the Project Roadmap responds to the stated Design Statement and ensures that all Dutch municipalities obtain guidance on how to stimulate market stakeholders to implement smart solutions in construction logistics in UAV-GC procured civil structure projects. It is recommended to keep supplementing the Project Roadmap with the latest information concerning municipalities its deployable instruments and smart solution in construction logistics in urban confined areas.","Urbanisation; Construction Logistics; Municipality; City accessibility; City livability; Nuisances","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

In recent articles, characterizations of binary tree-based networks are given. They are linked to maximum-sized matchings in bipartite graphs, path partitions and antichains. However, in many real-life applications, phylogenetic networks are not binary. Therefore, we will prove that some characterizations are extendable to all (nonbinary) phylogenetic networks while some others are not. We will discuss ﬁve proximity measures of how close an arbitrarily (nonbinary) phylogenetic network is to being tree-based. Three of the measures turn out to be equal and at least three of them are computable in polynomial time. We show that this is also true in the nonbinary case.

It leaves little attention for reducing exposure and vulnerability, as the other components when defining risk. Socio-economic trends show that the areas below sea level will be only more densely inhabited with people and will experience only more economic growth. This along the predicted sea level rise and greater fluctuations in river discharge compel research on spatial planning and urban design to look far into the future, to widen their scope and to anticipate developments further ahead. <br/><br/>This project aims at transition of the current way the Netherlands deal with the increasing treat of water zooming in on the situation of the city of Rotterdam and proposing to create more adaptive capacity of the spatial structure in order to deal with future uncertainties in the context of extreme climate change scenarios. <br/>The scenario the project is dealing with, shows that 3 meter of sea level rise before the year 2100 and drastic precipitation changes could become reality. This thesis focuses on the possibilities of restructuring the Randstad region throughout the scales (in space and in time), including Rotterdam, assigning densification zones and areas of relocation towards reduction of flood risk exposure of the extreme flood scenario. The project explores what it would mean for the city and the citizens of Rotterdam if all the areas below sea level get relocated to higher grounds. The transformation of infrastructures and networks is described on a spatial level at the city, neighborhood and at street- scale. Design interventions show what Rotterdam could look like in 2060 and what spatial qualities it could bring if we already start now to prepare the city for the future. This contribution of spatial planning and urban design can help filling the gap of knowledge about the spatial uncertainty climate change brings. It can also help in finding new ways of dealing with water that can prolongate the line of water expertise of the Dutch. Truly new visions on this subject can only emerge by leaving the beaten track. <br","Adaptive capacity; Extreme scenario thinking; Climate Change; Spatial Transformation; Densification; GeoDesign; multi-scalar approach; Rotterdam; water management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.9244, 4.4777"

Two main criteria for evaluating the survivability performance of optical transport networks are recovery time and resource efficiency. Taking resource efficiency into consideration, we propose a multiple-backup-path protection scheme for traffic over super-channels which is the trend in EON. As the proposed multiple-backup-path protection scheme is more suitable for traffic over super-channels, we classify the traffic based on their bandwidth requirements.

This combination results in an in-vitro model that mimics the minimal functional unit of a human organ. OOC devices are expected to provide accurate and predictive screening tools that will eventually reduce false negatives and false positives during drug research and development. By exploiting the accuracy of micro-fabrication techniques, multiple features such as micro-channels, micro-fluidics, micro-topologies, micro-pumps, etc., can be embedded in the device to replicate the biological conditions experienced by the cells in an in vivo human tissue. Moreover, it is possible to monitor the behavior and viability of the cells in the model through sensors embedded in the device.<br/>The Cytostretch device, an OOC developed by TU Delft and Philips, consists of a stretchable membrane fabricated on a silicon chip and equipped with microelectrode arrays (MEA) and micro-grooves. This device provides a customizable platform for multiple organ models. The Cytostretch Silicon-based fabrication should guarantee a large-scale fabrication and a rapid commercialization. However, the design choices compromise the electrochemical performance of the Titanium Nitride MEA on the device. In order to solve this problem, this project focused on coating the Cytostretch MEA with PEDOT (Poly (3,4 – Ethylenedioxythiophene)). PEDOT is a conductive polymer, known to exhibit a superior electrochemical performance due to its high porosity. To the best of authors knowledge, this is the first time a PEDOT MEA is embedded in an Organ-on-Chip. Moreover this is the first work reported aiming to produce a stretchable PEDOT MEA at large-scale by following the “polymer-last approach”.<br/>In this project three main issues were addressed and successfully solved. Firstly, the adhesion between the polymer layers composing the Cytostretch device was improved. Secondly, the process and the masks of the Cytostretch were optimized in order to coat the Titanium Nitride MEA with a noble metal (Platinum) in order to facilitate PEDOT deposition. Thirdly, the deposition of PEDOT on top of the Cytostretch electrodes was successfully performed by cyclic voltammetry deposition from an aqueous solution with NaPSS (Sodium-Poly (Styrene Sulfonate)) as the dopant material.<br/>The performance of the novel stretchable PEDOT MEA was assessed with multiple characterization methods such as Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, and Cyclic Voltammetry. Compared to the Titanium Nitride MEA, PEDOT electrodes exhibit an enhanced performance providing an outstanding 94% reduction of the electrochemical impedance at 1 kHz. The new electrodes showed an ohmic behavior over a wider range of frequency. Last but not the least, a significant increase of the total charge delivery capacity (CDC) was obtained during cyclic voltammetry tests. The results reported in this work demonstrate that the electrochemical performance of the Cytostretch can be drastically improved with PEDOT coating. The combination of robust microfabrication and the electrochemical deposition techniques presented in this work is an important step forwards toward the use of the Cytostretch device in pharmacological applications.","PEDOT; Microelectrode; Organ-on-chip; Cytostretch; Electro-chemical Characterization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Nowadays, human health and urban design are separate academic fields and their relationship is often disregarded. The main challenge for urban planning is dealing with the pressure on the available space affected by urbanization and climate change. The role of health is changed in our society due to two major reasons. The first reason is the evolvement in health, diseases and the impact of them which are changing over time, for example due to improved health care. The second reason is the changed common perspective towards health; the current emphasis is on participation in daily life instead of the absence of illnesses. Large health differences are identified between different kind of neighbourhoods.<br/><br/>This research focusses on the relation of human health and the design of urban environments. The goal of this research is to design urban environments which contribute to the health of the residents. For this reason, the emphasis is on the promotion of a healthy lifestyle. For this research three determinants of health related to space are identified: the physical environmental, the social environmental and the behavioural determinants of health. Six design principles, derived from these determinants of health, are composed to guide the design process. A set eighteen of design elements are chosen as instruments which have a relation with health. These design elements can be used to transform urban environments towards more human and sustainable living environments.<br/><br/>The design approach is tested on two test cases in The Hague: Rustenburg Oost and Morgenstond Zuid. Both these neighbourhoods have health related problems, however they have a totally different urban form. After analysing these areas, two kinds of design locations are identified for both. On one hand, the space around infrastructural bodies are mentioned. For these test cases, waterlines are the large scaled elements. On the other hand, public spaces which are typical for the neighbourhood are indicated. The elaboration of the test cases show the effectiveness of the healthy design approach. The various designs demonstrate that the application of the healthy design approach is applicable to different urban fabrics. <br","Healthy environments; Urban design; Human health; Determinants of health; The Hague; Social-ecological system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","",""

In this study 3 concepts were designed for a fictitious Next Signle Aisle aircraft (NSA) rudder to perform a trade-off between the two composite materials and the two stiffening concepts. An existing C/PPS multi-rib rudder concept is used as a reference. Specified requirements were elaborated to create a C/PEKK based multi-rib rudder redesign. Two multi-rib concepts, each with a different minimum skin thickness, were made and compared. The weight and cost of these two concepts was found to be nearly equal. Alternative stiffening concepts for the multi-rib were generated in collaboration with experts. Grid-stiffening (GS) of the skin using a short fibre reinforced composite was selected. The GS skin allowed most of the ribs to be omitted so that part count and assembly effort could be reduced. The multi-rib concept proved to be the lightest, regardless of the used material. The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of some manufacturing processes for C/PEKK is low and requires more development. The C/PEKK rudder shall be a viable option in the near future when all envisioned manufacturing concepts and welding of C/PEKK tape become available. The GS rudder requires more research and development. The short fibre material and manufacturing process of the grid have a low TRL and are not yet qualified. A discrete model of the GS skin is also required to better understand the behaviour of the rudder. Thus the GS rudder is expected to be a viable solution in the long term future.","rudder design; aircraft movables; Thermoplastic Composite; thermoplastic welding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-29","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Having a prospective future in terms of growing worldwide demands, it becomes more important to reduce the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCoE) of the wind turbine which is generally done by manufacturing the structure, such as the rotor blades and tower, larger. Consequently, this so-called upscaling strategy introduces a drawback in terms of more severe fatigue loadings at both the rotating and fixed components, for example due to wind shear effect, turbulence, and tower shadow, if not dealt with properly.<br/><br/>Fortunately, a solution from the control engineering field, namely Individual Pitch Control (IPC), emerged in response to this challenge. The idea is to rotate the pitch angle of the blades individually depending on the measured loads, normally from the corresponding blade roots. Conventional IPC incorporates the Multi-Blade Coordinate (MBC) transformation which transforms the individual blade load signals from the rotating into the non-rotating reference frame; resulting in the decoupled signals of tilt and yaw axes. This enables the design of Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers that generate pitch actions at these channels; followed by the reverse coordinate transformation such that the individual pitch actions can be implemented. In reality, however, there are interactions between the tilt and yaw axes, which can be coped with by inclusion of a constant azimuth offset into the reverse MBC transformation. Although the straightforward technique is widely practiced in the literature, no validation on this offset and how it affects the cross-coupling prevail whatsoever.<br/><br/>Recently in the literature, an analysis of a wind turbine model with the inclusion of the MBC transformation in the frequency domain revealed the existence of tilt-yaw axes crosscoupling to some extents which invalidates the SISO control system design; confirming that the problem should be treated in the Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) control framework. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to enhance the decoupling by the aforementioned azimuth offset inclusion in which SISO control system design can be made possible.<br/><br/>In this study, an extension of the above-mentioned frequency domain analysis was done by including the azimuth offset. Having successfully shown considerable changes in terms of system’s gain, the investigation was continued by using both the linearized and nonlinear NREL 5-MW baseline wind turbine models in which the offset inclusion to the MBC transformation managed to affect the tilt-yaw interactions. The degree of decoupling assessment and the closed-loop stability analysis were done by means of Gershgorin bands. The results showed that the best decoupling effect, stability margins, and robustness could be achieved by inclusion of the azimuth offset of 20◦ for the particular wind turbine model. More importantly, this study contributes to filling the knowledge gap substantially in the literature by providing the validation of tilt-yaw decoupling by the inclusion of an azimuth offset.","IPC; Decoupling; Wind Turbine; Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most optimal method that was tested was based on measuring the length of the snow stakes before the first snow fall and again throughout the season. From the ratio between the two lengths, the snow depth could be derived.

In the past decades, after observing gradual global climate change, most governments<br/>acknowledge the environmental impact of their system and want a change. One way to reduce the pressure on the earth is by shifting to the circular economy. In terms of energy this means that society should be completely disconnected from fossil based energy and switch torenewable energy. The objective of this research was to look at the potentials for a local energy network in an existing<br/>city context and to design a local energy system. A Lidl supermarket forms the centre of the system. In addition to this, a new element is introduced to the<br/>built environment : the urban rooftop greenhouse. <b>Study design</b>. Broad literature survey on circularity, later converging to energy related literature studies. This is followed an energy analysis of a modern Lidl supermarket and energy balances are calculated for a greenhouse and a supermarket. The energy system is based on these energy balances.<br/><b>Setting</b>. This research focuses on one residential city block in Amsterdam Oud-West, the Netherlands. The block is enclosed by the Eerste Helmerstraat, Alberdingk Thijmstraat, Tweede Helmerstraat and the Nassaukade (52°21’51.7”N - 4°52’38.1”E).

A modern and sustainable Lidl supermarket in Stein is analysed to determine the energy performance of the refurbished Lidl in Amsterdam.<br/><b>Energy quantification</b>. Energy balances of the Lidl supermarket and the rooftop greenhouse are calculated. The energy system is based on the values retrieved from these energy balances. The heat demand of the local dwelling is determined from the literature survey.<br/><b>Designing the energy model</b>. The greenhouse, the supermarket and adjacent dwelling form an energetic triangle. First, the possibilities of energetic collaboration between individual components are explored. Secondly,<br/>all components are connected with each other through an underground energy storage. The size and indoor climate of the greenhouse are determined based on the required balance of this energy storage.<br/><b>Urban design</b>.

About 6% of the total burden of disease can be accounted to influences of the natural environment on well-being. Part of the problem is the unawareness of people about these influences. In order to improve well-being, people first have to reflect on the current situation and therefore become aware. Therefore, the goal of the product is to increase awareness and give people the knowledge to make different or better decisions. Studio Überdutch for who the project was conducted saw potential in measuring, interpreting, processing and adjusting the quality of the living environment. As a result, this project was initiated. <br/>It was found that the variables that have most impact on human health are air pollution and noise. Based on the outcomes of the influence of the different variables, a look was taken at the influence of stress on well-being. Being able to cope with environmental stressors can only be done when being aware of the interpretation of the stressor. This led to the need to measure the subjective experience of these variables as well. It was decided to measure air pollution and noise for the rest of the project, both objectively and subjectively. During the project scope phase, a concept direction was chosen, being a product connected inside and outside the home environment to measure air quality and noise and comparing the outcomes. This means the products will consist of two parts, Part A for indoor and Part B for outdoor. The final concept consists of two parts attached on opposite sides of the window. Feedback will be given by indicators in a transparent ring and input will be collected by touch. This concept was validated by a user test. From the user test it was concluded that the product can increase awareness on the level of air quality and noise, but that the experienced need for providing input is missing. <br","Well-being; air quality; noise; air pollution; subjective input","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

This is often attributed to high valgus torques repetitively stressing the ligament. The goal of this study was to research the effect of Elbow Flexion (EF) and arm External Rotation (ER) angle on Peak Valgus Torque (PVT) as well as ball velocity, using a three-folded approach. <br/><br/>Methods <br/>Motion data of 12 Dutch A and AAA team pitchers were collected (29 pitches in total). Firstly, the relationships between the variables and outcomes were statistically evaluated with Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). Secondly, simplified movements and EF and ER variations were input to a two-segment model, which was based on the hypothesis that valgus torque is generated by inertial effects from external rotation deceleration and forearm forward acceleration. Lastly, for one pitch per player, ER and EF angles were varied in simulations.<br/><br/>Results <br/>Statistical significance was only observed for higher EF as a predictor of increased PVT and higher ER as a predictor of decreased ball velocity. In the two-segment model, PVT increased for higher EF and decreased for higher ER. The simulations showed different effects between pitchers, however, most trends were similar to those of the two-segment model. Ball velocity was maintained or increased with<br/>higher EF, while the influence of ER on ball velocity differed between players.<br/><br/>Conclusion <br/>The two-segment model led to a more in-depth insight in the many factors influencing PVT in pitching. The results of this study suggest that higher ER and lower EF could lead to lower PVT, without necessarily giving in on performance. However, the results showed differences between pitchers. As previous studies reported opposite trends regarding ER, we believe that this discussion should be re-opened. Our findings suggest that some pitchers are more prone to elbow injury than others and that pitchers might be able to lower injury-risk by adapting their pitching technique.","baseball; pitching; injury; elbow; UCL; sports engineering; flexion; external rotation; valgus torque; ball velocity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The share of local renewable energy supply is also increasing, driven by the urge to mitigate climate problems.<br/><br/>Residential energy demand and renewable energy supply are both intermittent; the demand profile depends on several aspects like the inhabitants, the physical properties of a building and the outdoor climate. Renewable energy supply is intermittent because it can only occur when the intermittent renewable energy source, e.g. the sun, is present.<br/>So, the intermittencies of supply and demand depend on different aspects, hence cause a mismatch. This mismatch must be solved. Energy-flat buildings are a potential solution to this problem. To diminish the problem of energy mismatch on a residential level, dwellings will have to be able to adapt the demand to supply and vice versa. The research presented in this thesis explores the potential of architectural design in eliminating the on-site energy mismatch. In other words, the potential of energy-flat buildings.<br/><br/>First, three key-performance indicators for energy-flatness are defined and a dynamic energy simulation model is set-up using Grasshopper Honeybee software. With this tool, the energy-flat performance of several designs can be quantified and analysed. Then, the current mismatch of residential energy in a reference design is determined. Thereafter, the effect of building parameters on the energy-flat performance of a design is researched. The results of this parameter study are then used to design an energy-flat building. The knowledge gained by this design-by-research approach is bundled in a toolbox, which serves as a guide for architectural designers.<br/><br/>It is found that the heat balance should be considered first when aiming for energy-flatness, rather than the electricity balance. The nine building parameters researched, all significantly influence the energy-flatness by affecting different elements of the heat balance. An adaptive approach in terms of daily and seasonal differences is required for almost all parameters to achieve the best energy-flat performance. The largest challenges for energy-flatness are the lack of supply potential at night, lower solar power in winter combined with lower outdoor temperatures and the unpredictability of both energy demand and energy supply in short time intervals. The toolbox that is created provides effective energy-flat design principles. <br/><br/>Moreover, it is concluded that architectural design can significantly contribute, but not completely solve the mismatch of residential energy demand and supply. The performance of building installations is essential for achieving energy-flatness, but it is only partly researched in this thesis because these building installations lie beyond its scope. <br/>Lastly, it is concluded that energy-flat buildings theoretically can be the solution to the (inter)national energy balancing challenge, but it is preferable to distribute the challenge over multiple levels of the system. The relevance of energy-flatness will change in the future, depending on the development of energy storage technologies and the share of renewable energy production.<br/><br/>Altogether, the architecture of a building can significantly influence its energy-flatness and the concept of energy-flatness will contribute to effective use of local renewable energy.<br","Energy; Energy Flexibility; Energy Neutral; Sustainability; Mismatch; Toolbox; Design; Energy demand; Energy supply; Parametric study; Architectural engineering; Heat demand; Cooling; Renewable Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

This network is an entry-exit system where entry and exit capacities can be booked by parties called shippers. Variations in usage lead to an enormous number of possible entry-exit combinations. GTS must be able to accommodate all realistically possible gas transport scenarios that result from these entry-exit combinations. In principle, hydraulic testing of all these scenarios is required to see if the current network is optimally sized for this task. However, calculating all scenarios is extremely time consuming, so a smaller set of severe scenarios that also covers the less severe ones, is needed to represent the complete set. <br/><br/>Reduction of the complete set of transport scenarios is a mathematically challenging task. The current method to reduce the number of these scenarios is workable and probably meets the requirements of day-to-day planning calculations at GTS. This method makes use of the so-called end point representation, which describes transport scenarios by their capacities on entry and exit points only, while e.g. the flow pattern is unknown. The distance function for the current reduction method measures the difference between scenarios by comparing the capacities on end points, where the end points are correlated by their respective transport distances. <br/><br/>A new representation is introduced in this report: the flow representation. This representation makes use of the flow patterns that emerge from balanced combinations of entry and exit capacities. A flow pattern follows from an entry-exit combination by determining its minimum associated transport load. Compared to the end point representation, the flow representation is more intricate to obtain (more calculations are required to get flow patterns), but the result is a more accurate representation in terms of the transport physics of the network. The pay-off is that the distance function for the flow representation can be a lot simpler, e.g. a weighted norm which approximates the transport effort. It also turns out to be more adaptable. For example the diameter, pressure drop and other network information can easily be included in this weighted norm. <br/><br/>In this report both representations are compared. However, from the experiments no final conclusion can be given for which representation has a better performance. Future studies, e.g. involving hydraulic calculations, are recommended to conclude this matter.","Natural Gas; Distance Function; Stress Tests; Transport Planning; Transport Network; Flow Patterns","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Having one disease increases the risk of having another different disease. A coexisting disease, also known as a comorbidity, drastically decreases the quality of life and can result in further health decline, as they come unnoticed and untreated. Detection of the first disease signs gives rise to timely seeking help and intervention. Therefore, screening for other diseases than the one diagnosed is essential for the health and well-being of patients.<br/><br/>This graduation project aims to improve secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease by design. It focused on opportunities to encourage people with established cardiovascular disease to act on cardiovascular risk and decline, using data derived from self-monitoring. The project aim was to develop a solution which helps patients at home with the interpretation of clinical signs indicative of cardiovascular decline and undetected co-occurring diseases.<br/>The project is carried out for the CardioLab, a research consortium between Philips Healthcare, the Dutch Heart Foundation and the faculty Industrial Design Engineering. The common goal of the three partners is to “join forces in research and design to decrease the large number of heart patients and casualties due to heart failure with the use of data-driven technologies”.<br/><br/>Problem<br/>The prevalence and detection of comorbidities bring along various problems. The actual prevalence of comorbidities is underestimated due to underdiagnosis of the primary disease and the comorbidity. It may that the comorbidity is confounded by shared risk factors or that the features of the comorbidity overlap with features used to define the primary disease. The first signs of the comorbidity are often undetected or unacknowledged as checkups at the specialist are just isolated samples. Complaints and clinical signs do not always present or are not actively sought during these samples. Also, the timing can be just unfortunate. The presence of the comorbidity causes many complaints and can result in contradictory treatments. Needless to say, new strategies for comorbidity detection and care are necessary.<br/><br/>Research<br/>Longitudinal screening through self-monitoring could pick up on the first signs of disease. Literature and field research showed that certain health variables, such as heart rhythm and blood pressure, are indicative of multiple diseases. Combinations of these variables can be suggestive towards specific diseases. Therefore, integrating these variables in a home-use screening device enables patients to monitor the risk of various diseases continuously.<br/><br/>Design proposal<br/>The project proposes a self-monitoring solution which enables patients to monitor their risk of complications and comorbidity by using a home use stethoscope and a smartphone application. The smartphone application visually demonstrates the near future risk of complications and gives patient-tailored action points to reduce this risk.<br/><br/>The proactive feedback intent to evoke a well-considered patient response, ranging from encouraging healthy lifestyle habits, to the reassurance of seeking help. It aims to engage and empower patients in the ambiguity of risk management by providing insights on the whys and hows of preventative self-management strategies which apply to their situation.<br/><br/>Evaluation<br/>The user evaluation demonstrated that most participants, with and without a cardiovascular disease, perceive the design proposal as helpful and motivating. However, the experience of stress due to an increased risk level for disease was perceived as a concern by many. Some saw the risk insights as a necessary evil to come in action to reduce their risk; others wouldn’t want to know about it. This assumes that the platform would not be suitable for all personality types. Further research needs to assess the role of stress in these risk scenarios.<br/><br/>The project explored a new strategy to improve secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Further research and development are needed to substantiate the true effectiveness of the proposal.<br","cardiovascular disease; comorbidity; secondary prevention; self-monitoring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","CardioLab",""

Because of its monumental and iconic status, the KU Leuven therefor decided to transform it in an architectural study centre. This was the starting point of the graduation studio.

The main question in this study was therefor: what is our ideal program for an architectural university or study center. We also looked at precedents of monasteries to understand their architectural language, the positioning of functions and the relations between them.<br/>The project requested a clear position towards the architectural oeuvre and thinking of Dom Hans van der Laan and a clear understanding of his proportion, light and materiality.

Resulting city models are used for a great variety of purposes. The reconstruction of roofs remains challenging. These roofs are not only building blocks for the city models but are of direct interest as well. The company READAAR uses roof segments for the detection of asbestos and PV potential analysis. Typical clients for such analysis are muncipalities and provinces. Currently, READAAR extracts roof segments from the gridded LiDAR dataset: algemeen hoogtebestand nederland 2 (AHN2). The use of LiDAR data however comes with some limitations. Most importantly, outside the Netherlands, LiDAR data is not always available as it is relatively expensive to gather. Furthermore, the point density of the AHN is 6-10 points/m^2, which limits the amount of detail that can be extracted. In the Netherlands countrywide aerial stereo imagery is available at a resolution of 10cm, this potentially gives a point density of 100 points/m^2 after image matching. This research explores the possibilities of using aerial stereo imagery instead of LiDAR data for the efficient large-scale extraction of 3D roof segments. A workflow is designed in which stereo matching and extraction of segments are integrated. This makes the workflow both efficient and easily scalable. Roof segments are extracted in two steps. First, a watershed segmentation is applied to retrieved color segments. Second, these color segments are clustered based on their orientation. The resulting roof segments generally have a higher quality than the segments retrieved with READAARs LiDAR-based approach. However, problems do occur, especially in shaded areas. This could possibly be solved by integrating LiDAR data when available. Another recommendation for future research is improving the matching by using multi-view matching or possibly neural networks. Furthermore, the segmentation could potentially be improved by using multiple images from different years and processing building blocks.","roofs; segmentation; reconstruction; aerial imagery; stereo; point cloud; clustering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

To make sure that all these PV systems work optimally it is essential to have a good way of monitoring these devices. In this project an open generic model that can detect and identify malfunctions of PV systems based on yield data was developed. The model detects malfunctioning systems by comparing the yield ratio of a specific system with the yield ratio of similar neighboring systems. To determine the similarity of these neighboring systems properties such as their orientations were identified. The azimuth of the PV systems could be identified with an accuracy of 8 cardinal points, the standard error for the azimuth approximation was 2%.

To address this issue, significant research and development in the field of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is currently being carried out. One such technological development that allows grouping of vehicles into platoons, controlled by one leading vehicle has proved to be a fruitful and potential solution for the existing issue of traffic jams.<br/>The state of the art technology that enables vehicle platooning is called Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC). In CACC, the individual vehicles are grouped into platoons and allowed to automatically adjust their speeds using on-board sensors and vehicle to vehicle communication to maintain a desired and safe inter-vehicle distance. The specialty of CACC is that it enables to have small inter-vehicle distance between the vehicles which increases road throughput and reduces air drag on the vehicle. Consequently, traffic jams and fuel emissions are reduced.<br/>However, a crucial challenge arrives due to its high dependency on mechatronic devices, as a fault in such devices could lead to unsafe conditions for the vehicles in a platoon. Hence, there is a need of making CACC application Fail-Operational, which means that the vehicles would continue to function safely under faults and failures of those devices. TNO in its EcoTwin III project has identified Electronics Control Unit (ECU) to be a very critical component and uses the concept of redundancy to provide the Fail-operational capability that can tolerate one failure of ECU. However, this implementation involves a transition period caused due to fault detection and switching of ECU. This transition period could jeopardize the safety of vehicles under conditions where a nominal ECU would have kept the vehicles safe. <br/>Thus the objective of this MSc thesis is to address the problem of the transition period of a homogeneous platoon under ideal communication network conditions. In the first part, a model is proposed that captures the effect of the transition from primary ECU to the standby ECU on the platoon dynamics. This is done for both warm and hot standby strategies which depend on the functionality of the standby ECU. We see how this transition period affects the overall safety of the system under a worst-case scenario (emergency braking). In the second part, to improve the safety and exclude the effect of the transition period, a new method of implementation of existing control law is proposed. This technique exploits the benefit of using communicated data from the preceding vehicle for generating control input during the transition period. <br/>Simulations are conducted for a two-vehicle platoon. The results show the effect of the transition period in a warm standby strategy will lead to collisions. The simulations also show that the hot standby strategy outperforms the warm standby one, though it cannot avoid collisions at large transition periods. On the other hand, the proposed new strategy shows the potential of using the communicated signal in preventing collision and shows significant improvements in comparison to other two strategies at the larger transition period.<br","CACC; Simulations; ECU failure; Fault-tolerance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-26","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","","51.474445, 5.623926"

The infrastructure that once was created to primarily relate to shipping, now had to cater to a different use, the HEF bridge being a prime example of this.This also led to fragmentation in the South of Rotterdam, as the infrastructure that catered to the shipping industry no longer served that function, and in certain cases was abandoned- like the HEF. • In such a fast paced city, can infrastructure adapt rapidly enough? Can it also be more than a physical connection and also work a public place typology to connect people? • I wanted to use infrastructure as a grid, as something to orient towards, within a city in flux, by integrating it into the public realm. This would mean different interpretations of what the HEF could be, as well as for future infrastructure, and with a new bridge connection already being planned by the city, I zoomed into the strip/core between east and west Feijenoord as my site. • With new developments like Feijenoord city, slated to come up actively over the next decade, this will require 2 things: 1. Infrastructure to support new traffic and movement intake. 2. To integrate this infrastructure in the diverse urban fabric and everyday life of Feijenoord- preserving its identity, while still responding to the grand architecutral gestures, that initiate innotivation and economic growth of Rotterdam. The project is an approach to address the current issues of Feijenoord by developing a strategy to design a more connected and inclusive typology of public place. This is considered as a plug-in to the existing infrastructural networks of Rotterdam- using other qualities of the region. The main objective is to integrate new infrastructure and developments into the daily life of Feijenoord with design elements and program that act as activators for an interactive, inclusive public place.

The process is fast, clean, and highly automated. In the USW process, an intermediate, unreinforced polymer layer is required at the weld interface to concentrate the heat generation at this weld interface and is called the Energy Director (ED). This research investigates a new method to manufacture and apply this ED at the weld interface, being Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). <br/><br/>With FDM, complex products can be manufactured directly from a Computer Aided Design (CAD) model, without additional mould or special tooling required. The goal is to simultaneously manufacture and adhere a dedicated ED geometry on a consolidated TPC substrate with FDM, such that no additional fixation step of the ED is required before welding. The new technique is successfully applied with a PEEK (Polyether ether Ketone) ED and a consolidated CF/PPS (Carbon fibre/Polyphenylene Sulfide) substrate. The deposited ED has sufficient bonding with the substrate that it remained fixated during handling prior to and during the weld process. This resulted in a successful weld, having similar strength and quality as found with welds having a loose, flat film as ED. <br/><br/>A challenge encountered in using FDM as manufacturing method of the EDs, is a non-uniform thickness distribution occurring in the ED. Additional research on the influence of a variation in thickness is done, where it is found to reduce the overall single Lap Shear Strength (LSS), and divide the fracture surface of a single weld in two areas welded to different weld stages.","Ultrasonic welding; Thermoplastic Composite; Energy Director; Fused Deposition Modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","TAPAS2",""

One market in which the AWE systems can open a path as a renewable distributed generator is in offgrid communities or camps. Nowadays, this market is dominated by fossil fuel energy like diesel generators. Even though the diesel is cheap, in some cases the complexity to transport the diesel can increase its price considerably. A military camp is an example of this cases. AWE systems designed by the start-up Kitepower can offer a solution to this type of application. Nevertheless, there are some points in the AWE mechanism that should be improved. The most important of these aspects is the cyclic power production that generates a power gap. <br/><br/>This thesis compares solutions as 2 KP systems, other distributed generators (DG) and storage systems (SS) to find the best option to mitigate the power gap. For the integration of the components with the KP system, microgrids designs and layouts were studied. This led to one of the most important things in a microgrid that is the SS sizing. Here, also a method to size the SS to fill the power gap is proposed based on the distribution of power generated by the KP system each cycle. To test the sizing and the operating of the system, a model was built in Simulink. The results show that the method finds a power balance between the power produced and the power generated. <br/><br/>Finally, an efficient integrated system is proposed to mitigate the power gap of the KP system.

The majority of the foundations for these offshore wind turbines are large-diameter monopiles. The driving of monopiles into the seabed is conventionally done using a hydraulic hammer, this process is commonly known as piling. Piling causes high noise levels that are damaging to marine life, for example it is known to cause permanent hearing loss to marine mammals. Also smaller fish are known to be affected by this noise. Piling additionally causes fatigue damage to the pile during the installation process requiring over dimensioned monopile foundations.<br/><br/>A potential solution to these problems is currently being developed by GBM Works; To install a monopile foundation, a set of vibrating elements is installed at the bottom of the monopile that reduce the resistance of the soil at the tip of the pile. Water is injected upwards on both sides of the pile wall to lubricate the pile-soil interface. In this way, the resistance of the soil is temporarily reduced to such an extent that the monopile foundation penetrates the soil to target depth under its own weight, thereby greatly reducing noise levels and fatigue damage.<br/><br/>To determine the feasibility of this installation method, an experimental study has been performed, where a prototype of one oscillating element was constructed and attached to a steel pile. Tests with this prototype were performed at the Maasvlakte, where very dense sand is found with cone resistance values of up to 30 MPa in the test depth range. Multiple experiments were conducted in which the amplitude and frequency of the vibrations were varied. Tests were done for a large range of variables in attempt to optimize the penetration speed. Additionally, based on the test results, a semi-empirical model was built to predict the installation speed of the prototype pile and to identify the influence of the different variables. <br/><br/>The experiments show that it is possible to penetrate the prototype pile to its full penetration of 4.5 meters into the soil. Depending on the properties of the applied oscillations and soil conditions, the penetration rates are found between 1 and 5 cm/s. <br/><br/>To determine the feasibility of reaching penetration depths that are similar to those of offshore foundation piles, i.e. 30 to 40 meters with larger diameter monopiles, additional experiments are required .The noise levels during the experiments were significantly lower than the noise levels for conventional piling. However, as sound in air propagates differently than in an underwater environment underwater measurements are required to further assess the noise levels of this new installation method for monopile foundations.<br","Foundations; Offshore; Noise","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-01-25","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

A changing world means that the problems society faces change too. Solving these problems has become more complex, and will so even more in the future. Increasingly, designers are the ones expected to be the ones to solve them. To that end, new design methods need to be devised to support designers in approaching these new challenges. This project focuses on improving one aspect of design behavior: reducing designers’ reliance on exhaustive search strategies. <br/><br/>Exhaustive search strategies are characterized by designers trying to exhaust an imaginary source of ideas and methods as a way to attain certainty in the design process. These are resource intensive and low in effectiveness. As problem complexity and consequently uncertainty in the design process rise, resources become more scarce and the risk these strategies bring increases. <br/><br/>A literature study was executed to investigate the origin of these strategies, as well as search for opportunities for improvement. The aforementioned problematic situation is a trait of non-expert designers. Expert designers employ completely different strategies. In order to deepen the understanding of the problem and create a better understanding of the expert approach, two sets of structured interviews were performed. One set with graduating industrial design students and one set with expert industrial designers. It was confirmed that the expert approach is characterized by a high tolerance for complexity and uncertainty. <br/><br/>As a way to instill this quality in non-expert designers, the design of the method thus focuses on supporting designers in embracing complexity and uncertainty. From findings in the literature study and the interviews, a promising direction was identified in the use of narratives and reflection. By means of rapid prototyping tests of the method with graduating students, a methodological structure for a narrative-based reflection method was designed: Design Interlude. A Design Interlude is a break in the design process to reflect on the complexity of the project and look ahead to the uncertainties that are to come. Additionally, a template for performing the method was designed.<br/><br/>The results of several validation tests suggest that this method is effective at supporting designers in embracing uncertainty and complexity. More research is needed to measure if using the method consequently affects reliance on exhaustive search strategies. Additional effects of using the method that were observed are: increased likelihood of new insights, clearer project direction and easier communication of problem complexity. <br/><br/>From here, a larger study of the effectiveness of this method should be conducted. As well as an investigation into the possibility of implementing it into the industrial design curriculum.","Design; Design methodology; Design method; Reflection; Narrative; Methodology; innovation; Strategy; Design research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Following Brexit, Amsterdam, along with other European cities are competing to attract the biggest share of potentially relocated businesses and organisations from London. The lack of available housing options acts as a deterrent to expats looking for job opportunities in Amsterdam. The city wants to become a competitive and attractive destination to be able to generate more economic growth and become a major global business hub. According to its 2040 strategic plan, the city aims to provide more housing, especially in its inner area by densifying the already existing fabric, with suburban expansion not being seen as a viable option. This master thesis is exploring the high-rise as a form of densification in the belt of former fortification works within Amsterdam's city centre. The connection between the public realm and the high rise through the use of the plinth is explored in an effort to integrate the high-rise as an urban form within a historic city fabric. The design proposal aims to provide unique housing typologies for a high-rise, taking advantage of the access to views and combining it with the unexpected element of greenery on higher levels, with green towers becoming modern symbols of major cities across the world. The building works as a landmark for the city, being its tallest residential tower while catering for its residents and visitors through the provision of public facilities on ground and rooftop levels.","High-rise Building; Green; Densification; Expats; Amsterdam; Housing; Plinth; Third Golden Age; Landmark","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture and Dwelling","","52.359194, 4.900190"

When an attacker penetrates an IT system, commonly one of their first actions is tampering with the logs, so that they can hide their malicious activities. For most types of systems a suitable secure logging solution exists. These solutions prevent an adversary from tampering with the system logs, or make it infeasible to do so undetectably. However, the solutions that exist for devices with limited computing power, “resource-constrained” devices, are all unsuited for long-term unsupervised deployment. In this scenario a device is deployed in a hostile environment for prolonged periods of time, during which it cannot communicate or otherwise interact with another party. Existing solutions for this scenario are either, not secure against all known attacks on secure logging schemes, make assumptions that are not realistic given the aforementioned scenario, or fail to account for real-world constraints that these devices and scenario impose on the capabilities of a secure logging scheme.<br/><br/>In this thesis we present two secure logging schemes called Immutable Forward Linked and Sealed Logging (IFLS) and Pseudorandom Indexed Forward Linked Logging (PIFL). Both schemes allow for tamper-resistant logging on low-powered devices while at the same time requiring only initial interaction with an external party. Furthermore we present a novel and efficient way of establishing an immutable link between consecutive log entries, which grants protection against most attacks on secure logging schemes. We additionally detail two methods to shield the last log entry, so that Truncation Attacks and Crash Attacks are mitigated. The combination of these techniques in IFLS and PIFL results in two schemes which are fully tamper-resistant. We find that PIFL’s pseudorandom indexing of log entries makes this scheme well-suited for use on flash storage, a storage medium that is ubiquitous in resource-constrained devices. Lastly, we confirm the real-world feasibility of our work by implementing and practically evaluating IFLS in the Rust programming language.","Cryptography; Secure Logging; resource-constrained","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-01-25","","","","Computer Science","",""

The indoor acoustic climate can be influenced by adding absorption material, however traditional materials do not offer precise solutions but have a more generic behavior. Furthermore these products are often applied on walls, floors and other flat surfaces and take up space. In the last decade the industry of additive manufacturing, specifically 3D printing, is on the rise introducing new design and production possibilities. Existing products are dependent of a production process, additive manufacturing opens up new ways since here the batch size is only one therefore each application can have a unique solution specifically tailored to it’s needs. Furthermore additive manufacturing creates the possibility to feature intricate geometries which may benefit acoustic performance. An established principle of absorbing sound involves quarter wavelength tubes, which in theory, absorb 100 percent of incident sound at one given frequency. This shows a direct limitation of this principle, but also introduces opportunities for research. Coupling quarter wavelength tubes would in theory create broadband absorption at any desired frequency and absorb sound for 100 percent. Using additive manufacturing as a production technique offers near production freedom. This thesis does research on the behavior of linear coupled quarter wavelength tubes and uses additive manufacturing to create production freedom so that new types of acoustic components can be designed for indoor use.","indoor acoustics; additive manufacturing; broadband absorption; acoustic components; quarter wavelength tube","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

(mentor); Mulder, K.B. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The main objective of this graduation is to find a new structural principle that is emulated by the design by nature. Observing, analysing and transforming the natural design principles and laws could derive a new application in the field of structural design. There are many concepts, approaches and directions to translate biology to architecture. The way to get from biological observations, to physical phenomena, describing these mathematically in the hope to come up with an integrative innovative structural principle for architecture is done through different levels of mimicry. <br/><br/>The observation phase led to a categorisation of biological processes into physical phenomena. It is a necessity to mention that firstly, the twelve phenomena are definitely not the only twelve and secondly, these twelve are not in a specific order or hierarchy. Some phenomena overlap others. To come up with a proper design direction based on natural examinations, a transformation methodology is proposed based on partial mimicry. Every level has its unique grade of abstraction. In the end, after having walked through all the separate levels of the methodology, the derived information will form the basis for the design direction. There are various ways to interpret the methodology. Looping, skipping, going back a few steps or even starting at a totally different level can therefore often be very useful, resulting in more in depth concepts. <br/><br/>The combination of the physical phenomena ‘minimal surface’ and ‘fractals’ formed the basis for my design concept. These phenomena were translated into architectural forms; the anticlastic ruled surface and the branching structure. An anticlastic ruled surface is a negatively double curved surface that can be described using straight lines. This is called a ‘hyperbolic paraboloid’ - in short ‘hypar’. The branching structure is based on the natural fractal of a tree. A split of the main ‘trunk’ is called an iteration. A branching structure defines itself by having one, two, three or even four or more iterations. <br/><br/>Using nature as inspiration combined with mathematics enables us to come up with structurally rational designs. These rational designs are because of its simplicity appropriate for smart solutions on detailing as well. Besides, the research on the structural performance of natural dendriforms contributed to the sustainable development in such a way that material usage was minimized. Ludwig Glaeser rightfully state in his book on the work of Frei Otto that by applying his minimal theories to support elements and space frames, Otto arrived at lighter structures by reducing the buckling lengths of their compression members. This reducement of buckling lengths is also applied to branching structures. <br/><br/>The design development was done one the branching connections, the assembly of the structural components and the water management of the structure. After having elaborated on these facets briefly, the next step was the building method. There are basically three stages when it comes to the building method. The prefabrication off-site, the transportation to the site, and the assembly on-site. For the stage of assembly a so called ‘method statement’ with building sequence is visualised. Finally, the detailling was done, incorporating the design functionalities and the desired design freedom. <br/><br/>There is still a lot to gain from our observations towards nature and phenomena that are all around us. With both of the selected phenomena separately several structures are built and have been proven to work. However the final product of this graduation project; ‘an anticlastic surfaced roof supported by a fractal-like branching structure’ has never been done before and therefore the main objective proposed in the beginning is achieved.<br","Confluence; Nature; Structural Design; Anticlastic; Branching structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

Two new acoustic imaging techniques are Global Optimization and Source Power Integration, improving on the shortcomings of conventional beamforming. This thesis investigated the performance of Global Optimization and Source Power Integration in comparison to conventional beamforming. Two of the main findings are that the Global Optimization technique is good at precisely identifying closely spaced sound sources and that the Source Power Integration technique can accurately determine the sound power levels of distributed sources.","beamforming; acoustic imaging; optimization algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Bertotti, G. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The fluid flow in a reservoir largely depends on faults, as faults can act like conduits or barriers. The influence of three fault parameters (permeability, thickness and angle) on the temperature and pressure behaviour of a geothermal reservoir, has been investigated by modelling a faulted reservoir in 2D in MATLAB, based on the Finite Element Method. The reservoir is assumed to be sandstone with a permeability of 40*10-14 m2. The fault has been modelled with a permeability ranging from 10-11 m2 to 10-17 m2, a thickness ranging from 10 cm to 150 m and an angle ranging from 0 to 90 degrees. While varying one parameter, the other two stayed fixed. The base values for the fault permeability, thickness and angle were 10-14 m2, 20 m and 0 degrees respectively. Both a finite and infinite fault have been modelled in the reservoir. Decreasing the permeability led to a higher production temperature, especially at a finite fault, where the fluid is able to bypass the fault and thus sweep the warmth of a larger part of the reservoir. At a fault permeability of 10-14 m2 the fluid has seemed to have extracted the maximum amount of heat in the reservoir, further decrease in permeability did not lead to a higher production temperature. At an infinite fault there is only a small increase in temperature at a fault permeability of 10-16 m2. The impedance at a finite fault is not much affected, as the fluid is able to flow around the fault. The impedance at an infinite fault, however, rapidly builds up with decreasing permeability. A thickness of 20 m, at the base permeability value of 10-14 m2, results in the highest production temperature. Larger thicknesses cause larger amounts of unrecoverable area and consequently less heat can be extracted. At a finite fault the impedance climbs only to a value of 4 MPa at a thickness of 150 m, but at an infinite fault the impedance already reaches 10 MPa at a thickness of 80 m. The fault has its largest influence at a perpendicular position to the flow. At a parallel position, the results are the same as a reservoir without fault, as the fluid will not have to dodge a lot to reach the production well. All three fault parameters have a significant influence on the temperature and pressure behaviour of the geothermal reservoir. They are all able to enlarge and eliminate the influence of the fault. A finite fault can cause a favourable higher production temperature without a large impedance, as the fluid is able to bypass the fault. An infinite fault has less effect on the temperature and causes the impedance to build up rapidly, which requires an unrealistic high pumping power and consequently an unprofitable geothermal system.","geothermal; faults; reservoir","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

In order to facilitate these applications, geo-information about functional, semantic, and topographic aspects of urban features, their mutual dependencies and relations are needed. Substantial work has been done in the modeling and representation of above ground features in the context of 3D city modelling by means of CityGML. However, the below ground part of the real world, of which utility networks form a big part, is often neglected in 3D city models. At the same time, several existing utility network data models exist. These are, however, commonly tailored to a specific domain and not suitable for the integrated modeling and representation of utility networks and city objects in 3D urban space<br/><br/>This research proposes a 3D data modeling approach for integrated management of below ground utility networks features (viz. electricity and sewer) and related above ground city objects (viz. streetlights and manhole covers). The data modeling approach is successfully examined by implementing relationships between 1) the below ground electricity network and above ground streetlights and 2) between the sewer network and the above ground manhole covers.<br/><br/>Having existing utility network data and city objects as input, a file in CityGML Utility Network ADE format is created. The manipulation of the data structure and content, according the proposed data modeling approach, is completed in FME. The output CityGML dataset allows interoperability but may become very large and objects may be arbitrarily nested leading to complex data structures. Therefore carefully optimized database schemas are required that enables efficient storage, management and data access of the CityGML data. The object-oriented CityGML data model, including the Utility Network ADE, is mapped to a relational database by means of the 3DCityDB. Subsequently, the CityGML data is inserted into the derived relational database. Several relevant (network) analyses are performed by querying the designed relational database.

In addition to incorporating certain physical features, like other algorithms have done, the proposed algorithm (Step-1) also takes into account the spatial relation between these features, in order to increase its robustness. Looking at a staircase from the front, the distances between each step become warped, as they are further away from the observer. This exponential spatial distortion is known as a ’chirp’. Step-1 tries to match a chirp-waveform to every edge along a straight line randomly drawn through an image, and based on that match classify the image as containing a staircase or not. The random lines are then weighted based on their effectiveness using Adaboost, which are finally combined to obtain a final classification. The results show potential but there are still some issues to be addressed. However, once the algorithm has been upgraded it could aid space exploration by being applied to satellite images and autonomous rovers.","Machine Learning; Adaboosting; Computer Vision; Depth Camera","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Space Systems Engineering","",""

In engineering practice, there are two primary methods to solve this problem. Numerical models based primarily on the finite element (FE) method, can treat the dynamics of the tank-liquid system with high accuracy. However, this comes at the cost of low computational speed; these models are slow and sophisticated finite element packages are required that can deal with both the structure and the liquid with equal rigor. On the other hand, analytical methods exist to solve the tank-liquid interaction problem. The latter, although computationally fast, lack of accuracy and can treat only the most simplistic configurations regarding the structural type. In this thesis, we aim to develop a semi-analytical model that combines the strong elements of both approaches, i.e. it is computationally fast and accurate.<br/><br/>In the first part of the thesis, a two-dimensional case is analyzed in which the tank is composed out of three beams representing the plate and the wall of the tank, while the liquid is assumed two-dimensional. With this model, the semi-analytical solution method is established. The method is very straightforward and is based on the principle of dynamic sub-structuring which is valid for linear systems. The response of the structure, i.e., the three interconnected beams, is expressed in terms of the in-vacuo beam modes; a modal basis that is convenient since different modes are orthogonal to each other. The liquid motion is expressed as a superposition of two or three potentials each of which, in turn, is also shown in terms of modes. By representing the response of each sub-structure in terms of an orthonormal set of modes, the behavior of the system is spatially fixed, and the remaining unknowns are only the modal coefficients representing the multipliers of the various modal shapes. The latter is obtained by enforcing displacement compatibility conditions at the liquid-tank interface and by satisfying the forced equations of motion of the structure. The results of the adopted solution approach are compared against known results in the literature for validation purposes.<br/><br/> With the developed three-dimensional model a parametric study is conducted in order to determine the influence of tanks dimensions, soil flexibility and wave speed on the structural response. Results are compared with others available in the literature in order to validate the model. The present model can be easily extended to include more complicated structures, e.g. horizontal tanks and tanks of different geometry. Finally, the model can be amended by a more accurate representation of the soil in terms of a three-dimensional layered continuum by merely adding an extra sub-structure to the system (the layered soil) while keeping the same solution approach.<br","Liquid-Structure Interaction; Liquid Storage Tank; Seismic Response; Earthquake Engineering; Cylindrical Shell; Circular Plate; Thin Shell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We look at the interactions between the shock and the characteristics. The mobility control at the shock front and injectivity are examined. The system is compared to a Newtonian foam.<br/>Results and conclusions: For shear-thinning foam, the foam front’s dimensionless velocity decreases with time, while the characteristics accelerate and collide with the shock. As the foam front propagates, the mobility ratio and mobility control becomes more favorable. The injectivity decreases until breakthrough, then improves slightly. <br/>For shear-thickening foam, dimensionless velocity of the foam front increases with time, while the shocks slow down. Mobility control worsens and injectivity improves as the foam propagates, even before breakthrough. For extremely shear-thickening foam, the near-wellbore region exhibited shear-thinning behavior. This has three causes: a shift from the high- to the low- quality regime, the extrapolation of f mdry over a too large range, and the Namdar Zanganeh correction.<br/>Recommendations: Future models should replace the shock with the colliding characteristic, instead of eliminating the characteristic. For shear-thickening foams, new characteristics should split off from the shock.

The tsunami was caused by an earthquake with a magnitude of 9.0 just of the coast of Tohoku. The inundation height of the tsunami exceeded the design height of the tsunami barriers. This event led to thousands of fatalities. <br/>The aim of this study is to find the characteristics of the incoming tsunami waves for the design of coastal defence structures. This incoming tsunami wave close to the shore or on the shore is influenced by a lot of offshore factors that will change the wave and its behaviour. The tsunami wave will either develop into a bore or just run up the coast. This has large influence on the forces on the barrier. Potential influencing factors are examined on if and how they influence the tsunami wave when it travels to the coast. <br/>A numerical one-dimensional SWASH model is used throughout this study to simulate the tsunami wave. The tsunami factors and the factors that influence the wave were studied in several steps.<br/>The factors that have the most influence on the wave are used to simulate bores. From all these bores the important characteristics for the design of a barrier are investigated. These are the bore height, the bore velocity and the corresponding Froude number. With the simulations a new definition of the bore height is introduced. This is the height at the maximum velocity of the bore. The bore characteristics are also tested with an existing formula for the impact forces on a structure. <br/>The behaviour of the breaking wave is studied and a breaker parameter [ξtsunami] for tsunami waves is made. This breaker parameter defines if the tsunami wave develops into a bore before it reaches the coastline or that the wave runs up the coast without breaking. This is important for the location of the coastal structure. <br/>This breaker parameter and the Froude number of the bore give a relationship between the important parameters that influence the development of a bore and the characteristics of the incoming tsunami bore. <br/>Finally, physical tests were performed at the Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan, to simulate the bore attack on a coastal defence structure with a dam-break. The bore of the tests is compared to the bore from the SWASH simulations. This resulted that the velocities of the tests seem too high. However, with a new method to find the bore front characteristics is a Froude number constructed. This Froude number matches very well for the tests and SWASH simulations.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The main objective of this thesis is to develop a method to investigate stability behaviours of stiffened and unstiffened panels under the influence of in-plane compression and out-of-plane lateral pressure using appropriate simplifications. A test fixture to conduct buckling experiments with lateral pressure is also designed. Due to the deflection caused by the lateral pressure, considerable complexities will be introduced in terms of loading interactions and geometric nonlinearities, which make the analysis both theoretically difficult and computationally intensive. In addition, in aerospace structures, non-cylindrical wing and fuselage panels are potentially exposed to the combined action of in-plane compression and out-of-plane pressure, and the assessment of their stability behaviours becomes an issue of growing concern of structural engineers. To this end, the study of the buckling behaviour of stiffened panels under compression and lateral pressure is of practical importance.<br/><br/>Step by step investigations are performed on typical structures from unstiffened isotropic plates to stiffened composite panels using both analytical and finite element approaches. First, linear based methods using equilibrium and energy equations based on classical plate theories are reviewed, and predictions indicate that these methods only validate within the range of small deformation under small pressure loading. Eigenvalue buckling analysis and explicit dynamic procedures are adopted as numerical methods for verification. Simulated results of explicit dynamic procedures in Abaqus predicted the buckling loads fairly well compared with those in literature, revealing that lateral pressure has a positive impact on the stability behaviour of rectangular isotropic plates by postponing the buckling onset. Composite panels behave similarly as isotropic plates in terms of buckling and postbuckling responses. Given a large pressure, the critical buckling load of a simply supported laminate is able to reach up to four times as that of the uniaxially compressed plate. <br/><br/>A conceptual design of a test fixture for buckling experimental studies involving compression and lateral pressure is proposed in which pressurized airbags are adopted for generating uniform pressure load. The lateral loads are controlled by the internal pressure of airbags through a pressure gauge. Compression sensors are utilized to calibrate the pressure loads by measuring the reaction forces. A rubber filler pad is laid inside the panel's bays between stringers to eliminate the unevenness on the stiffener side of the panel. Test rigs are designed with the consideration of compatibility with classical buckling experiments to lower the cost. Dynamic explicit simulations of the test reveal that the locations of the first local buckling onsets are shifted from the skin to stiffeners with the increase of lateral pressure. Buckling strengths of the entire stiffened panels exhibit an increase with the increase of lateral pressure. However, this trend is reversed when the pressure load exceeded a certain value at which stiffeners buckle before the skin.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

A MOD well, or MOD well section, has a (nearly) constant diameter over several sections. This is achieved by deploying expandable liners: a liner is lowered into position and is expanded by pulling an over-sized cone through it. This plasticly deforms the pipe, increasing its inner diameter to that of the previous section. MOD eliminates many of the constraints of conventional well design. Greater depths may be reached and zonal isolation may be performed without paying the penalty of reduced production rates.<br/><br/>While lowering an expandable assembly (expandable liner and expansion tools) into a well, caution is required. Displacement of the drilling mud causes a pressure drop due to fluid friction and acceleration. The running speed of the assembly into the well is limited by the surge (overpressure) or swab (underpressure) pressure. Pressure must remain within a predefined window to ensure well control.<br/><br/>The current understanding of the mechanisms governing surge/swab pressure, as well as the models used to predict it, are deemed insufficient. The effect of unorthodox MOD conditions is unknown. This study is conducted to overcome these obstacles.<br/><br/>Firstly, a model is programmed so that transient surge and swab pressures, induced by assembly movement, may be predicted. The drilling mud’s velocity and pressure are described by the water hammer equations, which are solved using the interpolated method of characteristics. One dimensional (1D), unsteady and nonuniform flow of a slightly compressible fluid in a conduit with linearly elastic walls is considered. The annular pressure drop for flow with a moving inner pipe is solved considering both laminar and turbulent flow of a Herschel-Bulkley fluid. Flow over the expansion tools is solved separately and is considered 1D and incompressible.<br/><br/>Secondly, the model is validated. The model is first validated under conventional conditions using field measurements presented in literature and performs better than existing models. The validity of the model while dealing with extremely small clearances, as found in MOD applications, is investigated through a full-scale experiment on Shell’s test rig. The surge and swab pressures are generally predictable. Some discrepancies between predictions and measurements are observed and are attributed to the relatively large uncertainty in clearance size and shape, which results from imperfect pipes. The surge/swab pressure’s sensitivity to the size and shape of the pipes means that predictions should be treated with care. The effect of local annular flow restriction over the expansion tools is investigated too. The tools are found to cause acceleration induced transient pressures not predicted by the model. This implies that the 1D and/or incompressible assumption at the interface does not describe the flow adequately.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the effect of MOD well design at true well depths and assembly lengths is investigated through a case study. The surge pressure is significant. The pressure drop generated in the narrow annulus between assembly and wellbore is too high to allow significant flow. Instead, all drilling mud is displaced upwards through the drillstring. Swabbing occurs behind the assembly. Circulation while tripping in expandable assemblies is therefore impossible. At these depth and length scales, the effect of fluid compression and borehole expansion becomes significant, causing steady state models to become increasingly inaccurate with depth.","Swab; Surge; Pressure; Expandable; Transient; Waterhammer; MOD; Well","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-01","","","","","",""

Another issue that is observed is lot segregation at different breweries, at different production lines and on different production dates. The lot segregation will cause that in times of a recall an organisation has to withdraw significantly more products. Using a Multi Criteria Analysis and the Ease and effect method results in a final design based on organisational changes, periodic evaluations, barcode technology and RFID technology. Implementing this design guarantees the traceability since all the incoming and outgoing flows are registered at pallet level and the registered data is periodically evaluated.

However, the knowledge on the effects of these pits is limited to only two studies at a single reef: near-shore wave transformation based on measurements (Ford et al., 2013) and a numerical modelling study (Yao et al., 2016). This MSc thesis provides insights on the effects of pits, related to hydrodynamics and wave runup, on a large variety of fringing reefs, by using a 1D and 2DH process-based wave-resolving hydrodynamic model (XBeach non-hydrostatic+, “XBnh+”). Model results indicate that excavation pits cause a decrease in amplitude for waves in the infra-gravity (IG) frequency band. For the majority of the modelled reefs, this was mainly due to a modification of the longest natural frequency of the reef caused by the pit, resulting in a decrease in resonant amplification. Both pit width and cross-shore location have a strong influence on this mechanism. The observed changes in variance in the high frequency (HF) band can be partly explained by a decrease in wave dissipation, as well as a decrease in wave-wave (triad) interaction, both associated with (locally) increased water depth, which causes an increase of the HF peak and a decrease of the HF tail. Of all modelled reefs, there is a 15% chance of an increase in wave runup due to the presence of a pit. This probability is lowest for pits with narrow width and/or located close to the reef crest. The change in runup ranges from +10% to -20%. An increase in runup is caused by a combination of increased wave energy at peak frequencies, as well as smaller reductions in resonant amplification. Moreover, the effects of pits on mean water level near-shore of the excavation can cause circulation patterns that potentially result in coastal erosion and entrapment of sediments.","fringing reef; hydrodynamics; XBeach; wave runup; atoll; excavation pits","en","master thesis","","","","","","NUS-TUD Double MSc Degree Programme","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","7.121645, 171.186053"

Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) or energy disaggregation aims to estimate appliance-level energy consumption data from the aggregate consumption data of households. NILM algorithms can be broadly classified into supervised and unsupervised (or semi-supervised) techniques. The former requires a large amount of prior data for each appliance and the latter relies on manual tuning of models of appliances based on some metadata information. While there is a significant interest from academia and industry, NILM techniques are still not adopted widely across households. This is mainly because the techniques developed for one household cannot be generalized and applied in other households (applicability), require tremendous manual-tuning to apply across households (scalability), and cannot run in real-time. To overcome the above issues, we propose a novel semi-supervised energy disaggregation framework – UniversalNILM. The key idea of UniversalNILM is to model appliances in a few (3-10) training houses, which has detailed appliance-level data and transfer this learning to test houses (blind disaggregation), which has only aggregate house consumption data to derive fine-grained appliance energy consumption. To this end, we develop an automated appliance modeling technique that creates general appliance models across various appliance brands and models. The general appliance models are analytical models which describe power consumption of each appliance. These general appliance models are then fine-tuned automatically on test houses to accurately disaggregate the energy consumption in real-time. To test the robustness of UniversalNILM, we empirically evaluated it across three publicly available real-world datasets. We show that the general appliance models learnt on a few households is able to accurately disaggregate on unseen test houses in the same dataset, as well as unseen houses from different datasets. This is the first work in NILM which is able to perform disaggregation across datasets. Another improvement is that UniversalNILM outperforms the reported accuracy from both state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised NILM techniques.","NILM; Machine Learning; disaggregation; Energy efficient technologies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

In the bay adjacent to Quidico town, a great number of local fishermen are active. In the current situation, high waves, a strong current and significant sediment transport hamper the effectiveness of the bay as fishing harbour. Also qualitative onshore facilities to support onshore activities of the fishermen, are absent. The Department of Ports of theMinistry of Public Works, developed a preliminary design proposal, to solve these problems. However, after consultation with the fishermen, this proposal was declared unsatisfactory. Therefore, an additional study is performed to develop a new integral design for the bay of Quidico. The desired design consists of onshore buildings, a paved support area, mooring facilities and breakwaters to create shelter for safe mooring of the fishing boats. Furthermore, these breakwaters shouldmitigate the problems related to sediment transport.<br/><br/>To develop a new breakwater orientation and design, wave data is analysed. Waves coming from the south to south-west are most common, but not guiding due to the sheltering factor of IslandMocha, positioned in front of the coast. The guiding wave, which is coming from the north-west, is implemented in models of Delft3D to see what the new orientation of the breakwater should be. Based on the wave analysis, sediment transport analysis and modelling results, a new breakwater orientation is determined, that fulfills all requirements prescribed by the DoP. After defining this new orientation, the influence of the breakwater on sediment and waves is analysed. Due to the new orientation, a new design of the breakwater is made.<br/><br/>The fishing harbour should offer the possibility for the fisherman to unload their goods and berth safely. The DoP proposed the construction of a mooring facility along the south-west shoreline of Quidico Bay. Two types of quay walls for the mooring facilities are proposed, a sheet pile wall and a concrete mass wall. For both types a preliminary design is developed, by making use of the 2D finite element software PLAXIS and hand calculations. The preferred mooring facility design mainly depends on the soil conditions at the specific location. From the boundary conditions it is concluded the bedrock is found at a depth of 60m, the soil above mainly consists of sand. Therefore the construction a sheet pile wall to serve as mooring facility, is recommended.<br/><br/>In the initial design of the Department of Ports, six separate masonry buildings are proposed to accommodate the desired supporting facilities. These buildings cover a large area of the bay and will require a large paved supporting platform. To reduce this paved area, the DoP is interested in a more compact design, that includes all supporting facilities in one multi-storey building. In consultation with the DoP two different designs are developed; a three-storey steel building and a two-storey concrete building. A structural design is developed within the boundaries set by the functional design requirements. Next, a structural analysis is performed by making use of finite element software (ETABS) and a final design is obtained for both buildings. The concrete building is concluded to be the most suitable option for the DoP.<br/><br/>Quick offloading of the boats and smooth transshipment of goods is hindered due to the lack of a good support area and access road. The DoP proposed a design for both pavements in the their preliminary study, but it was requested to evaluate different alternatives. Three different pavement technologies are proposed for the access road: surface treatment, asphalt and concrete slabs. For the pavement in the support area concrete slabs are the preferred solution. To achieve an optimal pavement design that fulfills all structural and serviceability requirements throughout the full design life, slab pavements with different dimensions and thicknesses are evaluated. In conclusion, short concrete slabs are the preferred pavement for both areas. Short slab pavement is an upcoming technology that has great advantages in terms of structural performance and costs.<br","Fishing-Harbour; Quidico; Department of Ports; Design Proposal","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","MP240","-38.2, -73.5"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Steady state multiphase flow models are used for the design and operation of pipelines that are used in the oil and gas industry. The predictions obtained with these models contain uncertainties, which arise from model assumptions and simplifications, and from uncertainties in the input parameters. In this thesis we investigate the effect of uncertainties in the input parameters (such as the wall roughness or the superficial velocities) on two main quantities of interest in steady state multiphase flow in pipelines: the liquid holdup and the pressure drop.<br/>The approach that we take is to describe the uncertain input parameters by probability density functions (PDFs), propagate these through the steady state models, and obtain a PDF for the quantities of interest. We use two methodologies from the field of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to perform the propagation step: Monte Carlo sampling, the current standard in the literature, and Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), our proposed approach. Furthermore, we use Sobol indices to perform a sensitivity analysis that ranks the input parameters depending on their contribution to the output.<br/>Our proposed UQ methodology is applied on two commonly used multiphase flow models in the oil and gas industry: a 0-D model, the Shell Flow Correlations (SFC), and a 1-D model, PIPESIM.<br/>First, application to the SFC reveals that PCE is much more efficient than Monte Carlo sampling, and an improvement of several orders of magnitude is achieved in terms of the number of samples required for a given accuracy, while the evaluation of a single sample requires the same computation time for the two methods. Furthermore, with UQ the flow pattern maps commonly used in industry can now be displayed in a probabilistic way. This allows the quantification of the probability that a flow regime (e.g. slug, stratified) occurs under given conditions. These are significant improvements compared to existing work that handles uncertainties in multiphase flow models.<br/>Second, application of PCE to a multiphase pipeline, known as Goldeneye, modelled in PIPESIM revealed that several uncertain variables, namely the wall roughness, the ambient temperature and the outlet pressure, play a role in determining the liquid holdup and the pressure drop. This is in contrast to what was assumed in an earlier benchmarking study. Furthermore, our probabilistic approach allows us to make predictions under uncertainty. For instance, we can now predict that the liquid holdup of the Goldeneye pipeline will have a 65% probability to be lower than the value of 1496 m3, the value obtained when using a deterministic setting.","Uncertainty Quantification; Multiphase flow models; pipelines; steady-state","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Solid and Fluid Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Schmid, Matthias (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The flow field subjected to the influence of the helicopter rotor is characterized by its three-dimensional pattern and unsteadiness. The accurate modeling of the flow around the rotor blades addressed by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations is associated with high computational costs. The complexity of the analysis can be reduced by means of simplified methods such as the actuator disk approach, where the rotor is modeled as a zero-thickness porous surface.<br/><br/>The CFD solver TAU developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) includes among its features an actuator disk module which transmits to the flow field prescribed time-averaged load distributions both in axial and tangential directions by means of pressure and tangential velocity jumps. The computation of these loads can be achieved by using the Blade Element Analysis Tool (BEAT), a developed rotor code based on the blade element theory. In addition, since it is considered that changes in blade motion about the feathering bearing and flapping hinge induce variations in the aerodynamic loads acting on the blades and vice versa, the loads need to be calculated under trimmed or equilibrium conditions.<br/><br/>The coupling between BEAT and the TAU actuator disk is defined in a way that the velocity captured at the grid points of the actuator disk surface after each simulation performed in TAU is transferred to BEAT, which computes an updated aerodynamic load distribution. The performance of this approach is tested for an isolated rotor configuration in hovering and forward flight conditions. In hovering flight, the convergence of the CFD flow simulations towards the steady state solution is not satisfactory due to the stiffness of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations at low Mach numbers. Furthermore, reverse flow regions are determined by TAU at the inner and outer boundaries of the actuator disk. The recirculation flow entails high gradients in angle of attack between neighboring blade sectional elements, which yields to the unstable formation of new reverse flow regions. Nevertheless, in forward flight conditions the performance of the flow solver is robust and convergent solutions can be obtained. Moreover, as the flight speed is increased, the shed vorticity is displaced more quickly outside the rotor disk and, hence, its associated effects on the performance of the rotor are diminished.<br/><br/>The accuracy of the coupling approach is validated by comparing the computed results with those measured in a wind tunnel test campaign. The found differences in pitch control angles are assigned to the fact that the blade elastic deformations are neglected in the developed method. This statement constitutes the baseline to be developed for future work.<br/><br/>Finally, the reduction in computation time required by the coupling approach with respect to other more accurate methods enhances the idea of further developments. Therefore, the developed method can be regarded as a suitable strategy to tackle the problem in forward flight conditions in cases where high fidelity results are not needed, such as in the preliminary design stages.","Helicopter Rotors; Actuator Disk; CFD Simulations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The three-body problem (3BP) formulated by I. Newton has inspired many great mathematicians like L. Euler (1707-1783), J.L. Lagrange (1736-1813), K.G.J. Jacobi (1804-1851), W.R. Hamilton (1805-1865) and J.H. Poincaré (1854-1912) to develop mathematical studies, methods and theories in an attempt to solve this problem. Although these concepts have been crucial to the advancement of the natural sciences, a closed form solution has yet to be found. To aid in solving this problem, a restricted form of the 3BP has been formulated in which the mass of the two primaries greatly exceeds the mass of the third body. Known as the circular restricted three-body problem, this system gives rise to three collinear and two equilateral equilibria referred to as libration points. These locations are surrounded by various families of periodic libration point orbits. The corresponding exotic trajectories are highly non-Keplerian which offer desirable characteristics that have revolutionised space mission design. Crucial to this effort has been the theory on hyperbolic invariant manifolds. These topological structures asymptotically arrive at (stable) or depart from (unstable) a selected target orbit by exploiting the natural dynamics of the system. A connection which joins stable and unstable manifold trajectories with no discrepancy in state space, constitutes to a free (natural) transfer mechanism. In the case that two different equilibria are connected, this path is called a heteroclinic connection. The potential existence of these solutions are of significant scientific interest and are known to exist in the planar case. In this research, the current theory is extended by providing a comprehensive understanding of the phase space of the (spatial) vertical Lyapunov (V-L) orbits and their associated manifolds including the potential existence of heteroclinic connections in the Earth-Moon system.The transition from the planar to the spatial case is associated with a rapid increase in complexity. To reduce the order of the problem, the two hyperbolic manifolds which are to be connected are integrated until they intersect a plane called a Poincaré section. These stopping conditions form a N-1-dimensional subset of the phase space. A completely new effort is aimed at investigating the influence of the orientation of this section on the state vector discrepancy that arises from the connection of hyperbolic manifolds emanating from collinear libration points L1 and L2. The aim of this study is to reveal novel transfer trajectories outside the solution space confined by the traditional locations and orientations of the Poincaré section. The path towards creating these insights consist of three stages, all of which employ a variety of numerical methods. As these steps are sequential, the individual chapters of this thesis cannot be considered as stand-alone work. First of all, the target orbits are generated through the refinement (Differential Correction) and extension (Numerical Continuation) of analytic approximations based on Perturbation Theory. The families of horizontal Lyapunov (H-L), halo, axial, and V-L are analysed to provide an overview of the range of possible solutions. The periodicity of each orbit is verified numerically and the trajectory is validated by studying the so-called monodromy matrix. Secondly, the manifolds are constructed using the eigenspace of this fundamental matrix. Once more a high level of generality is achieved, this time by analysing the sets of manifolds associated with three different families of target orbits at three distinct energy levels. Each member of each manifold is verified through studying deviations in the Jacobi's constant, and validated by using symmetries. Lastly, the stopping conditions for integration of these hyperbolic trajectories are varied to analyse the sensitivity with respect to the orientation of the Poincaré section.This research has revealed that the most optimal connections for V-L orbits are found outside of the traditional stopping conditions. The ramifications of this behaviour are extensive and are observed to arise from the fact that these hyperbolic trajectories curve behind the Moon. Moreover, the orthographic projections display interesting differences in global stability. The manifolds associated with the V-L family retain their shape, whereas those corresponding to the H-L and halo families behave in a chaotic way over time. This enables an accurate approximation over extended integration periods. In addition, the V-L orbits have revealed the largest eigenvalue moduli across all families in both equilibria which indicate a minimum time to unwind from the target orbit. In conclusion, these insights provide a fresh perspective on the range of possible solutions and phenomena that can be further explored. Moreover, new techniques have been employed to ensure the mathematical validity of libration point orbits and their hyperbolic invariant manifolds. As these structures are inherently difficult to verify, this effort forms a valuable contribution to the TU Delft Astrodynamic Toolbox (C++) for future research.","Invariant manifold theory; Circular restricted three-body problem; Earth-Moon system; Dynamical systems theory; Heteroclinic connection; Natural connection; TU Delft Astrodynamic Toolbox; Poincaré map; Libration point orbit; Differential correction; Pseudo-arclength continuation; Perturbation theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-01-19","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Current haptic shared control systems induce conflicts when the reference trajectory of the automation differs from the drivers own desired trajectory, which can lead to rejection of the automation. This study investigated whether conflicts can be reduced by individualizing the automation. The approach of the study is twofold. First, a Four Design Choices Architecture (FDCA) is implemented that allows for separate tuning of the reference in a haptic shared controller that determines the total torques by separating feedback and feed-forward torques. Second, a driver-model was used to identify the individual steering parameters and determine the corresponding individualized reference in the curved road-sections. The combination of the FDCA controller and individualized reference was evaluated in an experiment using a fixed-based driving simulator. Sixteen subjects participated in a two-day experiment, where the first day was used to collect manual driving data to identify the individual and average steering parameters to construct the references. On the second day participants drove with four conditions: manual control, a conventional shared controller architecture using feedback torques towards a center-line reference, an individual tuned reference with FDCA controller, and an average tuned reference with FDCA controller. The results showed that the driver-model was able to identify differences in individual curve negotiation styles. Both FDCA controllers resulted in higher objective acceptance and lower workload; conflicts in torques and driver torques decreased significantly compared to manual control and the conventional controller. The usefulness and satisfaction scores were only marginally higher for the individualized FDCA compared to the average FDCA. Interestingly, only the individualized FDCA was perceived more satisfactory and useful than the conventional controller and manual control. Thus, the individualized FDCA can reduce conflicts and increase acceptance compared to the conventional shared controller","Haptic Shared Control; human-machine interaction; Conflicts; Driving Simulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-04-18","","","","","",""

Optimizing conventional video filter applications to take advantage of current multi- and many-core architectures is one such application. This thesis investigates the case of how to parallelize a video filter-chain to obtain maximum performance on Intel's newest many-core architecture, the Knights Landing platform, and also on a conventional Haswell Xeon server platform. Implemented optimizations include line parallelization, multiple frames in flight, and AVX-512. The line parallelization and multiple frames in flight optimizations are both coarse-grained parallelism strategies, focusing on minimizing synchronization and communication overhead while the AVX-512 optimization was a fine-grained parallelism strategy. Challenges found with the coarse-grained parallelism strategies are primarily load balancing issues. The line parallelization approach paired with the multiple frames in flight optimization managed to achieve a speedup of 27.14x for the 28-core Xeon server system and 95.47x for the Knights Landing system with the compute-intensive 8k color conversion benchmark. Memory-intensive benchmarks such as blend had lower but still decent overall speedups at 9.76x and 25.34x speedup for the Xeon server and Knights Landing platform respectively. The AVX-512 optimization for color conversion and scale resulted in a single-threaded performance enhancement of 1.41x and 1.60x speedup respectively. We can conclude from the experimental data analysis that for video filter applications, data parallelization strategies are very effective. Especially for compute-intensive filters such as color conversion, it can net up to near linear speedup to the amount of cores. The main limitation prohibiting speedup found in some other filters is memory bandwidth.","parallelism; filter; Video; scalability; Performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are sensitive to an erosion process that is known as piping. After several years of investigation into piping, Sellmeijer proposed design rules by curve fitting results of a numerical model. The design rule are currently applied in the assessment of levees, despite being obtained under the assumption of uniform and homogenous subsoils. Consequently, the design rules seem to be fine for standard consultancy, but it is insufficient for heterogeneous and anisotropic. In this thesis, the effects of anisotropy and heterogeneity are analysed in a elementary and a realistic numerical model study in order to improve the design rule of Sellmeijer. In the elementary study, several aquifers compositions are created by adding an artificial element with a different permeability to the body or by varying the permeability of the body depending on direction. The realistic study is a modification of the elementary study since stratified aquifer compositions have been implemented. After each simulation, the critical head computed in the elementary or realistic composition is compared to the critical head computed with Sellmeijer design rules which requires one calculation value of the bulk permeability. To improve the design rules an alternative method to determine the bulk permeability is proposed that assumes that there is curved or radial flow towards the exit point instead of the Dupuit method which assumes that there is only horizontal flow. As a consequence, the bulk permeability is calculated as the geometric or logarithmic mean of the vertical and horizontal permeability. Based on both studies, it can be concluded that both anisotropy and heterogeneity in the aquifer greatly increase the critical head so that heterogeneous and anisotropic aquifers are significantly more resistant to piping. In some cases, the aquifer can withstand a 45% higher water level. Furthermore, Sellmeijer’s design rules more accurately approach the heterogeneous and anisotropic aquifer, if the bulk permeability is determined with the new approach.","Piping; Heterogeneity; Anisotropy; Sellmeijer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The increasing energy demand and reduction of greenhouse gasses require a significant increase of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency of buildings. Also, the increasing degree of renewable energy sources increase the demand to store excess energy and to bridge the gap between energy production and consumption. This thesis focusses on the possible energy reduction for air-conditioning systems by the application of thermal energy storage and phase change materials (PCMs).<br/><br/>Tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB) is a promising PCM for air-conditioning applications. PCMs store thermal energy in the form of latent heat. PCMs are also promising cold storage media because of the capacity to store energy at constant or near constant temperature. TBAB has a high solubility in water and hydrate crystals are formed in a TBAB aqueous solution at temperatures from 0-12.5 °C depending on the concentration of TBAB in the solution. The solid mass fraction of the slurry is limited to maintain the slurry pumpable.<br/><br/>A pilot system to control the temperature of a 144 m² space is installed. The system is equipped with multiple sensors to monitor the system. The air-conditioning system consists out of a primary loop, which uses the conventional refrigerant R134a, and a secondary loop, which uses a TBAB solution as distribution fluid. An initial mass fraction of 36.5 wt% TBAB is used, resulting in a phase equilibrium temperature of approximately 12.5 °C. The hydrate crystals are produced in the generator and stored in a storage vessel of 300 l. The capacity of the air-conditioning system is around 3.5 kW.<br/><br/>The pilot system is modelled with both water and a TBAB solution as secondary distribution fluid by improving and extending an existing model. The crystals are produced in the generator by evaporation of the primary refrigerant. The crystals are removed from the heat transfer surface by the friction of the flow. The crystal layer thickness and flow velocity in the generator are calculated by comparing the friction losses to experimental determined scrapping forces required to remove the crystals. Experimental data of the pilot plant are used to validate the model.<br/><br/>The model simulations of the air-conditioning system show a COP increase from 3.27 to 4.30 when a 36.5 wt% TBAB solution is used as a secondary distribution fluid instead of water. Simulation results show also an increased performance when the initial mass fraction of TBAB is lowered to 35 wt%. The COP of the system increased to 4.50 mainly due to the reduction of the energy consumption of the compressor. The force required to remove the crystals from the heat transfer surface lowers by lowering the initial mass fraction of TBAB. Therefore, the steady state crystal layer thickness in the generator reduces, increasing the heat transfer rate by lowering the thermal resistance. However, reducing the initial TBAB mass fraction also lowers the evaporation temperature of the primary refrigerant and the total cooling capacity of the slurry.","TBAB; air conditioning; slurry; phase change materials; Energy Storage; Clathrate hydrate slurry; Cold storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

After the disaster, the Dutch Government appointed the so-called Deltacomittee, provided with the task of advising on the execution of the Deltaplan. As part of the Deltaplan, North Sea estuaries has been closed off from the North Sea in order to provide sufficient safety against flooding in the future.<br/>The 11000 hectare Lake Grevelingen was one of the closed off North Sea estuaries. Two dams and two islands enclose the lake and prevent fresh water flowing in. Characteristic of former estuaries are deep gullies that remain intact as any kind of sediment transport is prevented. Contact with the North Sea is prevented due to the construction of the Brouwersdam, the western border of Lake Grevelingen. Direct after finishing the construction works of the Brouwersdam, Lake Grevelingen showed reducing oxygen gradients and thus a decreasing water quality, especially at the deep gullies. The construction of a stop lock, the Brouwerssluice, was conducted to prevent the further decrease of the oxygen gradient.<br/>Today, more than 40 years after finalizing the Brouwerssluice, the low oxygen gradient tends to rise to shallower areas and reaches critical values. Measures, such as a water inlet system are due to be constructed.<br/>Introducing a tidal range of 50 cm has shown to be a valid solution to overcome the decreasing water quality. The tidal range allows thinking of power generation when water flowing in or out Lake Grevelingen. Generating tidal energy produces revenues and provides renewable energy. Therefore, the design of a Tidal Power Plant in the Brouwersdam has become the goal of this thesis.<br/>Since caissons were used to close Lake Grevelingen off from the North Sea, as a starting point, it has been determined whether these caissons allow reusing with a new function; forming the powerhouse of a Tidal Power Plant. Mainly due to the concrete cover of the caisson, has shown to be inappropriate. Adapting the caissons becomes expensive and very time-consuming.<br/>The starting point of the power plant construction was found in the turbine dimensions. In total six turbine types have been analyzed. Based on their efficiency, fish friendliness and ability to generate power in two directions, two optimal turbine types for low head power generation have been found: free-stream (Tocardo) and a modified bulb turbine (Pentair Fairbanks Nijhuis).<br/>Due to the low head differences between lake Grevelingen and the North Sea, maximum energy generation will be required even for very low head differences. Hence, turbines able to generate energy at such low head differences will be required. In the Preliminary turbine design, two turbine types provided the most promising features: The Pentair Fairbanks modified Bulb turbine and the Tocardo free-stream turbine.<br/>A total cross-sectional discharge area of 960 m2 would lead to a tidal range of 50 cm at Lake Grevelingen. Applying in total 18 turbines in a squared sluiceway with an inner space of 8.24 meter allows introducing a tidal range of 50 cm at the lake.<br/>The free-stream turbine has already proven to generate power in low head environments in previous projects. The PFN modified bulb turbine has not yet been tested on such scale, but due to the expected higher efficiency rate, the energy generation of the PFN lies supposedly much higher than the Tocardo free-stream turbine. Therefore, it has been decided to temporarily apply the free-stream turbine until the PFN turbine has shown to meet the fish friendly requirements while ensuring high efficiencies. With current knowledge, the annual production of the Tocardo and PFN turbine has been estimated at 20 GWh and 80 GWh respectively. The energy production of the freestream turbine is based on the tidal data obtained from 2016. The same tidal data has been applied to the PFN turbine while accounting for the sea level rise as well. Since it is expected the PFN turbine will be in commission at 2030, an estimated sea level rise of 25 cm has been added to the 2016 tidal data.<br/>The thickness of the concrete members in the preliminary design has been set at 500 mm. The conceptual design of structural elements has been dedicated to checking the assumption. In total four base cases have been studied, providing local and global forces emerged from uneven bedding of the rubble foundation layer. The rubble foundation layer functions as a bed protection foundation on which the Tidal Power Plant is located.<br/>The influence of uneven bedding of the rubble foundation bed has been computed by considering the Tidal Power Plant as a beam on an elastic foundation. Due to an uneven bedding, one-dimensional base cases Hogging and Sagging are introduced. Sagging represents a beam on elastic foundation subject to a reduced foundation stiffness at the midsection of the beam. Hogging has been described as the opposite situation of sagging, a reduced bedding stiffness at the beam edges.<br/>The structure’s strength has been determined while applying the hogging and sagging bases cases together with external and local forces. The external forces emerged from the hydraulic pressures in transverse direction and lateral earth pressures in longitudinal direction. The local forces concern the self-weight of an element or locally applied loads, such as the ballast load or road construction. The bending and shear resistance of the concrete members has been checked accordingly.<br/>In addition to the forces obtained from hogging and sagging, a coupled 2-dimensional approach has been applied. Two base cases have been considered in the 2-dimensional plane. The uneven bedding induces the rise of torsional moments in the beam on an elastic foundation. The torsional resistance of the concrete members has been checked. Together with local and global one-dimensional forces, the governing reinforcement ratio has been determined for relevant concrete members. Combining the findings of the one-dimensional approach with the two-dimensional approach has resulted in reinforcement ratios exceeding 3%. Comparing this with the 1 % economical reinforcement ratio value, it has been concluded the 500 mm thickness of the concrete member is insufficient.<br/>In further analyses, it is recommended to provide a cost estimation including revenues made from the energy production. The feasibility of the Tidal Power Plant will be determined by this cost estimation.","Concept Design; Tidal energy; Torsion; Tidal Power Plant; Gate design; Turbine Size; Bed protection; concrete structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.772861, 3.863218"

Due to the large pressure drop over the well head choke, the so-called Joule-Thomson cooling will give a very low temperature of the<br/>expanding gas jet. Low-temperatures can give brittle fracture of the material in the piping downstream of the choke. Models are needed to verify whether the material temperature remains above the lower-design temperature. For the model validation, Imperial College in London (on request by Shell) has carried out lab experiments with argon gas that expands through an orifice from 120 bara to 1 bara. Awaiting the results of the lab experiments, detailed simulations were carried out in the present study using the Fluent CFD programme.<br/><br/>The 3D, steady, compressible Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations were solved with the SST k −ω model for the turbulence. The considered configuration is the same as in the lab. It consists of an upstream chamber with argon at 120 bara, that expands through a 5 mm long orifice with 1.55 mm diameter, into a square outlet section with 50 mm sides and 500 mm length. The inlet temperature is -17 oC and the outlet pressure is 1 bara. The supersonic flow leaving the orifice reaches a maximum Mach number of about 9, just before a shock to subsonic flow is found. The jet reaches very low temperatures due to isentropic expansion, and reaches the isenthalpic expansion temperature of 196 K (or -77 oC) downstream of the shock. The jet reaches the sides of the outlet at a distance of about 100 mm.<br/><br/>The maximum Mach number of about 9 predicted by Fluent is higher than the value of about 6 found in a previous simulation study that used the STAR-CCM+ CFD programme. To verify the Fluent results, the distributions of grid cells was varied and the number of grid cells was increased. Also, a MATLAB programme was written that solved the inviscid compressible equations (Euler equations) for an axisymmetric jet. <br/><br/>This confirmed the Fluent results. In addition to the 3D square outlet section, also 3D and 2D Fluent simulations were carried out for a cylindrical outlet (using a hydraulic diameter of 50 mm). The maximum Mach number and the jet structure (velocity, temperature) are not affected by the side walls. This is because the side walls are sufficiently far from the jet.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the temperature and the heat transfer at the walls of the outlet section were investigated. Thereto both adiabatic and non-adiabatic walls were considered. The ambient temperature is 20 oC. Thermal boundary layers are formed along the side walls, that are exposed to a temperature of 196 K (the isenthalpic expansion temperature) in the centre of the pipe, up to a distance of about 1.5 m, where the outer edge of the boundary layer reaches the centre of the pipe. Thereafter the centre line temperature increases due to heat inflow from the ambient.","Joule Thomson cooling; Underexpanded jet; Cooling; Mach number; Shockwave; gas dynamics; High pressure to low pressure; CFD; Computational Fluid dynamics; Fluent; Shell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-18","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Solid and Fluid Mechanics","Fluid Flow team Shell","52,3864 4,9018"

(mentor); Keulemans, W. (mentor)","2018","Industrial railway systems can be found within companies where the production and processing of goods require large quantities to be transported. These systems are often privately owned and are characterized by short to cover distances, many locations, inefficient layout due to historical expansion and bidirectional driving on the rail tracks. Examples of these systems can be found in mining operations, port operations in both container and bulk material, agriculture goods, lumber and other natural goods and steel production. Local optimization in such systems have been found to not directly lead to global improvement of the system as a whole. This research suggests a new model to define and measure the performance of industrial railway systemas a whole. Themodel uses the customer value, known from the theory of lean thinking, as the essential performance metric. It does so by combining the prioritization of transport tasks with a pricing mechanism on delay, in order to be compared with operating expenses. In order to test the model and to optimize the capacity of an industrial railway system a case study is performed at the railway system of Tata Steel IJmuiden, one of Europe’s steel production giants located in the Netherlands. The industrial railway system found here transports the 7m ton of annual steel production to numerous production facilities until the end product is send out for external transport. Containing 95 kilometer of railway track, 294 switches, 13 locomotives, 360 wagons and over 40 destinations, this highly complex network is crucial in the continuity of production flow of the complete site. The future performance of the railway system is under pressure since a growing production leads to an increase in rail transport demand. It is unknown if the capacity of the current railway systemis sufficient to execute the increased future transport demand. The complexity of the system is caused by the historically expanded inefficient layout of tracks, multiple wagon and locomotive types, high loads which cause track and wagons breakdowns and a diverse set of human decisionmaking by experience and intuition. On top of that, the lack of transparency in the railway specific processes caused that the railway system and its performance as a whole is not well understood...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-19","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

The goal of this graduation project is to develop a unified path planning and tracking method for autonomous vehicles in highway driving scenarios, by making use of Artificial Potential Fields (APFs).<br/><br/>Most autonomous vehicles base their navigation control on first planning a path, which is then tracked by using a combination of feedback and feedforward control. The strength of using APFs is the possibility to integrate the path planning and tracking process. This concept has been extensively used in the field of robotics. The attractive and repulsive forces coming from the APF guide the robot towards the final goal while avoiding obstacles. This offers an intuitive way to represent the level of hazard experienced in the direct environment. However, considerably less research has been devoted to the application of APFs in the field of autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, the available research mostly treats the vehicle as a particle, thereby leaving out the more complicated vehicle dynamics. <br/><br/>Therefore, this research is aimed at including the vehicle dynamics into the path-planning process such as to generate feasible and desirable paths. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is proposed to fulfill this task. The adopted vehicle model is given by the linear bicycle model, which represents the vehicle dynamics sufficiently well for highway applications. The two main manoeuvers of lane keeping and lane changing are executed with the aid of two different APFs that were designed for these specific purposes, respectively. A second order Taylor approximation is used to incorporate the APFs into the quadratic MPC cost function. <br/><br/>The Simulink model from TNO to simulate the controlled vehicle is modified by extending it to curved roads and by including the developed APF MPC algorithm. The resulting algorithm is capable of following curved highway lanes and overtaking slower vehicles at different velocities in the simulation environment. The results are compared with the previously developed path planner and lateral controller from TNO. In order to also deliver longitudinal control action, the model can be connected to the adaptive cruise control application of TNO. <br/><br/>It is concluded that the suggested method potentially offers a powerful solution to the navigation control of autonomous vehicles. Real-life experiments have to be done in the future to validate the performance of the controller.","Artificial potential fields; Path planning; Trajectory tracking; Lateral control; Model predictive control; Autonomous vehicles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

These insights are valuable because Damen keeps standardised vessels in stock in order to significantly reduce delivery times. This concept gives Damen a competitive advantage, but is not without risk since they must speculatively build vessels beforehand. As a case, Damen wants to improve the current forecasting methods for the thriving offshore wind market - for which they supply vessels - based on data derived from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS data includes among others information about identification, location, speed, date and time of approximately 200.000 vessels worldwide. Made Smart Group (MSG) is an information service provider specialised in nautical information, and maintains the world’s largest AIS database. MSG and Damen joined forces for this research.<br/><br/>Objective - The objective of this research is to determine if and how Big Data analysis can be used to model (future) demand for Crew Transfer Vessels (CTV) being used for Crew Transfer Operations (CTO) in the offshore wind industry. <br/><br/>Methodology - Almost 45 million AIS location reports of 39 CTVs servicing 263 turbines in 3 offshore wind farms throughout 2016 are analysed to derive key figures of the executed CTOs. Key figures are e.g. the weather window, and the number of executed CTOs per hour. The CTV demand is modelled based on these key figures, and three wind farm specific input parameters: number of turbines, distance between wind farm and port, and the sea state distribution. <br/><br/>Results - The CTO demand of the 263 analysed wind turbines was on average 113 per year in 2016. This average CTO demand has a variation of almost 50% between turbine types. With an accuracy of 4%, it is modelled that a yearly average of 12.4 CTVs are needed to service these 263 turbines. Furthermore, the CTV demand decreases on average with 11% in the three analysed wind farms if the CTO limit can be increased from 1.5 m to 2.0 m mean significant wave height. This result in a potential cost saving around € 5.1 million on a yearly basis for these three wind farms alone.<br/><br/>Implications - AIS data can be used to model vessel demand and gain insight into the market size. The accuracy of the developed model can be improved by adding: more wind farm specific variables; and/ or data of more CTVs/ wind farms. The gained knowledge about using Big Data analysis to forecast the CTV market size is useful and important for the introduction and future development of commercial AIS based data analysis. Furthermore, it provides insights into the operational profile of CTVs. This can be used to develop better vessels, better service the market and ultimately help to lower the cost price of offshore wind energy. It is believed that the maritime sector could profit from AIS data analysis.<br","Automatic Identification System; Offshore Wind; Shipping Management; Big Data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-17","","","","","",""

Although mobile apps are widely adopted, everyday news shows that the applications often contain severe security vulnerabilities. Recent work indicates that state machine learning has proven to be an effective method for vulnerability detection in software implementations. The state machine that can be learned about a software implementation provides additional insight into the internal software structure. The insight can then be used as input for security assessment which most of the times is performed by manual evaluation of the learned model.<br/><br/>In this thesis, we aim to extend state machine learning to improve the security of mobile applications in an automated way, solving two problem. The first problem is the lack of a methodology to learn state machines for mobile apps. The second problem is the need for an approach that detects vulnerabilities from the inferred models. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no framework that automatically infers behavioral state machine models on mobile Android applications, nor does there exist a methodology for automatic vulnerability detection on the inferred models.<br/><br/>We propose two solutions to the aforementioned problems. For the former, a framework for inferring a state machine model on general mobile Android applications is presented, which uses active state machine learning algorithms to ensure time optimization and model correctness on the learning process. For the latter, we designed algorithms that use the inferred models and determine the presence of vulnerabilities. We combine both solutions and propose a novel testing methodology that gains new insights into the behavior of an app and achieves the goal of vulnerability detection. The methodology identified relevant security weaknesses in numerous Android apps. Moreover, the solution can detect rogue applications such as a malicious WhatsApp version in the Android Play Store, which affected over a million devices in three days on November 2017.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the major factors that contribute to the overall cost is the over-dimensioning of the substructure. The response of the structure under various loading conditions can provide valuable insight in the design phase so as to provide a structural design that is cost effective yet reliable, and can withstand the loads that are considered to act on the structure.<br/><br/>The objective of the present thesis is the development of a 1D finite element model, that allows for a dynamic analysis of an offshore wind turbine under the combined actions of wind and wave or wind and ice. For this purpose, different models have been combined and improved or extended. Through this model the importance of accounting for non-linear and breaking waves, the effect of the kinematic stretching on the response and the manner in which the misalignment of the load affects the response can be investigated.<br/><br/>A detailed design of the NREL-5MW offshore wind turbine supported by a monopile is subjected to wind, wave and ice action. The aerodynamic action is evaluated through a model valid for the above rated regime when pitch control is active, using a turbulent wind signal resulting from the Kaimal spectrum. The hydrodynamic action is calculated either with the Morison equation or the MacCamy and Fuchs equation with the use of either linear or nonlinear water particle kinematics. An approach towards the calculation of the load from a breaking wave is considered accounting for the wave skewness and asymmetry during such an event. The ice action is calculated through a model that evaluates the force while in the crushing regime. The soil is represented with linear soil springs.<br/><br/>The structure’s response is investigated for all the loads separately at first. The next step is the combined analysis. Aligned and misaligned cases are considered. Results show that wind load is dominating the response in the aligned and misaligned wind and wave case regardless of the method used to calculate the hydrodynamic load in the case of a small wave height. In the case of a larger wave height, using Stokes theory and the Morison equation, the hydrodynamic load is contributing to the resulting response. Concerning the ice loading, the intermittent crushing and the continuous brittle crushing regimes occur for the turbine. The response to the combined wind and ice action appears to be affected by both loads in all examined cases.<br","Offshore wind turbines; numerical modeling; integrated modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

At present, wind farm owners face difficult decisions when finding the right O&amp;M contract for their offshore wind farm after the warranty period with the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) has ended. Because of a lack of experience in this new O&amp;M phase, decision-making processes are not yet structured or standardized. During the warranty period of approximately 5-10 years, traditional performance-based contracts based on availability guarantees are offered by the turbine manufacturer. To stimulate innovation and increase the energy output, some O&amp;M activities may be better off outside the scope of the performance contract and need a different sourcing scenario. This leads to the aim of this research to compose a decision-making flowchart that can be used when finding a new sourcing strategy for the O&amp;M of offshore wind farms in the post-warranty future. It was concluded that these O&amp;M activities can be segmented in three main items: the offshore turbine maintenance activities, offshore logistics and the onshore back-office maintenance operations. Increasing the maintenance efforts will improve the overall availability of the wind farm but will also increase the required resources to be devoted to O&amp;M. For this reason, it is important to know the cost-drivers for the main O&amp;M activities (Milborrow, 2010). Insights in these costs-drivers and performance shapers were combined and used as input for the decision-making tool. Next, three decision-making variables were derived from the Transaction cost theory and Agency theory that structures the outsourcing decision including the type of contract. First, the owners’ techniques and processes that are needed to transfer or take in-house a good or service were identified as the ‘proprietary nature’ which is an important decision variable when choosing between the O&amp;M in-house or outsource option. Secondly, when outsourcing with a performance-based contract, a relatively high level of knowability of the performance is required compared to behaviour-based contracts. Thirdly, it was found that the type of contract is influenced by the dynamics of the environment because if the performance requirements change due to new innovations, the performance outcome becomes difficult to measure. The three decision-making options altogether lead to four scenarios that could offer a possible sourcing strategy after the warranty period: The Broker scenario, The Incubator scenario, The Coordinator scenario and The Controller scenario. The decision-making flowchart and the four post-warranty sourcing scenarios contribute to a more efficient scoping of the current performance-based maintenance contract in the post warranty future, so that O&amp;M costs can be minimized while keeping the performance high.","Offshore Wind Farms; sourcing strategy; operation & maintenance; performance-based maintenance contracts; Decision-making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

In 2015 a set of five turbines was installed in one of the barrier openings as a pilot for tidal energy extraction. Due to the construction of the barrier, the average tidal range and velocities have significantly decreased throughout the basin and therefore tidal and meteorological processes driving sediment transport over tidal flats are no longer in equilibrium with the bathymetry. Working towards a new equilibrium, tidal flats erode and channels fill up. This is expected to continue over a long period of time. Turbines installed in barrier openings will lead to an increase in effective resistance at a barrier opening and therefore a further drop in tidal range and velocities throughout the basin. An available two-dimensional Delft3D model (Pezij, 2015) covers relevant hydrodynamics and morphodynamics of the basin with barrier, openings, channels and tidal flats. This model was modified to account for tidal energy extraction. The tidal turbines were parameterized through a momentum sink that increases the flow resistance locally. This sink term was calibrated using a state-of-the-art three-dimensional model of one opening with five turbines. Upscaling scenarios were specified, in which different sets of the barrier openings are equipped with tidal turbines. Numerical simulations over one spring-neap cycle were performed for these scenarios. Results show small deviations in tidal range, volume and discharges throughout the basin due to tidal energy extraction, compared to changes that have occurred due to the construction of the barrier. Reductions in tidal range and volume appear to be near-linearly increasing with the number of turbines installed. Deviations in tidal range increase in landward direction. Between the barrier and mid-basin, peak discharges decrease in channels directly behind the barrier section with turbines and increase in channels behind sections with no turbines. From mid- to end-basin, discharges are not affected by positioning of turbines, only the amount of energy extraction. Simulation results indicate that the emergence time of tidal flats decreases due to tidal energy extraction as a result of an increase in mean low water level throughout the basin. The increase in low water level due to tidal energy extraction would only be a fraction of the increase in water level due to sea-level rise in coming years. Additionally, the reduction in acreage was estimated based on hypsometric curves of the three largest individual tidal flats. The reduction in acreage of these flats due to the rise in mean low water level resulting from tidal energy extraction is relatively small compared to the ongoing loss in acreage due to both sea-level rise and erosion resulting from the barrier construction. Further work is required to improve basin and turbine modeling and evaluate long-term morphodynamics (sediment transport). Separately a comprehensive socio-environmental evaluation is required to compare benefits from (renewable) tidal energy extraction to the (incremental) ecological impact resulting from further reduction in acreage of tidal flats that support animal and bird life.","Tidal energy; Numerical modeling; Hydrodynamics; Morphodynamics; Tidal basin; Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, more extreme weather conditions occur. In urban environments, rain during these extreme weather conditions cannot be discharged immediately. A Polder Roof, a combination of a blue and green roof, provides a solution for this problem. This roof stores water under a green layer consisting of soil with vegetation. A Polder Roof is difficult to sell, because the investment of an user is earned back long term and the water storage does not have a direct influence on the user. This study aims to investigate the possibility to add a direct function to this water storage, by harvesting or transfer thermal energy out of or into this water, to heat or cool a building energy-efficiently.<br/>To heat a building, a certain heat input is necessary to keep the building on the same temperature. This heat demand can be determined by standardized yearly values used in the sector. If these are distributed monthly over a year, a mean heat demand per second can be determined. This heat demand is provided by harvesting heat out of the water on the roof by using a heat pump. Therefore the temperature of the water changes. To state that the water may not turn into ice, a maximum daily heat drainage can be calculated. The total amount of thermal energy which can be harvested is determined by the water’s temperature and volume. The temperature of the water is influenced by the temperature of the air in contact with the water, incoming radiation and outgoing heat from the building underneath. The volume rises through precipitation on the roof and lowers by evaporation and the discharge from water of the roof. The influence of the air on the water temperature is modelled with the Cooling Law of Newton.<br/>By modelling the described system, an equilibrium temperature difference between water and air can be found with a given heat demand. When cooling is needed, this difference will also occur because the heat pump transfers heat into the water and is cooled by the air. This method for heating a building can be used from March to November in the Netherlands. By using another isolation layer which can retain more radiation instead of the green layer, the applicability can be increased. Cooling with a heat pump can be applied if the cooling demand is low. A high water temperature is adversely for the efficiency of the heat pump and the vegetation. Because a Polder Roof isolates a building better than a conventional roof, the building has a lower cooling demand, so the temperature of the water will rise less. The use of a heat pump is more energy-efficient than a conventional installation, on the condition that the COP is higher than 1.33.","Heat pumps; Polder roofs; Green Blue roofs; Watermanagement","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Om aan de woningvraag te voldoen werd in 2000 de bouw van eilandengroep IJburg gestart in het IJmeer-Markermeer. IJburg bestaat uit twee fases die achtereenvolgend aan elkaar zouden worden aangelegd. In 2002 betrokken de eerste bewoners hun huizen op de eerste fase van IJburg. Momenteel is het laatste eiland van fase 1 nog onbebouwd en is gepland dat in 2023 wordt gestart met extra bebouwing van huizen op de tweede fase. Echter, verdere beslissingen met betrekking tot de gehele aanleg van IJburg in de tweede fase is op dit moment nog uiterst onzeker. Omdat het huidig waterbouwkundig ontwerp nog steeds uit gaat van de definitieve situatie van fase 1 en fase 2, is onderzoek naar het effect van het uitblijven van het Buiteneiland op de waterveiligheidsstatus nodig. Daarnaast is vanaf januari 2017 een nieuwe waterkeringsnormering en veiligheidsfilosofie voor dijken, dammen en duinen in Nederland wettelijk van kracht. Hieruit is de volgende hoofdvraag ontstaan voor het onderzoek: “Wat is het effect van de implementatie van de nieuwe normering voor primaire waterkeringen en het uitgestelde besluit van B&amp;W voor het eiland Buiteneiland op de waterveiligheidsstatus in IJburg, welke BwN alternatieven bestaan er om de waterveiligheid in IJburg te garanderen, en welk alternatief wordt geadviseerd voor Gemeente Amsterdam?” Om de waterveiligheidsstatus van IJburg te beoordelen worden scenario’s opgesteld waarbij de twee ontwikkelingen in acht worden genomen: uitgesteld besluit met betrekking tot het aanleggen van Buiteneiland en de implementatie van de nieuwe normering voor primaire keringen in Nederland. De waterveiligheidsstatus wordt beoordeeld aan de hand van het berekenen met een vereiste kruinhoogte volgens Ontwerp Instrument 2014. De berekeningen worden uitgevoerd aan de door Rijksoverheid beschikbaar gestelde programma’s als Hydra Modellen en PC Overslag. Geconcludeerd kan worden dat de waterveiligheidsstatus onveilig en ‘worst case’ scenario als 0-alternatief wordt gesteld bij het ontwerpen van de BwN alternatieven. Om de eisen, randvoorwaarden en wensen, oftewel oplossingsrichtingen, voor de alternatieven vast te stellen wordt er een gebiedsanalyse, ecologische analyse en een stakeholderanalyse uitgevoerd. Hierbij wordt onderscheid gemaakt tussen de primaire functie waterveiligheid en de secundaire functies ecologie en recreatie. Uit de oplossingsrichtingen ontstaan een vijftal oplossingen, genoemd: IJmeer Wadden, Zanddam, Zandeiland, Groenstrand en Natuureiland. In de waterbouwkundig ontwerpen van de BwN alternatieven voor dijkverhoging wordt uitgegaan van natuurlijke elementen zoals wind, stroming, flora en fauna waardoor voordelen kunnen worden geboden voor zowel natuur, recreatie als kostenreductie. De alternatieven berusten op twee verschillende principes om de waterveiligheid te waarborgen zonder dat de kruinhoogte van de primaire waterkering moet worden verhoogd: dempen van golfslag door infrastructuur waarbij een schaduwzone in de IJburgbaai wordt gecreëerd en aanleggen van een zandige vooroever voor de huidige kering. De dagelijkse windcondities spelen een belangrijke rol in de ontwerpen betreffende onverdedigde zandige taluds. De zandige taluds bieden zowel voordelen voor natuur (land-waterovergangen en rust- en ruiplaatsen voor watervogels) als recreatie (windsurf-, kitesurf-, zwemmogelijkheden en creatie van stadsstrand). Daarnaast is het gebruik van zand in de ontwerpen gewenst doordat zand beschikbaar komt uit een ander project binnen IJburg. Hierdoor worden kosten gereduceerd en werk met werk gemaakt. Naast zand is er ook nagedacht om met slibmateriaal te werken. Het slibmateriaal is aanwezig in het systeemgebied en overmatig slib is ongewenst door het negatieve effect op de waterkwaliteit. Door het opnemen en verwerken van slibachtig materiaal wordt de waterkwaliteit verbeterd, natuurgebied ontwikkeld en een oplossing geboden op de waterveiligheidsproblematiek. Een laatste belangrijk aspect om voordelen te behalen in tegenstelling tot traditionele dijkverhoging, is het inspelen met het ontwerp op mogelijke beleidsplannen betreft de configuratie van eilanden. Dit wordt gedaan door het creëren van tijdelijke ontwerpen met een mogelijkheid tot permanent karakter.","Waterveiligheid; Building with Nature; IJburg-Amsterdam","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

In the past the focus has been primarily on the shaping of the upper body. However, due to practical requirements, further scope of improvements to the upper body has been greatly reduced. The focus has thus shifted towards the optimization of the underbody which includes the wheel and the wheelhouse. The contribution of the wheel and the wheelhouse to the total drag and lift coefficient of a body has been estimated at 30\% and 40\% respectively. Therefore, understanding the behavior of the flow in the wheelhouse would potentially result in reducing the drag coefficient of an automobile. <br/><br/>In the present study, the wheelhouse flow has been investigated experimentally using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). A generic simplified car body with a wheel and a wheelhouse has been designed and used for this purpose. The study has been done for a rotating wheel and stationary ground configuration. Planar PIV and Stereo PIV have been used to study the flow inside the wheelhouse and in the wake of the wheel respectively. The study was undertaken for the Reynolds number, based on wheel diameter, of 9000 and 72000. Measurements were taken at planes inside and outside the wheelhouse as well as upstream and downstream of the wheel. In addition to providing data for the Large Eddy Simulation (LES), the results from the PIV measurements showed that the behavior of the flow depended on the Reynolds number. Velocity profiles in the wake of the wheel highlighted a three dimensional flow in the wheelhouse. <br/><br/>Finally, the effect of a Vortex Generator (VG) on the flow was investigated.

Many hectares of rice were damaged due to extensive salinity intrusion during the dry season of 2016. The impact of salinity intrusion on rice production is studied by (1) mapping the impact using remote sensing data (MODIS NDVI time-series) and (2) investigating how the impact affects farmers' lives. Ground data is collected in Soc Trang province through interviews with commune officials and farmers. Quantitative data includes damages to rice areas as aggregated by the local government and land use points for classification. <br/><br/>Rice areas are mapped through supervised classification, using extreme gradient boosting. Peak detection analysis is used to distinguish distinct rice cropping schedules within district boundaries. Compared against an evaluated climatology, hampered rice growth is mapped for two hot-spots (Long Phu and Nga Nam district). This can be attributed to salinity problems through interpretation of ground collected information and an understanding of the local salt-intrusion mechanisms. Reconciling affected rice grid cells mapped through satellite analysis with hectares of damaged rice recorded by the local government is difficult.<br/><br/>Analyzed perspectives of salinity affected farmers highlight the uncertain current conditions and future for rice production in the Mekong Delta.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Carbon dioxide emission into the earth’s atmosphere by maritime activities are a concern for the people within and outside the industry. This is because of the environmental impacts that are caused by these greenhouse gas emissions which changes the very chemistry of this planet. These impacts can be mitigated by reducing the CO2 emissions which can be achieved by several design and/or operational means. Waste heat recovery (WHR) technology is one such means that is capable of reducing emissions. This is achieved by improving the overall fuel efficiency of marine engines which reduces the fuel consumption of the vessel. This improvement is realised by harnessing the heat energy that is expelled by the engine through waste heat sources such as exhaust gas, etc.<br/> Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is one of many WHR technologies that is capable of harnessing that waste heat energy from the fuel which cannot be utilised by the engine operation alone. ORC as a WHR system (WHRS) is widely implemented in land based applications due to its fluid choice flexibility, plant simplicity and net efficiency. However, it is rather new to the maritime industry because WHRS on-board ships are predominantly based on steam Rankine cycle or turbo-compounding. These systems have their own advantages but ORC-WHRS may outweigh them in certain applications on-board ships. This is especially for electrical power generation from low and medium temperature waste heat sources. However, ORC in marine application encounters challenges unlike seen in land based applications. These challenges are caused by the physical &amp; geometrical constraints, operational profile of the vessel or uncertainties caused at sea.<br/> In this thesis, the implementation of ORC-WHRS to marine engines for exhaust gas is investigated and studied to understand how such an application can be beneficial. Unlike steam Rankine cycle, an ORC system has flexibility in choosing an organic fluid that is suitable based on the application. This flexibility in fluid choices are confronted by the above mentioned maritime related challenges. Hence, a screening methodology is devised in this thesis that finds a suitable fluid based on the waste heat source profile and selection parameters. These selection parameters are necessary to filter out functioning organic fluids that can be limited due to the mentioned challenges. In this thesis, the power density of the ORC plant is the selection parameter used.As mentioned earlier, the ORC-WHRS may often be subjected to off-design conditions due to the operational profile of the vessel or by uncertainties at sea. Hence, off-design performance is analysed to study the ORC system when designed at several discrete engine load points. These analysis are carried out in plant models modified from an existing steam based dynamic model and developed into a simple-ORC and a recuperative-ORC dynamic plant models. Sensitivity analysis of these models are also performed to understand uncertainties in the model output corresponding to uncertainties in model input parameter. This analysis is followed by analysis of the dynamic behaviour of the ORC plant model to varying load step functions and step duration for plants designed at discrete engine load points.<br/> This thesis can be extended, not only to study how ORC can be used to meet future regulations on CO2 emissions, but also on operability limitations imposed on ships. The fluid screening approach used here can also be modified based on parameters, such as toxicity, flammability, cost, specific power etc. This can present a realistic approach to an end product that can be safely and economically operated on board.","organic rankine cycle; Waste heat recovery; Marine Technology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

(mentor); Lettieri, C. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The threat of global warming made the increase of efficiency a crucial objective for future power plants and aero engines. As secondary flow is a major source of aerodynamic losses in turbines, its mitigation is critical to enable efficient designs. However, the suppression of secondary flow formation is challenging due to the complexity of the flow field and to the variability of its features according to each cascade characteristics. One solution is the use of three- dimensional endwall fence, to reduce secondary flow losses. Three-dimensional<br/>fences can reduce the secondary flow penetration, increase the pitch-wise uniformity of vorticity, reduce the kinetic energy of the crossflow and decrease the mixing out of the vortices downstream the blade passage. At the same time, the endwall fence entails an increment of wetted area and viscous losses, making the design of its shape a trade-off problem. The design of such devices must be tailored to the specific turbine and is usually obtained via lengthy and time-consuming experimental campaigns. Shape optimization can greatly enhance<br/>the design process of these components as it provides a way to investigate the fluid dynamic performance of a multitude of fence geometries at affordable computational cost. This paper presents a numerical methodology to automate the endwall fence design; a surrogate-based optimization is applied to minimize the total pressure losses of a steam turbine cascade. The results of the numerical analysis indicate a reduction of 48% of the secondary kinetic energy leading to a decrease of 1.96% in total pressure loss of the optimized design with respect to the baseline geometry without endwall fence. The partition of the passage vorticity led to a weakening of the secondary flow strength and consequently to reduced downstream mixing losses. A wind tunnel validation of the improvement has been finally carried out, confirming the success of the methodology.","Secondary Flow; CFD Optimization; endwall fence; turbine optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

This project concerns project management department. The operational team of this department is relatively small and exists out of six people. Although this department is quite small, their demand on the real-estate market is not. The consistent successes of their projects, which are created through their high level of execution and premium services and products, cause an increase of demands and projects. A consequence of this success is that an imbalance is created between the amount of work and the available employees. As the pressure and workload increases the team starts to experience numerous difficulties which refrain them from seamless project management processes. Once a lot of projects start to run simultaneously, certain existing problems in the organisation, of which the team might have been unaware, become very prominent and can’t be ignored anymore. One of the most prominent difficulties the team encounters is the lack of an overview regarding the project processes. The organisation indicates that next to the large number of projects and small number of employees, this problem is foremost caused by the lack of a standardized project process. The team does not have a clear documented process which they can hold onto when for example the projects increase and the overview blurs. In order to solve the difficulties they cope with, one of the steps is the implementation of a tool which supports and accommodates the organisation with the difficulties they face. The following design challenge is created: ‘Design and develop a tool which facilitates the management of the project process as well as the management of all running projects.‘ This tool will both support the team dealing with the difficulties and solve the existing situation. In order to solve this design challenge a design process is conducted. This design process exists out of a research &amp; analysis phase, a ideation phase, a conceptualisation phase and finally an embodiment phase. Within this process elements are discovered, defined, developed and designed. From discovering the underlying core problems, to developing ideas based on the defined design requirements and finally developing a concept which is also user tested. Eri-tool is an interactive smart app which provides management support regarding the phasing, hierarchical lines and decision documentation of each project. This application requires specific project input which is to be defined in the project plan- and decision documentation templates. From this input, numerous fundamental elements are generated such as the long- and short term overviews (plannings) of the project process. The user can zoom in and out on the project-phasing overview, as much as preferred or required. The application also contains personal pages, project pages and an archive which offers the users a continuous learning process. The Eri-tool is an application which guides, supports, enhances and optimises the process and projects management by not only facilitating the management process however also by accommodating the required fundamental elements to perform to full potential.","Project management; supporting tool; process optimisation; organisational problems; real estate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Technologies such as force feedback and haptic guidance have shown to increase task efficiency during teleoperation. In an unmodeled environment, sensors provide input for haptic guidance or present extra information about the environment to the user in order to make decisions and to perform the tasks. These sensors come with inherent errors and uncertainties which propagate through the teleoperation system. The absence of knowledge of these errors has been shown to cause deterioration in the task performance. These errors can further cause the application of forces on the environment by the robot without the knowledge of the user while using haptic guidance. Thereby, the strategies being used to increase task performance can have some adverse hidden effects. Thus, it crucial to have an understanding of the behaviour of the errors and uncertainties in the system. It is considered critical for making decisions about how the robot system can be controlled and used to manipulate objects remotely.<br/><br/>In this thesis, a novel framework for estimating the uncertainties in a vision-aided teleoperation system in real-time is introduced. The uncertainty estimate can then be used by the control system or communicated to the user. Methods to use the uncertainty estimate for haptic guidance and for user display are proposed. Furthermore, the thesis analyzes the behaviour of the uncertainties in the system and the sensitivity of the system to individual component errors. It evaluates the uncertainties in individual components of the system and implements an uncertainty model for each of them. It then provides a method to propagate these uncertainty models through the system. This results in a final uncertainty estimate in the frame of reference of interest for the task. Experiments were performed to validate the component uncertainty models, the propagation method, and the system as a whole. Additionally, an inverse of the propagation method is also conceived so as to obtain the component accuracy specification from system uncertainty requirements. This can be used in the design of future teleoperation systems.","space robotics; Teleoperation; uncertainty; estimation; computer vision; Robotics; 3d vision; stereo camera; motion capture system; Framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The tensile strength levels achieved are compliant<br/>for both materials’ specifications but the presence of localized lack of fusion in the Scalmalloy<br/>specimens reduced the final ductility of the material considerably.<br/>The obtained results are an encouraging step towards the application of the analyzed technology<br/>in structural components for the motorsport industry and possibly, in the near future, for the wider<br/>automotive industry.

From the experiments, thickness dependency on multiple parameters such as the lap shear strength, the deformation capability and the strains at failure is proven.

Advances in additive manufacturing create new design possibilities, which allow the production of patient specific implants. These endless possibilities will enable to tune the mechanical properties of porous implants and to distribute the loads in such a way that it mimics the natural load distribution. This technique will therefore be used in the design of a new type of implant, which is a deformable acetabular implant that will fully fit in a massive acetabular defect after plastic deformation. In this way, all remaining bone will be loaded, and the physiological load distribution will be restored to maximally reduce stress shielding and to prevent further loss of bone stock. To design this new implant, more information is required on the mechanical properties of the titanium porous structures. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the mechanical properties and deformation behaviour of highly porous pure titanium (grade 1) structures. The diamond unit cell was used to design three types of structures with different porosities (&gt; 95%). A static compression test was performed on cylindrical samples. In addition, push-in and pull-out tests were performed on hemispherical shaped samples. The samples were compressed into specially designed moulds, which represent the acetabulum with defects, to test how these structures deform according to their surrounding shape. Micro-CT images were made during and after the test to analyse the deformation. The cylindrical samples continuously deformed during compression and large plastic strains were measured (&gt; 57%). The hemispherical samples deformed conform the surrounding mould and even penetrated into the holes. The push-in and pull-out forces are positively correlated, and these forces are lower for more porous structures. The micro-CT scans show that all unit cells within the structure do not equally deform under compression, but show a gradual, layer-by-layer deformation. This study is a first step towards the design of a deformable implant. The results are quite promising and can function as a basis for future work.","additive manufacturing; porous structures; pure titanium; deformation; acetabulum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-01","","","","Biomedical Engineering","Prosperos",""

The research emerged from Pieters Bouwtechniek Delft and Hi-Con Denmark. They cooperatively designed very slender balconies in ultra-high performance fibre reinforced concrete. Other engineering firms tend to recreate these balconies in HSC and insecurities emerged around the cracking behaviour and crack width prediction for these slender HSC cantilevering balconies. In addition to this research an informative report, also functioning as a literature study, on the connection of prefabricated concrete balconies is produced. This report is separately attached.<br/><br/>The research is step wisely conducted starting with a simple fully clamped cantilevering slab. For this slab the cross sectional height, reinforcement diameter and reinforcement spacing are varied to investigate their influence on analytical crack width predictions. First for all variants an analytical design and analysis process is executed, followed by a numerical analysis with DIANA FEA and a comparison of the results. The most important observation is that for a cross sectional height of 120 mm or smaller reinforcement bars are located outside the effective area, making the analytical method unsuitable. Furthermore, a big discrepancy between the predictions of the different analytical models is observed, indicating an unreliability of these methods. <br/><br/>In two steps the fully clamped balcony is transformed into a Hi-con shaped balcony executed in HSC. It appeared that in light of detailing rules from Eurocode 2 an exact reproduction is impossible, but the concept could be reproduced in a less slender way. Furthermore, by comparing analytical and numerical design results for two different balcony designs it is found that the accuracy of the analytical crack width prediction depends on geometric disturbances. In case a geometric disturbance is present in a slender area loaded in tension peak stress concentrations occur, which negatively influence the reliability of the analytical crack width prediction. In case the area is less slender, the effect is less pronounced and the conservative characteristics of the analytical method outweigh the influence of the concentrated peak stresses.<br/><br/>When summarizing, it appears that specific care should be taken when analytically predicting crack widths in slender balconies because it might appear that the reinforcement is not located in the effective area. Furthermore, the more slender the structures become, the bigger the influence of a geometric disturbance can be, increasing the risk of an underestimation of the occurring crack widths because peak stress concentrations are analytically not accounted for. <br","Balcony; High strength concrete; Crack width prediction; Finite Element Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

As railway track is used frequently by passing rolling stocks, its performance degrades over time. At certain degradation levels, maintenance interventions must be carried out to improve the track performance so to meet technical and safety regulations. In this way, the risk of accident or derailment can be minimized and the railway interoperability is ensured. Furthermore, the responsibility of designing maintenance plan belongs to infrastructure managers. To help them, predictive strategies based on optimization can suggest the optimal schedule to maintain the track over a certain time period. In this way, track performance and maintenance costs can be explicitly optimized over the whole life cycle of the track.<br/><br/>However, a railway network typically consists of multiple track sections, each of them with different degradation level and parameters. Hence, the optimization of track maintenance can be considered as a large-scale problem which has a large number of decision variables. For such kind of problem, the conventional centralized optimization is very difficult or even not tractable to solve due to limitations on the computational time and resources. One way to overcome this issue is by applying the so-called distributed optimization scheme. In such approach, the original optimization problem is partitioned into multiple smaller, tractable subproblems. Therefore, the optimization is tractable and more preferred for real-life implementations.<br/><br/>This thesis develops distributed optimization approaches for track maintenance operations planning problem. Three different schemes are compared: Parallel Augmented Lagrangian Relaxation (PALR), Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), and Distributed Robust Safe But Knowledgeable (DRSBK). As these distributed approaches basically designed for convex problems, extension techniques to handle non-convex nature of the proposed optimization problem are implemented. Furthermore, some case studies are defined to evaluate the algorithms from both performance and numerical perspectives. In simulations of small, medium, and large-scale instances, it is shown that in most cases, DRSBK can outperform the other distributed approaches, by providing the closest-to-optimum solution to the centralized optimization problem while having the shortest computation time.<br","track maintenance planning; railway engineering; mixed-integer programming; distributed optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

This in turn influences the complexity of design process, along with the time and effort required for it. The problem, for this research, has been set up with respect to challenges faced at Fokker Aerostructures, during in-proposal design of fuselage panels made from Fibre Metal Laminates (FML). FML technology allows material tailoring that offers substantial weight saving with bigger part dimensions. This trait of material<br/>tailoring poses a complex design challenge in the time constrained in-proposal design phase. The objective of this phase, is to explore the solution space in order to come up with a winning proposal at a profitable cost. To tackle the challenges experienced, this research work establishes phase-I of a three phased project, proposed for implementation of full scale optimisation. The first phase is concerned with formalising the product and process knowledge of the laminate design, and bringing out the benefits of automation in a process largely<br/>treated as creative. For this a KBE application, called the PANADEE-II is developed. This tool aims to isolate all creative tasks to be performed by experts, and automate all repetitive and non-creative tasks around it.<br/><br/>PANADEE-II is capable of quickly generating multiple designs while keeping the designer in-loop. Dividing the design challenges into smaller Constraint Satisfaction Problems(CSP), it uses heuristic techniques of trial and error to find solutions for individual problems. Further, by experimenting with designs adapted to<br/>different design trait combinations, it performs general solution space searches. In doing so, it quadruples the number of design points tested as compared to the original manual process. This, along with a 28% smallerblead time, and 18% reduction in required expert time, greatly increase opportunities for design studies and manual optimisation. For a part manufacturer like Fokker Aerostructure, this serves a competitive advantage, as the current design process allows study of limited designs(1 or 2), offering no feel of the actual available<br/>solution space or how the performance of selected design ranks in it. On the longer run, PANADEE-II has laid down a foundation for implementing a full scale design optimisation, including processes that have been currently isolated as creative for experts.","FML; design automation; conceptual design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

As a result, customers became more demanding. One of the critical elements is that customers expect a high variety of products that are always available. Out of Stocks (OoSs) in apparel stores result in lost sales in the short term and a declining brand reputation in the long run. For many retailers, it is therefore critical to minimise their OoSs. A high inventory accuracy is necessary to reduce the number of OoSs. This is practically unable to achieve with traditional techniques. Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) has the potential to increase the inventory accuracy, thereby reducing the number of OoSs. RFIDs in the apparel retail, especially more sophisticated deployments are relatively new and specific benefits for various store types are unknown. This research compares different RFID-deployments for apparel stores regarding the reduction of OoSs. <br/><br/>An apparel store exists out of a backroom and a sales floor. Both can be seen as inventory systems, which have to be replenished to prevent OoSs. To achieve this, retail stores use replenishment systems, based on the recorded inventory. The problem in retail stores is that there are inventory losses, mainly due to internal and external theft, which are not registered. The result is an increasing discrepancy between the actual and recorded inventory. As a result, items that appear to be available in the inventory system are not. An effect is an increasing number of OoSs. RFID can increase the number of inventory counts to align the recorded inventory with the actual inventory. The following RFID-deployments are compared in this research: handheld readers, a robot reader, a combination of overhead and handheld readers and overhead readers. The deployments are linked to inventory counts that are performed once every seven days, once a day, partly continuous and continuous inventory counts. All deployments for various store types are compared to the original situation. To be able to analyse the different situations, a base model is constructed. The base model is implemented in a discrete event simulation model in which several parameters can be adjusted.<br/>The Key Performance Indicator (KPI) to measure the performance is the OoS percentage. The following parameters are adjusted in the experiments to mimic various store types: 1) the ratio between the sales floor and backroom, 2) the average number of items per Stock <br/>Keeping Unit (SKU), 3) the replenishment frequency. RFID significantly reduces the OoSs compared to the original store for each store configuration. <br/><br/>It can be concluded that for each store configuration, RFID significantly reduces the number of OoSs. The implementations hardly differ from each other for a particular store configuration. Regarding the results of this research, it does not matter which RFID-deployment is implemented. <br","RFID; Out-of-Stocks; replenishment; retail","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Currently in the energy system of the Netherlands, lower level consumer demand flexibility is rather obsolete due to sufficient capacity limits of the distribution network and supply of capacity mechanisms by large industrial actors. However, in the upcoming 10- 20 years, the power system is in transition to become decentralised with a higher share of renewable energy sources and significant increase in consumption. An operational control structure in the power system, where private consumers provide flexible capacity, is an effective and economical efficient approach to make sure the regulated process of electricity generation to supply at consumers is secure and reliable. Currently as a result of the EU Energy Efficiency Directive of 2012, an institutional base is presented for development initiatives of demand response in Europe [17]. Technical and regulatory standards now enable demand response flexibility to be offered on the wholesale and retail energy market and allow for consumer participation [34]. Demand response schemes are usually distinguished by the various motivation methods offered to the participating consumers. Programs include in general two control methods, centralised direct load control or time-based and incentive-based DR. Because these schemes rely on demand response decision-making by means of a centralised (multi) aggregator perspective, direct load control can be precisely adjusted to technical (local) grid constraints [69]. Practically, the objective of DR in this research is used to reduce congestion in distribution grids by moving part of BEV energy demand from (evening) peaks to the afternoon or night with direct control. By achieving these measures potential benefits arise, including the most profound in the distribution grid [29]:<br/><br/>• Optimising local grid assets by increasing the utilisation factor, and thereby maximise asset efficiency and subsequently decrease costs, which is beneficial for the DSO<br/>• Scheduling of peak charging demand to aid congestion in distribution grids.<br/><br/>The modelling of the demand response charging strategies in Amsterdam fills the knowledge gap towards handling congestion for the DSO. It also provides a new study that addresses the potential to postpone future distribution grid investments by using charging strategies specifically for Amsterdam. The main research question that this study addresses is therefore:<br/><br/>What is the value of demand response management in a Vehicle-to-Grid network and does it provide increased benefits to smart charging for consumers and the distribution system operator in Amsterdam?<br/><br/>In order to grasp the subject of congestion prevention within the time limits of graduation, the scope of this study is limited to assess the first mentioned item by modelling charging demand, and subsequently simulate optimal demand response charging strategies for a case study in Amsterdam’s local power grid. The motivation for this study is threefold. Firstly, providing insight and recommendations in Amsterdam’s BEV charging demand to compute the potential to provide demand flexibility by making use of a large-scale charging sessions data (2017-2018). Literature that uses such a vast data set for Amsterdam is scarce. Therefore, typical demand behaviour for daily and seasonal variation or periodicity is assessed by using a method of time series analysis and local regression analysis to derive time- and load-flexibility parameters. These parameters de- scribe the measures for which demand response is generally defined. Secondly, a linear programming model is developed that optimises charging demand of smart charging and V2G charging strategies for demand response purposes to aid congestion at local feeders in the distribution grid of Liander. Lastly, an information-task exchange protocol is de- scribed from the perspective of a multi-aggregator to perform coordinated DR.<br/><br/>Further investigation about the usable amount of flexibility is simulated with linear programming for charging strategies (smart charging and V2G charging) to aid in local feeder congestion. In this research a case study is performed on data of a low-voltage feeder under different congestion situations, and a range of different number of BEVS connected to explore future distribution grid implications. Results show that the model’s performance works especially well during peak demand periods throughout the day. In addition, the V2G strategy outperforms charged prices per kWh in almost every simulation compared to the uncontrolled scenario, by both charging during periods of low prices and discharging during periods of high prices even though the LP model does not optimise on prices. Thus, the V2G strategy allows the DSO to postpone grid investments in a number of cases while simultaneously the consumer almost always receives remuneration for its delivered services. The V2G strategy therefore provides a significantly added value over a smart charging strategy, by allowing electric vehicles to be charged whenever the feeder exhibits congestion. Future work includes analysis towards the value of DR in a liberalised system regarding the subject of the split-incentives challenge. Who initiates demand response (consumer, retailer, aggregator, DSO) and how should the benefits be divided along the supply chain. Handling an optimisation problem of DR for holds strong requirements for an global system balance in which neither participating actors are discriminated and the whole system benefits. An assessment of relational dependencies between participators in DR should be incorporated in designing charging strategies.","Smart charging; Vehicle-to-Grid; Demand Response","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The objective of this study is to develop and test a method for accurate, robust and automatic monitoring of the spatial and temporal distribution of the number of beach users on the Dutch coast.<br/>Multiple approaches to quantify the number of persons in an area are reviewed. Comparison of the reviewed approaches showed that a first distinction can be made between methods using a visual light (camera-) sensor and other methods based on the use of Bluetooth, Wifi, GPS-location (all related to phones) and LiDAR. Based on a literature review the visual light sensor is decided upon to best suit beach user quantification. Within the visual light approach a second distinction is made between methods based on the difference in pixel intensity, a method based on variance of pixel intensities over multiple frames and a method using oversegmentation combined with a machine learning framework for classification.<br/>The difference in pixel intensity method is observed most often in literature, but has limitations in conditions that are concerned typical for the Dutch coast (e.g. clouds). The method based on the variance of pixel intensities and the method using oversegmentation are possibilities to overcome the problems described in the studies on the pixel intensity method. Based on preliminary tests the oversegmented machine learning approach is selected because it does not require beach users to move to be detected. Moreover, single snapshots can be evaluated which require a limited data infrastructure in-situ and this is considered advantageous regarding the ease of implementation and cost effectiveness.<br/>The oversegmented machine learning approach divides images into small regions of similar pixels based on pixel gradients. The regions are called superpixels and superpixels can be characterised by significantly more features than the conventional r,g,b relations corresponding to regular pixels evaluated in the differences in pixel intensity method. The availability of an increased number of features provides more options to distinguish between classes during classification and this can be advantageous in difficult (e.g. cloudy) conditions. Classified beach user superpixels can represent multiple beach users due to for instance occlusion and therefore a regression relation between classified beach user superpixels and a manually counted ground truth is determined for conversion of classified beach user superpixels to the number of beach users. Hence, the oversegmented machine learning method for quantification of beach occupation combines an oversegmented classification model to classify superpixels into classes (e.g. beach user and sand) and a regression model to convert classified beach user superpixels to beach users. <br/>The oversegmented machine learning method has previously been evaluated in the study of Hoonhout et al. (2015) for the classification of coastal images into the classes 'water', 'sand', 'objects', 'vegetation' and 'sky' and this led to the open-source toolbox Flamingo (Hoonhout and Radermacher, 2014b). The current study adapts and develops the Flamingo toolbox for the quantification of beach occupation. The impact of changing parameters of the existing toolbox on the oversegmented classification model are evaluated to obtain insight in the parameters that have to be changed to apply the toolbox to the quantification of beach occupation. The influence of the parameters: class aggregation, measures to take account for imbalances in the dataset, regularisation, number of images in the training dataset, image enhancement, addition of articial channels to enable more (new) features and the required number of features are reviewed. Especially changes in the parameters class aggregation, number of images in the training dataset and articial channels affect the overall model performance. The effect on the overall model performance of measures to account for imbalances in the dataset is limited. However, these measures can change the relative distribution of precision and recall corresponding to the false negative and positive rates respectively. The final classification model is trained and validated with a dataset containing 76 manually annotated images, default undersampling to account for the imbalance in the dataset and added articial channels. A 4-class model with classes beach users, sand water and objects proved to be the best performing class aggregation.<br/>The classified beach user superpixels are converted into a number of beach users with a regression model obtained by fitting a second order polynomial regression line to the classified beach user superpixels of the training images and the corresponding manually counted ground truth. Evaluation of the fit shows that the oversegmented machine learning method is a suitable method for quantification of beach occupation indicated by a R2 of 0.92. The regression model is validated by application of the combined  oversegmented classification- and regression models on a new and 'unseen' dataset of 80 images. Validation shows that the regression model is applicable on images that are not used during development of the model (R2=0.87) and this moreover confirms the suitability of the oversegmented machine learning method. Analysis of the largest errors showed that especially unoccupied beach stretchers and images captured by an unclean lens limit the performance of the oversegmented machine learning method.<br/>The developed oversegmented machine learning method is benchmarked against one of the differences in pixel intensity methods representing the current state-of-the-art. The benchmark shows that the oversegmented machine learning method (R2=0.87) has a higher performance on the evaluated evalidation dataset compared to the method representing the current state-of-the-art (R2=0.76). The difference in performance indicates that the newly developed method is more suitable to the varying conditions associated with the Dutch coast.<br/>Tests of the oversegmented machine learning model on a different camera station than was used for training of the oversegmented classification model, did not lead to satisfactory results. This indicates that the current approach for application on camera stations not used during training is not suitable. Therefore, at this point, the oversegmented machine learning method lacks robustness with respect to the performance on multiple different camera stations.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","This thesis describes three different predictive frameworks which are applied to improve the interaction behavior between a robot and their users. Machine learning is used to train the frameworks. The training data contains information obtained from one user over a period of approximately 3 to 30 days. This work is applied to the LEA robot: an elderly assistant robot.<br/><br/>Each framework is implemented in an exciting real problem with the aim to improve life quality of elderly. The first framework predicts when and from where the user calls the robot to go towards the user on a daily basis. The repetitive events are predicted with an accuracy of 98%. The framework starts to give correct predictions from four examples only. This framework uses a density-based clustering algorithm in combination with a shifting window over the input data. This combination creates a predictive framework that adapts to the user behavior changes. <br/><br/>The second framework is used to filter undesired warning messages such as e.g. obstacle warnings while walking. The true positive rate is measured to be 100% for events that occur at least once in the three days. The algorithm creates a grid map which is used to memorize trajectories that lead to undesired warning messages.<br/><br/>The last framework predicts the user destination while walking. This is an important aid for patients suffering from dementia. The framework uses the trajectory and the starting time and location as input. A forward neural network is used to classify the room destination of the user. The network has two input layers. The first input layer uses a part of<br/>the trajectory and the second input layer is an embedding layer which reduces the size of ""metadata"". The framework classifies 66.6 % of the time with a certainty above 85%. When only considering predictions with a classifications certainty above 85%, a predictive accuracy of 97.3% is measured. If all classifications are considered, the framework showed to be 86.4 % accurate, whereas an alternative approach like support vector machines showed to have a predictive accuracy of 60 % on this problem.","Machine Learning; Small data; Robot","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The publicly funded ESA Copernicus and NASA Landsat earth observation programs are publishing their data as open data in the promise of 30 billion euro of financial benefit for the EU as well as 50.000 new jobs, both by 2023. The move by these two space agencies fits in a larger pattern of ‘new space’, in which the launch and exploitation of satellites are moved from national agencies to private commercial stakeholders. The data offered by ESA and NASA are published as open data intended for reuse with the objective to create viable value-adding earth observation services, i.e. services which use big and open earth observation as a resource for analytics and provide incentives for all participants, including the client and user, to continue the service provision. Furthermore, the earth observation data are big data, as it satisfies the criteria of high volume, variety and velocity increasing the effort required for handling the data. Even though the market for value-adding earth observation services is growing and has the potential to become the most important market in the whole earth observation value chain from rocket to service, the initial promises of the release of the data are not going to be accomplished at the current pace.<br/><br/>Within searched academic literature and during conversations with practitioners, the lack of a structured approach to creating these viable value-adding services has been observed. Furthermore, the research articles on this topic are very much technology-oriented, with only very few articles invoking the interests of stakeholders to make a service design viable. And none of these followed a method for creating the service. This thesis addresses the lack of such a method for the creation of viable services using big and open earth observation data as a resource. Specifically, four knowledge gaps are identified: The first and second knowledge gaps concerned the lack of viable services which used a structured method for their design in the academic literature of respectively the narrow focus area of big and open earth observation data as well as in the larger area of earth observations which includes the previous narrow focus area. The third knowledge gap concerns the lack of factors of big and open earth observation data which influence the viability of a service design within the searched academic literature and the fourth concerns the actual lack of a structured method to guide the design of viable services which use big and open earth observation data as a resource. Together, these knowledge gaps lead to the formulation of the following research objective: “to design a method targeted at service providers for the creation of viable services which use big and open earth observation data as a resource.” The artefact which is developed is a method which guides a service designer through the process of creating a viable service. Following the method results in creating a service design which is both feasible, i.e. technologically possible, and viable, i.e. provides sufficient incentives for all stakeholders involved to carry on its provision. The approach for structuring the creation of the method is the design science research approach for information systems. The demarcation of the problem is the first activity within this approach, and it uses a structured literature review as well unstructured explorative interviews. This is followed by a literature review on influencing factors, using only a structured literature review as a research method. The requirements gathering activity employs a case study method, in which participant-observations and interviews are used for information gathering within three cases. Then, creative methods are used in the design activity to create the artefact. For the following demonstration of the artefact, a case study is again used. Finally, for the evaluation of the artefact a survey based on the combined UTAUT-ECT theory and observations are used to evaluate whether the artefact attains its objectives, and improvements are suggested based on the evaluation and the demonstration. During this research, the author was a research intern at CGI Netherlands in the Space, Defence and Intelligence department, which allowed for rich observations and access to cases.<br/><br/>The result is the SIMEO-STOF method consisting of five phases. It combines the Service Innovation Method for Earth Observation (SIMEO) with the STOF model tailored for the earth observation domain. The first phase guides a designer through the process of finding together with a client a new service idea based on the current capabilities of earth observation analytics and the business processes of the client. Linking the earth observation capabilities to the limitations of current earth observation data supply allows for the rapid exclusion of unfeasible or unviable ideas. Any ideas that pass this initial set of limitations can proceed to the second phase. In this service domain, essential aspects of the value proposition are defined. This is followed by the technology phase, where principles of security and big data computing are set as well as a first architecture of the IT systems. Then, acquisition of external resources and inter-organizational relations are discussed in the organizational phase. Finally, the amount and form of value retained by the service provider are discussed in the financial phase. As a demonstration, the artefact is applied to the case of a crude and refined oil transhipment provider in the harbour of Rotterdam. The result of the application is a service design which is most likely to be viable, considering some issues still need resolving. Whilst not being definitively viable, the identification of issues which require resolution to achieve viability is an outcome which gets as close as possible to a viable design. <br/><br/>The artefact is evaluated for internal and external validity, respectively whether it fulfils the quality requirements and whether it fulfils its objective. Both were included in a survey held amongst employees of a service providing company interested in the use of the SIMEO-STOF method. Whilst the limited number of responses did not allow for any statistical analysis, the descriptive statistics and observations allowed for the concussion of a generally positive evaluation. Measured by the attitude towards using the SIMEO-STOF method, the method fulfils its objective of facilitating the creation of viable services which use big and open earth observation data as a resource. Whilst there is a mixed response to the quality requirements, observations indicate that part of these can be explained by different levels of expectation. Some participants thought of a future use for the artefact and judged the quality requirement based on this instead of the actual objective.<br/><br/>In terms of academic contributions, this research contributes to all four identified knowledge gaps. Foremost, it provides a viable service design method in form of the SIMEO-STOF method. This extends the service design literature to the application domain of earth observations, which has not previously been viewed from this perspective. Furthermore, factors of big and open earth observation data that contribute to the understanding of its effects on viable service design have been identified, in direct response to a further knowledge gap. Ultimately, the result of the SIMEO-STOF method demonstration is a viable service design created with a structured method, which is a contribution to the first and second knowledge gaps. In terms of societal contributions, the SIEMO-STOF method may accelerate growth in the ‘value-added EO services’ market, not only allowing service providers to more efficiently and effectively design viable service and create value, it may also lead to increased market growth on the suppliers side and an argument for open data publishers for the value of their activities. Though the use of the SIMEO-STOF method, EO service providers may be able to achieve the expected breakthrough of EO services within the broader society, which is one of the objectives of the ESA open data portal. <br/><br/>One of the principal limitations of this research comes from the choice of case study as the main research method, which limits the generality of the results. This is valid for the environment form which requirements are gathered, the type of data used and the design perspective of a service provider which is taken. The author suggests further research to include cases which cover aspects previously not included, for example, a business to consumer service, non-satellite earth observation data, and the inclusion of cases from different service providers. Another important limitation concerns the novel application of the UTAUT-ECT theory in a novel wats, including to an information system which is not a practical implementation of a technology but a method. Combined with the reduced number of respondents in the survey, the UTAUT-ECT-model adapted from theory for this research could not be tested statistically. Future research could focus on repeating the novel application of the theory with sufficient respondents to allow for validation of its application. <br/><br/>The objective of this research is the design of a method targeted at service providers for the creation of viable services which use big and open earth observation data as a resource. Considering the successful demonstration, and the generally positive evaluation of the SIMEO-STOF method, the author considers this objective to be attained. <br","Big Data; Open data; Earth Observation; Big and Open Earth Observation Data; Viable Service; Viable Service Design; service-dominant perspective","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-10","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Many companies, including Rolls Royce and DNV are investing heavily in research that helps in the development of autonomous shipping. Most research is currently being done regarding autonomous navigation, communication and cyber security. What is often neglected in these studies is the need for maintenance within the engine room. With all ships having multiple crew members solely dedicated to keep the engine room going, their absence will have a big impact on the design of engine rooms.<br/> This paper aims to find what equipment will become a weak point in engine rooms once these are no longer occupied and maintained by crew members, and how these weak points can be eliminated. With the absence of reliability data that corrects for maintenance and crew interference, this paper tries to find these weak points by analysing crew member behaviour. It is assumed that if a crew members spends more time on equipment, or deals with it more frequently, then that piece of equipment is less reliable.<br/> In order to find what equipment can be seen as a weak point, a redundancy reduced risk index was created. This index is a combination of the frequency index, which states how often engineers spend time on equipment, the severity index, which lists the consequences of failure for equipment, and the redundancy index, which is dependent on the level of redundancy of components. The redundancy reduced risk index is split into three levels: low, medium, and high risk. Medium and high-risk components were considered weak points, while low risk components were not.<br/> For all high risk and for most medium risk components, solutions were generated which will reduce the risk index of the components or system overall. For some components, the risk was deemed acceptable, as any solutions would be too costly to justify the risk reduction. Solutions were split into two categories: specific solutions, which were all catered to specific components, and a bulk solution, which was the installation of a second drive train. A second drive train would include a second main engine, gearbox, propeller and rudder.<br/> With the solutions found, the two categories were subjected to a financial analysis to see if they are commercially viable. The solutions were applied to ships of four different sizes, ranging from a 6,000 GT feeder to an 85,000 GT capesize bulk carrier. For these ships, the OPEX were calculated and divided into four categories: Operational costs, fuel costs, capital costs and crew costs. The initial investment for the machinery plant was also calculated. This was the basis to finding the increased cost for solutions found in this paper.<br/> Using these specific solutions, the machinery plants will become roughly 50% more expensive, while adding a second drive train will increase the machinery cost by 110%. It is assumed that these solutions will eliminate the need for a crew and therefore eliminate all crew costs. Using these figures, it was found that the specific solutions will lead to a potential yearly savings of $600,000.– for all ship sizes, and adding a second drive train will lead to a potential yearly savings of $500,000 – for the small ship and $163,000.– for the larger ships. <br/> With both the specific solutions and the second drive train, the machinery plant is deemed reliable enough for continuously unmanned operation, which proves the technical feasibility of continuously unmanned engine rooms.<br","Autonomous Shipping; Engine room; Diesel engine; Unmanned; Machinery plant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

Within the family of symmetric geometries the cross spread is most used. Recent developments show a marked increase of the number of available channels, nowadays 100,000+. This enables the use of point receivers, meaning that every geophone has its output recorded, instead of being in an array which is summed before sending the data.Geophones are ever increasing in capability, seeing an increase to lower corner frequencies and the use of batteries and GPS systems to make them cableless and suitable for point-receiver recording. MEMS are new on the market, with a noise floor of &lt; 15 ng-per-square-root-of-Herz being available. The two main quantities which are not specified in the manufacturers’ data sheets of geophones, but which are highly relevant to the user are the noise floor and the dynamic operating range.The case study shows that most surveys nowadays are 3D cross-spread surveys with a source and receiver spacing of approximately 40m each.The most used data format in the geophysical industry is SEG-Y.A synthetic subsurface model has been generated, through which shots have been modelled. Using real field data from Saudi Aramco tests have been conducted to both increase the shot and receiver interval, and to add various amounts of noise to this data. The shots have subsequently been migrated to generate a subsurface image, for which two methods of quality control have been devised: the correlation of the image with respect to the full, no-noise model, and the number of lines as detected through the Canny edge method. The quantity spatial interval over SNR has been used to create a function for both QC methods; Corr = 117.862/( SI/SNR + 114.650), and Nl proportional to (SI/SNR)^1/4 for the number of lines. The fit for the number of lines has a very low R-squared, hence a new method must be sought for quality control.For the given model SI/SNR = 75 has been selected as a maximum for this ratio to obtain a migrated result of sufficient quality for it to be able to be interpreted.","Seismics; singal-to-noise; migration; image quality; spatial sampling","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","Additional thesis",""

Making decisions concerning a career is not something that stops after high school and therefore Yubu B.V. has taken interest in offering a career counselling program for students. <br/><br/>Research is carried out to find out how Yubu B.V. can be of service to students. Annual reports from governmental institutions revealed that HBO education (University of Applied Sciences) struggles the most with delayed students and student satisfaction for career orientation programs. Therefore, the decision was made to focus on HBO education. The outcome of the interviews with the target group revealed that an internship is considered an important moment in their career preparation because it provides a period in which students learn if a type of work suits them. Unfortunately, students struggle with finding a suitable internship because they are not certain about their abilities and interests and end up at the wrong company due to the lack of sufficient career orientation programs. Another problem is that it is very difficult to get an invitation for an internship interview resulting in a study delay for many students.<br/><br/>A serious game is designed that helps students to get an invitation for an internship interview that fits with their interests and values so that they have a bigger chance to get selected and enjoy the time they work for a company. The game is played in three steps. Students will do a self-reflection of which the results can be used to search for an internship and after they have found one they try to get an interview invitation from the company. <br/><br/>Students indicated to have an aversion for self-reflecting in general. However, a better self-image helps students in defining their ideal internship. To ensure that students will perform a self-reflection a model is designed for this specific purpose. This model helps students in defining their internship preferences, skills, motives and personal mission. For each of the categories students create playing cards. All of them together form a card deck that generates a character, which is a representation of themselves and is further used as their avatar in the game. Companies use the same model to create a vacancy so that it can be matched with the characters. With a mini-card game students filter through the offers by laying down cards and making combinations. Students can look at the results and can decide to apply for one or more. They will be placed in a queue together with other students who applied. Students can now compete with each other to earn a position at the front by strengthening their card deck (doing more reflecting). At some point the enrolment deadline expires and the few students at the top get the invitation.<br/><br/>Parts of the game are tested separately with the target group with positive responses as result. However, a large scale test needs to be carried out to find out how efficient the system is, by making real matches between students and offers. Furthermore, for the success of the game it is important that schools are involved because they can play an important role in setting up the game. Schools have databases of companies who need interns and can advise students to use the game.<br","Serious game; Internship; Self-reflection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The results show that modern materials, while allowing man to identify himself with his abstract ideas, do not allow him to do so with his natural environment and human condition. Through the analysis of contemporary architectural works, the study explains how modern materials can be transformed and articulated in a way that they can contribute to a meaningful experience of architecture. Finally, this research paper suggests a need for further study to be conducted.

The ever-growing demand for mobile phones and rapid upgrade patterns, gives mobile phones an unsustainable linear character, with a big contribution to e-waste. This study is about stimulating consumers to return their mobile phones to extend its life or fulfill another purpose through refurbishment and recycling processes. This project is conducted for the case of KPN’s return program and aims towards a beneficial exchange between KPN and consumer. Beneficial transactions of resources, already take place for millions of years in nature, where designers can learn and derive inspirations from. Therefore, these are explored and used as an inspiration throughout this project. Simultaneously an analysis of the mobile phone ecosystem is done to understand how and why retailers and consumers behave in the current context. An in-depth study with consumers resulted in insights on the impact of factors on current take-back programs. Next, to financial incentives, family friendly practice and charitable/circular motives are identified as incentives during the end-of-use stage. Users need to be informed well on the importance of the return of phones, the ease of the method and their privacy. Also, the perceived value of payback should exceed the perceived financial, functional and sentimental value in old phones and the perception of effort. This requires the elimination of negative factors and enhanced benefits for both KPN and consumer in their cooperation. The insights enabled the generation of relevant elements in nature and a translation onto the case. Based on the insights the design goal is formulated: a satisfactory disposal phase that ensures an alternative and long-term payback method for both KPN and users, that enables the involvement of other users for the spread of circular behaviour. As a result, KPN Bewust is developed: a return system that promotes the spread of information and circular behaviour through its return service. In this system, returning an old phone and involving others, is the by-effect of purchasing the next contract with or without a phone with discounts, which reduces the perceived effort. Persuading friends and family to return their phones, is rewarded with mutual benefits.

This thesis furthers the online methods in ACD by developing Incremental Model based Action Dependent Dual Heuristic Programming (IADDHP). In IADDHP, local system dynamics is identified online which does not require any priori knowledge about the system thus making it essentially ‘model-free’. Experiments are performed using missile model for reference tracking control and the results show that the IADDHP is capable of finding near-optimal control policy for the tasks with noise and system failure. It also outperforms the already existing model-free ADDHP which uses finite difference method (FDM) and has advantage over it in failure detection and adaptation. Being a model-free approach, IADDHP should be applicable for reference tracking control of any system.","Action dependent dual heuristic programming (ADDHP); Finite Difference Method (FDM); Incremental model; Model-free controllers; online learning; Reinforcement Learning (RL)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-03-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

These comps act as a benchmark for the valuation as well as a provider of context in the final appraisal report. Traditionally, these comps are selected manually by an appraiser based on recent transactions within a ten mile radius. This manual selection is biased by the appraiser's market knowledge and the amount of transactions in the area. To replace this process, we developed an automated comparable selection service that does so based on objective characteristics, without restricting itself to a small spatial and/or temporal slice of the market.<br/><br/>Comparable selection does not have an objective ground truth, which complicates or even prohibits the use of many machine learning algorithms that could otherwise have been used. Additionally, the outcome of the service needs to be explainable to its users — it cannot be completely opaque. Finally, our service needed to integrate with a streaming data platform, with incremental new data that arrives continuously and needs to be incorporated into the service's model and output.<br/><br/>Our research phase focused on three aspects: determining the possible algorithms for selecting comparable properties given the constraints of explainability and a streaming environment, how to explain the output of the chosen algorithm to the user, and how to build a service around the chosen model that consumes a stream of input data and can generate a set of comparable properties ad-hoc.<br/><br/>Our process was based on agile methodology, with two-week sprints in which we gradually expanded our service into a fully functional proof of concept.

Here more and more slopes fail as anthropogenic activities such as building, farming, or deforestation, are moved to marginal lands such as hillslopes. To investigate the hydrological response of typical hillslopes in North Western Rwanda five landslides are chosen from a previously set up landslide inventory of the region. These five landslides form the basis of a regional assessment for which geotechnical parameters like soil texture, cohesion, and angle of internal friction, are analysed. For one of the five also hydrological data is gathered. This data consists of soil moisture content, groundwater level, hydraulic conductivity, and infiltration for both the moved and the stable parts of the slope. With all this data a back analysis is performed to gather why the slope failed. <br/>The soil texture results show that most of the soil layers investigated are sandy soil, with a slight fraction of clay. This is supported by the values for hydraulic conductivity and infiltration, and by the results of the back analysis, which is coherent with literature values. The direct shear results, however, yield quite high cohesion values, typical for clay, and high angle of internal friction values (even too high for sand sometimes). Thus, the soils can be classified as sand, but the influence of the fines is significant. The slope failure can be a result of a very thin weak soil layer, or anomaly in the soil skeleton, but this is difficult to represent in the tests carried out, with such small samples. Another reason for slope failure does not have to be internal but can be external, such as anthropogenic activities, or toe erosion by a river. It is therefore important to analyse the surroundings of the failed slope carefully. <br/>It is wishful to extend hydrological measurements to more landslides and also wait longer to be able to gain more insight into the relation between precipitation, infiltration and groundwater levels, and the hillslope’s hydrological response.<br","Rwanda; Landslides; Hydrology; Geotechnical","en","student report","","","","","","Additional thesis (CIE5050-09)","","","","","","Water Management | Hydrology","The effect of land use change on the hydrogeotechnical processes triggering landslides in North Western Rwanda",""

Possible reasons for these error margins are discussed.<br/><br/>Hydrophilic mineralwool is an emerging material and not much research is yet available on its water filtering properties.

On top of that, the population and prosperity of cities around the equator are growing fast. Meaning that the need for electricity, cooling and drinking water will grow fast in the following decades. ROTEC’s vision is that these growing problems require a sustainable approach for the future.<br/>A solution to these challenges can be found in the oceans temperature difference. The top layer of the ocean is heated by the sun, while the deeper layer remains cold. This causes around the equator a temperature difference of more than 20 degrees over the ocean’s depth. This offers a lot of opportunities. It can be used as a vast source for electricity production (OTEC), large scale drinking water production (ROTEC) and for cooling (SWAC). Indonesia is one of the best locations worldwide, due to the easy access of cold deep sea water and the abundant presence of hot surface water. North-Sulawesi has a unique access to these sources. Due to the steep slope of the seabed the cold deep seawater can easily be reached.<br/>Team ROTEC conducted a research in Manado for two months and came up with several solutions that can contribute to a more sustainable and beneficial future of North Sulawesi. There was mainly focussed on performing a need assessment for the capital Manado and the touristic Bunaken Island. This pointed out that Manado can reduce their electricity usage during peak loads by implementing a new way of cooling of malls and hotels along the boulevard. Bunaken needs electricity and drinking water in a way that is more easy to maintain and operate. Data analysis and measurements showed that both Bunaken and Manado have a high theoretical potential, since cold deep seawater is close to shore and found at relative shallow depths.<br/>For Manado a new seawater district cooling system is proposed. This system uses cold deep seawater to cool the large buildings along the boulevard, instead of conventional chiller-cooling-tower units. The solution reduces their electricity usage for cooling by 96% and more electricity is left for the grid of Manado. The yearly costs for the operation of the cooling is 92% cheaper and the investment for the installation is earned back within 6 years after construction. Peak loads in the grid are decreased and emissions reduced; equivalent to 19,000 tons CO2 per year.<br/>For Bunaken an integrated drinking water and electricity solution is found. By just using the temperature difference in the ocean, to produce clean and constant electricity and drinking water from seawater. The proposed installation provides the base load (80kW) for Bunaken for the same price as current solar PV and diesel generators together. Clean drinking water for the villagers is 12 times cheaper than Aqua Danone and 1.4 times cheaper than the not drinkable water from fresh water wells on the island.

The overall heat transfer can be improved by adding various additives to the water, although this new medium also requires more power to pump it through the system. The examined additives are: immiscible- and miscible fluids, and nanoparticles. After a theoretical analysis it became clear that only the nanoparticles improve the heat transfer.

One of the critical aspects of the windfarms is the foundation type, as it can define the functionality and the cost of each turbine. Monopiles have prevailed as the most efficient foundation, since 75% of the existing wind farms are founded in this way. However, despite their dominance, there are still mechanisms that affect their stability during their lifetime. Scour formation, which is the erosion of the soil around a monopile, is a crucial one that is the topic of this project. More specifically, the effect of the scour formation (both depth and type) in the stiffness and the lateral capacity in sandy soils has been investigated, followed by analyses about the efficiency of the scour protection layers. The methodology that was followed included numerical simulations, which have been performed in the finite element code of PLAXIS 3D. More specifically, 26 simulations have been conducted, in which the vertical load, the scour depth and type and the scour protection length were the parameters that have been investigated. The conclusions drawn could be divided into four categories, the vertical load, the scour depth and type and the scour formation effect in the stiffness and the lateral capacity. It was shown that the increase in the vertical load had a positive influence in the lateral capacity of the soil-monopile system. However, it could be characterized negligible, as the lateral capacity increase was less than 5%. In the next set of results, the scour depth impact in the stiffness and lateral capacity of the soil was investigated. It was observed that for the same type of scouring, the increase of the depth of the scour hole significantly reduced the soil resistance. It is noted though that scour up to 1.0D could be managed except for the global scour case. On the other hand, for larger depths the situation was becoming more critical and in depth of about 2.0D, the loss of the capacity was too great leading to a no-return state, for all scouring types. Then, the type of scouring impact was investigated, as local scour (narrow and wide) or global can occur. It was shown that the narrow type of scour was the most favorable case, which could approach the no scour case for small scour depth, while the global scour case was the most critical, as even in small scour depths could lead to dramatic reduction of the capacity. The main point is that the narrow case and the wide one can be manageable in depths up to 1.5D under certain conditions, while the global type seems to become a no-return case for much smaller erosion depths. The last part included the scour protection effect which was similar to the vertical load effect, as it had a positive influence in the lateral capacity of the soil-monopile system, but in a range of 5 to 15%. Therefore, it could be ignored in the design phase, unless a thicker protection layer is used. The graphs of the evolution of soil pressures and pile deflection clearly indicated that the monopile presents a rigid response, as the pile was rotated in all cases from a certain rotation point. The rigid behavior of the pile states that the API method is outdated as it is based on slender piles and it cannot capture the rotation point and the distribution of soil pressures that occur due to the rigidity of the monopile. The final output of this current report is a design recommendation, depicted in two normalized charts that correlate load and stiffness at failure displacements with the scour depth and type.","monopile; scour; scour protection; local scour; global scour; monotonic load","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Climate change implicates that temperatures of the atmosphere are getting higher. This may lead to that the drinking water may become warmer. One of the consequences of climate change is that alternative ways of using and making energy has to be developed. One of the options is to use drinking water as cooling water. This will however require careful investigation. In this study the eﬀect of higher water temperatures is examined for the purpose of using drinking water as cooling water, and enquires are made as to what eﬀect this has on the structure of the bioﬁlm inside drinking water distribution systems. A model system, with three setups using PVC pipes, was constructed. The ﬁrst set up was a reference system with drinking water from the Dutch drinking water system, second set up was a reference system with heat exchange equipment where the water from the Dutch drinking water system goes through the equipment but no heat exchange occurs, the last set up was a thermal exchange system in which the drinking water is heated to a constant 25 degrees with the help of heat exchange. From each system bioﬁlm samples were taken after 1,2,4,12,20 and 32 weeks. These samples were then analysed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Some visual trends were seen that were caused by age, and between the system with diﬀerent temperatures with help of the scanning electron microscopy imaging. However, element analysis with the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed no such trends. Whether this was due to no trends being present, or to the limitation of the technique, is unclear. From the result found in this research it is hard to make any conclusion of the eﬀect of higher water temperatures on the structure bioﬁlm in drinking water distribution systems, and further methods should therefore be tried","biofilm; structure; drinking water","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","Additional thesis",""

A solution to this problem is the development of pavement surfaces with improved noise reduction characteristics. Previous attempts to develop low-noise pavement surfaces were not successful, mainly due to their poor mechanical performance and low durability. In this research the mechanical performance of three different low-noise pavement surface materials is investigated. The study was part of the Ultrastil Wegdek (USW) project in the Netherlands. The materials were evaluated with respect to their moisture susceptibility, stiffness, cohesive strength and bonding with the underlying layer. For three different low-noise road surfaces (LNRS), the stiffness was evaluated by means of dynamic modulus tests. Furthermore, indirect and direct tensile tests were carried out after long- and short-term moisture conditioning to estimate strength degradation. The interlayer bond strength was determined using uniaxial tension tests at dry and wet conditions. To evaluate the bond characteristics, also two-layer porous asphalt systems were tested as reference materials. The results show high difference in their properties as a result of the mixture composition. Especially, considering the effect of moisture is of paramount importance for these highly open-graded mixtures.","Low-noise Pavement; Poroelastic material; Moisture susceptibility; Stiffness; Cohesive Strength; Interlayer Bond","en","student report","","","","","","","","2020-01-01","","","","","Ultrastil Wegdek (USW)",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","A comparative batch experiment as well as a biochemical methane potential(BMP) test were conducted over 44d for aerobic granular sludge (WAGS) and waste flocculent activated sludge(WAS) on sludge anaerobic digestion (AD), to give an insight into the chemical and mechanical properties change of the EPS in different sludge source during AD process, via the analysis of polysaccharides (PS), protein (PN), loosely bound extracellular polymeric substance (LB-EPS), tightly bound extracellular polymeric substance (TB-EPS) change and its gel-forming property with multi-valent ions. The EPS, who play a vital role in forming the compact gel-like sludge structure, was extracted from WAGS and AS and analyzed for several test.<br/>During AD process, WAGS demonstrated a lower hydrolysis rate than AS over the first 6 days and reached a comparable overall methane production potential afterwards, suggesting the necessity of pre-treatment of WAGS to enhance sludge hydrolysis. The isolated SEP was slowly degraded over the AD process with a biodegradability of 31% for WAGS and 39% for WAS and this degradation of EPS mainly contributed from the PS and PN it contained. This EPS degradation led to the loss of gel-like properties for both sludge after AD process. Although the results from fourier transformed infrared (FT-IR) spectra exhibited the similar typical brands within the range of 1000~3000 cm-1 in all samples, the second-derivative spectra manifested the occurrence of polysaccharides degradation, especially for homopolymannuronic acid blocks (MM) and homopolyguluronic acid blocks during sludge digestion. Meanwhile, the dewaterability of both sludge was observed to deteriorate with AD ongoing due to the internal transmission from the compact TB-EPS to porous LB-EPS as well as the increase in PN/PS ratio in EPS. Moreover, the mechanical property variation of different sludge was examined by the crosslink of EPS solution with ion to form hydro-bead. Reduction on mechanical strength of EPS formed hydro-beads was seen for both WAGS and WAS but mechanical structure loss of WAGS was less than that of WAS after digestion which can be attributed to higher EPS residues in WAGS. However, no matter for WAGS or WAS, only a limited amount of EPS was degraded during AD process and this provided a possibility of recovery EPS as a coating material from digested sludge.<br","waste aerobic granular sludge(WAGS); sludge anaerobic digestion(AD); waste flocculent activated sludge (WAS); extracellular polymeric substance; gel-like structure; gel-forming property","en","student report","","","","","","","","2018-11-01","","","","","Additional Master Thesis",""

The additional thesis contributes part of Finite Element Analysis of microbatteries, to be specific, the trenched mirobatteries architecture. The project aims to perform a parametric study of micro-battery, including a python script implemented and an example of asymmetric trench model simulation. The python executable allows to run the parametric study in an automatic way. The asymmetric working example provides a generic trench model template. <br/><br/>The python executable consists of six functional blocks, namely: reading the input data from users, generating meshes with multiple parameters, splitting the interface nodes, refining the mesh files, running the simulations, and collecting the generic output parameter. Generating meshes allows users to create 2D triangle mesh with two parameters for a given geometry. Splitting the interface nodes uses a generic manner to split interfaces for an arbitrary structure. Once splitting interface is done, the executable is able to seek the new nodes on the interface and compile them in a prescribed fashion before simulation. Coming into the last part, the executable makes use of a set of external programs to run Jem-Jive carrying out the relative outcome. A simple case will go through every step how this script works, after which a more complicated model will be illustrated. <br/><br/>Generally, though taking the advantage of symmetry of trench makes the parametric study easier and straightforward to handle with, which only the half of trench is considered, an asymmetric trench model is more probable and realistic. An example is provided afterwards with five pillars which not only their length may vary, but imperfection is introduced here: pillars can be slightly inclined as well until they touch each other. An important property worth noticing is the top and bottom of the trench stay smoothie although inclination occurs and the neutral layer of pillar still remains the same length. The example gives a detailed universal geometric derivation and formulas with respect to heights and inclined angles, which are regarded as two relative variables implemented by the python executable mentioned above.<br","Micro-battery; Parametric study; Trench Model","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","Additional thesis",""

After deposition with 3 cycles, MWCO of the ceramic membranes was reduced by ~ 250 Da. The pore size of the ceramic membranes was correspondingly narrowed down by ~ 0.16 nm. The growth per cycle of TiO2 on the pore walls was ~ 0.272 nm/cycle. An improved Carman-Kozeny model was used to estimate water permeability.

Therefore the research questionin this project is: how can the implementation of vario-scale be improved to better meet theneeds for end users of Kadaster topographic data?This question is answered by questioning surveying users of Kadaster data on what theywould like to see improved about the existing implementation. Combining this with anexploration of the current software leads to an attempt at improving the currentimplementation.

Road network visualization is achieved by building the roads space scalecube and overlay with the background area at the front-end.

This research seeks to bridge this gap in existing literature by determining the effect of the openness and monotony of the built environment on cyclist route choice in the Province of Noord-Brabant. The openness value for a specific route has been modeled by accounting for the building heights and distance to a building for a sequence of locations. Applying a linear regression analysis with the openness and monotony model as input shows that openness of the built environment has a negative influence on the amount of distance people are willing to diverge from the shortest path, while on the other hand, cyclists prefer to use roads with higher variation in the built environment.
