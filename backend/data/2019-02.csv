The goal of the thesis is to explore the use of true multi-GPU acceleration on computationally challenging brain models and to assess the scalability of such models given sufficient access to multi-node acceleration platforms. The brain model used is a state-of-the-art, extended HodgkinHuxley, biophysically- meaningful, three-compartmental model of the inferior-olivary nucleus. Not only the simulation of the cells, but also the setup of the network is taken into account when designing and benchmarking the multi-GPU version. For network sizes varying from 65K to 4M cells, 10, 100 and 1000 synapses per neuron are simulated. These simulations are executed on 8, 16, 32 and 48 GPUs. A Gaussian-distributed network of 4 million cells with a density of 1,000 synapses per neuron executed on 48 GPUs, is setup and simulated in 465.69 seconds, of which the cell-computation phase takes 4.57 seconds, obtaining a speedup of 50 times the execution time on a single GPU. A uniform-distributed network of same size and density is setup and simulated in 889.89 seconds of which the cell-computation phase takes 10.09 seconds, obtaining a speedup of 8 times the execution on a single GPU. For the implemented design, the inter-GPU communication becomes the major bottleneck, as latency increases when the sent packet sizes increase. This communication overhead does not dominate the overall execution while scaling network sizes is tractable. This scalable design gives a good prospect for neuroscientists, proving that large network-size simulations are possible, using a multi-GPU setup.","multi GPU; brain simulator; cluster; Hodgkin-Huxley; gap junctions; neuron network; Cartesius; multi compartment; linear scaling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

(Stefan) (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","This study was initiated with a view to understand factors that either aids or presents a barrier towards the adoption of a radically new public transport mode, Hyperloop. The initial promises of Hyperloop include a faster, cheaper, sustainable and efficient mode of transport compared to the existing public transport mode alternatives. However, the technology is largely conceptual and hasn’t been realized yet for commercial operations. Thus, it was found through literature review, that it was important to first study the perceptions on the development of Hyperloop. Also, since Hyperloop development would be of a multi-stakeholder nature, due to the extensive urban landscape and infrastructure changes, it is important to incorporate and/or address the concerns and incentives of every stakeholder involved. Furthermore, large scale infrastructural projects similar to Hyperloop, such as high Speed Rail have faced opposition from the public due to lack of general awareness. This research thus aimed to explore the existing perceptions on the development of Hyperloop, with a view to recommend an inclusive nature of development as well as policy design.<br/>To identify these perspectives the ‘Political Economy Model for Transport Innovations’ was used as a framework. Since existing literature of Product Development relevance of Hyperloop was limited at the time of the initiation of this study, the model was used to interview experts and stakeholders involved in the industrial development of Hyperloop to generate additional content and statements on Hyperloop. A limited set of 25 statements were then presented to a limited set of respondents to identify the patterns of perspectives on Hyperloop.<br/>The study was conducted in the Netherlands with a sample respondent size of 32 participants. To identify perceptions among these respondents, Q-methodology was used. Q-methodology helps in statistical derivation of subjectivity. It also helps the research identify broad patterns of subjective biases compared to the traditional qualitative analysis or R-factor analysis. Through this study 4 distinct perceptions were interpreted. The first perspective is that the public would support research and development on Hyperloop, with a view to either fully realise or help in positive knowledge spill over for adjacent technologies. The second perception interpreted was that the public would rather spend the resources on the development of current existing transport modes to achieve the objectives of Hyperloop. The third perception interpreted was that the public would fully support the implementation of Hyperloop. The fourth perception identifies the skepticism in the full commercial realization of Hyperloop.<br/>Through this study it was found that there is a healthy balance between positive and negative perceptions on the development of Hyperloop. Thus it is required to include the public as a primary stakeholder in its development. This could be enabled by a transparent flow of communication between all the stakeholders via a platform. The study also advocates the use of marketing the technology via subtle measures such as ‘nudging’. <br","Adoption; Adoption of Innovation; Perception; Hyperloop; Q-methodology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The satellite carries a Doppler navigation system (DORIS) and a Satellite Laser Ranging system (SLR) to aid the precise computation of orbits down to centimetre level.<br/>CNES/IDS releases DORIS tracking data in two formats for CryoSat-2. One is the raw format called RINEX and other is the pre-processed Doppler format called version 2.2. V2.2 data contains all information necessary for straightforward usage in orbit determination - measurements time-tagged in TAI, range-rate measurements, ionospheric correction, tropospheric correction, antenna corrections and flags that indicate unusable measurements. RINEX does not contain any corrections and has the phase and pseudorange measurements at short latency allowing users to have flexibility in processing. Additionally, data required for formulating the corrections are present in RINEX. For missions in and after 2016, CNES/IDS supplies tracking data only in RINEX and not in V2.2. Analysis centres using DORIS data now have to independently develop processing strategies to process RINEX data. This problem is the main objective of this research. In this thesis, a pre-processor called RX2RR (RINEX to Range-Rate) has been built in Fortran in an attempt to process the raw data and compute all the necessary corrections. RX2RR converts RINEX format to a format exactly similar to V2.2 such that RINEX can now be used in any orbit determination tool that has been previously using V2.2. In this processor, clock synchronisation of on-board clock to International Atomic Time is performed. A new approach of utilizing Meteorological data in RINEX for troposphere delay corrections is implemented. Use of real time data from numerical weather models is also presented for tropospheric correction. Ionospheric delay and antenna phase centre corrections are performed using iono-free phase centre. An editing strategy to remove outliers in Doppler data is implemented and tested. To demonstrate the performance of the tool, we perform orbit determination using NASA Goddard Space Flight Center’s orbit computation software GEODYN-II. We use RX2RR processed RINEX data and CNES processed V2.2 data of CryoSat-2 for year 2016. Tracking residuals from both POD runs are compared and average difference in R.M.S residual is found to be approximately 0.011 mm/s over a year. This validates that the corrections are formulated and implemented correctly. The result proves our capability to process the RINEX measurements independently and the tool developed has extended the capability of GEODYN-II to process RINEX observations from DORIS system.","Precise orbit determination (POD); DORIS; IDS; GEODYN-II; RINEX; Doppler","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","CryoSat-2",""

Researchers in the field of computer vision devote their time and effort to analyze images in order to gain valuable insight. Data<br/>analysis and classification can be impeded by different factors. One of which is the image filters that are studied in this work. People greatly change the appearance of their photos by adding filters in order to make them more appealing. Instagram is arguably one of the most popular social media platforms online. With the platform’s growth, filtering images has also become more popular. In this thesis a subset of Instagram filters has been selected in order to study their impact with a series of experiments. To our knowledge, no mention has been made of image filters’ impact in prior work, in the domain of machine classification and human perception. Image filters can create many challenges depending on the application they are used in. In this thesis, focus has been given on classification of weather conditions. Systems have been designed to receive images and accurately identify the weather conditions that exist in them solely using visual features and no prior knowledge. In weather forecasting a lot of resources are spent in order to study past and current weather conditions so as to predict the state of the weather in the future. Gathering and documenting weather related information can be aided by these aforementioned systems. However, if researchers would like to use social images to extract insight, they need to change their approach accordingly. As it is documented in the following chapters, dealing with these photos can be problematic and can cause huge decline in performance. For this reason, the algorithmic design has been changed by using different techniques inspired<br/>from the domain of Adversarial Machine Learning to measure their effect. In addition to machine classification, filters can influence human perception as well. A study is conducted that measures the impact filters have on the ability of humans identifying the weather conditions in images. From the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results several key findings are extracted regarding the effect of filters and the visual cues that are used by people. People have identified certain visual cues that have not been encoded in the classifier such as the type of clothing people are wearing. Instead much simpler features have been engineered and the performance of the classifier is still<br/>quite high.","Machine Learning; Computer vision; Image filters; Weather condition classification; Adversarial Machine Learning; Crowdsourcing; Human perception","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

For Dutch startups to expand to a new market like India that has a considerable difference in the context, it is first required to redefine the value proposition and the business model specific to the new context. Also, startups in the energy domain are defined as a beachhead market for Venturedam considering their faster growth. Venturedam as a strategic design consulting firm would help Dutch energy startups to understand and identify markets in India that fits with the value proposition. Once the market is identified, Venturedam would also support startups to redesign the product and the business model. To execute market expansion projects for startups, Venturedam is required to have a process or a framework to guide different activities. These activities would be required to perform successful market expansion for the startup. Venturedam itself would also require a business model to make a viable business case. The design goal was set up to define a framework and a business model for Venturedam. Market expansion is a strategic design activity, and it is required to find an opportunity with a considerable balance between desirability, viability, and feasibility. Strategic design literature is referred to create the framework for Venturedam. The framework is named as ‘Projectile framework.’ The framework derived from the literature is tested with a Dutch energy startup Solar Monkey from Yes! Delft incubator. Steps from the first diamond of the framework are applied to the case of Solar Monkey. Learnings are captured throughout the application of the framework. These learnings are utilized to redesign Projectile framework for future projects. Addition to the learnings gathered from the application of the framework, feedback from experts and Solar Monkey is collected. Analyzing learnings and feedbacks, new design directions were defined. These design directions helped to further develop Projectile framework. Design directions also helped to modify steps, tools, and methods of the framework. Learnings captured during the application of the process facilitated to build the business model of Venturedam.The concept of Venturedam started with a broad idea of facilitating innovation transfer between two countries.

This study therefore investigates different invariant objects and their properties in the neighbourhood of Earth and in the L5 region that could be used as departure and arrival conditions: equilibrium points, families of periodic orbits and families of invariant tori as well as the stable manifold of periodic orbits. Then, transfers between these invariant objects are studied using a hybridisation of different trajectory design techniques. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is applied to obtain near-feasible initial guesses, which are transformed into feasible transfers using a differential correction method. Through a continuation on the fixed time of flight, the differential corrector is subsequently used to reduce the transfer time. A pseudospectral optimisation method is finally taken at hand to obtain a smooth, continuous control profile, to, if possible, further reduce the transfer time. This approach results in fast solar-sail transfers between 391 and 1194 days, depending on the departure and arrival configuration and the assumed solar-sail technology. These results can serve as preliminary design solutions for a mission to the Sun-Earth L5 region.","Solar sails; Periodic Orbits; Quasi-periodic orbits; L5 mission; Trajectory optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-02-28","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

An actuator reference planning strategy to bring tensegrity robots closer to controlled full body movements was proposed by Guido Tournois \cite{GuidoThesis} in 2017. This strategy, called the Full Body Reference Planner (FBRP), finds a sequence of equilibrium configurations for a tensegrity structure, predominantly to follow a trajectory in space. However, the method is incapable of incorporating inequality constraints while obtaining said equilibrium configurations. This is a problem when dealing with certain restrictions, e.g., actuator limitations and stability of the structure. <br/><br/>In this thesis we implemented a robust way to account for inequality constraints while utilizing the FBRP. That was done by means of optimization, i.e., an implementation of a Sequential Quadratic Programming method to ensure inequality constraints were respected for each configuration. The approach was validated in scenarios related to practical applications where inequality constraints were enforced. The results showed advancements towards practical feasibility. Furthermore, the robustness, efficiency and accuracy of the method were validated. The extended implementation depicted robustness to parameter variations and good results in terms of accuracy. However, given the iterative nature of the method, it was more computationally expensive than its precursor.","Tensegrity; Robotics; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

We analyse the effect of both strategies separately. We let humans evaluate the output on grammar, meaning preservation (from the complex sentence) and simplicity (compared to the complex sentence).<br/><br/>Results show that an NMT trained on general aligned complex and simple sentences is able to simplify medical sentences at the level of Simple Wikipedia.

In project-financed infrastructure, lenders are a specific stakeholder whose risk analyses need to understand a project’s technical substance as a basis for appraising the quality of borrower’s plans and making their decisions on financing conditions. This need makes an interesting interface of disciplines, where engineering and finance worlds must meet and work together in the specific domain of lenders’ technical due diligence. In this context, the lenders’ perspective of project complexity was explored, and a lack of mutual understanding was identified between engineers and finance experts as regards project complexity. To address this, the thesis conceptualised a systematic approach to project complexity evaluation to explore whether and how project complexity evaluation could improve cross-disciplinary collaboration and communication in the realm of technical due diligence performed by engineers supporting lenders’ risk analyses. Through case studies and interviews, the study confirmed that an absence of a systematic project complexity evaluation can give rise to conflicting perceptions about a project’s technical riskiness. It was shown that a systematic approach to complexity evaluation can act as a needed nexus between engineering and finance expertise. If applied at a preliminary phase of technical due diligence, systematic complexity evaluation can facilitate communication and collaboration, complementing the existing risk analysis practices and methods by establishing a common understanding of a project’s substance. Through critically considering different experts’ views enabled by a BWM-based analysis applied in this study, an enriched understanding of project complexity can be gained, helping streamline the identification, evaluation and management of risks and eventually contributing to more informed decisions.","PPP; complexity; technical risk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); de Haas, Felix (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Currently wind turbines are a popular source of renewable energy. Royal HaskoningDHV designs foundations for these turbines. Design optimization of these foundations becomes more and more important due to the growing demand for renewable energy, the development of increasingly large wind turbines and intensification of competition. Design improvements can reduce construction costs, and also reduce the carbon footprint of the tower foundation. Today these foundations are designed using the Eurocode in combination with the results from linear analysis of a 2D model. Expectations are that this yields a conservative model. A 3D non-linear model is expected to provide a more detailed insight into the actual structural behaviour of such a foundation. Specifically, the distribution of concrete and reinforcement stresses and strains can be found, and used to determine whether, and where, reinforcement can be reduced or should be increased. To obtain a non-linear 3Dmodel, first a linear 3D model is developed, starting fromthe existing 2Dmodel. Subsequently the results of the two linearmodels are compared. Once the linear 3Dmodel is deemed to function satisfactorily, it is further developed to incorporate non-linear material properties and reinforcement, taking into account observations made in the linear analysis.<br/>Simplifications made for the 2D model cease to hold. Besides minor details, the pedestal, that was left out of the scope for the 2D model, is introduced in the 3D model. Additionally, the connection between the foundation piles and the structure are placed at the underside, instead of at mid-height. Results of the<br/>2D and 3D linear models are generally similar. However, small differences were observed. In general, these differences can be attributed to these two main modelling differences. Modelling in 3D opened up more possibilities for detailing of the supporting foundation piles. However the effects on the results for different support cases was minor. After comparing the linear analysis results, the next step is a non-linearmodel. The non-linear 3D model includes several non-linear aspects. Reinforcement was incorporated. Non-linear constitutive models were studied and chosen for concrete in tension and compression as well as for the reinforcement steel. Connections between different parts of the structure, such as the anchor cage, were also modelled non-linearly. The results of the non-linear analysis seems to provide an improved insight into the structural behaviour of the foundation structure. More detailed information about concrete strains, reinforcement stresses, crack progression and displacements can be shown, and used to verify, or disprove, assumptions based on the 2D linear analysis. However, problems with non-convergence occur before the expected failure load without a<br/>satisfactory structural explanation. Therefore the model does not provide a plausible structural failure load. Because no ultimate load was found it is difficult to determine whether, and if so, how much the applied reinforcement can be reduced. Nevertheless, the model could be used in a more qualitative way to show and describe where stress concentrations will occur and how the structure will deform. Internal splitting cracks are seen outside of the centre of the structure where only limited reinforcement is present. These splitting cracks may be a cause of model instability. Design alterations can be made to increase the load for which non-convergence occurs. An increased the ultimate load is found when splitting<br/>reinforcement is elongated, or when the amount of applied prestressing load on the anchor cage is altered. Even applying a simply modified constitutive concrete model, to represent steel fibre reinforcement, appears beneficial. However, these alterations may only improved the behaviour of the model, while still no actual<br/>failure mode is found. It cannot be said without a doubt that these modifications will improve the structuralbehaviour of the actual structure.

Furthermore, the ground state of the harmonic oscillator is equal to the square root of the reversible distribution of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Combining these results gives us the evolution of quantum states with an almost Gaussian wave function. If we conﬁne one degree of freedom in the end result, we obtain the coherent states of the quantum harmonic oscillator.

The current project is a preparatory analysis for the research in which the two components will be combined. It is anticipated that their combination may generate more added value due to mutual reinforcement. <br/>The study of metal foam based sandwich materials showed that looking at the material level, the {aluminium foam core, steel face sheet} sandwich material is theoretically promising with respect to the conventional steel solid plate in specific situations and applications. When the sandwich material is implemented as part of the stiffened panel, the expected benefit could not be realised. This confirms the search for a more selective use, such in naval vessels when one needs a high resistance to impacts and blasting, and when one wants to conserve the limited internal space. <br/>Compared with the currently existing arc welding technique of double sided T-joints, the corner adstir fillet stationary shoulder FSW scores better on hardness and fatigue resistance of the weld. Since the properties of the weld material correspond to those of the parent material, the weld can no longer be seen as the weakest link of the structure. The fatigue experiment occasionally revealed a new failure type at the undercut, being a sharp corner created by the modified FSW shoulder. This second failure type did not impact on the overall expected failure resistance; however, the limited occurrence does not allow a final statistical interpretation.<br/>Based upon our analyses, there is not yet a place for widespread use of {aluminium foam core, steel face sheet} sandwich materials, but there is an added value for the corner adstir fillet stationary shoulder FSW.","Sandwich material; Metal foam; Stiffened panel level; Structural optimization model; Cost calculation model; Friction stir welding; Corner adstir fillet stationary shoulder; T-joint; AA 5083-H111; Fatigue resistance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-28","","","","Marine Technology","",""

These facilities need to be connected with each other in order to enable the transfer of personnel among each other. As a result, bridges are implemented for such purposes with their ends being positioned at extensions of the two connected platforms, known as the bridge landings.<br/>Such a bridge should be able to follow the excitations that are imposed at its two ends from the response of the connected platforms due to the applied environmental loads. Thus, in its longitudinal direction, the bridge should be pinned-supported at one platform and sliding-supported at the other. Such a configuration enables the bridge to adapt to the continuously varying relative movement that is induced by the motion of the two connected platforms. This results in the generation of friction at the sliding end of the bridge.<br/>Similarly to any other offshore structure, a bridge landing should be able to withstand the maximum operating loads and its configuration should be checked against the different limit states. Although a jacket substructure is commonly analysed against the serviceability, ultimate and fatigue limit states, a bridge landing is checked against only the first two states. However, the generated friction at the sliding bridge supports results in varying stresses at the corresponding bridge landing. This indicates that the fatigue limit state should also be examined and thus investigation is required in order to highlight its significance in the design of such a structure.<br/>This is the motivation behind the certain thesis, which intends to clarify the sensitivity of a bridge landing into the varying dynamic load of the generated friction. In order to do so, a specific case is examined, with real information about the structure and the environmental details. The analysis comprises examining three limit states (SLS, ULS, FLS), concluding into the governing one for the case of the bridge landing. The structural analyses were performed using the SACS software, which enables performing all the SLS and ULS checks. Regarding fatigue, though, the whole analysis was conducted independently, using a simplified approach that enables to deal with the issue in a quick way. This comprises the base case approach, through which assumptions are made regarding the wave and friction main characteristics.<br/>After verifying the significance of the fatigue limit state in the design, an assessment of the base case approach follows. This is performed through the examination of the main sensitivity parameters that influence the simplified approach through which the fatigue assessment was conducted. The results of the sensitivity analyses are then incorporated in order to review the method and conclude into any possible improvements.<br/>Finally, enhancement of the structure is examined through four different ways, aiming to turn it to be sufficient against the fatigue requirements. The improvement actions consist of improving the existing weld details, modifying the existing structure and reinforcing of members.<br/>It should be noted that the problem was also approached through a numerical approach that was generated using the Matlab software. Through this, it was intended to capture the behaviour of friction in a more realistic way before incorporating it in the fatigue assessment, something that was not possible to be done inside SACS. However, the model didn’t show rational results and thus it could not be used in the fatigue analysis. The whole procedure and theory, though, are described in detail since it is possible that they can set a useful background for further investigation.","Fatigue Analysis; bridge landing; Friction; Dynamic; S-N approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Hence, the potential of unconventional configurations are being investigated in recent years. Flying V is one such configuration that promises a lift to drag ratio about 24 in cruise conditions, an improvement of 25% with respect to the NASA Common Research Model that was used as conventional configuration benchmark. In addition, the flight dynamic characteristics of such an aircraft must be investigated to ensure flight safety. Sub-scale flight testing (SSFT) allows the characterization of flight dynamics using sub-scaled models. In order to mitigate the risk of loss of control situations, the static stability and control characteristics of the model must be investigated. This research work aims to support SSFT by designing a sub-scale model and assessing its aerodynamic characteristics by wind tunnel testing. The sub-scaled design is representative of a 4.6% geometrically scaled model of full-scale Flying V design based on Froude scaling laws.<br/><br/>To test the aerodynamics of the future flying model, wind tunnel testing have been conducted. Balance measurements of 4.6% scaled half-model have been collected in an open jet wind-tunnel. A total of three control surfaces are installed on the model and the two inboard have been prescribed, during the design phase, to provide pitching moment control authority. The shift in aerodynamic center at higher angles of attack has been registered and large deflections of the control surfaces have been noticed to influence the shift of the aerodynamic center up to 6% of the mean aerodynamic chord.<br/><br/>Aside of the experimental investigations, RANS simulations have been performed using the Spalart-Allmaras one equation turbulence model. Although discrepancies have been identified between the wind tunnel and numerical results, especially in terms of drag and pitching moment coefficient, the CFD results are used to get a better understanding of the influence of vortical flows on the genesis of lift and drag over the scaled model. Based on the performed CFD simulations, it can be concluded that the performed CFD simulations are insufficient to reproduce the pitching moment behavior recorded during wind tunnel testing.<br/><br/>The designed sub-scaled model proved to be able to substain flight loads up to more than 2.5g at MTOM conditions. Based on the performed analyses, the center of gravity is suggested to be located between 1.33 and 1.39 meters behind the nose of the configuration. The deployed control surfaces can trim the aircraft up maximum lift coefficients between 0.6 and 0.7, depending on the location of the center of gravity, with an ultimate static stability margin equal to -4.4%. The results highlight that a reduction in pitching moment control authority would cause a reductions up to 20 % on the maximum lift coefficient achievable in trimmed conditions due to lack of control authority for forward location of the center of gravity. The designed model can therefore be used for future SSFT activities and landing speeds are estimated to be lower than 20 m/s for the proposed range of center of gravity locations at MTOM conditions.","Wind Tunnel Experiment; Stability Analysis; Control Analysis; CFD; Center of gravity effects; Aerodynamic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flying V Research",""

In order to reduce signal loss, this research has focused on the influence of smart electrosurgery on both the morphology and composition of the layer covering the optical fiber tip. Optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to examine the morphology, while energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Raman spectroscopy (RS) were used to examine the composition. The results of these analyses showed that there are two factors, both caused by extreme tissue heat, leading to signal loss: first, the fiber tip gets soiled by a layer of tissue debris covering the tip, and secondly, the fiber tip gets damaged due to degradation of the acrylate coating. Therefore, two different surface modifications were tested: application of a polytetrafluoro-ethylene (PTFE) coating to prevent tissue debris adhesion, and stripping off the acrylate coating to prevent melting damage. Both modifications were unable to completely prevent signal loss. However, elimination of the acrylate coating has shown to reduce signal loss from 45.8% to 36.4%. In contrast, the PTFE coating has shown to slightly increase signal loss to 48.5%. According to this research, the optimal solution for signal loss during use of the smart electrosurgical knife should respond to thermal optical fiber damage and thermal tissue debris adhesion. Based on the research results, it is suggested to implement a heat-resistant optical fiber provided with an advanced heat-resistant, anti-adhesive coating.","smart electrosurgery; diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; tissue debris; signal deterioration; optical fiber","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

A common trend towards cost reduction has been to build larger and lighter wind turbines. These produce more power per unit and use less material. Another strategy for cost reduction could be to reduce the Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) costs of wind turbines by using optimal O&amp;M strategies. O&amp;M costs account for approximately one-fourth of the overall energy cost for the full lifetime of a wind turbine. They assume even greater significance in the wake of growing interest in offshore wind farms since offshore wind turbines operate in harsher environments compared to their onshore counterparts and are more difficult to access. Condition monitoring has been proposed as a novel preventive maintenance strategy wherein sensors are employed to collect data related to the functioning of an operational wind turbine. This data can be processed to get meaningful information about component health of the wind turbine. An aeroelastic model can be used to simulate the fault-free response of the wind turbine for given operating conditions. By comparing real-time information from the condition monitoring system and aeroelastic model, it may be possible to develop routines which can detect developing faults in the wind turbine components. This forms the basis of a model-based condition monitoring system (MOD-CMS). For purposes of model-based condition monitoring it is required to have an aeroelastic model which is computationally fast to be capable of running real-time aeroelastic load simulations, and is highly accurate in order to detect faults. Furthermore, it is also desirable to have a linear aeroelastic model since this can also be used for controller and state observer design. A state observer can help estimate states of the wind turbine which are not easily measurable. This thesis reviews state-of-the-art aeroelastic tools to get a better understanding of their limitations. A reduced-order aeroelastic model is developed using the aeroelastic module in STAS WPP (State Space Analysis of Wind Power Plants) which is an open-source aero-hydro-servo-elastic tool in the Matlab/Octave environment. The linear reduced order aeroelastic model is verified by running test cases in the frequency domain for the NREL 5MW Baseline wind turbine. The accuracy of the linearized model is demonstrated by performing a stability analysis study for the NREL 5MW Baseline wind turbine. <br/>Furthermore, different coupling and numerical integration schemes are studied to develop a time marching simulation tool. Two main approaches are proposed. The first involves time marching of the monolithic, strongly coupled non-linear aeroelastic model using a multistep predictor-corrector integration scheme. In the second approach, a partitioned, loosely coupled version of the linear aeroelastic model is implicitly integrated over time. In the present work a tool based on the first approach of integrating the non-linear aeroelastic model is developed and subsequently verified by running simple power production test cases. <br/> In conclusion, this thesis discusses and implements a framework of strategies which can be implemented to reduce the order of a high-order aeroelastic model. It suggests coupling and numerical integration schemes to utilize this reduced-order model in a time marching simulation tool.","Aeroelasticity; Reduced order model; Wind Energy; Structural Dynamics; Condition Monitoring; Fault Detection; aeroelastic instabilities; model order reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Age-hardening of the binder leads to the embrittlement of the overall asphalt mixture, which entails its increased susceptibility to traffic and environmental induced damage. As a result, high maintenance efforts as well as increased expenses are required to allow for an asphalt pavement to reach its expected service-life.<br/>Past research efforts have established a solid background with respect to the implications of bitumen ageing on the overall response of an asphalt mixture as well as on the binder’s physico-chemical properties. In the same framework, studies have demonstrated that the ageing process of bitumen in the field is not solely a function of the bitumen type itself, but rather, added effects have been identified attributed to the mineral matter and the asphalt mixture design parameters.<br/>This thesis attempts to provide a deeper understanding of the effect of mineral aggregates on the ageing of bitumen, and more specifically, the effect of a special fraction of the solid phase in asphalt mixtures, the mineral fillers. Six different mineral fillers were employed in this research, covering a wide range of physical and composition-related (i.e. elemental/mineralogical) properties. Bitumen-mineral filler blends were prepared, according to a single design protocol, and the resulting mastics along with neat bitumen were subjected to accelerated laboratory ageing by means of the Pressure Ageing Vessel.<br/>The rheological (i.e. Dynamic Shear Rheometer) evaluation of the resulting materials and the derivation of ageing indices revealed the overall ability of the mineral fillers, regardless of their individual properties, to mitigate the ageing of bitumen incorporated in the mastics. The chemical (i.e. Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy) investigation of the materials showed that, in fact, the chemically active mineral fillers catalysed the oxidation of bitumen incorporated in the mastics. These results allowed for the identification of two mechanisms through which the effect of the mineral fillers on the ageing of bitumen occurs. The first one is related to the physical presence of the mineral matter in the mastics, whereas the second one to the developed physico-chemical interactions between the mineral fillers’ particles and the bitumen. Basic mineral fillers were found to be more efficient in reducing the age-hardening of mastics, compared to acidic ones, by allowing for more intensive interactions between the mastics’ constituent materials. Moreover, there are indications that the mineral fillers’ specific surface area also has a primary role to the developed interactions, and, by extension, to the ageing behavior of the mastics.<br/>Finally, in addition to the aforementioned main findings, binders were extracted and recovered from the aged mastics, in an effort to derive further information on the effect of mineral fillers on ageing of bituminous mixtures by investigating the aged mastics’ constituent materials on their individual level. The rheological and chemical examination of the recovered materials did not lead to any further insight regarding the research questions of this study. Instead, features were revealed which manifest that the extraction and recovery of bitumen may not be a suitable approach for the investigation of the research problem addressed in this thesis.<br","Bitumen; Filler; Ageing; Bituminous mastics; DSR; FTIR; Mineralogy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Middelkoop, Erik (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","In Groningen, seismic activity has increased due to the extraction of gas in the area. A large-scale research campaign has been launched with the aim to assess and safeguard structures in the region. However, an accurate assessment of these buildings turned out to be a challenge, due to the nonlinear behaviour of the masonry and the dynamic nature of a seismic load. A Nonlinear Time History (NLTH) analysis takes into account both these factors, but the computational demand of such a method is considerable. Another method that is widely used to analyse the seismic response of a structure is the Modal Response Spectrum (MRS) method. The computational demand of this method is considerably less compared to NLTH, but nonlinear material behaviour is only taken into account in an indirect manner via a behaviour factor, and the results are considered to be too conservative. A third method is the Nonlinear Pushover (NLPO) method. It takes nonlinear material behaviour into account and compared to NLTH, NLPO is computationally more efficient. Furthermore, an advantage is that it separates capacity from demand. Even though the NLPO method is commonly applied worldwide, its validity still needs to be proven for the Groningen case. Both objectives were studied by looking into a single case study, consisting of a low-rise URM apartment building. The behaviour of the structure is characterised by a weak and strong direction, in which the weak direction is characterised by a relatively low stiffness and lateral capacity compared to the strong direction. The seismic response of the structure is determined according to the MRS, NLPO and NLTH methods. Furthermore, the NLPO analyses are executed using two different computational discretisation methods, namely continuum FEM and macro EFM. DIANA is used as a FEM solver for the MRS, NLPO and NLTH analyses and 3MURI is used for the EFM model. Moreover, a modal and uniform lateral load pattern are taken into account for the NLPO analyses. The conclusions which are drawn from the case study can generally be applied to low-rise URM apartment buildings in Groningen. However, it must be noted that significant alterations in geometry and building materials might influence the results. Furthermore, modelling assumptions have been applied, and it is important to note that the possible influence of these assumptions, may partially limit the extent of the conclusions. Moreover, several limitations are inherent to the studied methods, and cannot be accounted for somehow. All analyses are performed by incrementally increasing the seismic load until one of the near collapse limit state criteria according to NPR 9998 is met. Furthermore, three target displacement methods are evaluated: the capacity spectrum method according to NPR 9998, the regular N2-method, included in the Eurocode 8, and an adaptation of the N2-method which is developed specifically for URM structures by Guerinni. The performance of the structure according to each of the methods is studied subsequently, by looking into the force-displacement behaviour, displacement profile and damage at failure, failure mechanisms and the maximum admissible seismic load. Two significant disadvantages of macro EFM were identified when comparing the results of the NLPO analyses using 3MURI and DIANA. First, the fact that out-of-plane behaviour is not taken into account in 3MURI could significantly influence the behaviour of a structure in terms of base shear capacity, which is especially true when structures are characterised by an extremely low total length of piers in the in-plane direction. Furthermore,DIANA allows for a more gradual softening behaviour, which helps the post-peak force redistribution. As a consequence, the maximum admissible seismic load according to DIANA could be higher. However, despite the two aforementioned disadvantages of the macro EFM method as implemented in 3MURI, all other relevant results of both methods are similar. The fact that the two identified disadvantages of 3MURI can only result in more conservative results, suggests that macro EFM, as implemented in 3MURI, is a suitable computational discretisation method for the seismic assessment according to the NLPO method for low-rise URM apartment buildings in Groningen. However, it should be taken into account that the conservativeness of 3MURI could lead to a significantly larger amount of required retrofitting, in comparison with DIANA. The applicability of the NLPO method is reviewed by comparing the results of the MRS, NLPO and NLTH methods. Similar behaviour of the structure according to the NLPO and NLTH method was captured, which suggests that the NLPO method is a suitable analysis method for the studied typology. The maximum admissible seismic load using the target displacement method according to NPR 9998 is in-line with the NLTH analysis. However, the governing load case made use of a uniform load pattern, which returns a structural behaviour different than that obtained by NLTH analyses, as can be seen from the force-displacement behaviour. If only the capacity curve according to the modal load pattern would be considered, then the allowable seismic load according to NLTH is similar to that of NLPO using the target displacement method of Eurocode 8. Furthermore, from the results of the case study can be concluded that the choice of target displacement method has a significant influence on the maximum admissible seismic load. For the case study, NPR 9998 is more conservative in the strong direction, and Eurocode 8 is more conservative in the weak direction. Regarding the MRS method, very conservative results were found. A reason that was found for these conservative results is that the prescribed behaviour factor by NPR 9998 is too low for the case study when compared to that derived from the NLPO analysis. However, even with a larger behaviour factor, the results according to the MRS method would still be conservative in the weak direction.","Gronningen; Earthquakes; NLTH; NLPO; MRS; Non linear time History; Nonlinear Pushover; Modal Response Spectrum; URM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

As agriculture accounts for 70 percent of global freshwater withdrawals, fresh water availability will thus face even greater stress (World Bank, 2013). Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s) 2, 6 and 7 (UN, 2015) show that the achievement of water, food, and energy security have been set to a high priority on the global world agenda. However, achieving these goals cannot be done without a proper understanding of the interlinkages between the sectors. As water resources become more stretched, the energy and food sectors’ dependence on water implies that decision-makers in all three domains should increasingly focus on water resource management as part of their policy and practice (“Water, Food and Energy | UN-Water,” n.d.).<br/><br/>In light of this, the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations launched the so-called Water Productivity Open-access portal (WaPOR). The portal provides free and open access to processed satellite data that enables monitoring of land and water productivity throughout Africa and the Middle East in near real time. Crop Water Productivity is defined as the crop yield per unit of water consumed, expressed in kg/m3. The objective of this thesis is to explore and assess the available datasets provided by WaPOR to improve current water resource management practices in agriculture in the Eastern Nile Basin countries. The study focuses on the quantification of monthly water withdrawals for irrigation purposes, as well as benchmarking physical water productivity of the main irrigated crops within so-called Agro-Ecological Zones of each country. Throughout this study, crop water productivity is assessed and defined as the amount of agricultural yield that can be attained per unit of water that was allocated for its production, expressed in kg/m3. Data analysis and modeling are the major tools applied to assess spatial variation of water withdrawals and water productivity and subsequently to explain the results. The results are both the quantification of monthly water withdrawals for irrigation purposes, as well as benchmarking crop water productivity of the main irrigated crops within of the countries of the case study: Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia. <br/><br/>Irrigation is considered the largest water-consuming sector in the world and has great potential to become more water-efficient. Rain-fed agriculture, however, does not influence the water balance within a catchment and can thus not improve its water efficiency. Separating irrigated agriculture from rain-fed agriculture can be done by splitting the total evaporation in so-called green and blue water evaporation. Evaporation from green water is the part of the actual evaporation that is derived from rainfall that infiltrated into the soil, while evaporation from blue water is due to the use of human-made infrastructure such as pumps, with the purpose of irrigation. With blue water evaporation, the total water consumption [m3] that was used for irrigation can subsequently be calculated. This can be used to then calculate the water productivity, but also provides insight into the current water management practices of a country. The principle of the Budyko Curve has been applied to obtain blue water evaporation (Budyko, 1974), in compliance with the Water Accounting Plus procedure that was developed at IHE Delft by Wim Bastiaanssen et al. (Bastiaanssen, W.G.M., Coerver, 2017). Finally, water consumption was obtained by multiplying the pixel size with the sum of the monthly blue evaporation. The outcome of these calculations provides a water consumption expressed in m3/month.<br/><br/>Water productivity is calculated by dividing agricultural yield [kg] by the amount of water that was consumed for its production [m3]. Agricultural yield was obtained by multiplying above ground biomass production (AGBP) with a crop harvest index according to the crop that was identified with the phenology data. To determine the specific growing season of a pixel, so-called “Start Of Season” (SOS) and “End OF Season” (EOS) phenology data are combined. By comparing the growing season of the pixel with literature from the FAO crop calendar, the crop type could be determined. The total water consumption between the SOS and EOS dekad numbers is summed to provide the total water consumption during the growing season of the crop. This way Crop Water Productivity is eventually obtained.<br/><br/>Throughout this thesis, the assumption was made that crops could be distinguished and recognized, based on the available phenology data. Considering the fact that a ‘no season’ label is applied when no growing season can be distinguished, agricultural cropland was thought to be identified through this method. However, from the fact that reasonable results complying with the literature are found with the use of the FAO LCC Land Cover Map, it follows that the identification of crops through phenology and blue evaporation data does not provide accurate results. This is especially the case for Ethiopia and to a lesser extent Sudan, likely due to the fact that Egypt has hardly any rainfall and therefore consists almost solely of irrigated agriculture. Similarly, ground truthing should therefore be done regarding crop identification and the presence of irrigation per pixel.<br/><br/>Calculating water withdrawals gave a promising outcome for Egypt, as the calculated water withdrawals were almost similar to the water withdrawals stated by AQUASTAT. However, numbers differed by a factor 10 for both Sudan and Ethiopia. When the FAO WaPOR LCC mask is applied, better results are achieved. The calculated water withdrawals for Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia are lower than FAO AQUASTAT’s numbers. It should, however, be noted that FAO AQUASTAT’s numbers are based on the required water withdrawals, while WaPOR calculates the effective water withdrawals. Lower values could imply low efficiencies of the irrigation systems, which is not uncommon for all three countries. With a typical irrigation efficiency of 60 to 70% (Howell, 2003), the total amount of water withdrawals can be computed with Q_irrigation/0.65 (Kwast et al., 2016). When this is taken into consideration, the results seem promising.<br/><br/>Overlapping phenologies of crops and the indistinct connection with the above ground biomass data are factors that caused unreliable results for the calculation of crop water productivity. The high CWP values that were found in Ethiopia are high compared to the reasonable values found in Egypt and Sudan. This could possibly be due to the fact that the pixels are wrongly identified as irrigated pixels. After all, CWP was assessed for all pixels that contain blue evaporation and was not masked with the FAO WaPOR LCC mask. It is therefore recommended to use an accurate land use mask when CWP is assessed.","Water Productivity; Remote Sensing; WaPOR; Google Earth Engine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

This thesis provides a comprehensive investigation on LS-DYNA modeling and design optimization of composite square tubes for crashworthiness. The objective of this thesis is to construct a optimization framework specialized for the preliminary design of composite structures with a balance of performance and efficiency. Three primary components are involved: firstly, coupon-level simulations in LS-DYNA are performed to characterize the material properties for carbon/epoxy composite material IM7/8552; secondly, a square tube is modeled by a single-layer approach in three mainstream material cards (MAT-54, MAT-58 and MAT-262) with calibrated parameters for crush simulation in LS-DYNA. Meanwhile, detailed sensitivity analysis of influential parameters in different material models is also be performed to have a more comprehensive understanding of the complex failure mechanism. The simulation results indicate good correlation to the experiments in terms of energy absorption and maximum peak load, with high computational efficiency and low-cost calibration. Lastly, a two-stage single-objective optimization is performed, which incorporates the fiber orientation for each layer as design variables and design/manufacturing rules as constraints. Two surrogate models are created to formulate the mapping between input design variables and output crashworthiness metrics, including Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) ensemble. Followed by Mix-Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (MDPSO) algorithm, the optimal set of design variables are obtained for each surrogate model. The first-stage optimization results demonstrate significant improvement in the crashworthiness performance compared with the baseline value, while the second-stage optimization results indicate an excellent transferability of the proposed optimization framework. This applicable, transferable, and data-driven optimization framework can be used in the aerospace industry regarding the crashworthy design and optimization of composite structures.","Optimization; Crashworthiness; Surrogate models; LS-DYNA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","51.9900, 4.3754"

Panicking is not an option and you need to be fully focused on completing a crucial task. There is no option to leave this precarious situation and your contribution is vital to the success of a multi-million dollar project. Sounds frightening, right? Oddly enough, it’s a common event during offshore topside installations at Heerema Marine Contractors. During these kind of operations a rigger foremen and an assistant superintendent take place on the jacket. With the role to communicate topside positioning information to the superintendent, on the crane vessel. They have to provide clear instructions until the installation is completed. Although the installation of offshore topsides have always been carried out with people on the jacket, without any major incident to date, having people operating under suspended loads of up to 10,000 tonnes is considered unwanted. Therefore, HMC is looking for a robust system to replace the presence of people on a jacket during topside installations. Existing techniques developed by HMC consist of robotic total stations and the use of augmented reality. However, these techniques are limited by the view from the stern of an SSCV.<br/>In this thesis, a novel motion tracking algorithm is developed based on drones, fixed cameras and visual object tracking. Drones are already starting to change how businesses operate – and this is happening today. Companies across industries are using them for inspection, monitoring, repair work and onsite security. They are also being used for real-time data collection. Drones are able to take any position with respect to the topside or jacket and can mimic the view from people on the jacket. They are therefore not limited by the view from the SSCV. The developed algorithm is able to localise a pair of Aruco markers in an image captured by the vision system. Aruco was only recently introduced which makes this solution unique in the offshore sector. If a marker pair is recognized successfully, relative distance calculations can be made. By conveniently placing these markers on the topside stabbing cones and jacket legs, the topside relative motions can be estimated. A minimum of two locations need to be monitored in order to perform a successful estimation. <br/>Two configurations have been proposed to test the algorithm. In the first configuration use is made of four fixed cameras on the stern of the SSCV. The four fixed cameras will need to track the marker pairs. Also one drone is available to provide visual confirmation from every desired position. In this configuration, the stabbing cones which are closest to the SSCV are monitored. In the second configuration three drones and one fixed camera on the stern of the SSCV are used. In this configuration the drones are used to track the marker pairs. Unlike configuration 1, the stabbing cones diagonally opposite to each other are monitored. Both configurations are able to provide relative positioning information during a topside installation. The first configuration is limited by the view from the SSCV while the latter configuration is not - since drones are used. <br/>The motion tracking algorithm was tested in a virtual simulation experiment. Experimental 3-DOF results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method compared with the simulation log of the virtual environment. For configuration 1 the mean absolute error was found to be 0.048m with a standard deviation of 0.040m. For configuration 2 the mean absolute error was found to be 0.034m with a standard deviation of 0.020m. Both configurations are therefore within the 0.15m acceptable error margin. It can be concluded that the configuration using drones seems to perform better than fixed cameras from the stern of the SSCV. An obstacle of using drones for this purpose is the need of certified operators and the limited power supply. Autonomous drones can be a solution for the first obstacle. The second obstacle might be tackled in the future with the continuous battery improvements fostered by the automotive and electronic consumer goods industry. Nevertheless, the motion tracking algorithm using Aruco markers looks very promising. Taking into account the steep developments of drones over the past year, the future use of drones during offshore topside installations looks promising.","Heerema Marine Contractors; Unmanned Topside Installation; Aruco; Computer Vision; Object Tracking; Python; OpenCV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Proper functionality of DRG stimulation strongly depends on electrode placement, and conventional pre-curved introduction shafts limit DRG coverage of the implanted electrode lead. The goal of this thesis is to design an introduction shaft with a steerable tip in one direction to decrease the minimum radius of curvature and increase the angle of curvature of the implanted electrode leads around DRGs. The steerable tip design consists of clamped stainless-steel rings on a nitinol rod and an internal braided stainless-steel pulling cable attached to the distal ring to bend the tip. A handle provides minimum radius of curvature adjustment for different DRG sizes, and combined shaft translation and tip bending for circular motion around the DRG. A scale-up prototype was manufactured, and the tip had an outer diameter of 2.40 mm and a length of 20.00 mm. A tip bending fatigue test was performed, during which the steerable tip showed no plastic deformation. The steerability of the tip was tested in gelatin and resulted in a DRG circumference coverage of 51.4% ± 1.1% compared to a 25% potential coverage of conventional introduction shafts. The minimum radius of curvature was adjustable between 42 ± 14 mm and 6 ± 1 mm. An electrode lead was successfully implanted in an artificial environment that mimicked a section of the spine. In the future, the outer diameter of the prototype tip should be decreased to reach the required size for the procedure (1.60 mm), and the handle should contain a mechanism to increase shaft translation relative to the tip bending in order to improve circular motion of the steerable tip.","steerable needles; Implantation; Minimally invasive surgery; Electrode array","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

During this research an answer to the question ""What is the effect of elaborated feedback versus minimal feedback given by a humanoid robot (NAO), on a primary school student solving basic math problems?"". Also, two hypothesis are tested: ""Feedback provided by NAO will improve the student math test results."" and ""Feedback improved the affection of the student towards NAO."". We find that lacing and split and add are the most used calculation strategies, and NAO also aims to identify commonly made mistakes such as switching units in bigger number or confusion about symbols or strategies.<br/>An important element of this research is feedback, which concerns information about how we perform in efforts to reach goals. It requires information about the goal, the followed track and the next steps. Feedback seems to be most effective when it is self-regulated and intended for process. Children need tangible and timely feedback, not too early (to prevent overwhelming the student) and not too late. Giving feedback on the result as well as on the track, challenging students and defining a clear road to success are crucial in helping the student succeed.<br/>In this research, NAO will provide this feedback and thereby should help the student succeed in solving math problems.<br/>Two scenarios are designed: an introductory class, to let students touch, feel and experiment with NAO, and a math tutoring session, which will be used during the experiment. We conduct an experiment, testing a feedback group versus a control group, where the feedback group is able to get feedback twice (elaborated feedback), and the control group only hears whether the answer given was wrong or correct. The elaborated feedback consists of detecting a mistake made by the student, and adapt the feedback according to the given answer. After a second try and incorrect answer, the process to the correct answer is explained to the student. Students had to fill in a PANAS form in order to measure affection towards NAO during the sessions. No significant results were found in both the math test and the PANAS scores.<br/>We did however find that students learned to work with NAO very quickly, interaction was robust, although speech recognition needs some improvement.<br/>Interesting to see was that we found contradictions when we compared the qualitative analysis with the quantitative analysis. Statistical analysis showed that there was no significant growth in the skills of a student, but all students mentioned that they felt that they did learn from the session with NAO. Future work could involve conducting the experiment for a longer period of time, to see a better lasting effect of the feedback given. Other work could be done in distinguishing groups according to their level of math, to see if students with a low grade in math have a higher profit from NAO's influence. Also, combining mistakes could lead to more mistakes that can be detected, and thus feedback could be more efficient.","Feedback; Math; Primary school; Adaptive; Tutor; NAO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

This certification process relies on validated flutter computations which have to be made for all flight conditions including variations in the aircraft's loading and failure cases. The aerodynamic component of these unsteady aeroelastic simulations is restricted to fast computational methods due to the large parameter space. Linear, inviscid models were the industry standard for this application. They had to be corrected by wind-tunnel or CFD data to cover transonic flow phenomena. Recently, high-fidelity aerodynamic models have been introduced which, in contrast to the previous methods, have an inherent quality to represent the important transonic flow phenomena for all flight conditions. However, the significant computational cost of these models restricts the computation of unsteady aerodynamics to a limited set of reference elastic modes. These unsteady aerodynamic reference results are subsequently mapped to all 'production' flutter computations with a least-squares method. This thesis report presents an investigation on the possibility of accuracy or robustness improvements in the implementation of this new, high-fidelity direct-CFD method in unsteady aeroelastic simulations. An error estimation study quantified the impact of approximation errors of the least-squares method on the frequency and damping curves of the 'production' computational case. Modal basis quality criteria are established and their performance is compared for a test case. In contrast to the proposed hypothesis, global mode assurance criteria are sufficient to predict the errors. Local or aerodynamically weighted quality criteria show similar performance and can therefore be considered redundant for the presented test case. In case of a non-satisfactory reference set, the modal basis can be enriched automatically and effectively in order to eliminate the approximation error. Additionally, a performance study of two reference selection methods on four computational test cases has been conducted. The application of the elastic modes of a nominal structural lay-out as reference is satisfactory for nominal structure flutter computations at different load distributions and for failure case simulations without strongly deviating mode shapes. However, this reference selection method can be insufficient regarding the approximation error for critical failure cases with strongly deviating mode shapes with respect to the nominal structure modes. Yet, for all test cases the error estimators are able to predict this approximation error, such that they can be eliminated by modal basis enrichment. On the other hand, a new method is proposed which uses the POD (Proper Orthogonal Decomposition) theory to decompose a wide range of modes for different failure and load cases into a reference set. This method performed satisfactory for all test cases, without any enrichment necessity. The prerequisite for a good performance of this reference selection method is a well-considered selection of the POD setup and the presence of the considered failure cases in the POD input.","Aeroelasticity; Flutter; Direct-CFD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-02-28","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

One of these uncertainties concerns the sediment plumes created by the mining operation. The return slurry released above the sea floor creates a large plume of sediments. With numerical models the behavior of such plumes is modelled in order to minimize these uncertainties. Particle size distributions in these plume models are currently based on individual particle sizes. In situ, at the bottom of the ocean in an salt water environment, flocculation can occur. Flocculation can have effects on the particle size distribution, settling rates and floc structure. The objective of this research is to investigate the significance of flocculation on the settling behavior and if it should be taken into account in these plume models. Shear rate and particle concentration, as function of time, are the most governing processes that have effect on the flocculation behavior. The influence of these parameters on the flocculation process are investigated. Different methods are used in the search for a suitable technique to measure the in situ particle size distribution. Next to the particle size distribution the floc shapes, structure and settling rates are measured under the influence of the factors mentioned above. In the shear range of 6 s-1 and particle concentration of 0.7 to 40 g/l flocculation does occur and has a large impact on the settling behavior of the sediment. Flocculation at other shear rates and particle concentrations remain unknown. Figure \ref{fig:vol_dem_salt_floccu1} shows the time until 100 $\%$ of the mass is settled when the suspension is released at a height of 10 m.

It assists in identifying, assessing and mitigating the uncertainties that are present in a project. These uncertainties affect important measures of a project, of which cost and schedule are the most prominent, and consequently put project success under pressure. Risk analysis, especially in its quantitative form, is a core process of risk management that provides valuable insights regarding these uncertainties. Numerous different procedures for quantitative risk analysis exist, but generally, they can be classified in two types based on the way they treat the cost and schedule components of a project. In the Separated Approach two risk analyses are performed, one for schedule and one for cost, which are independent of each other. In the Integrated Approach one risk analysis is performed, where schedule and cost components are simultaneously analyzed, and are no longer independent of each other. The advantages and disadvantages for each approach are well described in literature. However, there is little empirical evidence of the performance of different approaches when they are applied on real projects. This research tries to fill this gap by comparing the outcomes of different approaches when they are implemented on a real project, against the actual outcomes of the project to get an indication of their relative performance. Particularly, the Proposed Separate Approach, the Proposed Integrated Approach and the Company’s Separated Approach are applied on a completed project and their outcomes regarding cost and schedule contingency are compared to each other and to the actual project outcomes. Based on this comparison, a conclusion is drawn, and an answer is given on which approach is more accurate. Regarding cost contingency estimate, the Proposed Integrated Approach was the more accurate, while for schedule contingency estimate, the Company’s Separated Approach was the most accurate. A similar research should be conducted on a large number of projects to be able to generalize this conclusion though.","Risk analysis; Monte Carlo simulation; Contingency; Cost Estimation; Schedule risk analysis; Probabilisitic analysis; Project risk management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-02-25","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

It is therefore essential for the transition towards more autonomy that USVs are able to obey the regulations as well and clearly exhibit the right behavior to enable other ships to anticipate the behavior of USVs and reactappropriately and timely. In maritime navigation, ships have to obey the International Regulations for preventing collisions at sea, also known as COLREGS (COLlision REGulationS). This thesis is focused on the guidance of USVs, and is specifically aimed at COLREGS compliant path re-planning to avoid potential collisions. A first method has been conceived based upon the SaturatedFast Marching Square method where trailing points are used to correctly guide the USV past dynamic vessels according to COLREGS. A second novel method builds upon the previous one, by combining the Saturated Fast Marching Square method with a path generating Genetic Algorithm. The first methodperforms as supposed in simple environments such as when encountering a single dynamic obstacle. However, the first method starts to under-perform as complexity increases through the presence of both static and dynamic obstacles. The additional second method performs accurately in complex scenariosas well. Both methods have been tested in single case simulations and in extensive random simulations to assess their COLREGS compliant path re-planning accuracy.","Fast Marching Method; Genetic Algorithm; USV; Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle; Path Planning; COLREGS; GA; waypoints; Saturated Fast Marching Square; Pure Pursuit Controller","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Jarquin Laguna, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","In the last century, the offshore industry has installed a network of offshore pipelines in the southern North Sea. Due to decreasing oil and gas extraction in the North Sea, many pipelines of this network are becoming redundant. A potential option for the reuse of these pipelines is the transport and storage of gaseous hydrogen, which is increasingly considered as an attractive energy carrier for a fossil fuel free economy. A Shell study has shown that offshore hydrogen production located at a renewable energy source, such as an offshore wind park, can economically compete with onshore hydrogen production that uses power cables to transport the energy to shore. The offshore hydrogen production case is based on newly built pipelines. If it is technically feasible to use existing pipelines, this can contribute to making the offshore hydrogen production case more attractive.<br/>A transition from hydrocarbon transport to hydrogen transport through existing carbon steel gas pipelines changes the material behaviour of the pipeline, including a change in fatigue behaviour. Fatigue damage due to Vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) in offshore pipeline parts that are suspended above the seabed is a major challenge for oil and gas transportation in the southern North Sea. Therefore, it is of great importance to understand the change in fatigue behaviour due to the presence of gaseous hydrogen to assess the technical feasibility of hydrogen transport through the existing offshore pipelines.<br/>A fatigue analysis for a specified existing gas pipeline of the NAM in the southern North Sea has been done according to DNV Free Spanning Assessment Methodology. For this analysis, the fatigue SN-curve for carbon steel material in a hydrogen environment is required. The SN-curve is approached based on available fatigue data for carbon steel material in hydrogen and severe sour environments. It shows that hydrogen has a significant influence on the fatigue behaviour of carbon steel material. The fatigue analysis outcomes show that adjustments to the pipeline are needed to avoid a significant increase in the risk of fatigue failure in critical pipeline sections. A remediation analysis has shown that rock dumping comes out as the cheapest option.<br/>An existing time-domain numerical model that can determine the dynamic behaviour of a pipeline due to VIV is extended to perform fatigue damage calculations. The pipeline is modelled as a Euler-Bernoulli beam using the Finite Element Method. The model determines the VIV with a modal analysis in time-domain, which allows the model to include non-linear soil behaviour. The fatigue damage is determined for each pipeline element, which gives the fatigue damage distribution over the length of the pipeline. The time-domain numerical model is compared with the DNV Free Spanning Assessment Methodology and gives significantly higher fatigue lives. This suggests that the methodology that is used for the fatigue analysis is too conservative. However, there is still uncertainty about the influence of parameters predicting VIV. Further calibration of the model is required to ensure that the model outcomes correspond with target failure probabilities regarding industry standards.<br/>The general conclusion of this research is that the specified existing offshore gas pipeline of the NAM is technically suitable for the transport of hydrogen if the adjustments are conducted. Compared to newly built pipelines, hydrogen transport through existing pipelines is an attractive option due to relatively low adjustments costs.","VIV; Vortex-induced vibrations; Hydrogen transport; Pipeline; Subsea; spans; Fatigue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-02-25","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","Bottom Founded Structures",""

Numerous researches have acknowledged the importance of the bonding strength, but only a few have actually examined its mechanical properties of the bonds. <br/>A distinction between the interlayer and intralayer bonds is made. The former indicates the bonds between vertically stacked layers, while the latter is related to the coalescence between filament within one lamina. This report assesses the relevance of the intralayer bonding strength for extrusion-based additive manufacturing by the large-scale printers of company Aectual. Firstly, the complete fabrication process and the relevant parameters for the construction of 3D printed object are elaborated. Based on the layered structure of prints and regarding the desired geometries, the<br/>additively manufactured products are linked to Unidirectional Fibre Reinforced Composites. Subsequently, the international standards of the ISO and the ASTM are consulted for the design of the test specimens for the estimation of the material properties of interest, namely the tensile and<br/>flexural test for general understanding of the mechanical behaviour of the material and a test method for the Interlaminar Fracture Toughness to evaluate the intralayer bond strength.<br/>As the preliminary have shown promising result, the print geometry and the printing settings are optimised to achieve a high print quality and reliable test result as uniform as possible. The results of the flexural and tensile test indicated that this optimisation have proven to be successful. Despite the high number of test specimen, the interlaminar fracture toughness of the intralayer bond is not quantified. The post-processing of the insert relevant for delamination affected the crack front and reduced the probability of deformation. Nevertheless, almost 30% of the samples have delaminated<br/>and have confirmed the dependability of the bonding strength on the height of the print and the printed pattern. Moreover, the print orientation appears to be of significant relevance.

To date, there is no accurate method to reproduce either experimentally or numerically the physics in re-entry conditions. On the numerical side, high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods have potential to improve results achieved with state-of-the-art finite volume methods. However, they suffer from Gibbs-type oscillations around discontinuities such as shocks. This work uses artificial viscosity to tackle this issue.<br/>The artificial viscosity method used in this work contains three user-defined parameters which specify the magnitude, location and width of the artificial viscosity. A parametric study of these parameters on a steady inviscid wedge test case at Mach 2 showed that tuning their values is a non-trivial task and it appeared that in some cases shock smoothness and shock thickness need to be traded-off. Furthermore, it was observed that sufficient refinement in mesh size or polynomial order was needed to obtain satisfying results. The Sod test case was considered to test the method in an unsteady inviscid case. Good results were obtained, although the shock was better resolved than the contact discontinuity. The method was also tested on another unsteady inviscid test case, the Shu-Osher problem. The latter is more challenging due to the shock strength varying in time. Specifying the artificial viscosity parameters was challenging since the set had to account for variation of the shock strength in time. The test case also highlighted the need for a method that keeps variables within their physical bounds.<br/>Prediction of the heat flux on the surface of a half-cylinder in a hypersonic flow was attempted. However, this was unsuccessful and the Mach number was eventually reduced to 3.25. Strong non-physical oscillations appeared in the heat flux profile even with smooth contour plots and pressure profile at the surface of the half-cylinder. The key to obtain a smooth heat flux profile was to ensure no artificial viscosity at all is inserted in the boundary layer. Also, a symmetric mesh was needed to obtain a symmetric profile. Overall, the heat flux results showed that it is possible to simulate this challenging test case with discontinuous Galerkin and a combination of simple methods, including the Lax-Friedrichs flux and a basic smoothing of the artificial viscosity field.<br/>A new strategy to tune the user-defined parameter specifying the location of the artificial viscosity was implemented and tested on the Shu-Osher and half-cylinder test cases. It was found to be greatly beneficial in terms of stability and user-friendliness, but did not fully eliminate the issues in simulating these challenging test cases. This strategy allowed to run the half-cylinder test case beyond the Lax-Friedrichs flux and a polynomial order of 1. The heat flux profile with SLAU came very close to that with Lax-Friedrichs, whereas the difference was significant between first and second orders.","artificial viscosity; shock capturing; discontinuous Galerkin; supersonic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

It offers a good strength-weight relation, a long-term durability and slender bridge shapes. Slenderness has effect on dynamic behaviour of the construction and vibrations are common for these bridges. Hand calculations are commonly used for the forecast of the dynamic behaviour, but this approach is not very accurate. Royal Haskoning DHV felt the need for a numerical model to be able to forecast the dynamic behaviour of pedestrian bridges of which accelerations, natural frequency and damping ratio are the most important. This thesis aims to fulfil this need. During a literature study relevant calculation methods were found and offered a better insight in the behaviour of bridges and the properties of FRP. FiberCore, manufacturer of FRP bridges, provided information of 15 different bridges all over the Netherlands. These bridges were all examined and vibrations were measured in the field. It was possible to bring 7 of these bridges in vibration using two test methods. To be able to measure accelerations and natural frequency mobile applications were validated in a case study in Puurs Belgium with the University of Leuven. A numerical model has been built for one specific bridge with a finite element method in SOFiSTiK and validated with the information provided by FiberCore. Furthermore, a dynamic load simulating a person walking over the bridge was designed. After having validated the model calculations were made to determine the natural frequency and the accelerations of this bridge as well without as with handrails. The results were compared with hand calculation according to the calculation method of the Joint Research Centre (JRC). Significant differences between the results of the model calculation and the JRC method were found and analysed. The main conclusions of the thesis are regarding the damping factor and the results from the numerical model. The damping factor of 1.4% to 5.4% is measured for 8 FRP bridges spanning 10-25m. The assumption of 1% damping, which is often used in design verifications in engineering practice is conservative. The maximum acceleration from the numerical model, 1.22 m/s2, is higher than the 0.43 m/s2 calculated from the SDOF method from the JRC, which is used in design verifications in engineering practice. The psi factor is a very dominant reduction in the latter calculation. The author concludes with some recommendations for further research.","FRP; Dynamics; Pedestrians; pedestrian bridge; Sofistik; Numerical modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

It is expected that Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models will still be useful with the further development of the more accurate, but computationally expensive large eddy simulation (LES), especially in industry. The use of the robust but often inaccurate linear eddy viscosity closures is still widespread in industry. More complex closure models, such as Reynolds stress models and nonlinear eddy viscosity models, provide a more general description of the underlying physics of turbulent flows. Nevertheless, because of implementational difficulties or failure to provide consistent improvements over the more robust linear models, RANS turbulence modeling is considered to have reached a plateau. In the past few years, the availability of high-fidelity datasets, the increased accuracy of machine learning algorithms, and the rise in computational power led to the proposal of several data-driven approaches to turbulence modeling. The general idea is to use experimental and high-fidelity data to develop or enhance RANS turbulence models, instead of employing an approach purely based on physics. As in any emerging field, there are many possibilities for further developing the novel approaches to data-driven turbulence modeling. Recent work combined machine learning with statistical inversion. First, a spatially varying correction is applied to the RANS model and optimized by minimizing the discrepancy between the RANS output and the data for several flows. Machine learning is used to approximate a function between a set of flow features and the inferred corrections. The aim of this work is to further investigate this methodology, called the paradigm of field inversion and machine learning, in a broader set of test cases by inferring a spatially varying correction to the production term of the ω-equation in the k−ω model and to the eigenvalues of the Reynolds stress tensor. The gradients of this high-dimensional optimization process are obtained by implementing the continuous adjoint of the k−ω model in OpenFOAM. Gaussian processes and random forests are then used to approximate a function between mean flow features and the inferred corrections. It was found that both formulations are able to accurately infer the mean velocities and related quantities of interest, but that the inferred corrective terms are often non-unique or not physically interpretable. For several flow cases, the corrective terms were able to generalize to unseen Reynolds number and flow geometries.","adjoint; machine learning; field inversion; Gaussian process; random forests; turbulence modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Shallow locations are more occupied and a tendency to deeper water and to larger wind turbines is seen. These create more bending moment which can be more easily resisted by jacket substructures. The state of the art installation process of a jacket is as follows. The foundation piles are driven into the seabed. The jacket leg is installed by sticking a stabbing cone into the stick-up length of the foundation pile and fill the space between the cone and the pile with grout. In this situation a lot of grout, steel and installation time are used. An alternative connection could be a wedge connection which is considered in this thesis. A wedge connection consists of four parts: jacket leg, connector element, wedges and foundation pile. The challenge to apply this connection to jackets is to overcome the installation tolerances. Due to the inaccuracy of the driving of the foundation piles, the holes in the jacket legs and the foundation piles do not align and the wedges cannot be installed. The installation tolerances consist mainly of center-to-center distance, pile verticality and a vertical tolerance. The maximum translational tolerances are 75 millimeter while the maximum rotational tolerance is maximum 0.83 degrees. 23 different concepts have been developed to deal with the installation tolerances. All the concepts have some drawbacks and do not fully solve the problem without downsides. The magnitude of the installation tolerances is therefore reduced and from a multi-criteria analysis a screw thread connection is proposed. The advantages of the screw thread connection are: a reduced amount of material, no grout is required and the installation time of the jacket to foundation pile connection can be reduced up to 75 percent. The screw thread connection overcomes the vertical tolerance and the tolerance around the longitudinal axis of the foundation pile by rotation of the connector element. In case of an pile inclination, the connector element and the foundation pile do not fully align and a gap remains in between them. By applying a preloading force to the connection it is still not possible to close this gap. The space between the connector element and the foundation pile has to be filled with an epoxy resin. The screw thread connection does fulfill the requirements for the ultimate limit state based upon hand calculations for net stresses, bending stresses and contact stresses. The fatigue limit state of the wedge connection meets the requirements. Only the fatigue limit state of the screw thread does not fulfill the requirements based upon a hand calculation. The three largest issues of the screw thread connection are the fabrication of the screw thread profile, the fatigue in the screw thread and the installation of the epoxy resin between the connector and the foundation pile. The first step to develop the screw thread connection further is an more extensive investigation to these three issues.","Jacket structure; Wedge connection; offshore","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-02-22","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The replacement of solid airfoil trailing edges with permeable materials proved to be an adequate noise reduction mean in previous studies. This thesis project contributes to the development of innovative permeable materials by assessing the feasibility of actively influencing their noise mitigation characteristics. The proposed activation mechanism consists of heating up a polymerically coated, porous trailing edge and thereby influencing the material geometry and seepage fluid properties. Heating of the polymeric coating layer led to slightly decreasing pore diameters due to thermal expansion. The main limitation of actively changing the porous material geometry on a pore-scale level was the restriction of the coating layer thickness. Heating effects on the seepage flow through porous metal foams were analyzed experimentally. Characteristic material parameters, namely flow resistivity, permeability and form coefficient, were measured for varying fluid temperatures and it was shown that for low seepage velocities, the pressure communication across the material was negatively affected upon heating. The feasibility of actively changing far-field noise characteristics was demonstrated based on acoustic measurements in an anechoic wind tunnel. Increasing sound pressure levels were observed for both, coated and uncoated porous trailing edges upon heating. It is concluded that the dominant activation effect was the reduced communication across the porous trailing edge due to an increase in fluid temperature. The expansion of polymeric coating was not sufficient to alter the noise mitigation behavior of the porous trailing edge. Furthermore, no interactions between turbulent boundary layer wall pressure fluctuations and the soft coating layer were observed. However, it was shown that temperature control of the porous material offers a possibility to actively influence flow resistivity without modifying the geometrical structure.","porous material; trailing edge noise; polymeric coating; airfoil self-noise; trailing edge heating; aeroacoustic; permeable material","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Anaerobic digestion is a widely accepted stabilisation method for waste activated sludge (WAS) treatment. However, the application of anaerobic digestion is limited by the long retention time and low degradation efficiency of compounds. Structural extra cellular polymeric substances (EPS) are metabolic products released by microorganisms that play an important role in the disintegration of sludge structure. The limitations in anaerobic digestion mentioned above pertain to the hydrolysis step in anaerobic digestion. The cascade reactor (cascade AD) system i.e. continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) in series, is a robust reactor system that is expected to enhance the hydrolysis step and to show a superior performance at low solid retention time compared to a conventional CSTR. <br/>This research is aimed at observing the difference in performance of cascade AD and a conventional CSTR at shortened retention time. Various indicators were used to understand the performance enhancement of a cascade AD in comparison to a conventional CSTR. Moreover, the degradation of structural EPS by selected enzyme groups such as protease, cellulase and polygalacturonase were also studied. <br/>The cascade AD showed better performance than a conventional CSTR at a retention time of 22 and 15 days. This improved performance was enabled by the smaller reactors in cascade AD that provided higher hydrolysis rate. Higher removal efficiency of protein, carbohydrate and structural EPS was observed in cascade AD. Improved ammonium and phosphate release were also indications of better performance of cascade AD. Although the mass balance in nitrogen was maintained in the reactor system, phosphorous mass balance indicated possibilities of precipitation. <br/>The batch tests performed with the enzyme protease, cellulase and polygalacturonase were aimed at understanding the degradation of SEPS. It was inferred from the test that volatile suspended solids proved to be a better indicator for solubilisation compared to COD and ammonium concentration. Protease showed higher solubilisation compared to cellulase and polygalacturonase. Particle size distribution did not indicate a significant difference upon the addition of all three enzyme groups; indicating that a significant change in structure was not caused by the enzymes. Hydrolysis kinetics and SEPS degradation could not be derived from the test because of the variations in results based on the substrates used. Nevertheless, the tests proved to be useful in improving methodology for deriving hydrolysis kinetics of WAS. <br/>In conclusion, the novel cascade AD showed better performance at shortened retention time. The system also showed stable performance despite the shortened retention time compared to a conventional CSTR.

However, Thialf is expensive and has a low sailing velocity. To optimize its installation up-time it will stay offshore for the project duration. A feeder system is required to supply it with WTG components, which are readily available at the marshalling yard. The objective of this research is to determine the critical activities in a feeder system for installation of WTGs with an SSCV, and to improve them so Heerema can make a competitive entrance to the WTG installation market.<br/>Turbine manufacturers demand that WTG towers are positioned vertically at all times. A qualitative assessment for all components points to transport and offloading of the turbine towers to be critical activities. A comparative motion response analysis between a barge and a heavy transport vessel (HTV) shows that during transport, both solutions perform well in sea states higher than the intended installation sea state, thus making them suitable for the task. As offloading demands stricter limits than transport, vessel motions for that activity are too severe. The natural frequency of the vessel-tower system increases with each removed turbine, moving into governing wave frequency ranges for North Sea conditions. This phenomenon shows for both vessel types, from which it is concluded that a supply vessel will be selected based on project specific parameters, rather than motion response.<br/>During preliminary developments within Heerema, tipping of the tower when its sea fastening is released and large swinging motions of the tower after lift-off were main problems found during offloading, to which improvements are necessary. Three concept solutions are assessed: one an alteration of the existing, single tower lift solution, two others making use of the SSCV’s cranes with high capacity by respectively lifting a frame with 4 towers and two frames with 8 towers. For each concept, response limits are defined at relevant locations in the system. In-house software is used to determine the RAOs, from which the heading with the highest operability is computed. The offloading and installation activity sequence for wind farms of 48 and 96 turbines are defined, followed by a weather downtime assessment. <br/>First simulations show waiting on weather (WoW) is governed by crew transfer from a crew supply vessel to the barge for mooring operations. This can be improved by using a crew basket, motion compensated gangway or HTV. Simulations with revised limits show that using a frame with 4 towers results in significantly lower WoW days and shortest net project times, making it the most promising concept. Shorter lifting exposure and reducing motion amplification by means of a low frequency system are drivers for the decrease in weather downtime. With a lower total project duration, costs are reduced substantially.","Offshore Heavy Lifting; Offshore Wind Turbine; Logistic Supply Chain; Weather Down Time; Concept Design; SSCV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-02-12","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

When capacity is reached, traffic jams and accidents are more likely to occur. By raising the efficiency of traffic, the capacity of roads can benefit without the need to expand infrastructure. Automating longitudinal controls of vehicles and creating vehicle platoons show potential to raise traffic efficiency. A platoon consists of multiple vehicles travelling closely behind each other. Automating the longitudinal controls shows promise to decrease distances between these vehicles, while maintaining safety and raising traffic throughput. This smaller distance is below that of conventional human control, thus improving traffic density. Most modern cars already have the option of being equipped with longitudinal control. The most advanced being Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) which can either hold a predefined velocity or adapt that velocity to maintain distance to a preceding vehicle. However, due to the limitation of using only on-board sensors, these systems do not guarantee safety or increase traffic throughput. Research is being done on expanding ACC with Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication creating Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC). The addition of communication provides more precise data of neighbouring vehicles than conventional on-board sensing can provide and allows for vehicles to communicate intent. Optimization control for CACC systems has been researched, but it rarely incorporates passengers comfort or the future intent of the preceding vehicles. The goal of this thesis is to implement a decentralized optimization algorithm on a real-time simulated platoon of three vehicles, which takes into consideration safety, propagation of errors through the platoon, and comfort. These three aspects are subsequently implemented and evaluated on a real-time simulation platform in a distributed fashion.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

In response to this, research campaigns have been conducted, with the aim of developing new technologies. One of these technologies is the application of hydrofoils (e.g.: a Hull Vane) to marine vehicles. Although these allow a significant increase in efficiency, challenges and concerns rise due to their influence on seakeeping and manoeuvring performance. As a starting point, for a better understanding of the impact of hydrofoils on the dynamic behaviour of vessels, this research was focused on the: “Development of knowledge, methodologies and tools to perform manoeuvring predictions of vessels equipped with a Hull Vane.” For this, Virtual Captive Tests (VCT) were combined with a 4 DOF manoeuvring model, to perform manoeuvring predictions of vessels equipped with a Hull Vane. The convergence of the CFD solutions, for VCT, proved to be a challenging task with a lot of room for improvement. This is caused by the presence of complex flow features, e.g.: fore and aft-body vortices. In the end, an Adaptive Grid Refinement (AGR) algorithm, allowed an equilibrium between computational cost and discretization uncertainties. <br/>Two types of VCT were performed and compared: Oblique Towing Tests (OTT) and Planar Motion Mechanism (PMM) tests. Due to the strong non-linear nature of hydrodynamic forces and moments, a Discrete Spectral Method was developed for the analysis of the PMM tests. On one hand, PMM tests represent an advantage in the determination of unsteady forces/moments compared to semi-empirical models. On the other hand, virtual PMM tests are more complex and more vulnerable to sources of errors, e.g.: flow memory effects and higher numerical residuals. At last, this research showed that the gain in accuracy in the determination of unsteady effects, hardly compensates the loss in accuracy in the determination of steady effects. Furthermore, it was shown that the uncertainties of captive tests can be amplified by the manoeuvring model, which can significantly penalize the precision of manoeuvring predictions. For the validation of manoeuvring predictions, a 25 m patrol vessel equipped with a Hull Vane (RPA8) was considered, for which experimental data is available. By comparing the results of the manoeuvring prediction with the experimental ones, it was shown that the manoeuvring prediction process over-estimates the course stability. Resulting in 20% (≈20 m) over-estimation of the 35° turning circle diameter and 50% (≈0.4°) under-estimation of the 3°-3° zig-zag overshoot. Regarding the impact of the Hull Vane on the manoeuvring performance, it was concluded that the Hull Vane increases the course stability of RPA8, leading to 7% increase of the 35° turning circle diameter and 18% decrease of 10°-10° zig-zag yaw overshoot. This is the result of a combination between: interaction phenomena, an increase in yaw damping caused by the Hull Vane struts and an increase in Munk moment caused by the change in dynamic trim. Therefore, the extrapolation of these results for other vessels is not trivial, due to the interaction between these effects. With the aim of reducing the cost of manoeuvring assessments, a Linear Pressure Distribution Method (LPDM) was developed, to model the effects of the Hull Vane on manoeuvring. This model was successfully validated, using the results of an integrated approach, i.e.: hydrodynamic coefficients determined using captive tests with the Hull Vane. The results show about 1% (≈1 m) difference in the prediction of the dimensions of a 35° turning circle, and less than 11% (≈0.3°) difference in the prediction of the 10°-10° zig-zag yaw overshoot. Finally, this research provides knowledge, tools and methodologies for a better understanding of the dynamic behaviour of foil-assisted vessels, particularly vessels equipped with a Hull Vane. The results of this research provide a solid foundation for further research in this field.","Computational Fluid Dynamics; Hydrodynamics; Manoeuvring; Virtual Captive Tests; Mathematical Modelling; Hydrofoils; Hull Vane; Verification; Validation; Advanced Marine Vehicles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-04-15","","","","Marine Technology","",""

This product is based on thespectral measurements to obtain the column abundance of NO2 in the troposphere. This product alsorelies on a-priori data and one of  these a-priori datasets is the albedo dataset.The currently used dataset has a resolution of 0.5°x 0.5°, which corresponds to approximately 55 kmx 34 km at mid-latitudes. The TROPOMI pixel size is significantly smaller, 3.5 km x 7 km. Due to this large difference in resolution the discussion arises if this used dataset is sufficient for accurate results. This researchmakes a comparison between the current a-priori dataset and possible replacements.<br/>This paper makes this comparison by calculating Air Mass Factors (AMFs) using the OMI LERalbedo climatology as a reference and the two alternative high resolution surface reflectance datasets,Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8. These surface reflectance datasets were regridded and averaged on the corresponding TROPOMI grid. The focus area of this paper is the Greater Rotterdam region in the Nether-lands.Before these AMF calculations were done, a comparison between Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 surfacereflectance datasets is made. This is done both on their own high resolution and regridded onto theTROPOMI grid. Above water surfaces and land covered by vegetation a bias of approximately 0.01 was present between the two high resolution surface reflectance datasets. These differences are relatively small. The differences calculated for the datasets regridded to the TROPOMI grid were also relatively small, with a bias of 0.01 above the water and vegetation surfaces.<br/>Two cases were studied during this research: the 21st of April 2018 and the 6th/7th of May 2018. Theresults show that significant improvements can be made by using a higher resolution surface reflectancedataset. A median bias of -10.4% (-15.6%) was calculated for the 21st of April for Sentinel-2 (Landsat-8)compared to the AMFs based on the OMI albedo dataset. For May this was -3.9% (-9.3%). Furthermorethis study showed extreme AMF-biases of 68.0% overestimation and 39.8% underestimation by the OMIalbedo dataset compared to Sentinel-2, where the overestimation was observed over the greenhouses inthe Westland region and the underestimation in the rural region to the East of the domain in April.For May the underestimation was mostly observed to the West (North Sea), indicating that over regionswith a low surface reflectance the atmospheric correction greatly influences the AMF. The comparisonbetween Landsat-8 and OMI showed similar results in the AMF differences.These findings are supported further by a recent Sentinel-5P validation study, which comparedground based observations to the TROPOMI observations. This project found an NO2 underestimationof approximately 20% for many different stations. This research suggest that, at least partly, this difference can be explained by the coarse resolution of the a-priori albedo dataset used. <br","TROPOMI; Albedo; Air Mass Factor; Surface Reflectance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Clusters of densely spaced wind turbines, so called wind farms, are being built both on- and offshore. Wind farm installations relatively near to radar systems generate clutter returns that usually affect the normal operation of these radars. Interference caused by wind turbines is more severe for many radar systems than interference caused by stationary objects such as masts or towers. This is due to the rotating blades of the wind turbines. Many Doppler radars use a filter that removes echoes originating from objects with no or little radial velocity. However, these filters do not work for rotating objects such as the rotating blades of wind turbines. Wind turbines located around the line of sight of Doppler radars can cause clutter, blockage, and erroneous velocity measurements, affecting the performance of both military and civilian radar systems. As a result, the unwanted radar return from wind farms, known as Wind Turbine Clutter (WTC), is considered to be dynamic clutter due to the nonzero Doppler return created by rotating wind turbine blades. Nowadays numerous radar systems are developed in order to exploit the diverse information obtained through transmission of waves with different polarizations. This technique is widely known as polarimetry. Many targets of interest exhibit Radar Cross Sections which vary with different transmitted and received polarizations. Wind Turbines also experiences this variability. In this thesis we propose a method to optimal detect the presence of WTC with the use of radar polarimetry. Since the crucial part of this interference comes from the blades rotation, we initially propose a method to estimate the angular velocity of these blades. The estimation of this parameter is derived with the use of proper combination of maximum likelihood estimation theory and radar polarimetry. As there is absence of Micro-Doppler when the radar beam axis and rotation coincide, a separate estimator for this case is pro-posed. In the final part of this thesis, we present a detection approach based on the same signal model used for angular velocity estimation. Again we define a detection rule for the case when radar beam axis and rotation axis coincide and one when they do not. Although at some extent the used model for the second case is valid for low frequencies (f&lt;1 GHz), both estimator and detector derivations can be further applied for higher frequencies signal models. All these mathematical derivations are accompanied with proper simulations.","Radar polarimetry; Estimation; Detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The lack of natural resources and the growing amounts of demolition waste made that the Dutch industries in the early 1980s started to explore the possibilities to use construction debris in road construction. Recently, the application of recycled materials in pavement structures has also found traction in South Africa. Due to differences in pavement design, however, the mechanical and environmental exposure of these materials will be more severe than in the Netherlands. This results in different challenges with respect to (long term) performance and material durability. Understanding the potential durability issues and the way durability affects pavement performance is crucial to successfully implement these materials in South African pavements.<br/>This research, conducted at Stellenbosch University, South Africa, involves laboratory testing to investigate the performance and durability aspects of recycled aggregates. By means of triaxial testing before and after durability simulation, it is aimed to address the extent of potential material breakdown and the influence this has on performance. Tests are conducted on RCA, RCM, MG65 and MG30. The latter two refer to a mixture of RCA and RCM, with a mass percentage RCA of 65% and 35%, respectively. In addition to the recycled materials, a commonly used crushed rock of G2 quality is tested as well to serve as benchmark. Monotonic triaxial tests, to obtain the shear parameters, are performed on all materials except the pure RCM. Permanent deformation triaxial tests, to gain understanding of the long term response to cyclic loading, are performed on RCA and MG65. Specimens are tested under different confinement and deviator stress levels. For the durability simulation, the South African Durability Mill (DMI) is used. The DMI enables durability testing of the full grading under soaked and dry conditions. After the tests, the milled specimens are sieved out to obtain the change in grading.<br/>The most important findings regarding granulate durability include that the breakdown in recycled materials is significant in comparison with the G2. Mainly the largest particle fractions are affected. Furthermore, for these particular resources of recycled granulates, the RCA suffers more breakdown than the RCM. The breakdown in the blends decreases with increasing masonry content, implying that the RCA is the most prone to mechanical damage. Considering the monotonic triaxial tests, substantial values of shear parameters are measured in all materials. The highest cohesion is measured in the MG30, while the highest internal angles of friction are measured in the pure RCA. The shear parameters in the recycled materials are in all cases higher than those for the G2. Differences in failure type (brittle versus plastic) are observed as well. Durability milling results in a small increase of the internal angle of friction and in a moderate decrease of cohesion. The latter is the most governing for the material’s compressive strength after milling, as this is decreased in all milled specimens. Still, the shear parameters of the milled specimens remain relatively high. In the permanent deformation triaxial tests, a decrease of performance can be observed in both the RCA and MG65. Delayed shear failure is observed in milled specimens tested at a deviator stress ratio (DSR) higher than 30%. Although the number of permanent deformation tests performed in this research is limited, 30% DSR seems the upper limit with respect to cyclic loading. This points out that monotonic triaxial testing alone is not sufficient for an adequate material characterization. A small linear elastic pavement analysis based on the tested materials, however, shows that the occuring DSR levels in a reference pavement caused by standard axles of 80 kN do not exceed 20% DSR, proving the potential of these materials for further studies.","RCA; RCM; Recycled granulates; Unbound granulates; Triaxial test; Stellenbosch University","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Due to reduced mobility or cognitive functioning, elderly people fail to complete the oral care ritual sufficiently. Once this happens, caregivers are obliged to take over this task. Unfortunately, in many cases this does not happen due to the difficulty of the task, the uncomfortable feeling of intimacy for both the elderly person and the caregiver, and the high time pressure caregivers experience during the morning care ritual. <br/>Dental Robotics aims to improve the quality of care among frail elderly by developing an automatic toothbrush that takes away these pains. The Dental Robotics toothbrush simply requires the elderly person to bite in a mouthpiece. This enables the caregiver to brush all teeth at the same time while applying the right pressure and angle without skipping any teeth. The toothbrush completes this task in only 10 seconds, helping to reduce the total amount of time of the oral care ritual. <br/>However, for people with dementia such a product, bringing along new and different interactions, is difficult to comprehend. This lack of understanding can lead to problematic behaviour. This can be apathic, anxious, aggressive or agitated behaviour, all of which is difficult to overcome by the caregiver. Currently, the most common solution that caregivers use to overcome problematic behaviour is skipping the oral care altogether. When this happens, the care ritual cannot be completed. This is a major challenge for Dental Robotics, leading to the following design goal:<br/>Increase the acceptance of the Dental Robotics toothbrush among people with dementia and their caregivers, by creating a more pleasant experience for both.<br/>Person-centred care is a way to avoid problematic behaviour in the long term. This is an approach that puts the client with dementia in the centre of their own care, and uses the preferences and habits of the client during the care ritual. Since everyone has a different history, the way in which care should be approached should be different for everyone as well. In addition, the symptoms and severity of all clients are different. In order to apply this person-centred care, it is important to have a good understanding of the person in question. <br/><br/>Blink is an app that aims to enable caregivers to apply the person-centred approach over the entire care ritual. This is supported by the theory that, when the entire care ritual is executed without any problematic behaviour, the client with dementia will be put at ease and be more prone to accept such a difficult product as the toothbrush. <br/>Every time Blink is used for a specific client, the content changes. It will adapt based on the connection between the client and the caregiver, the severity of the dementia and the specific tool preferences for both the caregiver and the client. This helps to keep the use of Blink engaging. Over time, the connection between the caregiver and the client will grow. At the same time, the dementia gets more severe, making it increasingly difficult to connect and have conversations. The focus of the app will be on establishing a connection in the beginning, and slowly shifting towards more active help, such as an easy way to turn on music or videos. <br/>Together, this will help to create a more pleasant care moment for both the client and the caregiver, ensuring an increased acceptance of the automatic toothbrush developed by Dental Robotics.","Dementa; Person-centred care; Autonomous aging; Oral care","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Therefore, Hallmark should look for new ways to connect the younger target group to its brand.<br/>During this master thesis a product proposal and roadmap will be created to connect a younger target group to Hallmark in the following years.<br/>Hallmark is a creative company with a warm atmosphere. However, they are currently in a dilemma between its retail and online department. Where online sales grow by 5% per year, retail sales decline by 8%. However, retail is still responsible for 80% of the company's turnover. Hallmark doesn’t have a clear strategy what its internal focus should be. Furthermore, Hallmark is already looking for ways to innovate, but these innovations are mainly variations on the current greeting card and not something completely new or different.<br/>However, this is necessary, since the current industries in which Hallmark is active are not the most ideally in the long term. The retail greeting card industry is declining rapidly and the online industry faces a strong competition for both greeting cards and gifts. During this project, routine innovation will be conducted to explore a new industry.<br/>This new industry should connect to the younger target group, who experience problems with relationships. They are insecure and have to deal with a lot of stress. Furthermore, they have not much close friends and this is partly due to social media. There is therefore a need to strengthen relationships. Research shows that this is done best by enjoying experiences together and based on validated models, a new experience model has been developed. This experiences model will be the basis for the new product proposal. In addition to this model, experiences must be easy to consume and fit the target group.<br/>However, Hallmark must also be able to offer experiences, without expensive investments.

The concept is targeted at couples who have been together for a longer period and are in need of new, original dates.<br/>Hallmark is able to immediately start offering these boxes, but because the concept can easily be implemented by other parties, it is important to quickly expand to other target groups. Finally, a roadmap is provided, which enables Hallmark to grow into the activities industry, which should become a separate department within the company.","design; disruptive innovation; product proposal; Strategic Design; Roadmap; agile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

To that extent, customs authorities perform risk assessment. The customs declaration on which risk assessment is based often lacks detailed data or is incorrect.

One way to improve risk assessment is exchange of other trade documents (e.g., Bill of Lading or pro forma invoice) the customs declaration is based on. The documents can be used for piggybacking that involves the cross-validation of documents to determine correctness of the declaration. Blockchain technology can in potential support exchange of trade documents. However, challenges related to openness, security and scalability need to be addressed to come up with effective solutions. Therefore, this research develops an open, secure and scalable blockchain-based architecture that supports exchange of trade documents. Using a Design Science Research approach, several use cases to exchange documents are developed, requirements based on previous research on the exchange of trade documents (e.g., data pipeline concept) are derived, core blockchain architecture components are derived and a design that support the use cases is developed. The research finds that a open, secure and scalable blockchain-based architecture can support exchange of trade documents. However, slight differences in the design of each use case show that blockchain technology is not a black box. Generalization is therefore not straightforward. In-depth analysis of use cases is needed to come up with effective solutions.

Burning fossil fuels for energy is the dominant cause of greenhouse gas emissions. 32% of the Dutch energy supply is consumed by the built environment. The façade is the largest area of the building envelope. Consequently, the façade is responsible for roughly 40% of the energy loss of a building. Energy reduction can be realised by placing building integrated PV on the façade or by installing a double skin façade. The current study investigated the energetic performance of the combination of PV modules with a double skin façade. <br/>A control volume model has been integrated with an analytical mass flow model to predict the mass flow, energy flow and temperature profile of a double skin façade. An additional experiment was conducted were a PV module was placed at various locations within the DSF. The results were used to validate the combination of the control volume model with the mass flow model. The relative RMSE of temperature, PV temperature, mass flow and heat flow were found to be 14.6, 7.3, 14.9 and 42.7 percent respectively. <br/>An irradiance model has been programmed to calculate the amount of direct and diffuse incident irradiance on a vertical surface with specified orientation. The irradiance model was validated with the SAM [2]. A relative RMSD of 0.4% was found. Furthermore, a novel PV module efficiency equation has been deduced. this equation takes the effect of the angle of incidence into account. Finally, a heat demand model was created and compared to Dutch metrics. The energy demand, the generated heat flow and the electricity production were calculated for a base case. <br/>The generated electricity amounted to 65.7 and 56.5 percent of the final energy demand, when the PV modules were placed as front layer of the DSF respectively in the middle of the air flow channel. It was found that the total heat flow was 74 respective 103 percent of the total heat demand. However, the actual final energy reduction due to this flow was modest. This was caused by a mismatch in supply and demand and due to the low temperature of the supplied heat. When a ventilation system was coupled to the base case energy reductions of 4.6 and 4.7 percent could be achieved compared to the base case. When, instead, a heat pump was coupled to the exit flow energy reductions of 0.4 respective 0.6 percent were found.<br/>When limited area is available, the passive ventilation system can outperform solar modules in terms of final energy reduction. When the ventilation demand is high the amount of energy reduced by the airflow becomes more important with respect to the total energetic reduction.

This means there is a need for a back reflector in c-Si solar cells to capture the NIR light. One of the easiest ways of capturing NIR light is by using a reflective metal layer deposited onto a surface texture. However, in some cases surface texture cannot be applied. Having a flat metal reflector does not accomplish effective absorption of the NIR light. To enable effective absorption of NIR light, Lambertian reflectors are needed, which have a reflectance (rback ) of 1 (100% reflectivity) and a diffuse angle (θd ) of 60°. Lambertian scattering can be accomplished to an extent by using a combination of plasmonic nanoparticles and white paint as back reflectors. <br/>There have been many investigations where plasmonic back reflectors (PBR), white paint back reflectors (WPBR) and even plasmonic white paint back reflectors (PWPBR) have been used for enhancing absorption in thin-film solar cell technology. But there are not many instances where these reflectors are utilized in c-Si solar cells. Therefore, in this work plasmonic white paint back reflectors are optimized for poly-SiOx passivated c-Si solar cells. To accomplish this, first a detailed optical study was carried out to analyze various rback and θd combinations that can be obtained with different back reflectors. Then the back reflector combination that gave a decent rback and θd combination where then chosen for solar cell simulations. With the help of simulations, external quantum efficiency (EQE) and implied photo-current gain was quantified for combinations with high rback and θd in comparison with normal silver metal back reflectors. The solar cell stack that generated substantial optical gain with the help of simulations were then fabricated and measured. Measurements revealed significant EQE gain with all PBR, WPBR and PWPBR in comparison with Ag metal BR. Form this research work it was inferred that for poly-SiOx passivated flat c-Si solar cells, PWPBR gives highest EQE in the NIR. However, this is only the case when as thin as possible spacer layers are used.","Plasmonic white paint back reflectors; flat poly-SiOx passivated c-Si solar cells; EQE gain; near infra-red region","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-08-21","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Among these techniques, the recently developed mimetic spectral element method allows for exact discretisation of metric independent relations. This has been proven numerically in various mixed formulations, for instance the mixed velocity-vorticity-pressure formulation for Stokes flow, where mass conservation was point-wise strongly satisfied by the solution in the computational domain. Another example is the mixed stress-displacement formulation for the linear elasticity equations, where the balance law of linear momentum was point-wise strongly satisfied as well. A recent extension to a hybrid method leads to additional attractive features, such as the ability to decompose a large part of the computation of the solution into smaller problems. The aim of the research is to find a formulation for linear elasticity that is hybridisable while strongly satisfying conservation of linear and angular momentum as well, where the combination of linear momentum conservation and symmetry of the stress tensor is equivalent to angular momentum conservation. The proposed formulation has a mixed basis of both primal and algebraic dual nodal and edge basis functions. It fulfils the requirements as it is shown to be hybridisable, to satisfy point-wise linear momentum, and the discrete representation of the stress tensor is point-wise symmetric, hence angular momentum conservation is point-wise satisfied as well. The thesis furthermore functions as an overview of the method applied to elliptic problems, showing the results for previous formulations, and as a starting point for the next steps towards applying the method to fluids. A first step is proposed on extending the new formulation to a Stokes flow formulation with the stress as primary unknown, aimed at satisfying both linear and angular momentum conservation as well as mass conservation.","mimetic discretization; spectral element method; exact conservation; hybrid; Stokes flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

By using no steel reinforcement, which has with high carbon emission and is sensitivity to corrosion, the structure should have a longer life span with less maintenance and a lower carbon footprint.<br/>To get more information on unreinforced concrete structures, a literature study is done, focused on old Roman structures made out of Roman concrete. Besides historic concrete, research is also done on modern concrete and its capacity.<br/>The new bridge is designed for the ""Hoofdvaart"", a canal in the polder called, ""Haarlemmermeer"". The design consists of three arches are connecting the two abutments and two piers. In the connection of two arches, above the piers, so called flood openings are placed. Romans used flood openings to let water pass, but in this case they are used for the reduction of weight. Wooden piles form the foundation to the stiffer sand layers. Calculation of the design is done in a few steps. Firstly, the original design, as explained above, is calculated. Results show stresses, that are more than 7 times higher than the capacity of the concrete. The biggest contribution to the stresses are coming from self-weight and load model 1. Load model 1 is a heavy vehicle placed at the most unfavourable position of the bridge. Lowering self-weight is an option, but load model 1 has fixed values, so they cannot be lowered. Next, six optimizations are designed and calculated to create a structure that should fulfil the requirements. It turns out that the structure still exceeding the capacity by approximately 28%. After these optimizations can be concluded that for the given location, this design is not totally satisfying. To find out what contribution soil has to the structure, a few extra calculations are done for the last optimization. Based on overall calculations, the conclusion is that the top soil layers of the ""Haarlemmermeer"" are not capable of generating enough horizontal support for the unreinforced bridge. To finalize the design, a cost analysis and Life Cycle Analysis, LCA, are made. In both analysis a comparison is made between the new design and a reinforced bridge over the ""Hoofdvaart"" in ""Nieuw-Vennep"". The cost analysis show a difference of approximately ""170.000,- in advantage of the new design. Especially the material costs of steel and pre-cast elements in the existing bridge, contribute to this difference. So an unreinforced structure has less labour and less material costs, compared to a reinforced structure. Of course this difference is also depending on the type of structure and the design. The LCA shows around 30% less carbon emission for the new unreinforced bridge, compared to the existing reinforced bridge. Especially material use and demolition contribute to this decrease. This shows that an unreinforced structure is 30 to 40% more sustainable than a reinforced structure.<br","Unreinforced; Concrete; Bridge; Sustainability; Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-05-31","","","","Civil Engineering","","52.285101, 4.663694"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","In the Netherlands, a lot of traffic congestion occurs on motorways. This problem is most severe nearby larger cities. Utrecht is one of these cities. To improve traffic flow in this area, a huge masterplan is designed by Rijkswaterstaat called “A27/A12 Ring Utrecht”. One part of this masterplan consists of the motorway A27 at Amelisweerd. Here, the A27 is situated in a U-shaped concrete structure and must be expanded at both sides. Across the motorway a deck structure is going to be constructed with on top a public garden. This structure spans the total width of the A27 for 249 meters and is called The Green Connection.<br/>According to the original design of Rijkswaterstaat, this deck structure should be realized with an intermediate support. It will be advantageous to omit this structure, since it has a complex execution method. Therefore, it’s investigated if The Green Connection can be realized without the use of an intermediate support. <br/>Then, the execution aspects of the original design will be discussed more thoroughly. The first challenge is constructing the extended parts which is explicated according to 11 main tasks. These tasks seem to be relatively straightforward to execute. After realizing the extended parts, an intermediate support must be constructed. It is found that the existing foundation lacks bearing capacity by far. A new strengthened strip foundation with extra foundation piles must be realised in the middle of the motorway. Due to the boundary conditions (such as the water pressure beneath the structure and permanent drainage is prohibited), the only possibility left is to construct small building pits, compartments, within the existing structure. Such a compartment has a rough length of about 20 meters, will be about 6.5 meters wide and must be constructed 13 times. <br/>Thereafter, the deck structure should be assembled. Three alternatives in methods of assembly are outlined and discussed with the help of the same key-words. All three methods could be realized. But, it’s important to indicate that with some extra investments, the remaining space for traffic could be maximized during assembly.<br/>After discussing the execution aspects of the original design, the technical feasibility of the single span deck structure was investigated more thoroughly. In the Preliminary Study was deduced that two structural designs seem to be a possible solution in constructing The Green Connection. It turned out that the box beam design seems to be advantageous. Although this judgement is substantiated with preliminary calculations and an overall execution plan, it still required more research. Therefore, a reliable structural design is performed for a 75-meter span beam which can be used as a single span deck structure. It does exceed the boundary condition of 280 tons which was posed initially with 8%. However, no optimizations have been applied to this design. If the enumerated optimizations are performed, a beam can be designed according the boundary condition and possibly even less. <br/>When the original design of Rijkswaterstaat is compared to the single span design, the differences are quite straightforward. In essence, the question arises whether the extra money of constructing a single span deck structure outweigh the money which can be saved by leaving out the intermediate support and constructing the extended parts 25% narrower.<br/>Rijkswaterstaat has performed a design with an intermediate support. In this thesis, the feasibility of this design is investigated, and in particular this support. The only possible method of execution in realizing the support is upon condition that a temporary applied drainage system will be feasible and approved by the authority. When the authority states that draining ground water is prohibited, the original design isn’t feasible anymore. In that case, the single span design isn’t just an alternative to the original design, but is the only feasible solution. <br/>Concludingly, providing the applied principles of this thesis, it is strongly recommended against constructing an intermediate support within the existing U-shaped concrete structure. Since the structural reliability of a 75-meter span beam is proven, an intermediate support wall is redundant. Therefore, the single span design is less risky, less time consuming and less expensive compared to the original design.","A27 Amelisweerd; A27/A12 Ring Utrecht; Prestressed concrete; 75-meter span beam; De Groene Verbinding; The Green Connection; Intermediate support; Deck structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-01","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

A study in 2000 predicted that 25% of the houses located within 150 meters of the shoreline will be destroyed by erosion in 2060. The east coast of the US experiences an average erosion rate of roughly one meter per year. Moreover, the Atlantic coast can be classified as highly erosive as it is vulnerable to hurricanes in the summer as well as winter storm events. The erosive behavior is counteracted by the application of beach and shoreface (nearshore berm) nourishments, referred to as non-feeder nourishments. <br/>To illustrate this problem on a local scale, a project side in the northeast of Florida is selected, Duval County. At this site numerous beach and shoreface nourishments have been applied with an average nourishment cycle of approximately 5 years. However, taking the effect of climate change and sea-level rise into account, the required nourishment volumes will increase in the future. This means that other solutions need to be investigated. In the Netherlands, the pilot experiment Sand Engine is carried out, involving a large-scale feeder nourishment. It is expected that this type of nourishment will be more beneficial as it reduces the nourishment frequency and contains a concentrated displacement area. The nourishment will spread along the adjacent coastlines in a natural fashion, reducing the impact on ecology. Lastly, large-scale nourishment can temporary lead to additional recreational and environmental area, with a potential of creating new ecological habitats. This leads to the following research question: <br/>'How can a large-scale feeder nourishment be beneficial for highly erosive coastlines along the Atlantic coast of the US, and how can the effects of such nourishments be quantified on different timescales?'<br/>In order to evaluate the effect of large-scale feeder nourishments on the coast of Duval County, an evaluation framework has been developed. This framework is based on ecosystem services, which describe the way humans are linked to and depend on nature. Three main ecosystem services have been identified, which have been divided into several sub-services indicated by quantifiable parameters. The first ecosystem service is coastal protection, which is evaluated in terms of flood protection and maintenance of the coastline position. The time-dependent indicators for these sub-services are the foreshore volume and the distance between the Coastal Construction Control Line and the Momentary Coast Line. Secondly, recreation is evaluated by the sub-services of beach leisure, swimming, kitesurfing and strolling. Beach leisure is indicated by the dry beach width, swimming by the offshore directed flow velocities around the nourishment, kitesurfing by the additional sheltered area, and strolling by the walkable beach length along the shoreline. Lastly, the ecosystem service of habitat provision is split into three sub-services, namely nursery area, turtle nesting and dune growth potential. The nursery area is quantified by mapping the existing ecotopes, turtle nesting is evaluated by the beach slope and the beach width and finally the dune growth potential is indicated by the intertidal beach width.<br/>The researched nourishment alternatives differ from geometric shape and in nourishment frequency. Two shapes are connected to the beach and have a width to height ratio of (1:1) and (1:3), while one is detached from the beach in the form of an island. The first two shapes have been applied with a frequency of 1, 3, 5 and 10 years, and the island only for 5 and 10 years. The morphological development of the alternatives is predicted with the numerical model of Delft3D over a period of 10 years. <br/>All nourishment alternatives have been evaluated for all the selected indicators. For coastal protection the most suitable nourishment alternative is an attached and elongated nourishment with a frequency of 10 years (the (1:3) nourishment alternative). For recreation it differs largely per sub-service, but considering all sub-services have an equal weighting, the (1:3) alternative in combination with a 1 year frequency and the offshore island alternative with a 10 year frequency perform the best. The (1:3) nourishment alternative with a 1 year frequency creates the most benefit for beach leisure and swimming, while the offshore island with a 10 year frequency does this for kitesurfing and strolling. Finally for the ecosystem service of habitat provision, the offshore island in combination with a 10 year frequency has the most potential. The most suitable nourishment alternative cannot be selected for Duval County as a whole since the weighting between the different ecosystem services is unknown, as it depends on the stakeholders involved. <br/>Based on the analysis of the different nourishment strategies, the following conclusions have been drawn for the application of large-scale feeder nourishments:<br/>•Large-scale nourishments can decrease the required coastline maintenance on the long-term as long as they are placed within the dynamic wave zone. However, shore connected shapes can cause initial downdrift erosion because of their protrusion into the ocean, which requires extra nourishments at these locations. The application involves a trade-off between applying a low nourishment frequency with a large volume, and being able to place all the sediment within the dynamic zone.<br/>•The largest temporal additional recreational and environmental area is created by emerged alternatives. Shore connected nourishments provide the largest accessible beach area, while detached nourishments provide the largest sheltered area. In this study, the increase in sheltered area was up to 5 times as large compared to the original situation.<br/>•Nourishment alternatives that are elongated and streamlined along the coastline have a larger region of influence after the simulation period. Here, the region of influence was 10-20\% larger compared to the other shapes.<br/>•Large-scale feeder nourishments have the potential to transport sediment over the entire project area under sufficient tidal and wave forcing. It leads to a more gradual spread of sediment than small-scale nourishments, as they tend to pile up within the placement area.<br/>•As the disturbance of large-scale feeder nourishments is less frequent and concentrated, the adjacent coastlines are fed in a natural fashion, reducing the stress on ecology.<br/>In conclusion, large-scale feeder nourishment can be evaluated by the approach of ecosystem services. They can certainly be beneficial for highly erosive coastlines, but its optimal dimensions depend on the required wishes for the considered coastline.","Nourishment strategies; large-scale nourishments; Ecosystem Services; Duval County, Florida","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Therefore, this research aims to grant a contribution to the field by using the Bayesian modelling methods on private rental market prices to reduce unaffordable housing issue. To investigate the issue, the researcher analyses the literature on urban economic models, the use of models in policy making and, collects data from the national database and online rental housing agencies. With the use of hierarchical Bayesian modelling and exploration tools, the relations between house features and local characteristics are explored and two price prediction models are built by using local house features such as size, bedroom number, distance to city centre and district category. The researcher finds several demand profiles and detected a strong negative correlation between rental prices and some industrial and business locations, which might provide an opportunity for city planners to combine the development of these locations with house supply injections to create more affordable housing. Moreover, from the two prediction models, the first model investigated the average district expensiveness better than conventional metrics by increasing its prediction accuracy and ability to quantify uncertainty. Furthermore, the second model categorized the Amsterdam districts according to the preference profiles obtained by model parameters to find most suitable districts for middle-income households. In both models, the location parameter is found to have the highest impact on rent prices. The research provides informative demand profile findings and a descriptive plan on housing supply injections which can be useful for policy makers. Moreover, the policymakers can benefit from the use of advanced model techniques to better assess the spatial housing market according to the city needs. Furthermore, the research evaluates the effect of local factors on rent prices in order to customize development plans to meet the citizen’s needs more robustly. Lastly, besides benefiting from policymaker’s improved actions, middle-income tenants themselves can also use the research findings to make more informed affordable housing decisions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

The intention being that the person being taught, does not need to experience those things first-hand to be able to learn from them. A large portion of human learning is in some form derived from this concept. This has inspired this report. <br/>Recent developments in Deep Q-Networks applied a so-called replay memory. This replay memory stores experiences in a buffer for it to learn from later. It is this replay memory that is now used as a source of information for other agents. The core principle being attempting to find important entries in the replay memory and sharing those memories with other agents could improve the learning process of an agent. This memory selection process is done by use of prioritised sampling. The desired result being an agent able to learn faster. This is used to determine the importance of memory samples by influencing how likely those memories are to be sampled for teaching one another.<br/>Temporal difference is chosen as a metric for importance as it represents a surprise value. This method is then compared to a baseline DQN-agent who does not communicate, a randomly messaging DQN-agent and some other variations. The benchmark tasks describe a simple gridworld with objectives with varying levels of difficulty. <br/>The results of the experiments show that, initially, prioritisation results in rapid learning. This is due to the fact that agents are able to converge to identical policies without it having detrimental effects on the return of rewards. This converging, however, has proven to hamstring the learning process as a whole that prioritised messaging agents have. Very similar policies in benchmark tasks which stand to benefit from heterogeneous policies lead to agents not being able to find their personal optimal policy. The non-communicating agent was able to diverge in policies and therefore ultimately solve the problems more efficiently and with a higher return in rewards. <br","Prioritised; DQN; replay; memory; sharing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Dankelman, J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Transvenous lead extractions (TLEs) are minimally invasive procedures in which pacing or implantable cardioverter defibrillator leads are extracted under guidance of 2D X-ray fluoroscopy. Despite the fact that fluoroscopy is currently the gold standard for TLEs, it has several limitations in terms of visualization of anatomical structures, areas of high risk and complications. Since TLEs carry a small but distinct risk of major complications including laceration of the Superior Vena Cava (SVC), bleeding and death, this study aimed to evaluate the utility of intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) to overcome current problems of fluoroscopy and to reduce major complications during TLEs. Hereby the presented work first had the objective of designing and constructing a tissue-mimicking vascular phantom model with realistic geometry and echogenicity to simulate a real-life lead extraction environment suitable for ultrasound imaging and second, of evaluating the utility of ICE for different visualization planes of the lead-tissue interface whilst using the phantom model. In order to accomplish this, different mould prototypes were designed and constructed with additive manufacturing in order to enable polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) pouring of the phantom. Following several iteration steps of the prototypes, an ultrasound compatible PVA phantom model of the SVC and approximate innominate veins with realistic geometry could be constructed according a developed methodology, adopted and modified from previous protocols. Subsequently, its suitability to serve as a real-life lead extraction environment in terms of echogenicity was assessed by comparison of its results with findings from previous conducted clinical studies. Ultimately, both the constructed phantom and a porcine model were used to evaluate the performance of ICE in three experiments whereby several visualization planes of the lead-tissue interface were examined. The results of this study demonstrate that a side-looking phased-array ICE catheter could image different structures of the lead-tissue interface including the vessel wall of the SVC, area of scar tissue, free-floating and adherent cardiac leads as well as the advancement of an extraction sheath over the lead. It was found that the structures could be clearly distinguished from each other in terms of echogenicity. The scar tissue along the lead-tissue interface was visualized as an echo dense signal, characterized by a linear echogenic shadow, and equivalent to prior clinical observations. From the results, it also appeared that a parallel view and cross-sectional view outside the SVC gave more insight into lead binding sites and their location with respect to the vessel wall than a conventional parallel view inside the SVC. It can be concluded that it is feasible to design and construct a vascular phantom model with realistic geometry and echogenicity, adequate for the simulation of a real-life lead extraction environment and to evaluate the utility of ICE for TLEs. This study has demonstrated that ICE is a valuable tool to visualize and assess the lead-tissue interface, which is crucial to avoid major complications during TLEs. Thus, implementation of ICE imaging into TLEs has the potential to add to a more effective and safer procedure.","Transvenous Lead Extraction; Medical Phantom; Ultrasound; Intracardiac Echocardiography; Polyvinyl Alcohol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-02-20","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

A research conducted by Bain (K. Harris, Kimson, &amp; Schwedel, 2018) claimed that the impact of the economic disruption, which could be triggered by the collision of income inequality and automation, might be more dramatic than what was experienced in the past sixty years. On one hand, the adoption of new automation and production technologies, such as recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, is expected to raise new businesses and investment opportunities. It is also expected that automation will boost productivity which has been declining due to several reasons, including aging population (Bughin et al., 2017).On the other hand, only a fraction of society (around 25%) will enjoy the benefits of the coming wave of automation (K. Harris et al., 2018) because automation is expected to increase the demand for high-skilled labour while decreasing the demand for the low-skilled labour. Furthermore, the scarcity of the high skill labour may increase the skill premium. Putting it differently, the demand for high-skilled labour will boost their income while depressing the wage of the low-skilled labour. Moreover, the benefits of automation will flow to the owners of capital due to increasing investment along with automation. As a result, automation has the potential to further deepen income inequality, aggravating the existing inequality in the United States (Alvaredo, Chancel, Piketty, Saez, &amp; Zucman, 2018).This research, therefore, focuses three research gaps to study the impact of automation and digitalization.

This was done through the use of a purposely-built computer model that translates traffic projections into a terminal design in an automated fashion. The allowable waiting time for vessels calling at the terminal has proven to be the design guideline that has the highest influence regarding project feasibility. The allowable waiting time was optimized by monetizing the negative consequences of long waiting times at the terminal using demurrage rates. Existing guidelines state that bulk terminal investments are typically based on maintaining an average ratio of waiting time to service time between 20% to 30%. However, results from the computer model show that, if a terminal were to incorporate the notion of demurrage rates into its business model, waiting times could be allowed to rise to 70% of berth service time, unlocking significant project value. Furthermore, by automating the translation of traffic projections into terminal designs, the financial repercussions of the uncertainty surrounding such projections becomes quantifiable. By simulating the project value of a terminal under varying economic scenarios, the user is shown how a spread is possible traffic development results in a certain spread in project value. The final aspect that has been analyzed within this study is the financial impact of modelling a terminal based on <i>perfect foresight</i>, a presumption that the traffic projections on which investments are based will always come true. Results show that modelling a terminal is such a manor overestimates a project’s value. Depending on the size of the project and the market’s volatility, this over-estimation is in the range of 3% (steady market growth) to 20% (volatile markets). An alternative modelling method has been developed which bases investment decisions on forecasted traffic volumes, which are updated as a simulation progresses. This forecast method slightly lowers over-estimation of project value by several percentage points. <br","dry bulk terminals; traffic forecasting; grain terminals; terminal design; construction costs; demurrage costs; project feasibility; perfect foresight; allowable vessel waiting time","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The main research question is: What can be achieved by using a parametric model in the preliminary design phase, with the possibility to optimize and compare concrete bridges on material usage, costs and environmental impact? And to answer this question, the cantilever bridge and all other elements in the road design are investigated and a parametric model is developed. In this model the total vertical alignment of the road design is implemented along with approach bridges, substructure and foundations. Furthermore, the results of the designs are visualized in a 3D environment compared with an overview of the material costs and environmental impact. In the ""Discussion"", the following is concluded: Although the parametric model for the preliminary design of concrete cantilever bridges took a long time to develop, this time investment can be regained by using the model several times. Because by using the parametric model for the preliminary design of concrete bridges, the design time per procurement is decreased significantly. Furthermore, the design process of the balanced cantilever bridge has become more flexible since changes are automatically implemented for the whole model. Also the chance for (human) errors is decreased, for instance the risk of data loss is minimized due to the model’s single environment. Since only a limited amount of calculations is performed by the model, the results of the analysis must be used with caution. Another advantage is the instant results as produced by the model. These results consist of a visualization of the design and an overview of the material amounts, with their costs and environmental impact. Furthermore, the model is also able to optimize these results in a fast way due to a smart evolutionary solver. This all together makes the parametric model a useful tool with high potential, but it should be further<br/>developed and improved.","Parametric design; Concrete; Bridge; cantilever; Materials; Costs; Optimization; Grasshopper","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-02-19","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Rupture of plaque tissue is a mechanical event, where plaque stress or strain locally exceeds its strength. Biomechanical studies agree with histopathological findings that a large lipid pool and thin fibrous cap overlying the lipid pool increase the likelihood of rupture, by showing increased plaque stresses for these geometries. Another plaque morphological feature that is frequently encountered is calcification. However, its role in the vulnerability of plaques to rupture is not fully understood, and biomechanical modeling studies do not agree on the effect of calcifications on plaque stress. These studies used isotropic material properties for the anisotropic and collagen rich plaque tissue, and generally focused on the effect of calcification on lumen stress or cap stress. However, histopathological findings revealed tissue damage at the interface between calcification and surrounding tissue.<br/><br/>This study investigated stresses and strains at the interface between calcification and fibrous tissue, how these stresses and strains are influenced by local anisotropy of the fibrous tissue and how geometric features of the calcification are related to these metrics. A morphometric study was conducted first, to investigate and categorize different patterns of fiber alignment around the calcifications, and to measure the calcification geometric features including its location in the plaque, its shape and its size. Biomechanical models including the local anisotropic material properties were constructed next, based on the observations and measurements made in the morphometric analysis. Stress and strain metrics were investigated at the calcification boundary, and subsequently related to fiber patterns and calcification geometric features.<br/><br/>Hundred forty five calcifications were segmented and measured in the morphometric analysis, and surrounding fiber alignments were studied. The analysis revealed that four main fiber patterns in the fibrous tissue surrounding calcifications exist: the Attached pattern, Pushed Aside pattern, Encircling pattern and Random pattern. Collagen fibers are attached to the calcification in the Attached pattern, are pushed aside by the calcification in the second pattern, encircle the calcification in the third pattern, and show a disorganized alignment in the Random pattern. The Attached pattern was the most prevalent fiber pattern, and its corresponding calcifications had larger aspect ratios and were on average larger than the other three fiber patterns. Large peak stresses and strains at the calcification boundary were identified in the biomechanical models for the Attached pattern and Pushed Aside pattern, while these metrics showed generally lower peak values for the Encircling pattern and Random pattern. Peak values for all stress and strain metrics were attained at the tip of the calcifications. Multivariate analysis showed that stresses and strains are related to the calcification geometric features; calcification interface stress and strain increased if the calcification was closer to the lumen, had a larger length/width ratio and was larger in size.<br/><br/>Histopathological examination of plaques evidenced damage at the interface between calcification and fibrous tissue, potentially caused by an adverse mechanical state at this boundary. Most studies focused on stresses at the lumen or in the cap however, and this study for the first time specifically investigated stresses and strains at the calcification boundary while simultaneously introducing local fibrous tissue anisotropy in the computational models. Results show that peak stresses and strains can develop at this boundary, which will remain undiscovered if isotropic materials are used. This study was also the first to extensively analyze calcification geometric features and surrounding fiber alignment in relation to these interface stresses and strains. Peak values were found to be dependent on these features and fiber alignment patterns, indicating a relation between these characteristics and mechanical stability of the plaque. The findings of this study further increase the clinical relevance of finite element modeling in rupture risk prediction by showing previously undiscovered peak stress and strain values for interfaces and geometric configurations which already were deemed to be destabilizing in clinical and histopathological studies.","Atherosclerosis; Plaque; Calcification; FEM analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-02-19","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Biomaterials and Tissue Biomechanics","",""

During the last 10 years, several studies have been carried out to introduce the thin glass in the building industry. The advantages of this material are light weight, high strength and high flexibility. On the other hand, thin glass, due to its low thickness, has a limited bending stiffness. Therefore, it is challenging to apply this innovative material in the building field. Within this research, the stiffness of thin glass is increased by the realization of a thin glass cold bent sandwich panel.<br/>The proposed sandwich panel is realized by using thin glass faces and a 3D printed polymeric core. Due to the high flexibility of the glass, the material can be easily bent and glued to the core.

This actuator is fixed on the projectile and offers a single force that can only be switched on or off. <br/><br/>In order to test the effectiveness of the guidance, navigation and control (GNC) system, an accurate model for both the projectile and the proposed actuator are constructed. These models will serve as a substitute for testing with working prototypes. The model for the projectile dynamics is constructed based on existing nonlinear 6-DOF rigid-body models that are widely-used and validated. A new, simplified second order model that approximates the dynamics of the actuator, based on available measurements, is constructed.<br/><br/>The overall structure of the GNC loop is defined, with the guidance method of choice being the pre-calculation of a reference trajectory towards the intended target. This method serves to alleviate under-actuation and computation time problems. One of the most important contributions of the thesis is made with the description of a method for transforming the input from a single binary input signal towards two continuous virtual input forces. This method uses a discretization of the rolling motion of the projectile, such that an optimization can be done which results in a transformation from the binary on/off signal to two virtual force inputs. These two virtual force represent the steering forces in the directions perpendicular to the forwards motion that would have the same effect as the binary on/off signal if directly applied on the projectile.<br/><br/>The restructuring of the input allows for the use of PD-controllers to track the pre-defined trajectory. Using a grid-search method, the controller gains are found that best satisfy the design goal of minimizing the dispersion, which is defined by the sum of the mean error and the standard deviation of the impact points.<br/><br/>Analysis of the integrated solution shows that the proposed solution with the input transformation and the PD-controller is able to significantly reduce the projectile dispersion from standard deviations of about 50 cm to just a few cm. The exact performance depends on the frequency of the actuator and the spin rate of the projectile. The best performance is reached with high spin rates and actuator frequencies high enough to match these spin rates.","Guidance; Control; Projectile; PD control; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-02-21","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

This requires the shipyard to make a prediction of the additional installed power required to maintain a certain speed when waves are encountered. The additional required installed power is directly related to the average extra resistance that the vessel is subjected to when it’s sailing in waves. This extra resistance is known as the time-averaged added resistance in waves. In the maritime industry Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is increasingly used for resistance predictions as it promises cheaper and faster predictions than model testing. The result does come without the comforting ’truth’ of the towing tank. In this study, the applicability of CFD for the estimation of the time-averaged added resistance in regular head waves is researched by assessing the error and uncertainty of the solution. For fast sailing vessels, no standard procedure for the estimation of the timeaveraged added resistance in waves using CFD has yet been developed. Therefore the secondary research objective is to establish such a procedure. For this research the resistance predictions are done for the Fast Displacement Ship (FDS) hull form. Extensive research was conducted on this hull form by the Cooperative Research Ships (CRS) organisation. Their model tests results are used for the validation of the solution. The discretisation error is determined through a procedure developed by L.Eça and M.Hoekstra [25] which is based on a grid refinement study. The time-averaged added resistance is estimated by simulating the vessel both in calm water and waves. The time-averaged calm water and total resistance in waves are determined from these simulations. The time-averaged added resistance estimate is then calculated by subtracting the calm water resistance from the total resistance. First a grid topology is optimised to simulate the incoming waves as well as the vessels response to them accurately and efficiently. Grid sensitivity studies of the simulation of incoming waves as well as simulations of the static vessel in waves and the vessel subjected to forced motion are used to determine an efficient topology. To determine if the vessel’s response is accurate, it is compared to the solution from potential flow code solver PRECAL. The comparison proved that accurately propagating waves and accurate vessel response to the waves and motions are achieved on grids with less than 3 M cells in total. Verification estimated an uncertainty that varies between 0.5 % and 1.3 % for the time-averaged total resistance in waves and between 15.1 and 36.2% for the time-averaged calm water resistance on grids with a total number of cells ranging between 1.3 and 6.6 M. Comparison with the results from the model test revealed that an error of 1.4 % was present in the timeaveraged added resistance estimate. This error is smaller than the uncertainty margin of the model test result. Using the proposed method, the time-averaged calm water resistance estimate didn’t converge well, resulting in a large discretisation uncertainty. As the added resistance prediction is dependent on the calm water resistance prediction, it is also affected by this uncertainty. Therefore it’s concluded that the proposed method for the estimation of the time-averaged wave added resistance using CFD is not yet applicable in its proposed form. However, by using the proposed method, it is possible to estimate the time-averaged total resistance in waves accurately and efficiently. Therefore it’s concluded that further research is required to improve the uncertainty present in the time-averaged added resistance due to the uncertainty seen in the calm water resistance for the used grids.","CFD; ReFRESCO; added resistance; regular waves; 2D waves; radiated waves; diffracted waves; FDS; discretisation uncertainties; verification; validation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore Engineering","",""

Their atomic scale thickness makes it that these resonators exhibit amplitude-dependent damping at relatively small driving forces. To further increase the performance of these devices, it is essential to understand the dissipation process. Although many physical mechanisms that lead to linear damping have been investigated, the origin of nonlinear damping remains largely unknown. Nonlinear damping in nanomechanical resonators is typically studied using phenomenological models.<br/>In this thesis, a multilayer graphene resonator is studied that is electrostatically actuated. The graphene resonator is modeled as a viscoelastic membrane operating in the geometrically nonlinear regime. The amplitude-dependent damping term used in phenomenological models arises naturally in the equation of motion. The experimentally obtained nonlinear frequency responses are then fitted using a fully automated algorithm. Based on these fits, the viscoelastic properties of graphene and its loss tangent are found. When the same analysis is done for a single-layer graphene resonator coupled to an optical cavity, negative nonlinear damping is observed which turns positive with increasing laser power. The effect of the optical field on the nonlinear damping is then modeled. It is found that the change in equilibrium position of the graphene membrane due to laser illumination as well as geometric imperfections can lie at the root of the negative nonlinear damping behavior.","Nonlinear damping; Graphene resonators; Nonlinear dynamics; Viscoelasticity; Optomechanics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-08-15","","","","","",""

Typically, the solution of a SOC problem requires solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for all system states and controls. However, this operation becomes intractable when high-dimensional systems are used. In recent years, advances on a certain type of SOC problem, which can be efficiently solved by sampling from a diffusion process have been presented and are better known as path integral (PI) control. We build upon this theory and implement a decentralized formulation of the PI algorithm to compute the optimal controls of real Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) flying in formation using solely on-board computational resources. One challenging aspect of the PI control method is the efficient sampling of useful trajectories. It is not clear how to guide the samples towards the optimal states. To this end, we propose a probe enhanced importance sampling (PEIS) method which performs a coarse exploration of the state space with the objective of identifying an optimal guiding trajectory around which the samples are taken. The feasibility of the proposed method is shown by means of simulation and real-hardware experiments with up to four MAVs in an indoor environment.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Recent advancements in direct-injection technology have contributed to an increase in volumetric efficiency and engine power, but the physical modeling of such gaseous injection with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is still challenging. This work describes the development of a CFD methodology for the simulation of CNG engines, an evaluates its predictivity by varying certain simulation parameters. <br/>Firstly, turbulence modelling has been investigated by comparing the RNG k-ε RANS, Dynamic Smagorinsky LES and Delayed DES approaches. The DES provides the best trade-off between computational cost and accuracy during fuel injection, but the model makes abrupt transitions between its RANS and LES-like regions, leading to inaccuracies during combustion. The expensive nature of the LES and the adequate accuracy of the RANS model lead to the preference of the latter. Secondly, the turbulent Schmidt number was investigated. By lowering the number, mixing is more dominant in the simulation and the mixture formation becomes more stoichiometric. The influence on combustion is even larger because of turbulent transport across the flame, with extremely low values even leading to falsely-predicted engine knock. Thirdly, by comparing multiple consecutive engine cycles to each other, it was found that the first cycle still contains a large amount of initialization error in the turbulent field. The second and third cycles show much better agreement to each other. Finally, the amount of turbulent fluctuations at peak power and their influence on laminar flame speed partially lead to flame extinction at the start of combustion. As a consequence, the G-equation model is not justified and does indeed provide inaccurate results for the heat release during combustion. Even though the SAGE detailed chemistry solver in conjunction with the Gri-Mech 3.0 mechanism is assumed to have a larger computational cost, it was found that the opposite is in fact true, and the latter should be preferred. <br/>The aforementioned conclusions are used to calibrate the simulation model against measurement data. The recommended settings are the RANS turbulence model, SAGE detailed chemistry and a turbulent Schmidt number of 0.6, while considering results from a second engine cycle. The Lower Heating Value (LHV) of the fuel was decreased in order to account for an unforeseen inconsistency with the measurement. This ad hoc solution showed that the predictivity of the RANS simulations can substantially be improved, and a good agreement between simulation and measurement was observed. The calibration is however not consistent with other operating conditions, as the part load analysis showed. Finally, the comparison between the peak power and part load operating point have revealed that the engine performance can potentially be improved by altering the piston bowl shape or the position of the injector and the spark plug.","CFD; CNG; Automotive; Engine; Methodology; Turbulence; Combustion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-02-14","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This task is referred to as the crew rostering problem; an optimization problem that aims to assign flights to crew members in a cost-effective way, while also considering preferences of crewmembers. Flights are combined into multiple-day activities called pairings that consist of flight duty days and rest period days. For intercontinental long-haul destinations specifically, pairings may take more than a week. During flight duty days of these long-haul pairings, crew members are not situated at the airline base location. During rest period days, however, they have the opportunity to be at their homes or with their families. The pairings that crew members on long-haul crew divisions operate, thus, directly impact their life<br/>apart from work as well as the locations at which they are situated during flight duty days. Therefore, crew preferences are highly valued by crew members, as these provide their only means to influence duties. This is a critical reason for crew preferences to be a recurrent topic in negotiations on collective labour<br/>agreements between crew unions and airlines that influence crew resources. As crew costs are the biggest expense for airlines next to fuel (Belobaba et al., 2015), crew preferences are considered in an environment that is predominantly designed to manage crew resources as efficiently as possible. For long-haul cockpit crew in European airlines, crew preferences can be expressed via requests for the operation of specific pairings. However, the problem with these pairing requests is that the requests concern pairings that commence months later than the pairings considered by the crew rostering problem. This<br/>problem is typically solved only one month before operation of the pairings. It is impractical to consider the pairing requests as part of the crew rostering optimization problem, since the problem size of the optimization problem becomes too large to be solved within practical computation time. In other words, a decision on whether or not to grant a certain pairing request has to be made with limited information available on the consequences of that decision since it concerns a part of the schedule that is not optimized for. When a pairing request is granted for a crew member, this invokes a pre-assigned pairing for this crew member. Such pre-assigned pairings constrain the construction of this crew member’s roster in the crew rostering problem, as only a limited number of options exist to efficiently construct this crew member’s roster. When many of these pre-assigned pairings exist in the schedule, this leads to inefficiencies in the schedule. Such inefficiencies cause loss days without productive activity in the schedule, which are an indicator of inefficient use of crew resources leading to higher crew costs.","airline crew scheduling; airline crew rostering; crew preference management; operations optimization; classification model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-03-02","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In this thesis, this experience is called the void. An established psychological phenomenon called the Peak-End rule describes how events are judged by both their peaks, be they positive or negative, and their ends. The end of festivals is now often perceived by visitors as ""necessary evil"". It is assumed that the end and its experience are part of the festival and last from the moment of leaving the terrain up to three days after. Therefore, the judgement of the festival depends on this experience. MOJO Concerts has not designed anything for this period of time, while the number of competing festival organisers is rising, which makes delivering a better festival experience even more important. To improve this end-of-festival experience, a product was designed to 'embrace' the visitor. Embracement is an experience that solves the void. A greater amount of embracement results in a better experience. In this thesis the product uses the auditory sense to embrace the visitor. A binaural, head-shaped microphone is designed that will record the sound of the festival, and record the visitors' reactions to the request to say something nice. After the festival, the records are collected by the organiser and distributed to the visitors over a popular music streaming medium. The head-shaped microphone was shaped as such for a more binaural experience. A more binaural experience will result in a more embracing experience. The face that was put on the head was chosen from sixteen faces in a test (n=32). During this test, participants were also asked to describe what they would say to see how the question should be changed for better results. Indicative tests on the reaction to the head and its recordings were performed. The head was tested in front of Amsterdam central station. The installation consisted of the head, a steel structure with padding and clothing, and a sign asking passengers to say something nice. The test was filmed from ten meters away to avoid interference with the passengers. During this 53 minute test, 39 reactions were recorded. This is a lower number of reaction than expected from a festival, because then it is common to step out of one's comfort-zone. It is assumed that this amount of reactions is an indicator for a positive result. The record was edited to cross-fade from reaction to reaction. This sound was tested (n=85, v=45 + m=40) and on average valued a 3.0 (1 to 5 Likert scale, v=3.1, m=3.0). This assessment is expected to be higher when the record is from a festival and the listener is just back from that festival. Proposals for further research and how to asses the value of a test at a festival are added. The installation is expanded to a gathering spot in which the head is positioned in the midst of the visitors to further improve the embrasiveness of the binaural records.","binaural; festival; experience; peak-end rule; MOJO; audio; psychology; Installation; Sound; 3d print; human head","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Consequently, TVMPC is introduced as a middle ground between Adaptive Model Predictive Control (MPC) and fully nonlinear MPC, capturing model variation over the control horizon while retaining the computational efficiency of quadratic optimization algorithms.

Five scenarios compare the effectiveness of time-varying control versus adaptive and fixed-model MPC, with TVMPC not outperforming fixed-model control in horizontal vehicle orientations, but improving on oscillatory behavior shown by adaptive control.

A passive single lift involves no active motions compensation and the interaction between platform and vessel will cause uncontrollable impact. A time domain model was developed to evaluate the loads during the single lift procedure. Prescribed motions for the vessel were used as a conventional method, assuming no deviating responses after impact due to its dominant inertia capacity. The Pioneering Spirit was used as referencevessel. Environmental loading on the topside during a beam wave corresponding to an annual stochastic JONSWAP spectrum was used as representative condition.Multiple 1-, 2- and 3-Dimensional impact models with two vessel motions methods were built for modelling the motions of the vessel. The first was the prescribed motions method corresponding to a frequency domain stochastic response, lacking the account for coupling onto the vessel. The second method incorporated the coupled motions by use of the impulse response function (Cummins equation), to evaluate the motions after impact. A sensitivity analysis on the stiffness’s within the system was performed which quantified the effectson the loads. A second analysis quantified the impact between the prescribed and coupled motions, theirresponses, and loads corresponding to the components within the system.The results show that accounting for the pitch and heave motions in 3-D modelling, using the coupled motions method, resolves in the most accurate responses and a decrease in motion responses after impact. The coupled motions method is found to be a more appropriate method of modelling for the complete behaviour and loads of this type of impact problem, but more time consuming in solving. It showed a decrease of the mean forcing due to decreasing vertical motions after impact. An increase in mean zero-crossing frequency after impact and caused an increase in number of impacts.

However, before the full potential of future applications can be achieved, a proper characterisation of the fundamental properties of graphene is crucial. The aim of this project was to contribute to the understanding of the mechanics of graphene membranes in presence of surface imperfections. To this end two configurations are investigated: ribbons and cantilevers, respectively. Wrinkled graphene nanoribbons are used to investigate the mechanical behaviour during the transition from the wrinkled state to the flat state. A molecular dynamics model has been developed of a single layer graphene ribbon to describe both the formation of wrinkles as well as the transition from the wrinkled state to the flat state. Also, a continuum model was developed to investigate the formation of wrinkles in graphene nanoribbons. Different constitutive laws have been investigated to describe the mechanical response of wrinkled membranes during the transition from the wrinkled state to the flat state. It was concluded that an exponential version of Hooke’s law fails to describe this transition correctly. The transition is however well described by the first order compressible Ogden’s law. Ogden’s law provided further insights into different mechanical properties of the wrinkled layer. Ogden’s law predicted that wrinkledmembranes exhibit a negative Poisson’s ratio at small strains, which is in agreement with previous research. Also, Ogden’s law predicted a decreasing shearmodulus and an increasing Poisson’s ratio after flattening of the membrane. Single layer graphene cantilevers show great potential, however, due to the difficult manufacturing of these fragile structures they remain virtually unstudied. Herein, a molecular dynamics model has been developed to investigate if nanocantilevers could be stabilised by implying a curvature. We found that, depending on the aspect ratio of the membrane and the applied rate of curvature, single layer graphene cantilevers could be (partly) stabilised by implying a curvature. In conclusion, with this research we provided new insights for designing and investigating the next generation of graphene nanoelectromechanical devices.","Graphene; wrinkles; constitutive modeling; nonlinear identification; Poisson's ratio; Shear modulus","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-14","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The result of those studies can be found today in the concrete structure design specifications of well-known building codes, such as the Eurocode. Nevertheless, the inclusions of the results of those studies into the design specifications are still minimum and therefore, it is necessary to conduct more studies on size effect, especially on other types of cracking. <br/>In this thesis, an investigation focused on the size effect in shear tension cracking at prestressed concrete beams was conducted. The model used for investigating the size effect is a prediction that a shear tension crack will occur when the principal tensile stress at a certain location on the web of a beam is equal to the concrete mean uniaxial tensile strength (σ1 = fctm). The investigation was conducted by studying premature shear tension cracking on a group of several I-profile prestressed reinforced concrete beams, called the trusted specimens, which were experimented by Hanson (1964), Choulli (2005), and Elzanaty (1986) under four-point bending tests. These tested beams were numerically investigated using linear elastic finite element analysis (LEFEA) with an aim to find the nearly realistic principal tensile stresses that caused the shear tension crack to initiate below the designated tensile strength of the beams. <br/>To study the size effect, the obtained principal tensile stress distributions were analyzed using two new approaches proposed by the author, namely the σ1 area approach and the ratio-of-distances approach. The σ1 area method is a technique for detecting a structural size dependency of the uniaxial tensile strength by comparing rectangles which areas represents a group of σ1 values that have a higher likelihood in achieving the deviated values of fctm and initiate shear tension cracking on the web of the trusted specimens. In contrast, the ratio-of-distances approach investigates the size dependency of the uniaxial tensile strength by observing the locations of σ1max where a shear tension crack initiated in the web of each trusted specimen under an assumption that a shear tension crack is more likely to originate from near the beam neutral axis instead of near the web-flange junction due to the change of thickness at that interface. <br/>In conclusion, the result of the investigation was presented. The σ1 area approach confirmed the presence of size effect in shear tension cracking at the trusted specimens by giving a relation that showed a tendency for the smaller specimens to have a higher resistance towards principal tensile stresses compared to the larger specimens. The ratio-of-distances result, on the other hand, implied that the approach has failed to detect the presence of size effect. In that result, the shear cracks from the smaller specimens and the shear cracks from the larger specimens had similar starting points locations, at which the σ1max was located. <br/>In addition, several recommendations are provided for future studies on size effect in shear tension cracking. It was recommended to do research this topic on different physical problems and shear tension cracking with the presence of flexural cracks.","size effect; prestressed concrete; shear tension cracking; Numerical Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

A common issue paired with light weight construction is the need to engage in vibrational design, in order to minimize hindrance due to human activities such as walking, that cause vibrations in buildings. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a crucial tool for accurately predicting structural behaviour in such a context. The typical problem with FEM considering large, complex or detailed structures, is that analyses may demand intolerably large computational eort to perform design studies. As a solution, a component-wise approach called Component Mode Synthesis (CMS) is proposed. CMS technique involves separating a construction into substructures, after which Model Order Reduction (MOR) is performed on each substructure individually. With this, the substructures are eciently described by a limited amount of Degrees of Freedom (DoF), after which they are assembled by means of Dynamic Substructuring (DS) techniques. Considering the large amounts of substructure DoF to be coupled to other assembly parts (typically containing 1%-10% of the total amount), an additional measure is required for analyses to be viable: a reliable interface reduction should be performed to deal with the number of unreduced interface DoF that still exist. This research investigates interface reduction by means of Orthogonal Polynomial Series, creating an a priori determined, generic reduction basis which closely resembles the true vibration modes along substructure interfaces. Its performance is investigated with several conceptual case studies, conducting reduced order analysis in Matlab and comparing the results with a full order solution. Alterations are explored, including dierent polynomial bases (Legendre and Fourier), exible couplings and viscoelasticity at either coupled substructure boundaries or bodies. The relevance of complex modes in viscoelastic structures with lightly varying damping and stiness is examined, as well as accuracy of approximations of complex modes, with the prospect of enabling arbitrary frequency dependent material properties to be represented in an ecient manner. This involves approximation of complex modes, obtained by superposition of undamped modes, for which a strategy is developed to optimize considered inclusion of undamped modes. Ultimately, a representative building is modelled in order to relate test results of OPS interface reduction to an applicable context, and to prove the overall eectiveness of the enhanced CMS strategy for large light weight building models. OPS interface reduction using Legendre series has shown to be a reliable and ecient technique depending on the frequency range considered. Its general error trends are mostly insignicant or manageable and exible/ viscoelastic boundary couplings do not de ate this. Disproportional viscoelasticity in substructure bodies, with respect to their mass and stiness matrices, are not necessarily beneted by the use of complex vibration modes when its dynamic modulus varies lightly over frequency. Though the potential which is beyond this scope, yet remains undetermined, the presented approximation technique for complex modes also comes with additional limitations besides the amount of damping. With regards to the applicative value of CMS, the analyses of the light weight building model prove that OPS interface reduction enables signicant improvement of computational eciency, yet yielding accurate results, as a valuable solution for modern-day problems.","Dynamic Substructuring; Component Mode Synthesis; Model Order Reduction; Interface Reduction; Finite Element Method; Vibrations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

It is positioned as an implementation of the ‘general data model (GDM) for socioeconomic metabolism’, which the authors state “can be used to structure all data that can be located in the industrial system”. To evaluate the representative capabilities of the GDM and IEDC, a source dataset of unit-processes is mapped to their datamodel. The source data selected for this purpose is a version of the ecoinvent database, which has been transformed into the minimum consensus knowledge model for LCA data (Kuczenski et al. 2016).<br/>Three primary insights have been found through this research. Firstly, it is possible to represent unit-process data within the IEDC. However, there are numerous shortcomings, which lead to the evaluation that this representation is not effective. Second, it was found that the GDM is probably not described sufficiently clearly and explicitly to allow for the development of alternative interoperable implementations, using technologies other than those used within the IEDC. Finally, the IEDC acts simultaneously as both a datamodel repository, and a database for storing the data which conforms to those models; a design pattern which permits the actual data modelling process to be deferred to the data-loading phase. Relational databases function best when their datamodel (and hence structure) is determined before the loading of data. As such, this report recommends that further work is required to satisfy the full design requirements of an effective platform for IE dataset exchange.","data modelling; open data; Industrial Ecology; lifecycle assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

MOR is a numerical technique that projects the physical based model, which is also called the high-fidelity model (HFM), into a lower dimension by using matrix decomposition, such that the computational speed can be greatly increased. The reduced order model (ROM) is also known as surrogate model. Obviously, error occurs during the projection process. We want to estimate this error and predict it through building an error model, and to fortify the surrogate model by adapting a parameter estimation. In this thesis, three statistical methods will be adapted to our problem, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and two machine learning (ML) methods: long short term memory (LSTM) and fully-connected recurrent neural network (RNN). The training data is the error of the ROM, which is defined as the difference between the ROM values and HFM values. Efforts have also been made to improve the performance of the error model, including the pre-processing of the data, and several model optimization techniques. The model order reduction method here is a non-intrusive subdomain POD-RBF algorithm, which treats subsurface oil-water flow data by adapting domain decomposition (DD), radial basis function (RBF) and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). The high-fidelity model is generated by Matlab reservoir simulation toolbox (MRST). The error is defined as the difference between the HFM data and the ROM data. Through the comparison of several statistical models, this error can be best predicted by an optimized traditional recurrent neural network.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Instead, the Dutch owner-occupied housing market has overheated not even five years after its recovery. As this could indicate a structural change in the housing demand of households, models were estimated using logistic regression analysis to examine how household mobility has changed following the crisis and position these changes in the context of macroeconomic and institutional developments. Based on the macroeconomic developments, the demand for owner-occupancy was expected to increase after the crisis. For one, the economy was gaining momentum rather than losing it, offering much better prospects for the near future. In addition, house prices were still relatively low and credit cheaper than ever, which greatly increased the accessibility of the owner-occupied sector for lower income households and offered interesting investment opportunities. Regarding institutional developments, the various reforms following the crisis are believed to cause an increase in the demand for affordable owner-occupied housing as a result of the tightened lending criteria in combination with the restricted accessibility of the social rental sector. In addition, the reforms are also expected to polarise households by widening the gap between the rental and owner-occupied sector through equity requirements. The results of the empirical analyses reveal a significant quantitative increase in demand with the intention to move nearly doubling from 21% in 2002 to 39% in 2015. The preference for homeownership itself, on the other hand, remained relatively stable. The most surprising development over time is the convergence of households from different income categories with respect to the intention to move, the preferred tenure, and desired purchase price. It is therefore believed that favourable macroeconomic conditions shortly after the crisis temporarily ameliorated the negative effects of the institutional changes. Further research is necessary to confirm whether the surge in the intention to move is merely a temporary effect of the crisis or an indication of a growing mismatch between housing demand and supply.","household mobility; housing market; economic crisis; housing preferences; housing choices","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

As a result, over 700 kilometers will be strengthened in the upcoming years. Traditional strengthening of dikes consists of strengthening with soil and requires space that is often not available. Further strengthening of dikes, therefore, requires smart solutions, which increase the strength, without changing the dikes cross-sectional area. One of these solutions is the use of sheet pile walls as stability screens. However, in contradiction to all commonly used design codes, including the Eurocode, the current design approach for stability screens in dikes does not allow for plastic calculation. Furthermore, a model factor of 1.1 is applied to the forces and moments, when the sheet pile is applied as a panel. These two aspects make the application of sheet piles as stability screens expensive to apply. A better understanding of the failure behavior is needed to clarify whether the current design approach is conservative. Within the scope of the Flood Protection Program, a cross-project exploration was formed between water boards and the national government at the end of 2014. This collaboration is called POV and the aim is to innovate dike reinforcement which will result in a better, faster and cheaper process. A separate branch of this organization, POVM, is focusing on macro-stability. Within this scope, the use of sheet pile walls as stability screens is investigated. In this context, the Eemdijk test has been performed. This consisted of two full-scale tests up to failure. Although the test was successful and led to many new insights, the reliability of strain measurement data is questionable. The strain distribution, however, is essential in understanding the failure behavior. That is why this thesis addresses the reliability of the measurement data. This is done by means of comparing measurements of different sensor types. Each sensor is then classified using four classes that indicate the reliability. Subsequently, reliable data is used to obtain a curvature distribution. In order to convert strains into moments, a moment-curvature diagram is required, which relates curvatures to moments in the sheet pile. This relationship is obtained by means of finite element calculation of a 4-point bending test. Subsequently, the chosen model is calibrated by means of reproducing the measurement results of three real documented 4-point bending tests. Finally, the model is applied to the sheet pile profiles used in the Eemdijk test. With the obtained moment distributions, conclusions are drawn with respect to the current design approach. Furthermore, recommendations are made with regards to the applied monitoring program and the influence of soil on local buckling.","dike reinforcement; dike design; sheet pile wall; Eemdijk test; flood defence; flood risk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","Eemdijk test","52.2586733,5.3283188"

It is one of the catchments with longest streamflow records, with daily measures of discharge dating back to the beginning of the previous century. Attempts to model streamflow with standard hydrological models revealed that average streamflow was consistently overestimated by the model in the period 1933-1968. Different attempts to explain such anomaly can be found in the literature. In this work we hypothesise that this anomaly could be resolved by considering a time varying root zone storage capacity, represented by a model parameter (Su,max), which has affected the partitioning between precipitation and streamflow. Vegetation is in fact believed to adjust root zone storage capacity to overcome droughts with a return period of about 20 years. To test our hypothesis, a semi-distributed conceptual model, based on the FLEX modelling approach, was used. A time varying Su,max was obtained with two approaches: by calibration of the model parameters in a moving time window, and by derivation of Su,max directly from climate variables. The results show that adding time dependency to Su,max improves the mean flow simulation, however not to a degree that it fully explains the observed anomaly. Deriving Su,max directly from climate variables delivered a better fit to the average streamflow than calibration, which confirms the feasibility of a climate derived root zone storage capacity in hydrological modelling.","Hydrological modeling; Meuse; Root-zone","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the most vulnerable components of a typical Dutch unreinforced masonry building subjected to earthquake excitation is the face-loaded walls. As the Dutch masonry walls are quite slender, this matter is of significant importance. Up to now, codes and standards evaluate the structural integrity of unreinforced masonry face-loaded walls with either force-based or displacement-based approaches. The latter present beneficial advantages, since the rocking mechanism of an out-of-plane wall is considered to be an instability problem. Particularly, for the definition of the demand (in terms of mid-height displacement for an out-of-plane unreinforced masonry wall) for the Groningen Case, it will be based on the design response outlined in New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering Standard (NZSEE) for the Seismic Assessment of Unreinforced Masonry Buildings. Nonetheless, a new rendition of the Shape Factor Coefficient Ci(Tp) and Height Coefficient CHi is necessary, in order to relate the design response with the genuine characteristics of Groningen seismicity. The Shape Factor or Part Coefficient indicates the interaction between the seismic responses of the structural parts and the building, while the Height Coefficient indicates the amplification of the peak ground accelaration through the height of building. The procedure towards the description of the out-of-plane seismic demand is analysed by three parts. In the first part, a series of Nonlinear Time History (NLTH) analyses are performed in single degree of freedom (SDOF) systems. In total, seven SDOF systems are modelled in Opensees. Each of them represents the equivalent SDOF system, according to Eurocode 8, of the considered structures for this research. The SDOF system characteristics as well as the ground motion records for five areas in the Groningen Province are provided from in-house studies of BAM Advies en Engineering. The ground motion records are related to the Draft NPR 9998:2017. Furthermore, two hysteresis rules for the structures are included in the Opensees Models. Hysteretic Rule 1 accounts for low-to-moderate energy dissipation, while Hysteretic Rule 2 for moderate energy dissipation. The hysteretic rules are in accordance with hysteretic behaviour of URM piers under in-plane loading. The geometry, loading conditions and mechanical properties of the piers are chosen to represent the piers in typical Dutch terraced and detached houses. These piers were tested at the Stevin Laboratory of the Delft University of Technology, which provided the data of the tests. Two specific in-plane wall specimens (COMP-2 and COMP-3) are used in this work. The Opensees parameters describing the aforementioned hysteretic rules, are calibrated according to the cyclic tests of these specimens. Next, the NLTH analyses are performed. The deliverables are the Floor Response Spectra (FRS) of each equivalent structure, per hysteretic rule, area and direction. Generally, a response spectrum is a plot that indicates the maximum response of linear oscillators with varying natural frequency or period. The oscillators are excited under the same vibration. Analogously, a FRS indicates the maximum seismic accelaration that the structural parts attract, if they are placed on the respective floor. Since a significant amount of FRS is provided from the NLTH analyses of the 1D Models, the production of Design Floor Accelaration Spectra per area is aimed. Design Floor Accelaration Spectra are “smooth” spectra that can be described by equations and act as an upper bound envelope for all the FRS produced per area. For their derivation, the Newmark-Hall method is applied to the mean Floor Response Spectra of all the structures per area. Consequently, a Design Spectrum per area is produced along with the equations that describe the Shape Factor Coefficient Ci(Tp). The Design Floor Accelaration Spectra efficiently describe the demand expressed in the response spectra of the 1D Models. Nevertheless, in some of the FRS, narrow high amplified spectra are observed with spectral values greater than the design plateau value. These cases are related to stiff structures that did not show proper plastic behaviour in direction X (“weak” direction of the structures governed by openings and rocking piers) and to all the structures in direction Y (“strong” direction of the structures governed by large shear walls), where they remain elastic, with the FRS to be bell shaped curves, highly amplified in a narrow period range around the fundamental period. This raises the necessity of examining if out-of-plane walls can potentially be subjected to these greater accelarations indicated by the narrow high amplified spectra. Therefore, the incorporation of a set of out-of-plane walls in the Opensees Models is decided, in order to compare their actual NLTH out-of-plane responses with their design responses ph. For the definition of the design response, the produced Shape Factor Coefficient Ci(Tp) for the Groningen Case is used. Hence, the second part of this research deals with the extended 1D Models, which are described as two degree of freedom mass-spring systems (2DOF systems). In the extended 1D Models, the nonlinear springs are in series and portray the hysteresis of the buildings and the out-of-plane walls. The hysteretic behaviour of the out-of-plane walls in the Opensees Models are calibrated to the experimental test of one-way spanning, double-clamped out-of-plane wall specimen COMP-7, performed at the Stevin Laboratory of the Delft University of Technology. Twelve wall configurations are considered, as a result of the 4 boundary conditions in the edges of one-way spanning walls presented in NZSEE Norm and 3 considered overburden loads (5 kN, 15 kN and 30 kN). The sensitivity studies in Opensees indicate that the design responses are larger than the NLTH responses for the non-failing walls and predict the failure when it is indicated in the NLTH responses. As a result, the Shape Factor Coefficient Ci(Tp) satisfies also the cases in which the FRS present higher values than the design plateau value. In the third part of the research, NLTH analyses are carried out in a 3D Model that resembles four two storey terraced houses with rigid diaphragms. The finite element method (FEM) software that is used for the NLTH analyses is ANSR-II and the Macro-element based modelling approach is adopted. ANSR-II allows the definition of nonlinear membrane elements to model the structural components. For shear walls and spandrels, specific in-plane backbone curves and hysteresis profiles are provided, being in agreement with the provisions of NZSEE Norm and Draft NPR 9998:2017. Regarding the in-plane rocking piers, no hysteresis is involved. However, the rocking capacity is in accordance with the Norms mentioned above. Triaxial excitations of the 3D Model with 11 sets of ground motions per area are performed in ANSR-II, following the requirements of Annex F of Draft NPR 9998:2017. From the NLTH analyses, the Floor Response Spectra are produced for each of the two floors of the 3D Model. These FRS are compared with the Design Floor Accelaration Spectra derived from the simplified 1D Models. A good predictabilty of the Response Spectra from the Design Spectra is found. Moreover, the Height Coefficient CHi is obtained as the ratio of the Peak Floor Accelaration (PFA) over the Peak Ground Accelaration (PGA). Linear regression analysis related to PFA/PGA ratios in the two floor levels of the structure is implemented per direction and area. The output is the linear equation describing the height effect as a function of height h. This equation has the same format with the one describing the Height Coefficient in NZSEE Norm, hence they are directly comparable. Similar to the 1D Models and for analogous purposes, sensitivity studies of one-way vertically-spanning out-of-plane walls in ANSR-II are conducted. The variation of the walls is retained the same. The out of plane walls in the 3D Model are modelled as beam elements that can rock out of their plane. The behaviour of these beam elements under dynamic excitation in ANSR-II is described by elastic loading and unloading, so no hysteresis is introduced. That is a major difference compared with the Opensees Models. In spite of that, the behaviour of the out-of-plane beam elements in ANSR-II is based on the rigid bodies assumption and rocking mechanism of an out-of-plane wall according to Nonlinear Kinematic Analysis (NLKA). In fact, a good agreement is observed between the capacity curves of the considered out-of-plane walls in ANSR-II and the capacity curves derived from the NLKA method. The results of the sensitivity studies in ANSR-II lead to same conclusions as the ones derived from the sensitivity studies in Opensees Models. That enhances the ability of the Shape Factor Coefficient Ci(Tp) and the Height Coefficient CHi to provide the appropriate design response. As an overall conclusion, it is stated that the Shape Factor Coefficient Ci(Tp) and the Height Coefficient CHi produced in this thesis, can be used for the definition of the displacement demand of one-way spanning out of-plane walls for the Groningen Case, using the displacement-based methodology described in NZSEE Norm. The deliverables serve all the possible factors and parameters that distinguish the characteristics of the Dutch scenario. As the number of the Opensees Models is already satisfying, it is recommended to carry out NLTH analyses in more 3D Models. It is believed that this would further raise the consistency of the deliverables.","out-of-plane; URM walls; seismic; Floor Response Spectra; Height Coefficient; Shape Factor Coefficient; NPR; NZSEE; rocking mechanism; Opensees; Groningen earthquakes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Children with physical disabilities face the issue to be excluded from the toy world of the able-bodied children. Toys with small buttons, heavyweight or the need of two hands for operating are examples which let children with physical disabilities experience failure. Alternative toys are mostly just suiting their abilities but forget about their actual needs. These needs are for example group play, rebellious play and active play. Further, these alternatives lack when it comes to pop culture topics or an aesthetic outer appearance. This insight showed the opportunity to create a toy for the mass market which takes inspiration from the abilities and needs of children with physical disabilities. The project was executed in cooperation with the toy brand Hasbro. Thus, it was possible to base the project on one of their products called NERF blaster. These toy blasters shoot non-harmful soft foam darts. This toy was chosen since it offers team play, active play, role play, rebellious play as well as it covers pop-cultural topics. Thus it is a perfect toy to satisfy the needs of children with physical disabilities. <br/>The project was executed in the following steps:<br/>Analysis<br/>At the start of the project knowledge regarding the topic of physical disabilities, inclusion and the toy itself needed to be gathered. To gain this knowledge, a literature research was conducted. Further, a school for children with physical disabilities was visited as well as a basketball wheelchair club, a trade fair for rehabilitation products and an occupational therapist.<br/>The research concluded with the insight of how a blaster could support the inclusion of children with physical disabilities. Also, a universal criterion was defined which tries to summarise the various kinds of physical disabilities.<br/>Direction forming<br/>The insights taken from the analysis phase were translated into inspirational guidelines. <br/>A matrix was created which combines three determined abilities with the tasks needed to operate a blaster. By using multiple “how-to” questions, different ideas to operate a blaster were generated. Promising ideas were clustered and visualised. Two loops of expert evaluation lead to one final direction.<br/>Concept Development<br/>The core elements of the concept direction were defined to set a focus for the upcoming steps. Necessary measurements of the to-be-designed toy were determined to create reference points. By using CAD modelling, sketching and rough mock-ups, the defined core elements were further developed.<br/> Company Visit<br/>To bring the concept to the next level, one needed to get feedback from the toy industry. Therefore the concept was presented to individuals at the Hasbro headquarter in Pawtucket, USA.<br/>The feedback emphasised the need for a good story for the toy. Instead of going already too much into detail about technical solutions, first of all, the story needed to be convincing. Further, it became apparent that the toy’s trigger had to become universal.<br/>Integration of Feedback / Final Design<br/>As a final step of the project, the feedback was evaluated and integrated into the concept. The outcome was the definition of a theme as well as the market positioning. Further, two parts were changed regarding their function. A test with seven children with physical disabilities was conducted to evaluate one of the reworked parts. Also, the overall styling was adapted to the defined theme.<br/>The report finishes with an evaluation of the created concept. An upcoming step would be to build a fully functional prototype and test it regarding the designs mechanical functionality and ergonomics.","phyiscal; disabilities; toy; NERF; cyborg; inclusion; abilities; dart; blaster; design; play; children; rebelliousness; active","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Goal of the framework is to assist analysts with their decision-making, when assessing whether a new booking should be accepted or declined. Unknown booking dimensions and flight details are forecasted using an ensemble learning method.

(mentor); Schott, D.L. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","In recent years, technologies such as artificial intelligence have enabled computer systems to provide decision support for maintenance planning. Using advanced analytics to determine optimal maintenance actions and moments is called prescriptive maintenance. Multiple prescriptive maintenance models have been proposed for different industries. However, none of these models or frameworks<br/>were designed for use in the FMCG industry. This industry seems to be lagging compared to the oil &amp; gas, process and transport industries for example. The goal of this research is to define a framework that can achieve prescriptive maintenance at a FMCG production plant. This research focuses on the decision making for maintenance on multi-component systems using technologies such as machine learning. The proposed framework uses an intelligent agent-based approach to optimize maintenance planning on a component and system level. The agents act on both levels and negotiate to find an optimal system level result. A life-cycle cost approach was used, where all impact of maintenance<br/>was translated to costs and thereafter minimized. As prescriptive maintenance aims to increase operational efficiency and reduce costs by artificial decision making, the effect of the framework on these KPIs was simulated and compared in a FMCG case study. This case study was done using a discretetime simulation of a cooling compressor system in a beverage production facility. It was found that, given a high-quality prediction of the remaining useful life, this prescriptive maintenance framework can increase a systems operational efficiency and reduce maintenance costs. However, the largest improvement could be seen in the overall production time of the system, as maintenance was planned in such way that loss of functionality was prevented.","Prescriptive maintenance; FMCG; decision making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

Here, a non-linearity like an atom is coupled to a single mode of the electromagnetic field in a cavity. Another field which explores the quantum mechanical nature of photons is Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics (cQED) where photons are the quantized excitations of a superconducting microwave resonator and non-linearity is introduced by the Josephson junction. Like this, setups analog to that of in cavity QED can be copied to cQED, with a number of differences. For example, the photons propagating in a transmission line are more confined and the circuits are made with conventional lithography techniques, allowing for more freedom in engineering the system parameters.<br/>In the first part of the thesis, we build a numerical model in order to examine the feasibility of quenching the ground state of a coplanar waveguide (CPW) interrupted by a tunable coupling element. Next, by means of experiments and simulations we considered the feasibility of observing experimentally a synchronization effect in a driven CPW with its central conductor interrupted by equally spaced capacitively shunted Josephson junctions (Josephson crystal) based on a recent proposal. Finally, we made a first step in understanding the<br/>synchronization from a classical perspective by modelling a Josephson crystal of two junctions as two degenerate non-linearly coupled Duffng oscillators.<br/>Concerning the quenching experiment, we found that the plasma frequency must be tuned faster than 1/f with f the resonance frequency of the CPW, which is in the sub-nanosecond regime and therefore unfeasible with current state the art electronics. We also found that, in contrast to what was claimed in the proposal, the synchronization effect cannot be observed for the parameters common in cQED. One way would be to push the limits of the capacitances to several picofarads. Finally, we found that the non-linear coupling causes the two degenerate non-linearly coupled Duffng oscillator to synchronize, which is a first step in understanding the proposed synchronization effect in a fully classical way.","Josephson junctions; Duffing oscillators; quenching; synchronization; non-linear coupling; cQED; resonators","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Especially the current workings of our economy have a detrimental effect on the environment. To reduce these effects, a transition is being made towards a circular economy. The construction sector plays a big role in the degradation: in the Netherlands the sector accounts for 50% of the raw material use, 40% of the energy consumption, 40% of the waste production and 35% of the CO2 emission. For the construction sector, one of the changes to establish a more circular economy, is the adoption of a circular design method. This method consists of the construction of buildings, building systems and building elements being designed for disassembly and reuse. This reduces raw material use and the expel of harmful emissions. While we see some developments being made in the construction sector regarding circularity, not many developments can be found in the field of reusable floor systems. For the sizable use of raw materials and expel of harmful emissions during the manufacturing process of floors, a more circular design for floor systems can (eventually) contribute to the sectors transition to circularity. Therefore, this research is focussed on developing demountable connections which can be used in such a circular floor system. The result is a system comprising a prefabricated timber-concrete composite (hereafter: TCC) floor slab connected to steel edge beams with toothed-plate connectors. An important aspect taken into account in the development of this design is the efficiency of erecting, disassembling and reassembling the floor. A multi-criteria analysis is conducted to determine floor slabs viable for use in a reusable floor system. A timber-concrete composite floor slab is chosen and designed. The slab is verified using analytical calculations. Design variants are made for demountable connections at the slab-beam positions at the head end and the side of the slab and for the slab-slab position. A choice between design variants is made by reviewing the fabrication and assembly tolerances and by assuring a non-destructive disassembly procedure. Analytical calculations are performed to verify the chosen connections. A case study building is used for the development of the floor system. The TCC floor slab spans 10.8m, has a total height of 510mm and a width of 1800mm. The used edge beam is an L-section. On the web a toothed-plate connector is adhesively bonded onto which the timber beams are placed to enable shear force transfer between the timber beams and the edge girder. At the top of the web a compression bolt is installed which is fastened after instalment of the floor slabs to ensure force transfer between the bolt and the concrete slab. Two angle sections are screwed to the outer sides of the outer timber beams and bolted to the edge girder to guide the slab to its intended position and to ensure structural soundness by vertically fixing the floor slab to the girder. Lastly the limits of the developed floor system are determined by performing a parameter study of the floor slab and the connection. The floor slab can be designed to span 12.6m. The connection still meets the structural requirements when the system is used in a building of maximally 70m high. This is applicable on many combinations of the building length (10m to 70m) and width (6m to 12.6m), if the right cross-sectional dimensions are used.","Demountable; Reusable; Structural design; Connections; Timber-concrete composite; Floor system; Tolerances","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

There is a current lack of understanding of the exact mechanisms involved, partially due to the need for experimental instrumentation able to mimic the microenvironmental conditions present in vivo. As crystal nucleation often initiates at liquid-solid interfaces, the interface morphology plays a significant role in the rate of nucleation. Within the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney, four distinct segments can be distinguished that contain different surface morphologies. Particularly, the cells lining these segments contain protrusions in the shape of nanopillars that vary in length, diameter and spacing. Exploiting the opportunities provided by organ-on-chip technology, we designed and manufactured a microfluidic device proposed to increase our understanding of the exact mechanisms that drive kidney stone crystallization. We used two-photon polymerization to fabricate surfaces that contain these morphologies in materials possessing a Young’s modulus matching the value of the biological structures. After optimizing design and process parameters like laser power and scanning speed, we manufactured nanopillars with diameters in the range of 150-250 nm and aspect ratios up to 100 with which we can mimic the protrusions in the nephron. Pillar arrays were printed on a glass slide, and assembled with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic component (channels 150 um wide). We used high-resolution 3D printing to create master molds used for PDMS soft-lithography. After precise alignment, the two components were brought together and clamped mechanically with a 3D printed holder to ensure a watertight seal between the glass and PDMS.

(graduation committee); van der Veen, Sjoerd (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","In this thesis, a methodology is developed that allows for both reliable and computational efficient robustness analysis of aircraft component distortion. This research applies to dis- tortion caused by reductive manufacturing processes that are used to obtain monolithic components from pre-stressed stock material. With the developed methodology, orienta- tions of any component within rolled plate stock material can be found where distortion is most robust. Part distortion is defined as a deviation in shape of an aircraft component from original intent as a result of the component’s reductive manufacturing process. As extreme precision is required in aircraft component assembly, the distortion phenomenon is highly undesired. The developed methodology in this thesis contributes to AIRBUS’ objectives to minimize part distortion related issues. In this thesis, the fundamentals of part distortion are studied. It is found that aircraft com- ponents distort as a result of residual stresses that are present in stock material from which the components are manufactured. As residual stress in rolled plate is subjected to substan- tial variation, part distortion is stochastic in nature. Positions of the components in rolled plate are searched for where distortion is most robust. The robustness of distortion refers to the insensitivity of distortion to uncertainty in residual stress. A mathematical stochastic representation of residual stress in rolled plate is developed showing high coherence with experimental measurement data provided by AIRBUS. For elementary geometries, the rela- tionship between distortion robustness and residual stress is derived analytically. The developed method for predicting distortion robustness is more than one hundred times more efficient in terms of computation cost compared to state-of-the-art methods and al- lows for reliable robustness predictions. In the developed method, three-dimensional po- sitioning of a component in rolled plate can be simulated where state-of-the-art distortion modeling tools usually stick to one dimension. The developed methodology is put to the test in a case study concerning an aircraft stiffener component. The case study emphasizes the significance of robustness predictions; distor- tion dispersion is found to be relatively large compared to the distortion magnitude and significant correlation is found between the component’s orientation in rolled plate and the level of robustness. Positions of components in rolled plate can be found where distortion is extremely robust. Moreover, a relationship is found between the component’s degree of symmetry and the level of robustness.","distortion; aircraft; component; residual stress; titanium; Robustness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-02-08","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Precision and Microsystems Engineering","",""

Due to climate change, renewable energy is onthe rise. The intermittency of energy, together with its unpredictable supply, are a big hurdlefor the energy transition. Two methods are promising solutions to this problem; large scaleenergy storage and demand response. Since large scale energy storage is not yet economi-cally feasible, demand response has an important role to play in the early days of the energytransition.Using energy when it is generated requires a data-stream from the generation facilities onproduction, which is not (yet) widely available. The market price, however, is an indicationof the scarcity of energy, since it is based on the ratio between supply and demand. Besidesthat, there is a correlation between a low energy price and sustainable energy productionsince marginal costs of sustainable energy production are lower than fossil energy produc-tion. This makes using sustainable energy cheaper that fossil energy, and gives DemandResponse a business case.In this thesis, a Model Predictive Control is created that uses energy market data to minimizeenergy costs. Multiple energy markets are analyzed with respect for their suitability for thepumping station in IJmuiden to act on them. The day ahead market is called the APX inthe Netherlands, and this is where energy is bought and sold the day before consumption.The intraday market, also called the flexibility market, is where energy can be bought andsold up to 5 minutes before consumption. A strategy combining these two markets will beevaluated. This is done by using a predicted day ahead price, generated by a SARIMA model,to create a plan. This plan will then be followed, but deviations from the plan are allowedagainst intraday market price.Due to imperfections of the market (mismatch between supply and demand), imbalances areoccurring. These imbalances result in frequency deviations of the grid, and voltage devia-tions. Tenner, the Dutch TSO (Transmission system operator), is responsible for minimizingthese imbalances. In order to minimize the imbalance, TenneT gives a real-time indication ofthe imbalance on the grid, and positive contributions are rewarded while negative contribu-tions are punished. This is done through the use of the imbalance price; a price per volumeof imbalance caused or solved. The imbalance price is based on the aFRR market, wherebids can be done on possible activation. Since the imbalance market is a fast-acting market,it is not suitable for a large pumping station like IJmuiden. However, the aFRR market willbe analyzed in this thesis.The effects of expected future development, like sea level rise and energy market changes,will be analyzed and simulated as well. A higher sea level would result in more pumping, andless discharging under gravity. Which causes the the pump schedule to become less flexible.The results show that it is possible to apply demand response to a pumping station, and theintraday market makes it possible for the MPC to adjust its energy use during the day.The aFRR market analysis shows a lot of potential for the pumping station, possibly makingup for all energy costs made through the spot markets.The conclusion of this thesis is that Rijkswaterstaat can possibly save energy costs on pump-ing, based on the fixed energy price, provided by Rijkswaterstaat, they pay now. Based ona reference scenario where the MPC only minimizes energy use, and a fixed ENDEX energyprice, the proposed MPC makes about 10% less costs in the German market scenario. TheDutch market scenario does not show cost savings. In the Netherlands there is not muchcorrelation between low energy prices and renewable energy yet, since renewable energy isnot a big part of the energy mix in the Netherlands. This correlation is expected to becomemore present when the Dutch energy mix becomes more sustainable. This is expected toresult in lower CO2emission through the energy use of the pumping station. However, moreresearch is needed to confirm this.","pumping; demand; response; side; management; smart; grid; sustainable; energy; market; day ahead; intraday; optimization; pyomo; ipopt; NLP; mpc; model; predictive; control; schedule; water; ijmuiden; pumping station; ijsselmeer; markermeer; noordzeekanaal; amsterdam-rijnkanaal; rijkswaterstaat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","","52.470852, 4.601499"

Looking at the trends in formal legislation and market developments towards sustainability, these diesel AGVs are most likely to become outdated. Although battery-electric AGVs are an emerging, zero-emission alternative, there are serious technical, operational and financial questions regarding their implementation at brownfield terminals operating 24/7. Taking the northern side of the ECT Delta Terminal in the port of Rotterdam as a case, the operational and financial feasibility of replacing diesel AGVs by a battery-electric AGV fleet have been evaluated by means of a functional design of the AGV charging process, simulation study and total costs of ownership analysis. The results indicate that battery-electric AGVs opportunity plug-in charged at the automated stacking cranes’ transfer points prove to be an operationally and financially feasible alternative to diesel AGVs: operationally under the condition that a sufficient amount of AGVs, charging power and plug-in chargers are installed and financially under the condition that the increasing trend in diesel price and decreasing trend in electricity price will continue in the near future. As environmental legislation for heavy-duty vehicles becomes more stringent while there is a decreasing trend in electricity prices, battery-electric AGVs are most likely to become profitable for deployment at brownfield container terminals. Therefore, this study’s findings could pave the way for terminal operators to replace their environmentally unfriendly diesel AGVs by zero-emission vehicles, potentially becoming the key force increasing the global penetration rate of electric vehicles in heavy-duty industry.","Battery-electric AGVs; Brownfield container terminals; Systems Engineering; Discrete Event Simulation; Total Costs of Ownership; ECT Delta Terminal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-02-07","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor); van Biert, L. (mentor); Aravind, P. V. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The interest in alternative fuels in the maritime sector is growing due to increasing concerns of the effect of harmful emissions. Hydrogen in combination with a fuel cell has a high potential to be a more environmental friendly solution than the commonly used fossil fuel systems. However, the use of hydrogen encounters problems looking at the fuel storage density, safety and the operating profile of a vessel. Hydrogen storage in a material, such as sodium borohydride, has the potential to overcome or mitigate these problems. <br/>The goal of this research is to provide an insight in the technical feasibility of this technology for the maritime industry. Therefore, the following research question will be answered: How does a technical design of a power train using sodium borohydride as hydrogen storage material on-board of vessels perform in terms of power and energy density and in a transient load? There are three important elements in this system: the sodium borohydride, water and the spent-fuel. The hydrogen in sodium borohydride can be released in a reaction with water, resulting in a hydrogen gas and liquid spent-fuel. The energy and power density is determined using the weights and volumes of these separate elements. Both the least, and most compact configurations are considered to determine the operating range of this technology. A model is made and measurements are done on the power demand of the `Stad Amsterdam' to investigate the performance of the system on dynamic behaviour. The most slow components, such as the mix-chamber, fuel cell and the battery system, are dynamically modelled to identify the critical elements in the design. <br/>In the first configuration, all fuels are stored in separate tanks and all the water needed for the process is stored on-board. This results in a low volumetric energy and power density. To improve the density of the system multiple concepts are considered: a concentrated or dry fuel, a volume-exchange tank, on-board water generation and a filtered spent-fuel. Implementing these concepts results in a compact configuration which is more competitive with diesel systems and other alternative fuels. The hydrogen buffer in the mix chamber, the fuel cell and the battery systems are the most important elements influencing the performance of the system in a transient load. A more constant behaviour can be expected by making use of multiple mix chambers. The safety on-board of the vessel still needs attention, especially around the places containing hydrogen gas and where hydrochloric acid is present. It can be concluded that this technology has a high potential for many types of applications in the maritime industry. It will be technically feasible to implement such a system on-board of a vessel. The harmful emissions in this industry can be decreased significantly using this system. Cost and safety of the system are a challenge and, therefore, further research has to be done to realise the implementation of these systems on-board of vessels.","Sodium borohydride; Hydrogen storage material; Feasibility study; Maritime; Fuel Cell; Power density; Energy density; Transient load; Safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

The past years, circularity has become a popular term in the built environment. This approach prefers a more circular way of perceiving the building process. Literature indicates that implementation of circularity in the building process, probably, will require different actors to be involved and different decisions to be made.<br/>The following research question is proposed: <i>“Which actors should be involved (in the beginning of the building process) to ensure circularity (implementation of circular building) throughout all phases in the building process and which actors should influence decision-making?”</i><br/>The following research method is adopted: a literature study, and case study research including interviews. From this literature study, assessment criteria for the case study research can be conducted. The case study research evaluates the actor network and decision-making processes based on three building projects. These projects are:<br/>Townhall in Brummen by RAU built in 2013; The Green House in Utrecht by cepezed built in 2018; and EDGE Olympic in Amsterdam by Architekten Cie. built in 2018.<br/>This thesis concludes that circular-related actors and traditional actors with circular-related resources should be involved and be influential in decision-making in the building process of circular building projects. This study particularly demonstrates the benefit of early on involvement of the following circular-related actors: transformation agent, circularity expert, reclamation expert, dismantler, and legal officer. In order to increase their influence on decision-making these actors should become part of the project<br/>team, or at least be taken seriously and offered room to influence decision-making. Especially, if traditional actors lack knowledge and resources for implementing circularity. Moreover, contribution of their resources to implement circularity is facilitated, if these actors are involved early on. Early on decision-making on circularity, particularly for long-lived layers (in comparison to short-lived layers), is beneficial for its implementation in practice. Later on in the building process, after the initiation and preparation (and design) phase, implementation is difficult.","circularity; sustainability; building process; built environment; actor network; decision-making; circular building; circular economy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Weiland, Siep (mentor); Eil, Hans (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","A relatively new and not rather common technique in construction industry is the use of 3D printers to print architectural structures and buildings. Nowadays, parts of the printed object are build in inside environments, where after the parts have to be transported to their desired location, which is very costly and time consuming. A solution could be to bring the printer to the construction site. However, current printers are not designed to be mobile or to be used directly at construction sites. This is what leads to the topic of this thesis: develop a robust tracking mechanism for the 3D concrete printer nozzle that is able to cope with disturbances that arise when having a mobile printer that is used in outside environments. Current printers have placed a mixing unit next to the construction area, pumping the concrete mixture to the nozzle. In this research, a new design concept is proposed which should displace the whole mixing unit together with the nozzle over the construction area while still ensuring high tracking accuracy of the printing trajectory. This is done by means of a dual staged manipulator. Horizontally spanned cables and an industrial crane account for the coarse displacement, whereas a Stewart-Gough platform accounts for the fine control of the nozzle. Both stages are assumed to be decoupled and by using the Euler-Lagrange approach, two separate models are derived with the corresponding equations of motion. This model is implemented in a fully parametrizable simulation environment in order to test the later developed controllers. Subsequently, a control strategy for the coarse stage is developed. Three control strategies are combined in order to guarantee a robust tracking: robustness by an \hinf controller, anticipation by a feed-forward controller, and slight tracking improvement by additional PI control. The disturbances that are taken into account are: wind, misalignment and support structure deflection. It turned out that the control strategy is able to reject these uncertainties in the simulation. The residuary error is compensated by the fine stage by using a PI control approach. The results show that the Stewart-Gough platform significantly reduces the tracking error to within a range of the desired accuracy. A high accuracy is beneficial for the reliability of the concrete structure and savings on finishing processes.","3D printing; concrete; robust control; tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-15","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Good Haptic feedback not only gives confirmation of a key press, but also enriches the user interaction and improves the usability of interfaces.<br/>This absence of haptic feedback is is generally not an issue when the users field of view is oriënted at the touch interface (as is the case with Smartphones and tablets), problems arise when features in the interface have to be controlled blindly, as is the case in automotive applications, where distraction of the driver results in safety risks. In terms of HMI design, the unique properties of Aito’s HapticTouch system has shown it can potentially solve these issues and even could enrich the user experience of automotive interiors. In reality however, when clients integrate Haptic Touch in their products, its application is generally limited to replacing traditional buttons, reducing its competitiveness when compared to other technologies. Broadly speaking, there two problems: The first one is that Aito has no demonstrators that show haptic feedback integrated with innovative UI designs. The second problem is that at this time, Aito has little experience in combining audio-visual cues with Haptic Feedback. This graduation thesis explores the possibilities in designing an affordable demonstrator that showcases the unique selling points of AITO®HapticTouch technology for automotive applications. To provide a sound foundation for the design process, internal- and external company analyses were done to identify the sustainable competitive advantages of Aito, trends and developments in the Automotive industry (until 2030) and companies/technologies that compete with Aito. Based on insights from the analysis, the following Design Vision has been formulated: Future automotive HMI’s should adapt themselves to the personal preferences of the user(s), taking into account the context the car is used in and the state of mind of the user(s) in relation to their physical and digital lives. With this vision, Aito’s Haptic Touch is central in making the UI contextual and personal to the user, while also being used as an additional channel of communication with the user in e.g. automated driving modes. The demonstrator presented in this thesis embodies this design vision: A light-weight structure with a wide range of personalised features, a minimalistic projection mapped GUI design, contextual to the driving situation and controls that communicate with the user through Haptic Feedback. To validate the design, a prototype version of the gear shifter panel was built to evaluate the use of projection mapping and the quality of the stack designs. The initial validation brought to light there is room for improvement in terms of HapticTouch integration. The estimated building costs were higher than the target price, but for a demonstrator of this complexity still acceptable.<br/>If Aito would decide to continue developing this demonstrator, would therefore be to start small with the individual panels before integrating them into a fu a demonstrator on the scale of the one discussed in this thesis.","haptic feedback; touch-based; piezoelectric; Automotive design; Automotive interior; Automotive industry; Automated driving; Automotive; Product design; HMI design; UX; GUI; UI; Shared autonomous vehicles; Shared mobility; Prototyping; laser cutting; 3D Printing; Projection mapping; interactive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

So why not use speech for digital communications between company and customers? This graduation assignment aimed to examine this by questioning how voice technology could possibly enhance the dialogue between TUI and its customers. <br/><br/>Voice technology is a rather new technology and has not been fully adopted yet by the public. It was found that the technology should be implemented in gradual steps. This way, company and customer can get used to the technology. Also, starting off small and simple enables stimulation of the adoption (Rogers, 1995).<br/><br/>The Brand Driven Innovation model (Boeijen et al., 2013) was used to structure this project and in order to maintain a high focus on the relationship between company and customer. It was found that the company could highly improve the information it provides to the customer throughout their journey. Within the entire customer journey, the “prepare to go” phase was chosen as a scope due to it not being of critical harm to the rest of the journey. After all, the technology is relatively new and, therefore, brings some risks with it.<br/><br/>Experiments aimed at validating assumptions showed that customers are looking for information while preparing for their journey. They are mainly interested in obtaining information about activities (excursions) and dining options (e.g. restaurants). A link with Musement was made, a company that was acquired by TUI and is designed around providing information about both activities and dining options. The voice-based solution, therefore, consists of an integration of the current Musement voice application into one that suits the purpose of TUI and was named the TUI Tour Guide 1.0. <br/><br/>As said, the technology needs gradual implementation and therefore a stepping stone (MVP) was designed: Holiday Trivia. A voice application with which users can learn what type of vacationer they are and obtain holidays and deals tailored to their vacationer type. This stepping stone was designed using a process tree flow to structure the dialogue, which highly limited the errors in the conversation as was found by user tests.<br/><br/>Both Holiday Trivia and the Musement integration (TUI Tour Guide 1.0) are steps towards the future vision, in which a TUI voice-based tour guide provides information along the entire journey in a personal and transparent way. In order to get there, a roadmap has been established in which the voice-based application is expanded step by step.","Strategic Product Design; Voice Technology; Future Vision; Roadmapping; Brand Driven Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The projectaims to develop an ultra-high resolution Earth Observation telescope with aresolution of 0.25m, but with a much lower mass and volume than its competitorscurrently in operation. In order to meet the stringent mass requirements, adeployable primary and secondary mirror are used. However, it is expected thatthe deployment of the optics will introduce severe aberrations in the system,limiting the performance. This thesis project investigated the implementationof phase diversity algorithms as a method for correction of these aberrationsthat does not add additional mass and complexity to the system. Phase diversityalgorithms originate from the field of ground-based astronomy and are rarelyused in space systems. Even less is known about their behavior in EarthObservation telescopes, which typically suffer from larger aberrations thanground-based telescopes. Also, Earth Observation telescopes image extendedscenes instead of point objects. FORTA, a ray tracing application developed ir.D. Dolkens specifically for simulation of the Deployable Space TelescopeOptics, was used for the simulation of the telescope imaging process. A MATLABtoolbox, developed during this project, was then used for simulation of a broadrange of phase diversity algorithm configurations. These algorithmconfigurations numerous methods from the field of imaging, including aneffective method for mitigating wrap-around effects resulting from theapplication of the Fast Fourier Transform. First, the set of algorithmparameters resulting in the optimum configuration in the context of the DSTproject was determined through a large number of parametric studies. Afterthat, it was found through simulations that by using a novel method for theselection of the subframe to which phase diversity is applied a significantperformance increase could be obtained. An analysis of the open-loopperformance of the algorithm showed that the wavefront error in the exit pupilcould be estimated to within a Root Mean Square (RMS) error of 0.07 lambda_0 inover 75% of simulations, where lambda_0=450nm is the smallest wavelengthaccepted by the panchromatic channel, and that a Strehl ratio (SR) of above 0.8was achieved in over 80% of cases. Through the development of an innovativepost-processing method that exploits a priori knowledge of the expected errorshape, both these percentages could be increased to above 85%. Deconvolutionusing a Wiener filter subsequently resulted in the reconstruction of details ofsmaller than 0.25m, in accordance with requirements. In addition, an analysisof the closed-loop performance was done, in which the wavefront error estimateswere used for iterative control of the active optics. This analysis showed thatfor initial Strehl ratios of higher than 0.6, the method would consistentlyincrease the Strehl ratio to a value of around 0.8 or above. However, after anoptimum was reached the method would diverge again. For the reliableimplementation of phase diversity in a closed-loop configuration, an effectivetermination criterion should be developed. Phase Diversity methods showpotential for implementation in the DST project, and it is recommended thatfurther studies are performed. These studies should focus on making the methodmore reliable through identification of inaccurate estimations, as well as onthe joint implementation of phase diversity with other calibration methods sothat the strengths of phase diversity can be exploited and its weaknessescompensated.","Phase Diversity; Aberration Correction; Deployable Optics; Earth Observation; Gradient-based Optimization; Imaging Physics; Space Systems Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Deployable Space Telescope",""

One of the main problems of bridges that utilize this technology is the susceptibility to fatigue failure. Cyclic loading due to wheel loads, in combination with the complex network of welded details, make such types of decks prone to fatigue cracking, which poses a threat to the structure's integrity.<br/>One of the factors that contribute to crack initiation and propagation under cyclic loading are welding-induced residual stresses. The localized heat input, due to welding, and the subsequent cooling, force the adjacent area to undergo expansion and shrinkage, which are, however, restricted by the surrounding material. As a result, residual stresses are formed, which can reach the yield strength of the material in the region near the weld. When these are tensile, they can accelerate the crack propagation rate, thus severely reducing the fatigue life and endangering the structure's safety. Knowing the residual stress distribution in welded joints of orthotropic steel decks can prove to be useful in the evaluation of resistance against fatigue.<br/>In this research project, a finite element model which is able to predict residual stresses in normal strength steel weldments, has been developed. In the first stage of the research, a small-scale welding experiment has been conducted, during which temperature and distortion measurements were derived. The welding procedure was then modelled in the finite element software ABAQUS. Experimental data have been used to validate the accuracy of the adopted heat source model and parametric studies have been carried out, in order to investigate the influence of the heat source parameters and the heat losses on the temperature distribution.<br/>The validated methodology was then applied on a trough-to-deck plate welded connection of an orthotropic steel deck. Longitudinal and transverse residual stresses have been calculated at various positions of the deck and stiffeners. The influence of the welding sequence on the residual stresses has been investigated, by considering two welding scenarios; parallel and sequential welding. The effect of the adopted stress-strain relationship under elevated temperatures on the residual stress field has been examined, by considering an ideal plastic material model and one that includes strain hardening. In addition to these, the impact of the boundary conditions has also been studied. Finally, the effect of welding on the appearance of imperfections is discussed, by considering the deflection of the deck plate, after the process. As a result, valuable information is obtained about the shape of residual stresses, the associated deformations, and the factors that affect them, in a welded connection of an orthotropic steel deck.","Residual stress; Orthotropic steel deck; Finite Element Analysis; ABAQUS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accessibility of art for visually impaired is covered based on the five different senses, from which audio and touch seem most relevant. <br/>This lead to the design goal of making the image, story and expression of paintings intuitively accessible for both blind and ill sighted visitors during an independent museum visit.<br/>The scope is defined, just as the requirements that the final concept should meet and the intended interactions in the interaction vision of unpackaging gifts.<br/><br/>Ideation<br/>From this design goal, the ideation process is started, with help from several visitor scenarios. By doing a creative session with visually impaired and individual brainstorm sessions with multiple input sources, ideas are generated. <br/>These ideas are evaluated and downsized in number, then assessed through PMI (Plus Minus Interesting) and clustered to create a morphological chart. By taking ideas from the different layers in this chart and merging them together, three concepts arose: ‘Take your Technique’, ‘Exploration Table’ and ‘Splitting the Art’. These are worked out into a design sketches and storyboards. <br/><br/>The three concepts are assessed by two experts from the field of visually impaired and two experts of the Rijksmuseum. This resulted into valuable feedback with strong and weak points per concept. On the basis of this feedback, the three concepts are revised and a fourth concept, ‘Portable Exploration Table‘ is created. All of them are assessed through a Harris profile based on the requirements and through the Interaction Vision. Eventually, a decision was made and the ‘Portable Exploration Table‘ was chosen which contains a relief of the artwork, an audio guide and several layers with specific information. <br/>This concept is iterated upon to find the best way to guide someone through an artwork without human interference. Eventually this is done with use of vibration.<br/><br/>Demonstration<br/>This last chapter explains the final concept in detail. Generally, the concept exists out of two main aspects: a basic relief to understand form and composition and layers on top of this to clarify other aspects of the work like materiality or lighting. The worked out prototype focusses on the first part. <br/><br/>The prototype guides people through the artwork in an independent way. It exists out of a relief of the artwork from which several parts can vibrate in order to guide and give feedback. It is accompanied auditory by narration. The vibration mechanism is explored both theoretically and practically through research and prototyping simultaneously. The relief is created through a heightmap. Last, the (background of) the guidelines for the accompanying story are outlined and the story is created . In between the story, complementary sounds are added, like bread and milk.<br/><br/>The prototype was tested by six participants with a visual impairment within the Rijksmuseum. The overall feedback was positive, participants expressed their with to extend this concept to other artwork as well. The possibility of touching is desired although the relief can be strengthened. The vibration was received well and it’s intended use understood. The narration was clear for most participants. It could use a rewind option. The intermediate sounds were received positive as well, for they added to the atmosphere. Scent was mentioned here as well.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the design goal was met fairly well, which is explained thoroughly, and the concept definitely has potential. The recommendations outline further detailing and testing upon the current prototype and the possibility of adding layers on top of the relief. Also the placement and accessibility within museums should be considered well.","Art; Visually impaired; Museums; Accessibility; Relief; Tactile; Narration; Paintings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

One of them is being climate neutral and the other one is to have a circular economy. In order to meet both goals in the best environmental conditions, extensive environmental research is required. This thesis is one of these researches and its main focus is on the climate neutral goal by 2050. In this thesis I start by creating a generic model in ArcGIS that will calculate the required materials and their environmental impacts for the implementation of high and low district heat networks and for air-water heat pumps in residential buildings. The model uses national spatial data of buildings, heat networks, and energylabels and combines them with material data that is retrieved from life cycle inventories (LCI) out of life cycle assessment (LCA) papers, material databases, several manuals, technical specifications on websites and own examination. The model is applied to the Merenwijk in Leiden. The model’s results show that for the Merenwijk the indirect environmental impact of the materials will reduce the total reduction in the heat pump scenario by approximately 10% and will be covered in the first 2 years of operation. On the material demand side, the model shows that the Netherlands will face problems with the demand for glass and glass wool. The current market for both materials should be intensified by 4 to 5 times in order to meet the expected demand. Glass wool demands will even reach 2% of the current global mineral wool market. In conclusion this thesis provides an addition to current environmental calculations by looking at the material environmental impact in the Dutch heat transition. The environmental impact of materials does have a significant impact on the overall environmental calculations.","GIS; LCA; Heat transition; Materials; Environmental impact; Heat pump; District heating; Insulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

First, the emergence of MBSs in a nanowire fluxonium would result in new Majorana signatures, obtained by radio-frequency spectroscopy techniques. This would complement the current experimental evidence for the creation of MBSs in semiconducting nanowires and would allow to characterize their coupling energy scales, that are, up to date, unknown. And second, the nanowire fluxonium devices presented here can be used for addressing a qubit whose state is topologically protected from local perturbations. Integrating topological qubits into a cQED platform would solve the currently existing problems of the lack of a universal set of quantum gates and reliable methods for qubit operation and readout, establishing a path for the development of topological quantum computing.","Nanowire; Fluxonium; Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics; Microwave spectroscopy; magnetic field resilient; Kinetic inductace","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

The easiest example of such an application is QKD, other examples are quantum secret sharing and measurement based quantum computing. Generating a non-local entangled state is however not trivial. Let us assume that there is an entangled state (source state) present in the network before the start of the protocol. One can ask than whether this source state can be transformed to the target state with only local operations. Local operations usually have a lower error rate compared to non-local operations. As the set of all quantum states increases exponentially, we will restrict ourselves to graph states (quantum states described by a simple graph). This allows one to study the graphs and local operations in a graph theory perspective, instead of in a quantum information perspective. In this thesis we investigate the complexity of deciding equivalence of two graph states under local multi-qubit operations (T-LMQC-equivalent), where T refers to the partition denoting which qubits are on the same device which allows multi-qubit operations.<br/><br/>When T consist only of single qubit nodes, this problem reduces to the single qubit Clifford equivalence problem (SQC-EQUIV). It is known that SQC-EQUIV can be solved in O(N^4). On the other side, if all qubits are in the same node, the problem can be solved in O(1) as every source state can be transformed to any graph state on the same vertex set. We will present three algorithms to solve T-LMQC equivalence. The first algorithm solves the problem in general but the running time scales exponentially in the number of multi-qubit nodes and the size of the graph. The other two scale polynomially in the size of the graph, but do not allow for nodes with more than 2 qubits. The remaining question is indeed whether deciding T-LMQC equivalence is an easy (in P) problem or a hard problem (NP-complete).","Quantum information; Quantum networks; Graph theory; Computational complexity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics | Quantum Technology","",""

However, a graphic user interface (GUI) was produced to give greater control over the system. With the GUI a serial communication can be established between Python and the Arduino.

Currently, determining the steady state over historical data is cumbersome, and difficult to do in real time.<br/>Our application aims to solve the problems with the current information workflow by consolidating the functionality that is currently spread across multiple applications into one main application, as well by offering steady state detection over real-time data.

Main conclusions can be found within the emphasis on the standardized sizes and easy connections of these elements and the effect that these decisions have on the design. Other conclusions include 1) the need of the continues involvement of the architect within the project by creating policies for the use of the building by the start-ups and pro-actively stimulate the living lab function of the building and 2) the need for a ‘creative’ architect to combine the different element into ‘good’ architecture instead of just a combination of different element.

The main advantage of this technique is controlled deposition of a monolayer of metal oxides. This project was done to study the effect of ALD on 0.5 m long tubular membranes. TiO2 was deposited on the membranes by means of atmospheric pressure atomic layer deposition (APALD). This is different from most of the reported studies that use vacuum-based ALD. TiCl4 and H2O were used as the main precursors for depositing TiO2 through 2, 3 or 4 cycles of APALD. The growth rate of the deposited layer per cycle under different experimental conditions was measured indirectly using silicon wafers through ellipsometry. The effect of ALD was determined by measuring the membrane permeability and molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) values of the membranes before and after coating. The results obtained showed a variation in growth rate per cycle (GPC) of the deposited layers for different experimental conditions. APALD was performed on 6 membranes and the GPC rate was acceptable for only 2 membranes (0.14 nm/cycle and 0.03 nm/cycle), whereas the GPC for the other membranes was very high (more than 1 nm/cycle). After deposition, the 2 membranes with acceptable GPC rate showed a decrease in MWCO value by 627 Da and 405 Da respectively. These results demonstrated that APALD could be used to fabricate ceramic membranes, but only at proper experimental conditions for TiO2 deposition. An improved Carman-Kozeny model was also developed based on the MWCO value and on the GPC value, in order to predict the porosity and the permeability of the membranes. The results of the model and the measured permeability were compared; for some membranes, the model predicted correctly the permeability after coating.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Vermeersen, Bert (graduation committee); Verhagen, Sandra (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","This research focuses on GNSS users interested in a faster position fix in a situation where the receiver holds limited data. This occurs when turning on a mobile phone or sport watch to use a location-based service, driving out of a parking garage with a navigational device or activating a search &amp; rescue beacon. In these cases, users care more about directly setting a certain action into motion, than waiting until a sub-meter level of accuracy is acquired. For this purpose, we aim to decrease the time to first fix (TTFF) of a receiver at the expense of position accuracy by focusing on its most dominant component: the time to read the first fix data, i.e. the TTFFD. In turn, the TTFFD is decreased by reducing the size of the clock correction and ephemeris data (CED) and integrating this reduced set into the existing Galileo I/NAV message while maintaining backward compatibility. Three reduction strategies are presented to reduce the size of the CED. First, the expression of the CED parameters relative to the matching almanac parameters, which requires downloading the most recent almanac. Second, the absorption of the clock and ephemeris time reference into related parameters by leveraging redundancies in the user algorithm. Third, the truncation of the CED parameters, where the optimal parameter bit allocation per CED size is determined by means of a Monte Carlo simulation. Subsequently, the optimal reduced set is integrated in the existing Galileo I/NAV message, since it is not only size but also the location and repetition rate of the reduced CED in the navigation message that determine the final decrease in TTFFD. A simulation is developed where the three reduction strategies are combined and applied to one year of Galileo navigation messages and almanacs starting from October 2017. The current I/NAV message has a size of 428 bits and an average TTFFD of 25.4 seconds. The relative expression of the CED parameters, the absorption of the clock time reference and ephemeris time reference yield a 76, 15 and 10 bit reduction respectively, without a significant decrease in position accuracy expressed as the signal-in-space ranging error (SISRE). The reduction in size that can be realized by truncation results from a trade-off with the maximum acceptable level of SISRE. When combining all three reduction strategies a 296 bit, i.e. 69%, size reduction can be realized at a SISRE level of 10.04 meters, yielding a 132 bit CED. 66% of the size reduction is in this case achieved by parameter truncation. To maintain backward compatibility, the spare and reserved bits of the I/NAV message are used to integrate the reduced set. This finally results in an average TTFFD of 6 seconds, which is a decrease of almost 20 seconds. With the reduced CED the user gains full independence of out-of-band channels for the computation of a fast position fix. In addition, it decreases the impact of bit errors on the TTFF and increases the chance of receiving an error free set of first fix data. Moreover, the reduced CED is not only of interest to fast fix applications that desire a decrease in waiting time. Positioning based on the reduced set also decreases the time the receiver has to be ""on"" to read the navigation data and consequently the receiver's power usage. This leads to a second type of applications that benefits from the reduced CED: low-power applications that do not require a high accuracy, such as freight management, wildlife tracking and stolen goods trackers. To conclude, the constructed reduced CED provides multiple advantages for a wide range of GNSS users and should therefore be considered as a purpose for the spare and reserved bits of the Galileo I/NAV message.","GNSS; Navigation; TTFF; Galileo; CED; Reduction; ephemeris","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Therefore a numerical model of Delft3D flexible mesh (DFM) was used. Since the model was investigated from scratch, a lot of data analysis and pre-processing was required to have reasonable input data. As input data a surface elevation map, a map with roughness coefficients, the drainage capacity and the infiltration capacity was required. Furthermore data of two typhoon events was available, one event on September 13, 2013 and the other on August 8, 2012 which also was used as input data. For the model in DFM a rectangular grid with a resolution of 50 m was used. The same resolution was used for the input data. A simulation for both rainfall events was done and it was found that the locations with the most intense rainfall and the locations with the highest inundation depths agreed with each other. Furthermore it was found that the highest inundation depths occurred at the same time when the highest rainfall intensities occurred. For most locations the resulted inundation depths were smaller than 0.1 m but there were also several locations with higher inundation depths. Furthermore a sensitivity analysis for all input data was done. It was found that the roughness values had only very few influence on the inundation depths and it depends on the location if the depths increase or decrease with changed roughness values. A higher infiltration leaded to slightly smaller inundation depths, but most of the differences were smaller than 5 cm The highest influence on the inundation depths was found when the drainage capacity was changed. When no drainage system was available, the inundation depths almost doubled. Hence, inundation depths up to 1 m occurred. This can be explained by the fact, that the drainage of rainwater is one of the main functions of a sewer system which was completely neglected in this case. For Jingan district a more detailed unstructured grid was established. Therefore curvilinear grids for the roads and triangular grids between the roads were combined. It was found that this grid leaded to better results because of the more accurate flow directions.","Shanghai; Delft3D flexible mesh; numerical model; urban flood modelling","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Additional thesis","",""

The current climate and environmental crises are in the very first place crises of culture, crises of imagination. [...] An idea in close correspondence with what Joan Didion famously mentioned when contemplating the American countercultural phenomena of the late nineteen sixties and early seventies: “We tell ourselves stories in order to live” (The White Album, 1979). To be at home in modernity is a constant struggle between space and place. The essay considers in a narrative way the longing for places which are stable and deep-rooted, which might be point of reference, of departure, of origin, in times which have declared change to be the purpose of life. It contemplates on matter inventively moulded into the reassuring concealment of ‘a world as we know it’. But also on ‘characters of the road,’ the mad ones, “the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars…” (Kerouac, J. On The Road, 1957). [...] The writings of the Beat Movement among others, unintentionally initiated the downfall of the American dream from moral clarity, pioneers and heroism to vague, meaningless freedom and decades of turmoil, violence, apathy, and a shaky morality. “Things fall apart, the center cannot hold” (Yeats, W.B. The Second Coming, 1920), but in order to make life possible on earth, we, as human beings, construct the world, the philosopher Hannah Arendt wrote. We, as human beings, are in need of a stage for what Arendt defines as ‘action’. A durable situation upon which we can speak, communicate, share and discuss. The shift of modernity from place to space and from durable to more and more temporal artefacts, of which architecture is a very important part while action takes place in the public sphere, renders the homeless mind of modern man. One who becomes hardly able to turn feelings of melancholia, insecurity and imperfection into creativity and reflection. But instead focusses on power, matter and scattering. Imperialistic concealments which narrow his frame of reference and increasingly shorten the range of the probable. A man-centered world that cannot cope with the questions the Anthropocene era poses. Questions of climate crises, hyper-objects and environmental instability, confronting a people who seem to have forgotten that “recognition famously is a passage from ignorance to knowledge” (Ghosh, A. The Great Derangement, 2017 p. 4). [...] A more suitable balance between the human and non-human is being advocated to widen the range of the probable and expand the understanding of modern man. By acknowledging instead of rejecting that technological and natural incomprehensibilities are not something outside of the human, but being human precisely exists out of the continuous scanning and incorporation of it, it becomes possible to confront oneself with the non-human actors and their effects on being human. By considering the human mind as ‘artefactual,’ an object made by human beings, it can be levelled with non-human actors and be recognized as a part of this. As long as architecture, a physical translation of the relationship between man and his surroundings in search of a place to call home, is understood and developed as an ‘attempt to bridge the gap’, it can be a vital practice in questioning what it means to be human, at home in longing.","Architecture; Anthropocene; Climate change; Environment; Inhumanism; Imperialism; Modernity; Hannah Arendt; American Dream; Humanism; Anthropology; Home; Anthropocentrism; Kairos","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","At Home in Longing - An architecture of the attempt",""

(mentor); Zong, H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","This project proposes a series of experiments that involve plasma synthetic jet actuators. The first experiment will perform a jet characterisation experiment that will research the effect of orifice geometry on the overall performance of the actuator. The second experiment will built upon the first experiment and will use a plasma synthetic jet array to combat leading edge separation of a NACA 0015 airfoil at Re=1.7⋅10<sup>5</sup> and U∞=10 m/s and improve the overall performance of this particular airfoil. Special focus will be put in uncovering the underlying mechanics of plasma synthetic jet actuation operating in leading edge separation conditions and how performance is dependent on the actuation frequency. From the jet characterisation experiments a clear performance trend of actuator efficiency with respect to the converging cone angle (θ) is found. The optimal optimal orifice angle is expected to lie between 45º&lt;θ&lt;69º. These geometries experience ∼20% higher jet velocities than the baseline 'straight' orifice, which results in larger mass expulsions and an overall more efficient operation of the actuator. Additionally it is found that adding a small diverging section to the orifice improves upon the electro-mechanical efficiency of the plasma synthetic jet actuator. PIV measurements show that this is due to the increased effective orifice area which allows for higher mass flows through the orifice but also the jet velocities remained of similar order as the optimal converging geometries. The flow control experiments show that plasma synthetic jet actuators can indeed improve the performance of a NACA 0015 airfoil at Re=1.7⋅10<sup>5</sup> and U∞=10 m/s. The force balance measurements show that PSJ actuation suppresses the hysteresis loop present when actuation is absent. Furthermore the angle at which maximum lift is achieved is shifted by ∼7º increasing the maximum achieved lift by ∼23%. Additionally, flow separation can be delayed by about 2º reducing the drag by about ∼40%. Furthermore, the PIV measurements show the mechanisms behind flow separation control. At moderate stall angles flow reattachment is feasible if the actuation frequency is high enough. At higher angles of attack the separation point moves upstream of the actuators and renders the array incapable to suppress flow separation. However, at these conditions the actuators are still able to influence the separation region and higher frequencies, with an optimum of F<sup>*</sup>=1, are capable to suppress the separation area more. If the above-mentioned experiments translate to aeronautical applications plasma synthetic jets might be a game changer when it comes to demanding flight conditions. Not only is plasma synthetic jet actuation capable of diminishing the hysteresis effect it is also capable of considerably increasing the lift and decreasing the drag forces. These effects can considerably improve the safety of aircraft as the omission of hysteresis can reduce unwanted unsteady loads that advance structural fatigue and the higher lift coefficients reduce the need of high lift devices allowing them to become smaller and less complex in the future. Overall this allows aircraft to fly at more demanding flight conditions than previously feasible.","Plasma actuators; Active flow control; Aerodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Until the invention of the steam engine, people were still closely bound to their cities and villages as traveling from one city to another could take up a full day. This made it hard to stay in contact with people in different places, but for example also hard for countries to be governed from a centralized position. When the train was introduced the world started to rapidly develop; different cities suddenly were within an hour’s reach and it became possible for organizations to work at national and later transnational scales. Nowadays, after years of technological developments, mobility plays a key role within our globalized world. Infrastructure connects people and places around the world and allows for transnational economies to exist. Globalization, and with it industrialization, has brought us a lot, but there are also a lot of negative side effects, such as air pollution. It is therefore of great importance to keep innovating within all professional fields in order to grow towards a balanced and sustainable world. In the field of transportation, Hyperloop seems to be a promising new development, that might eventually partially substitute flying and other modes of transport. It is up to us as architects, designers, and urban planners, to think how these new modes of transport will influence our cities and landscapes so they don’t lead to new forms of congestion and border conditions. Furthermore, in this phase of the development we can still think of a more innovative use of the technology.

Another prediction is that migration flows will increase, which means that diversity still will be a big topic in the future. Nowadays Amsterdam houses many nationalities and subgroups. Analyzing Sloterdijk, its demographics show more than 50% of the population is from non-western background. The people had to deal with the consequences of segregation in spatial, social and economical way. Problems as loneliness and a high unemployment rate are reason to doubt the approach of Amsterdam of dealing with integration of lower social classes and immigrants. What will happen when diversity will grow? Will this lead to a bigger segregation? Segregation arises where different groups of people aren’t meeting each other anymore and therefore do not understand each other’s world. The Slotermarket will form a new inclusive center for the local community in Sloterdijk in the future garden city 2.0. The building will house a market where different people of Sloterdijk can sell their goods next to each other. The market should be an inclusive place where different cultures could find their place now and in the future as migration flows are unpredictable. Therefore a flexible structure of pixels is made. On top of the retail functions, housing towers appear above the roof that covers the market. The roof functions as a connecting element, embracing all the pixels underneath the roof. On the other hand the roof is the meeting spot for the residents of the tower. Bridges are connecting the housing towers to the roof gardens with green houses. The inhabitants of the towers share several amenities as cars, workplaces, a sports room, a dining room and thus gardens and greenhouses on the roof. In this market a new typology is proposed: the city in a building, inspired by the souk and bazaars in the Middle East where the market is integrated in the streets of the city and by that is interwoven in the urban fabric. The Slotermarket is interwoven in its surroundings by embracing the green structures of the garden city. The future life in the garden cities will be focused around the ideals of social interaction, participation, sharing facilities and food production.<br","Amsterdam 2050; Sloterdijk; Gardencity; Market; Housing; Inclusive design; Complex projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Complex Project",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Designing a controlled offshore system is a challenging process, the system dynamics are often nonlinear and subjected to loads that are random in nature. Furthermore, the proper description of the system’s dynamical behaviour involves knowledge pertaining to several fields. Unfortunately, at the design level, the process is often segregated between the different fields which are using highly advanced technology from their own discipline on overly simplified models relating to the other disciplines. This thesis focuses on creating a generic framework enabling appropriate modelling and analysis methods for controlled offshore systems considered as a whole. To create a virtual prototype of the system in a generic and modular way, the modelling is based on the formalism of multibody dynamics coupled to hydrodynamics. Generic methods for the linearisation of the system equations are introduced and implemented to enable analysis in both the time and frequency domains. The short term statistics are also provided in both domains, using spectral analysis in the frequency domain and time traces in the time domain. These different modules can be used to build the complete model, including control and study the system using classical techniques. Lastly, an approach to efficiently compute the workability plots is proposed as they are an important performance indicator of offshore systems. The considerable increase in computational speed gained through this approach opens the door for new types of insights such as parameter optimisation and sensitivity analysis. This holistic view of the system should allow engineers to take the right decision during the early phase of the design process by allowing them to explore different integrated design solutions and understand the influence of design parameters on the system’s workability. The example of a motion compensated gangway is used throughout the thesis to illustrate how the developed framework and methods can be used in practice.","Controlled Offshore Systems; Workability; Mixed Time-Frequency Domain Approach; Workability Sensitivity; Linearisation of Differential Algebraic Equations; Coupled Multibody and Hydrodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

In this thesis a research is done to give an answer to the main question: ‘Is there an environmentally friendly and economically attractive coating for the shipping industry that deals with biofouling’.<br/>The best approach examined by multiple criteria, is the use of a Hard, Inert Coating. Toxic compounds, like zinc anodes and copper, won’t be released into our waterways anymore. Therefore, the sediments of rivers and ports are better protected from pollution. Which will benefit the water quality and the public health. <br/>The Hard, Inert Coating is the solution to prevent the NIS (non-indigenous species) problem. Because the vessel will be cleaned before leaving the port, no more marine organisms will be transported from their own ecosystem to another. Governments and port authorities will save a lot of money by preventing this problem. <br/>Clean hulls will give less resistance and will save a lot of fuel consumption and improve its speed. Worldwide, the Hard, Inert Coating system could save $70.000.000.000 worldwide in one year. The sixteen largest ships in this world provide just as much pollution as 800 million cars. If you save 30 percent on fuel, it’s like you’re taking 240 million cars off the road. <br/>As Hard, Inert Coatings are clean and do not emit harmful substances, more jobs in North- West Europe will be created. Currently, most ships go for repairs to dry docks in southern Europe and the Persian Gulf. Ruling on the use of toxic compounds are less observed here. By introducing a Hard, Inert Coating repainting is no longer required, and ships can be dry docked without any negative effects on the environment. In other words they can dry dock ”clean”. This will substantially increase the amount of work for ship repair yards in North- West Europe as owners do prefer these yards for technical and availability of service reasons. <br/>The use of a 100% non-toxic coating to tackle the age-old problem of biofouling, will benefit the ecosystems all over the world. Different from the current situation, no more marine organisms will be polluted and killed. No more toxic chemicals will be released into the sediments of our ports, rivers and oceans. No more toxic substances will be absorbed by organisms and end up in our food chain. Our public health is continuously in danger by the fact that the toxic chemicals are released continuously day in day out. <br","Biofouling; Coating; Coating system; Shipping Industry; Hard coating; non-toxic coating; alternative coating; in-water cleaning; pollution of waterways; Fuel consumption; antifouling coating; antifouling; toxic coating; NIS-Problem; clean oceans; clean waterways; public health; pollution aquatic organisms; vessel improvements; fouling release coating; hard inert non-toxic coating; sediment pollution; biocides; food chain","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Grand Motel explores the idea of luxury. It does so through the XIX century Grand Hotel- type and the grandeur of landscape as an authentic form of Irish luxury, synthesised with the model of the Motel, articulated through a sequence of touristic architectures along the stretch of the West Irish coast. <br/>The Grand Motel literally deconstructs an old model of luxury, as it was framed in the architecture of the Grand Hotel, through the context of Irish landscape. It is designed as a touring route composed of five self-sufficient day stretches around the remote county of Donegal. The vast lobby, bar, pool, shop, private room and even the ballroom are seen here as the support structures for the experience of different types of physical landscape. These structures together with a new system of service aim to unfold the authentic Irish luxury, providing conditions for an active process of engagement with nature. <br/>What does luxury mean for architecture today? It has no fixed formal definition. Thus, it is interesting to rethink its meaning yet again. “Elegance is refusal”, argued Vogue editor Diana Vreeland. And I think I agree. In these terms, true modern luxury could be seen to reside in an appreciation of its absence. Its idea is not about extravagance, but rather about reduction. And in this way, the Grand Motel takes a critical attitude towards the shifting ideas of luxury, landscape, service and economy.","luxury; motel; grand hotel; Ireland","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","The Berlage Post-MSc in Architecture and Urban Design","","54.6538 -8.1096"

Since its implementation in 1912, the border fluctuated in its permeability and meaning, for there it witnessed great periods of instability, quietness, denial and insignificance. When the “Good Friday agreement was signed” the common ground of the EU helped blur the choice between a united island of Ireland and a united kingdom. Today, the Irish border, is just another Irish landscape that is only relevant because of its location, and that seamless transition, is once again to be debated in the aftermath of Brexit.<br/>Given the glacial pace of the Brexit negotiations, the issue of the Irish border might not be resolved by 2020, in fact it might not be resolved by 2040.<br/>Borders are never resolved, they change…<br/>Hence, instead of designing a border, the project designs borders. In this moment of uncertainty, what is/are the future(s) of the Irish border? Like all borders, the Irish border was designed, drawn like a sharp line on the map, splitting the spaces hindering its precise cut through the territory.

This is narrated through the story of an extended fictionalized Irish family and is explained through the drawing of a family tree across seven generations. Seven house types are identified to discuss significant changes. <br/>The first four house types, moments are historical– the agrarian cottage, the Anglo-Irish big house, Suburban semi-detached house and the one-off. The survey of these first four moments results in the territorial artifact of the rural Irish village, consisting of a mix of these types. The project specifically addresses such villages along the Atlantic corridor and speculates new forms of communality through the three new types introduced. The fifth house is reactivated as productive space for working. Within a new social reality where individuals work from home this new type creates a large enclosed village green with a perimeter of single houses. The sixth house is a self-build house within a dense allotment system, designed to contain sprawl and protect agricultural activities. The seventh moment re-designs vacant houses around a cul-de-sac within the existing suburban estates converting them into sheltered housing and co-working spaces.<br/>It is within these house types – past, present and future that the story of the family operates in. Projective designs will be layered within this framework and subject to the same analyses and presentation techniques as their historical precedents. Placed alongside one another, the method of the project seeks to collapse, or at least interrogate, traditional divisions within the production and representation of architecture: technical and narrative; as-built and as-used; historical and contemporary etc.","House; Community; Rural; Ireland; Family","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","The Berlage Post-MSc in Architecture and Urban Design","",""

The essence of this project as the name suggest, is to combine two residual industries in Ireland, farming and the pharmaceutical industry into one new synthetic architectural type, The Farmacy. These Farmacies, house a pharmaceutical production facility within the traditional scale of the smallholding or farm, while using the authentic spatial model of the Irish monastery. It provides an alternative to the existing fragmented pharmaceutical production landscape. In its density, scale, repeatability and seriality it continues to define an architecture of rural Ireland, while they also give a much-needed identity to an economically important emerging industry.","Ireland; Brexit; Pharmaceutical; Farming; Architecture; Ramon Scharff; Scharff; Border; Industry; Pharmacy; Donegal; Highway; Atlantic Corridor; Countryside","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","The Berlage Post-MSc in Architecture and Urban Design","The Farmacy","54.62616, -8.1028"

The landscape has been used not only to challenge the peloton physically but also as a visual background for the event that has been broadcast worldwide. Tour of Ireland was first organised in 1953 as a part of An Tóstal, an Irish cultural festival, and was terminated in 2009 due to a financial shortage. The project proposes a new Tour of Ireland, whose stages exploit the varying topography of the country and promote the skill of a particular kind of racer — the Puncheur. The architect in this scenario operates as an event planner who demarcates a route, an infrastructural planner who provides structures and services, and an iconographer who depicts the landscape quality in different perspective. The project looks to enhances the spectator physical experience of watching the cycling race by providing multiple and different perspectives and a heightened experience. In addition, it also promotes the elongation of sports infrastructure beyond the short time span of a specific event, providing a structures that have a longer life span and more diverse set of uses. bicycle race is used as a catalyst to present a new and meaningful interpretation of the landscape culturally and technically, to change the way people see the landscape as a background to a representative artefact of the country.","Bicycle race; Tour of Ireland; Puncheur; Observation tower; Iconography; Landscape; Event planner; Infrastructural planner; Iconographer; Ireland; County Donegal; Atlantic Corridor; 2040 National Planning Framework; Brexit; Wild Atlantic Way","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","The Berlage Post-MSc in Architecture and Urban Design","",""

The project proposes a mid-sized distillery that downsizes and deconstructs, and where the production of whiskey is broken down into seven stages and spaces. The distancing, of one stage of production from the next, simultaneously acts to maintain flexibility in the number of participating landowners, and the size of production. It creates moments of serendipitous encounter between the visitors, the commuting workers and the locals where it crosses the fields, the paths and the roads, and forms spaces of seating or shared facility for distillery by-products. The central space of the distillery navigates between the realms of production and domesticity. Different stage of production, requiring distinct temperatures, materials and tools, create unique experiences in the encounters. The possibility of the new distillery working as a co-operative consolidation of parts, and the potential to form a wider local, and regional network of shared logistics and flow of people in macro scale, present a different form of development for the Irish countryside as opposed to the mono-centric development of the east of Ireland. Rethinking the architecture of production in countryside opens an array of possibilities. Distillery, while acting as an economic anchor to re-establish the connection to the place in the dying countryside, also hold the potential to become a physical, social platform of exchange between people of different backgrounds. Architecture consolidates the countryside sparsity and provides spaces for the encounters of the people. This is not blindsiding the economic logics of the production, since this very nature of fostering meaningful interaction impart to the value of the final product, as displayed by the effort put in by existing distilleries to bring visitors to experience the process in person. In post-capitalism society of today, architecture of production holds a new spectrum of functions to explore as means of extreme efficiency to mobilizer of people.","Production; Countryside; Ireland; Community; Distillery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","The Berlage Post-MSc in Architecture and Urban Design","","54.67411 -8.03951"

(mentor); Rosbottom, D.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The project explores the idea of exhibiting animals both in literal terms – the zoo for instance as a space for the display and containment of animals – and as a metaphorical construct for architecture’s relationship with nature, with enclosures and with artefacts. The Bestiary is proposed as a new way of exhibiting animals and as a new program to reappropriate “Big Houses” in Ireland and their adjacent demesnes. Sited in Hazelwood Forest which located just over 3 kilometers outside the town of Sligo in northwest Ireland, the project A Donegal Bestiary has a 28-hectare demesne and an 18th-century Palladian style country house. The Hazelwood House was destroyed during the Irish revolutionary period in the early 20th century and have been abandoned until now. By bringing the idea of the Bestiary – a compendium of beasts generating moral lessons for the observer – the project stands as a new model for the contemporary zoo. The Donegal Bestiary involves a process of integration of the animal into the found Irish landscape, allowing each party to influence the development of the other, far from the outdated idea of animal exhibitionism. It as well gathers within its territory a wide selection of local species that are naturally inhabited in the Irish landscape. The Big House, where the project is sited, was a house for the outsiders and once a colonial stage, it is reconstructed as the reversal of a universal reality, where the animals become the protagonists and the human become the observer, the outsider. The Donegal Bestiary is therefore an opportunity that can be utilized and manipulated with the adequate scientific and spatial practices, to generate targeted outcomes: reintroduction of extinct species, educational purposes, ecological integration and landscape recovery of the abandoned estates. In this sense, the project stands for 5 propositions: it is Bestiary not Zoo, Reintegration not Importation, Irish not Exotic, Big House Solution not Ghost House and Ecology not Tourism.","bestiary; Anglo-Irish big house; Ireland; ecology; nature","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","The Berlage Post-MSc in Architecture and Urban Design","",""
