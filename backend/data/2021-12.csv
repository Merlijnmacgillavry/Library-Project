(mentor); Vogt, M.R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy rely on climate­ and weather conditions, like sun irradiation in the case of solar energy, and wind speed in the case of wind energy. These change throughout the day and with the seasons. There are periods of little wind, and during the night there is no sunlight. During periods of no sunlight and little to no wind, there is still a demand for energy. This leads to a shortage of energy. On the other hand, there are periods when the amount of available wind­ and solar energy will surpass the demand for energy, leading to an energy excess. To mitigate this mismatch between energy production and energy demand the excess energy can be stored to be used during periods of shortage. Many different solutions for this have been investigated in recent years. One of the storage technologies that is currently quite dominant is battery storage. Lithium-ion batteries are used quite widely, among others in battery electric vehicles. However, the use of batteries as a storage device to overcome energy mismatch is not yet implemented on a large scale, as most battery technologies are still quite novel, making them <br/> uneconomical for this use compared to traditional hydrocarbon fired power plants. Furthermore, many battery technologies depend on scarce and expensive minerals. Recently, a battery utilizing silicon as its anode and oxygen from the air at the cathode has been proposed. This so­called silicon­-air battery utilizes mainly silicon and oxygen, which are the two most common elements on earth. Furthermore, the theoretical energy density of this battery type was shown to be significantly higher than the energy density of lithium­-ion batteries. Because of this, the silicon­-air battery has been a growing area of research in the last years.<br/><br/>Battery models help to simulate batteries based on empirical data and electrochemical systems. These models are a powerful tool in the evaluation of the performance of batteries. Parameters of the battery can be altered quickly and specifically. This can provide a powerful analysis tool to determine weaknesses in a batteries. They can also help in further developing an understanding of the operating principles of the battery technology. A specific type of model is the finite element model. In this type of model the object that is modeled is divided into small pieces and for each piece a set of (partial) differential equations is evaluated. Different electrochemical, chemical, physical and mathematical models can be modelled and combined in this tool. For this thesis a finite element model of an alkaline silicon­-air battery is developed in COMSOL. The model is based on an earlier model that was developed in 2020.<br/><br/>Besides the discharge mechanism, alkaline silicon-­air batteries are subject to two secondary reactions that hinder the performance of the battery: corrosion and passivation. Corrosion consumes a large part of the silicon without contributing to the discharge. Passivation creates an oxide layer on the surface of the silicon electrode, stopping the discharge reaction. Both these reactions have been implemented in the model. Besides that, a metal contact on the silicon anode is implemented in the model. The parameters used in this model are supported by empirical values for these parameters. Finally, the model was compared to experimental results.<br/><br/>The simulation of the discharge of the alkaline silicon­air battery was improved in several ways compared to the pre-­existing model. The corrosion was shown in the simulations, although the mechanism is somewhat simplified because of the 1D nature of the model. The passivation reaction was shown in the simulations as well, and was improved on compared to the previous model by breaking it up into two steps. Using this model, experimentally observed trends could be simulated reasonably well. The simulated discharge potential was a close representation of the experimental data, although the open circuit potential was somewhat higher, and for higher current densities the potential was somewhat lower. For different electrolyte concentrations the model showed results similar to what was found in experiments.","FEM; Silicon-air; Battery; Renewable Energy; Energy Storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In future decades, coasts will be exposed to increasing risks because of climate change and sea level rise, which poses an increased threat of coastal inundation, erosion and ecosystem loss. The natural variability of coasts can make it difficult to identify these impacts. Most beaches worldwide show evidence of recent erosion. Sea level rise is currently not necessarily the primary driver, but will become very relevant in the future. Understanding both the short-term and long-term development of a coast is considered essential for coastal managers, in order to maintain safety in the future. For a generic evaluation of the state of the coastal zone, it is also important that not only the coastline changes are examined, but also the behavior of the dunes. The interactions between transport mechanisms should be investigated in order to make a good prediction of the large-scale and long-term development of the coastal zone. Therefore, the adaptation of the dunes and the coastline to interacting cross-shore and longshore sediment transport processes must be studied. To get a comprehensive view on those interactions, a new coupled surfzone-dune model is developed and validated.<br/>This coupled model consists of a combination of coastline model ''Unibest-CL+'' and coastal profile model ''the CS-model''. The coupled model has the capability to simulate beach and dune evolution at decadal to centennial timescales including the relevant sediment transport processes that impact the beach and dune evolution: dune erosion and overwash, aeolian dune build-up, beach erosion and accretion due to gradients in longshore sediment transport, adaptation to sea level rise and response to nourishments. The model is tested quantitatively based on the sediment balance, in a very simple and a more complicated academic case focused on the individual effects of all transport mechanisms included in the coupled model. All test cases in the simple case -- which consist of the smallest scale situation the coupled model is able to simulate -- demonstrate sediment conservation and therewith confirm that the implementation of the different transport equations and their interaction in the coupled model is correct. In the complicated test cases – covering a varying number of cross-shore profiles along a larger stretch of coastline – the accuracy of the predicted sediment fluxes and the subsequent coastline and dune volume changes have been determined. The accuracy of every individual transport mechanism included in the coupled model is found to be sufficient and the different sediment fluxes within the coupled model are balanced.<br/>After model testing, the model is used to hindcast the 22-year long coastal evolution near IJmuiden. The dune evolution in this highly dynamic case is simulated reasonably. Furthermore, the coastline evolution is predicted in accordance with the data. Overall, the coupled model is found to quantitatively and qualitatively perform satisfactory. The model is capable of quantifying the long-term beach and dune evolution with interacting longshore and cross-shore processes. Though coupling the models and therewith simulating the longshore sediment transport gradients instead of deriving them from data induces model uncertainties, the application of the model on the IJmuiden case shows that it is possible to simulate the longshore sediment transport gradients using a schematized wave climate to predict the dune volume evolution sufficiently. Furthermore, the interaction between the cross-shore and longshore sediment transport processes enables the simulation of the redistribution of nourishments, improving the predictive ability of both model components with regard to the coastline evolution as well as the evolution of the dune volume. For future research it is recommended to use the coupled model to look into nourishment strategies and their effectiveness on the long-term, climate change scenarios and their effect on decadal to centennial scale dune and beach evolution and the relative importance of different transport mechanisms on the long-term beach and dune evolution.","Coastal; Modeling; Erosion; Enigineering; Model; coastline change; Coastal profile; cross-shore sediment transport; dune; dune erosion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Brik-II satellite is a Nano-Satellite which has the main objective to be a technology demonstrator and prove the use of self owned military satellites. One of the payloads onboard the Brik-II satellite is called the Store and Forward payload. It has the capability to Store and Forward messages from and to different military assets. To demonstrate this capability it has been purposed to design and install a communication system onboard the Royal Netherlands Navy submarines enabling communication with Brik-II. Subsequently, this would be a good way to demonstrate the performance and operational relevance of such system.<br/>The first step was to identify the problem that should be solved. The main objective of this MSc thesis was to design, manufacture and test an operationally deployable communication system for the submarines operated by the Royal Netherlands Navy. Based on the main objective and consultation with the Navy the requirements of the system were compiled. From the requirements it was concluded that there are a number of similarities between the Remote Radio Station (RRS) and the submarine communication system. However, the antenna system installed on the RRS cannot meet the size requirements. Therefore a new antenna systems had to be design that would comply with the requirements. This has been the main focus of this MSc thesis.<br/>To find the optimal design for the antenna, a simulation tool for the communication between the submarine and Brik-II was developed. In the model different antennas were tested to identify the optimal design. The type of antenna used in the optimisation is a helical antenna. Once the optimal design was identified it was manufactured used the 3D printing facilities at the 982 Squadron in Dongen. Hereafter, measurements were conducted to verify that the radiation pattern of the antenna corresponds with the predicted radiation pattern. The similarities in shape between the predicted and measured pattern were evident. However, the measured gain of the antenna was lower than the predicted gain. To meet the requirements the losses will have to be mitigated. Multiple solutions were purposed to reduce the losses. A communication test between the antenna and the satellite could not be conducted due to technical difficulties during testing.<br/>Part of the main objective was to develop an operationally deployable system. This first prototype developed in this MSc thesis provides a basis for further iteration. The current design imposes two constraints on the deployability. First the antenna gain losses have to be mitigated since the lower gain results in less than required data throughput. The losses can be reduced by implementing the proposed solutions. Second, the choice of a helical antenna with an omnidirectional radiation pattern results in an increased chance of detection by possible adversaries. This functional constraint cannot be remedied due to the size requirements. In conclusion, the antenna design proposed in this thesis gives a basis for a system that can provide added value to the operations of the submarine.<br","Communication; Submarine; Satellite; SATCOM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-23","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); de Reuver, G.A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Open banking is an evolution driven by new regulations, advance in technology, competition, and change in customer expectations. Open banking is about enabling consumers to share their financial data with authorized third parties in return for more personalized products and services. However, the adoption of open banking products and services is still very limited. Consumers are also not familiar with the open banking environment and are not well informed about the new regulations such as PSD2.<br/>Previous studies have shown that the success of open banking depends on: the safe transfer of the financial data and on the control consumers have over their data. Moreover, literature around the disclosing of financial data has demonstrated that consumers are unwilling to share their data, with privacy concerns being the dominant factor. Further, the new data economy brings a lot of around who actually owns the data and what data ownership leads to.<br/>To explore the adoption of open banking among consumers, this study combined the technology acceptance model with external factors related to consumer personality attributes. Through intensive literature review, three dimensions are identified as crucial: psychological ownership, user’s privacy concerns, and technology readiness. A conceptual framework was developed along with nine hypotheses. The data was collected via an online survey. The reliability and validity of all the constructs were assessed. The hypotheses were tested through structural equation modeling using the SmartPLS software.<br/>The results of the analysis indicated that the conceptual model was a good fit. The analysis indicated that there is a strong and significant effect on the intention to use open banking products and services. Specifically, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were important predictors for intention to use. Although psychological ownership had a negative effect on the intention to use, it showed a significant total effect through the mediating effects of perceived usefulness and ease of use. While the results of privacy concerns were insignificant, the technology readiness construct registered a total positive effect through the mediating role of the technology acceptance model on the intention to use. These findings allow the understanding of what affects the consumer’s intention to use open banking products.<br/>The study supports the literature by being the first study to include the construct of psychological ownership to the technology acceptance model. Although the results are quite encouraging, the generalization should not be based on one single study. Future studies could use these findings to explore more the effect of psychological ownership on the disclosing of personal and financial data. Furthermore, by being a pioneer in the topic of open banking, the study provides banks and financial organizations with new insights on the consumers’ adoption of open banking products and services.","Open Banking; Psychological Ownership; TAM; Consumer Adoption; Financial Data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(graduation committee); Veeger, H.E.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The main resistive force acting on the wheelchair during manual wheelchair propulsion is the rolling resistance. The magnitude of this rolling resistance is heavily influenced by the actions of the wheelchair user. By optimizing how wheelchair athletes move, this rolling resistance can be minimized, thereby improving their effective power output. However, in scientific literature, there are no dynamic models that analyze the direct effect of the wheelchair user’s actions on the rolling resistance. To fill this research gap, this master thesis was initiated. In this master thesis, a simulation model is created that can calculate the rolling resistance directly from the wheelchair user’s actions. This inverse dynamic model was created by combining a dynamical model that calculates the rolling resistance with a segmented model of the wheelchair user. To test this simulation model data were gathered using coasting tests and manual wheelchair propulsion tests. The first results were promising. The results of the calculated rolling resistance seemed plausible and the effect of the wheelchair user’s actions was clearly visible. This makes this simulation model a useful tool to analyze the effect of the wheelchair user’s actions on the rolling resistance. The most important factor in determining the magnitude of the rolling resistance appeared to be the thorax angle. This is in accordance with scientific literature, as leaning forwards shifts the weight distribution forwards. Multiple studies show that shifting the weight distribution forwards causes a significant increase in the magnitude of the rolling resistance. Further research to confirm the validity of this simulation model is still required.<br","wheelchair; propulsion; rolling resistance; inverse dynamics; simulation model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

Current bus networks are designed primarily for the coverage goals, as a consequence the patronage is lacking resulting in only few bus services to be cost-efficient. Literature provides several practices for increasing the cost-efficiency, but the effects on the coverage function are often neglected. This report follows a design process for a Dutch case in order to find how the coverage can be enhanced by including several new practices from the beginning of a network design. New design tools were <br/>developed in order to compare four different network designs relying on various coverage practices. The results show that a two layered system consisting of a high quality service combined with a supporting service in the form of a regular and/or demand responsive service is the best approach. Within the existing cost constraints, it is possible to create a large high quality network that relies on bicycles as access mode. By including shared bicycles, the coverage function is ensured while increasing the cost-efficiency of the network by allowing for faster routing. As a result, 10 percent more trips were made per timetable hour and 3 percent more passenger kilometres were covered. Replacing regular fixed line services by demand responsive services resulting in only a marginal increase that was highly dependent on the costs not to turn out higher. In combination with bicycle sharing, the results turned out to be much more positive with an additional 11 percent increase. By using a two layered system a high quality service can be provided that also serves a large coverage function. Of the supporting services, the use of shared bicycles allow for opportunities to improve even further, especially when combined with demand responsive transport.","Public Transport; Network Design; Shared Bicycles; Demand Responsive Transport; Bicycle-Transit; Design Approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Also, photovoltaic panels allow for production of clean energy anywhere, also in the urban environment where, unfortunately, non-ideal working conditions such as partial shading happen often and can reduce the performance of the photovoltaic panels. To maximize the energy produced by these panels, new solutions are proposed where DC-DC converters are attached to the panel. This fact makes the system more complex, due to the necessary extra components, and add losses and volume especially from the inductor of the DC-DC converter.<br/>In this study, a different approach has been studied to facilitate integration of DC-DC converter in photovoltaic panels. Photovoltaic cells as semiconductor devices have an intrinsic capacitance. Moreover, the metallization of the cell, especially on the back, can be redesigned to increase its inductance. Therefore, solar cells can in theory be redesigned to manipulate their output impedance and this impedance could replace the input filter of the DC-DC converter that is used to control the operating point of the photovoltaic panel. This will enable the design of novel solar modules whose operating point is controllable through inductor-less power converters.<br/>To determine the values of the capacitance, inductance and resistance that a photovoltaic cell should have so as to allow inductor-less power conversion as efficient as in a conventional solution with module-level power optimizers, a model of a photovoltaic panel that uses one or more of these “special” cells has been developed. Simulations have been done for a single solar cell and for a photovoltaic module of 96 solar cells. The simulation results provide information for the values of ripples and efficiency of the system so as to determine values of the capacitance, inductance, and resistance of the special cells to replace the components of the converter and also the number of such cells that a PV module should have.

The valorisation of the captured CO2 into value added products such as methanol provides an additional economic incentive to continue developing these technologies. The company Zero Emission Fuels B.V. (ZEF) is currently developing a mass-producible miniature methanol plant that houses a Direct Air Capture and CO2-compression unit, an Alkaline Electrolysis Cell, a Methanol Reactor, and a Distillation unit. Potential benefits of this approach are in the economies of scale of production, and autonomous operation in areas of high solar irradiation due to direct integration with PV systems.<br/>To validate the microplant-concept from an environmental perspective, a research project was executed with the goal to establish the environmental profile of the microplant, to identify hotspots for impact mitigation, and to assess the position of the microplant’s environmental profile in relation to results of comparable technologies reported in literature. To do so, multiple technological development pathways were considered that project the current microplant’s performance into a range of future states.<br/><br/>The impact assessment of the future PV-powered air-to-methanol plant, suggests that it is likely that methanol produced using this approach will exhibit a low (negative cradle-to-gate) climate change impact along its production chain, especially compared to conventional methanol produced via the steam reforming of natural gas. Environmental trade-offs are incurred by the additional material demand compared to conventional methanol, instilled both by the electricity generation from PV panels and the added material demand of the thousands of micro-plants that need to be produced for sufficient methanol production volume. <br/>Using polyamine sorbents for the process of capturing CO2 from the atmosphere inevitably leads to sorbent degradation which in turn can cause emissions of various substances. Using rough estimations via a worst/best case approach, it was analysed that emissions from the capture unit are relevant in three impact categories. <br/>Overall, the additional material demand and sorbent-related emissions introduce significant trade-offs in between 5-8 impact categories, depending on the followed technological scenarios. Additional technological improvement may reduce the trade-off effect, leading to a reduction of trade-off categories to a number of four.<br/><br/>The analysis concluded that it is likely that there are benefits to using the microplant-approach to methanol production, though additional research is critical to iron out the large uncertainties that are paired with future-oriented life cycle assessment. <br","Methanol synthesis; direct air capture; low-carbon methanol; Life Cycle Assessment; ex-ante; prospective; scenarios; microplant; co2-based; co2 conversion; environmental; Renewable methanol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

These factors are in line with literature from other countries on anxiety in public transportation during Covid-19. A typical profile of an anxious person is a female, older than 25 years old and not vaccinated. Since attitude already has a strong relationship with travel behaviour, the anxious group was compared to the not anxious group to investigate the effects of anxiety on travel behaviour and attitude. The results show that anxiety has a negative effect on attitude which leads to less usage, both current and expected usage in the future. Anxious people tend to generally have a negative attitude towards the train, while not anxious people generally have a positive attitude towards the train. In current train travelling behaviour, anxiety has the effect of people travelling less, and more people are likely to not travel at all. For future expected travel, anxious people are more likely to plan to travel less than not anxious people.<br/>The number of anxious people fluctuates over time and seems to be related to the number of cases or hospitalizations. The number of anxious people was higher when there were peaks in number of cases and hospitalizations, and lower when things were calmer. During the first year (April 2020 to April 2021), the anxious group had been over and around 40% of train travellers. It can be assumed that there will still be a group of people that are anxious after the pandemic, because in September 2021, when cases had been low for some time, there was a group of people still feeling very anxious. The results of this paper helped identify the anxious group and established the effect of anxiety on attitude and behaviour, which helps for designing timetables and planning rolling stock purchases.<br","Travel behaviour; Covid-19; Anxiety; Public transport","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","Additional Thesis",""

(graduation committee); Yang, Y. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Rail wear in curves at the tramway of Amsterdam is a considerable problem since it consumes a significant part of the maintenance budget. The wear mechanism is not fully understood because some curves could suffer much more than others, while the cause for the difference is unknown. GVB, the public transport operator of Amsterdam, wants to obtain better insight into this problem to optimise maintenance processes and reduce maintenance costs. <br/><br/>First, a literature review was conducted to assess knowledge on this issue and analyse methods to model train-track systems. Next, based on the literature review, parameters were identified which could influence the rail wear process, e.g. tram velocity, primary yaw stiffness or rail hardness. An evaluation of available data on those parameters at GVB was made. Data that was available and deemed essential was aligned and later used as input for a rail wear prediction model for the tramway of Amsterdam. The essential data analyses are the velocity analysis and wheel qR decay analysis. A tool was developed to obtain a detailed profile of driven velocities at the tram network, based on massive daily data from all the trams. Wheel measurement data from all the trams in the network were analysed to assess the wear of the tram wheels. Statistics were obtained over six years of wheel measurement data measured twice per year per tram. Besides, the usage data processed for inclusion in the model are tonnage, vehicle type distribution, amount of coupled vehicles and average vehicle loading.<br/><br/>Furthermore, more than six hundred simulations were performed at DEKRA rail with GVB tram models in VAMPIRE, to obtain more insight into tram curving behaviour. Based on the simulation outcomes, relationships between energy dissipation (\(T_{\gamma}\)) and radius, velocity, flange angle, vehicle loading and -type were derived. Those relationships were obtained per wheel and aggregated per tram passage. Finally, a rail wear model was made, which combines the relationships derived from the simulations, track characteristics and usage data about the curves. The energy dissipation (\(T_{\gamma}\)) was used as a wear indicator by the prediction model.<br/><br/>From the velocity analysis, trams generally keep to the speed limits, but trams drive too fast at specific curves. The wheel analysis showed qR at the tram's front wheels decays considerably faster than other wheels. Combino tram type's wheel decay was poorer than the older BN tram type. From the simulations, wheel wear has the most adverse effect on rail wear in curves. Increased vehicle velocity or amount of passengers also has a considerable negative influence on rail wear. The expected wear rises exponentially if the curve radius decreases. Also, the dependency on velocity increases exponentially when the curve radius decreases… <br","tram; railway; wear; curves; energy dissipation; estimation model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","","","","Civil Engineering","","52.373020, 4.892731"

(graduation committee); Vos, Roelof (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The need to contribute to a sustainable future of the aviation industry has spiked an interest in turboprop engines. This is due to the higher propulsive efficiency, the better take-off and landing performance on short runways, and the new developments in propeller-driven hybrid and electric aircraft. The most significant drawback is the noise they generate, which is undesirable. To reduce the propeller noise, new advanced propeller designs are needed. Propeller noise models can be used as a valuable tool during the design phase. The models can only be confidently used when they have been properly validated. The more data is used to validate, the higher the confidence will be. <br/><br/>A master student that graduated from the Aircraft Noise and Climate Effects section at the TU Delft created a propeller noise model called HeliX-tool. This model is validated by another model and wind tunnel measurements from NASA but not yet by full-scale outdoor experimental data. To increase the confidence of the HeliX-tool, this model is compared to full-scale outdoor experimental data and the quality is assessed in this thesis. <br/><br/>The HeliX-tool models the steady loading and thickness noise and is based upon the helicoidal surface theory. This theory needs the aerodynamic and performance characteristics of the propeller blade which are obtained by implementing the two external analysis tools, XFOIL and XRotor.<br/> <br/>The experiment is performed with the Pipistrel Velix Electro at Teuge airport to obtain the full-scale outdoor data to validate the model. The Pipistrel Velis Electro is a fully electric-powered two-seater owned by E-flight academy. The microphone array that is used to obtain the full-scale outdoor data has 64 microphones placed in an Underbrink configuration.<br/>The propeller geometry is an important input for the HeliX-tool and is obtained by 3D scanning the propeller blade of the Pipistrel Velis Electro with the FaroBlu HD laser. <br/><br/>The validation metrics are the SPL and OSPL values. The frequency spectra are generated for both the full-scale outdoor data and the HeliX-tool when the aircraft is overhead the microphone array and are compared to each other. In general, the HeliX-tool gives higher SPL values compared to the full-scale outdoor data, which also results in higher OSPL values from the HeliX-tool. <br/>The location of the most dominant noise source can be found, with beamforming, although the resolution is limited by the Rayleigh limit. Functional beamforming is used to reduce the side lobes and it can be seen that the dominant noise source shifts in location. It can be concluded that there might be a noise source present within the Rayleigh limit but this cannot be confirmed. <br/> <br/>The values of the validation metrics are within 4 dB and from this can be concluded that the confidence in the HeliX-tool is increased. It can be used as a tool in the design phase of new advanced propellers but is limited to Mach numbers below 0.7 due to the Prandtl­Glauert compressibility correction used in XRotor.","Propeller noise; propeller noise model; experimental validation; full-scale outdoor data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This type of disease necessitates network care because it is complex and necessitates a network of diverse healthcare expertise to reduce the negative effects of the disease and rehabilitate the patient to live a more normal life. As a result, effective communication and collaboration among various healthcare members become an important part of the overall patient experience.<br/>Based on the user research, it can be found that patients often encounter problems during their treatment, but they often cannot get proper help quickly due to the slow reply time of the healthcare professionals. Also, because of the difference in the know-how of the disease, the communication towards the patient is not summarized as one diagnosis and support session and in the end, they cannot get a complete answer from the healthcare team. Therefore, I want to design an online support platform to help FSHD patients get the right help in time during the treatment of their disease.<br/>The final design is an online support platform that aims to help patients solve their problems during the treatment and facilitate effective communications between patients and the healthcare network. The core of this service platform is to introduce a personalized coach to bridge the gap between the two sides. The platform has two main functions, treatment, and chat, which can meet most of the needs of a patient during the treatment process. In the treatment session, patients can follow the exercise videos based on their treatment plan made by the healthcare professionals. After they complete one exercise, the platform enables users to make a self-evaluation of their performance. When patients feel negative about the training, they can quickly inform this situation to the coach and the healthcare team by using the share function. Then they will receive comments on their recordings from the healthcare professionals so that they know how to adjust their actions. The chat function allows the patient to quickly ask questions and express their need when they encounter problems with their personalized coach. The coach will help to filter the question and inform the related healthcare professionals to discuss it in a chat group when needed. When the discussion ends, patients can get a summarized answer from the coach.<br/>Based on the usability test, it can be validated that the design can bring benefits to people. The two main features of the online platform (chat and treatment) were useful to the test subjects, and they expressed a willingness to use the platform if it will be developed in the future. However, there is still room for improvement. In the future, we can further think about enlarging the user group, such as involving more patients of other neuromuscular diseases and expanding the service, such as helping the customer to build their healthcare team to add more value to more people.","Healthcare; Communication; Neuromuscular diseases; Online Platform","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://www.figma.com/proto/GjTXSk1ghTiSVojhGt5oeS/patient-4?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=47%3A2910&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.07&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=33%3A1822&show-proto-sidebar=1 Interactive prototype","","","","","","","",""

Hence the establishment of buyer-supplier relationships is limited. The organisational challenges of a supplier have a negative impact on the conveyed service quality. Customer orientation can create superior value for the customer and thus the service quality. <br/><br/>This graduation thesis approaches the challenge from the underexposed perspective of the supplier. The assignment aims to design a framework for supply organisations to enhance and implement customer orientation in buyer-supplier dyads. More specifically, it analyses and designs how the conversion phase of a Dutch service supplier, Pezy Group, can be more customer-oriented. In the context of the case study, customer orientation is the extent to which the supplier prioritises the customer’s expectations and applies its knowledge of the customer in the organisation to create a positive experience. The conversion phase is defined as the process of translating the buyer’s development request into a proposal for executing the project. The proposal concerns the service Pezy Group offers, in this case, integral product development projects. <br/><br/>From the analysis, it becomes apparent that different customers and their intended interaction result in various expectations and requires the supplier to organise their processes accordingly. A design goal is formed based on the defined and selected buyer-interaction archetype Structured Sophie. A framework is developed utilising participatory design methods, resulting in archetype specific customer journey of the conversion phase and an implementation roadmap for Pezy Group. Multiple validation sessions were organised to measure the expected impact of the future scenario on the customer orientation and thus service quality. Internal and external participants were selected (n=12) to evaluate the customer journey of the conversion phase using Likert scales. <br/><br/>The results showed that the proposed design changes of the customer journey contribute to Pezy Group’s enhancement of customer orientation in buyer-supplier dyads. Archetype Structured Sophie has a product development request focused on conceptualising, gathering insights, and intending a transactional relationship for the execution phase. The results of the validated design indicate that for Pezy Group to enhance and implement customer orientation, the following organisational changes must occur. This thesis concludes that a change of roles, in which the operational support is empowered to establish and manage the Sophie buyer-interaction archetype, will enhance the experienced customer orientation. This change is enabled by the support of the account responsible and the usage of standardised proposals during the process.<br/><br/>The delivered archetype specific framework concludes that the conceptual customer journey and implementation roadmap, once executed, increases the service quality of the buyer-supplier interactions, supports the conversion phase related activities, and may indirectly contribute to the degree of profitability of Pezy Group. Implementing the proposed changes by change management methodologies is recommended, as indicated in the roadmap. Since this graduation thesis is based on one case study, future research is required to investigate the generalisation of the recovered insights and the designed framework. <br","Strategic Product Design; Organisation Design; Customer Orientation; Customer Journey; Sales Strategy; Buyer-Supplier dyads; service design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

This led to further research on building trust in inter-organizational relationships and concluded in a measurement model on relational succes factors. To master these factors, a handbook has been made for implementing co-creation in the way of collaborating of the relationship. Both the measurement model and the implementation of co-creation have become building blocks for creating long term relationships, based on mutual goals and mutual trust.

This is a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) used in Monte Carlo Markov chain methods (MCMC) for sampling from a probability distribution and calculating integrals \cite{Rejectionfree}, \cite{ZigZag}, \cite{Bouncy}. We show for Lipschitz potentials $U$ and bounded refreshment rates $\lambda_0 \in L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T})$ that the spectral gap $\kappa = \sup\{\operatorname{Re} \lambda : \lambda \in \sigma(\mathcal{L})\} \setminus \{0 \}$ of the associated $J$-self-adjoint generator $\mathcal{L}$ on $L^2(\mathbb{T} ,\nu)$ and $C(\mathbb{T} \times \{+1,-1\})$ is positive. Moreover, we give two lower bounds for $\kappa$ by making use of one of the Schur complements associated with a block operator that is unitarily equivalent to $\mathcal{L}$. In addition we show that the spectrum of $L^2(\mathbb{T} ,\nu)$ and $C(\mathbb{T} \times \{+1,-1\})$ are the same and that the generator defined on both spaces generates a contraction semigroup. Under the assumption of unimodality of the potential $U$ and a zero refreshment rate, we show that a vertical ""asymptotic line"" exists to which all of the eigenvalues converge. Furthermore, we show that a spectral mapping theorem exists where, due to the spectral line, the spectrum of the semigroup can become uncountable or countable depending on the time parameter of the semigroup $P(t)$ generated by $\mathcal{L}$. Lastly, we show that a discretisation of the spectrum generates a semigroup that converges uniformly on each bounded time interval to the semigroup of the Zig-Zag process and we use these discretisations to numerically analyse the behaviour of general potentials and refreshment rates.<br/><br","spectral gap; J-self-adjoint operator; spectral mapping theorem; Zig-Zag process; piecewise deterministic Markov process; MCMC; spectral theory; Schur complement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Although screening methodologies exist, plaques are highly complex, and the parameters used to measure plaque vulnerability are often insufficient for correct medical screening. Since plaque rupture occurs when the vascular forces exceed the plaque strength, the mechanical analysis of plaque stability could offer a new window into predicting rupture. By interpreting the mechanical behaviour of plaques, so-called mechanical markers could be derived, which could highlight vulnerable plaques before thrombosis. Unfortunately, the extensively modelled local stresses and energy functions are immeasurable in vivo. Therefore we turned to strains, a measure of material deformation that can be obtained clinically. This study investigates the predictive value of strain distributions in the early detection of fibrous caps rupture. <br/>Simplistic plaque cap mimics were engineered to model atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Made from a fibrinous matrix and a soft lipidic inclusion (SI), the constructs were tailored to have mechanical properties similar to in vivo plaque caps. Tissue engineered caps offer a wide range of advantages over endarterectomy samples, including unlimited sample availability, robust geometry, high reproducibility and precise control over biological constituents. These constructs were uniaxially strained and subjected to 2D digital image correlation (DIC) to obtain their strain fields. Two-dimensional DIC is an algorithm that derives the material deformation by tracking surface features of its target sample. Therefore, it can very accurately calculate local strains for a material. This report analyses the patterns and maxima of the strain maps of five samples to evaluate unique features distinct at the rupture location that could serve as potential markers of plaque vulnerability. Besides inspecting the individual strain maps, their collective contribution through two strain-based failure criteria was analysed. These failure criteria approximate the strain energy in the samples.<br/>The mechanical failure of the constructs was not instantaneous. All samples underwent failure in phases, starting with a small crack in the SI and concluding with the rupture of the fibrous tissue. Likewise, the strain and failure criteria patterns were consistent within all samples. Even though their strain values differ, the accumulations of low and high strains lie at nearly identical positions. These patterns emerged early in the tensile experiment, as the frames at a physiological (10%) and final (ultimate state before rupture) global strain measured a strong resemblance. In a more localised analysis, the fields were radially divided into ‘slices’ of data to produce distinct segment-based patterns. The rupture location consistently lies at a unique feature in the pattern, such as a peak or a valley. As was observed before, aside from the difference in their magnitude, the strain patterns showed no change between the frames. Finally, the local maxima of the strain and failure criteria maps were inspected. Their distances to the rupture site were comparable for all maps, indicating they performed similarly at estimating the rupture location. Moreover, the distances measured for the final frame showed no significant difference to those measured for the physiological frame.<br/>The mechanical response of the five samples is similar. Aside from undergoing mechanical rupture in stages, the analysis of the tissue construct shows that a relationship exists between the local strains and rupture location. First, the rupture location always sits at the edge of a high valued region in the SI. Second, the tissue segmentation produces a highly reproducible pattern with a distinct colocalisation between segment patterns and the rupture location. Third, the maxima of the strain and failure criteria maps lie close to the rupture site, although they do not overlap. Accordingly, there is a clear relationship between the rupture location and the<br/>local strain patterns.","Atherosclerosis; Plaque rupture; Cardiovascular biomechanics; Strain fields; Digital image correlation; Tissue engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-22","","","","Biomedical Engineering","CAPTURE: defining new imaging biomarkers for stroke by unraveling atherosclerotic cap rupture NWO vidi",""

A prescription of this policy is the application of watertight barriers on top of the wastebody. The policy also prescribes the renewal of the packing materials every 75 years. The wastebody is dried out, and the degradation has stopped so the wastebody does not change. The 'dry tomb' stays hazardous, thus eternal aftercare is implied.<br/><br/>The project 'introductie Duurzaam Stortbeheer (iDS) aims to create aftercare with an ending, or finite aftercare. It is looking for possibilities to stabilise the landfill mass, i.e. to eliminate the threat of pollutants by treating the wastebodies.<br/><br/>The goal of the CURE project is to develop fundamental insight into landfill processes in order to research the feasibility of wastebody stabilisation. To predict behaviour of landfills, and to monitor the processes, as much information as possible needs to be gathered through measurements. These consist of measurement of gas concentration and production rates together with the variation in leachate quality and volumes, as well as many more. This research, as part of the CURE project, presents the applicability of settlement as and addition to these measurements.<br/><br/>The main goal of waste body stabilisation is to actively reduce the amount of organic matter in a landfill. Uncontrolled landfills produce considerable methane emissions as well as high concentrations of nitrogen and heavy metals in the leachate, leading to groundwater hazards in the environment.<br/><br/>McDougall (2007) introduced the fundamental conceptual model upon which this research is based. This model is not publicly available, so one of the goals of this research is to provide a fundamental conceptual model. The relation between degradation and settlement has been studied and implemented in a 1D model which allows for hydrological systems, oxygen penetration, degradation and cell strain. The outcome is a relation between mechanics, biochemistry and hydrology. A few assumptions and simplifications were made to make the model versatile and adjustible, but also easy to read. For instance, the model uses oxygen as absolute limiting factor in degradation, neglecting all processes concerning anaerobic degradation. The model also assumes that at the beginning of the simulation, each cell has the same composition, because there is no conclusive data about the distribution of waste types. The model has been created in one dimension, thereby neglecting all multi-dimensional processes and limitations. <br/><br/>In the final scenario, the main limitation to degradation is the availability of dissolved oxygen. As irrigation provides infiltration of 5 mm water per day with 10 mg dissolved oxygen per liter, the daily reduction of oxygen demand is 50 mg. The total modelled oxygen demand of the landfill is over 9600 kg, which concludes that a different tactic needs to happen in order to stabilise the wastebody. To increase the degradation rate, more oxygen needs to be applied. An approximation of the effect of applying a partial vacuum above the water table in the landfill to attract air from the environment is modelled, giving the oxygen more transfer area into unsaturated water. An increase by a factor 10^{4} is applied to the effect of oxygen on organic matter to model this enhanced irrigation system. The results are modeled over 100 years, after which approximately 26.17% of the degradation has happened. This shows that aerobic degradation over a wastebody takes too long with conventional degradation, and the unsaturated voids might help the process.<br/><br/>The model shows credible results for an unspecified landfill with deterministic parameters. Settlement has been brought in relation to a simplified form of biodegradation. The need for further research, with a spatial fluctuation of these parameters and detailed multidimensional water flow is needed to predict landfill behaviour in more detail. \pagebreak","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Even with the more conservative estimates, these expected high traffic densities require a re-evaluation of the airspace structure to ensure safe and efficient operations. One structure that scored high on both the safety and efficiency metrics, as defined by the Metropolis project, is a layered airspace, where aircraft with an intended heading are assigned to a specific altitude layer. However, a problem arises once aircraft start to vertically traverse between these layers, leading to a large number of conflicts and intrusions. One way to potentially reduce the number of intrusions during these operations is by using conventional conflict resolution algorithms. These algorithms however have also been shown to lead to instabilities at higher traffic densities. As recent years have shown tremendous growth in the capabilities of Deep Reinforcement Learning, it is interesting to see how well these methods perform in the field of conflict resolution. This research investigates and compares the performance of multiple Soft Actor Critic models with the Modified Voltage Potential algorithm during vertical manoeuvres in a layered airspace. The final obtained performance of the trained models is comparable to that of the Modified Voltage Potential algorithm and in certain scenarios, the trained models even outperform the MVP algorithm. Overall, the results show that DRL can improve upon the current state of conflict resolution algorithms and provide new insight into the development of safe operations.","Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R); Deep Reinforcement Learning; BlueSky ATM simulator; Unmanned Traffic Management; Self-separation; Modified Voltage Potential","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-02-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

As studies on operator-based relocation strategies are in abundance, this research focused on user-based relocation. A user-based relocation strategy assumes the participation of the user, though (monetary) incentives are required to encourage users to participate in the process of relocating vehicles.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","For decades, developments towards a chromate-free protective system have been a crucial quest in the aerospace industry. In this search, innovation starts with a comprehensive understanding of the aircraft complex multi-material structures and the corrosion mechanisms involved. These complex structures, with aluminium the most dominant substrate, are used to optimize the strength to weight ratio, fatigue properties and operational performance in aircraft design. On the other hand, the use of multi-materials can cause an accelerated corrosion attack, called galvanic corrosion. This type of corrosion can be advantageously applied to galvanically protect a material but can also occur undesirably with serious accelerated degradation as result.<br/> <br/>This thesis aims to increase our understanding of corrosion on AA7XXXClad alloys as stand-alone material, as well as in configurations relevant for galvanic corrosion with other metals. The understanding of these phenomena should support the definitions of new hypotheses on how these alloys can be better protected using chromate-free coating technologies. Two commonly used aluminium alloys in the aerospace industry have been investigated in this study because a selective galvanic stimulated dissolution of the cladding layer material was found after an accelerated corrosion test. This selective dissolution makes it difficult for the corrosion inhibitors to reach the exact site of corrosion propagation in the cladding layer, reducing the inhibition efficiency and allowing corrosion to propagate.<br/> <br/>Since Zinc is the main alloying element in the substrate and cladding material, the role of Zn with respect to corrosion initiation and propagation was investigated first. Subsequently, the behaviour of clad alloys under galvanic corrosion conditions, and finally how inhibition under these conditions can be reliably assessed. This was performed by a combination of multiple electrochemical techniques and microscopic analysis. The results demonstrate that Zn plays a significant role in the dissolution of the cladding layer and may be held responsible for the selective dissolution observed. In addition, an experimental procedure was developed to measure the coupled galvanic parameters and to simulate the galvanic corrosion degradation in industrial desired timeframes. Although simulation of the phenomenon has shown to be promising with in-situ experiments, it was not fully observed. Furthermore, to test the performance of corrosion inhibitors, a procedure is developed with and without the use of coatings. In general, it can be concluded that limiting the cathodic reactions is of paramount importance to reduce the galvanic corrosion current.","Galvanic corrosion; Cladding; 7XXX series aluminium; AA7075; AA7072","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Wehrmann, C. (mentor); Borst, C. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This study has researched what are defining factors on the attitude toward a new technology within the group of Area Control (ACC) at Luchtverkeersleiding Nederland (LVNL) and how these factors shape an Air Traffic Controller’s (ATCo) attitude toward the technology in an exploratory way. The outcomes of the research suggest that dominant factors are result demonstrability, output quality, job relevance, subjective norm and (timeliness of) involvement in the development process. First, the work domain of air traffic control and the functioning of holding patterns were researched and a description of these things was given, based on interviews with air traffic controllers and on literature. It was found that the largest challenge when holding at LVNL is adherence to Expected Approach Time (EAT), and that this is caused by two things: the first is a lack of accurate and integrated information on the impact of a control decision on EAT adherence, the second is that current practice of ATCos is to aim for a 2:00 minute deviation from the EAT, which is the current error margin they are allowed to operate on. It was found, based on interviews with two professional area controllers and one other expert from LVNL, that in current practice an ATCo makes estimations of when to give a turn-to-IAF command based on a rule of thumb with a holding loop timing of four minutes and by extrapolating the history dots of the aircraft. However, analysis of historical holding pattern data shows that lap times often take six or seven minutes and that wind severely influences the in- and outbound ground speeds, making both the four-minute loop time and history dot extrapolation unreliable estimators. A support tool was designed that gives a prediction of the time it takes to reach the IAF from different locations, taking into account aircraft characteristics and wind. The new tool was designed such that it is in accordance with the layout and style of present LVNL systems. It involves two things. First, a prediction of the EAT adherence error upon giving an immediate turn-to-IAF command in the form of a delta-T in the aircraft label. Second, and a prediction of the turn-to-IAF locations at which an EAT adherence error of +120s, +110s, ..., 0s, 10s, ...-120s will be achieved, in the form of colored dots (ECOL dots) on the vertical view and the top view radar screen. The social situation at LVNL was described based on interviews with two professional area controllers and one other expert from LVNL. Indications were found for two opposite things. On the one hand, that (some) ATCos are willing to innovate and actually take initiative in innovation processes, and on the other hand, that (some) ATCos have a strong resistance toward technological system innovation. Regarding collaboration between groups, itwas found that the relation between ACC and Approach Control (APP) that is characterized by skepticism on the skills of the other party. Finally, it was found that ATCos take pride in the way they execute their job and are willing to work hard to achieve the goals they believe match their job description. In doing this, ATCos have indicated to value their autonomy and the idea that the effort they put in actually adds value for the full Air Traffic Control (ATC) process. Besides interviews to describe the situation at LVNL, case studies were done to research innovation in other organizations that showed similarities to the context of LVNL. Three things were found. First, ensuring people can contribute and influence the innovation from early stages of the innovation process is a promising factor that seems to influence a person’s attitude toward using the innovation in a positive way. Second, the lack of implementation of innovations has caused skepticism under ATCos. Third, the TAM is a suitable framework to further explore how area controllers at LVNL’s attitude toward innovations manifests itself. To be able to use the TAM in the framework, first, literature on the TAM has been reviewed. It has been found that there are different versions of the TAM that include or exclude several variables. For the present research, the most suitable version of the TAM was determined to be the TAM2, using the following external variables: result demonstrability, output quality, job relevance, image, subjective norm, experience, voluntariness, age. Next to the TAM in the framework, literature was reviewed on several factors surrounding the interaction with support systems, where autonomy and trust were found to be of a valuable contribution to the framework in the present research. The operationalization of the framework was done using survey questions, a semi-structured interview, and results from letting ATCos interact with the system innovation concept (the tool). It was found that some factors of the TAM could be questioned straightforward in either the survey or the interview, while for other factors it was necessary do design multiple questions and depend on the type of answers given by the participants. Since the research is exploratory, it was decided to keep the interview setup semi-structured to ensure participants would be able to outline defining factors for their attitude toward innovation relatively freely, instead of needing to keep them within a predefined set of factors. From the performed case study, where 10 ATCos participated in an experiment in which they had to manage two holding scenarios, with and without the tool, the following things were learned. First, three of the external variables defined in the framework played the largest role for participants’ perceived usefulness of the tool were result demonstrability, output quality and job relevance. Second, it was found that subjective norm impacts the attitude towards use for the participant group. A mismatch was found between the participants’ attitude toward innovation in general and the way the participants thought their colleagues viewed system innovations. Subjective norm was also found to be of influence on the participants personal objective in the level of EAT adherence they aim to obtain in their day-to-day work. Third, participants linked the external variables not only toward perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, as is the case in the TAM, but also to attitude towards use. Finally, it was found that participants appreciated being part of an innovation process rather than being presented with the final solution, which was further improved by the fact that the concept was visibly not perfected yet (even though it was functioning, it was clear it was still under development and showed some minor issues in e.g., the stability of the computer program).","controller acceptance; air traffic control; technology acceptance model; holding support","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double degree in Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation and Design for Interaction | Science Communication","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

The shipping sector still accounts for an important 2.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. On top of this, current industry fuels contain high levels of sulfur and release nitrogen oxides upon combustion, which both can be extremely harmful to local environments and ecosystems. The largest body in marine regulation; The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set a goal in reducing total industry emissions to 50% relative to 2008 levels. Additionally,the European Union has passed a series of regulations and targets relating to shipping. However, most of the regulations passed are not yet binding and it is not entirely clear how these goals are to be accomplished.<br/><br/> One of the most promising current solutions to this problem lies in the use of biofuels. These sustainably-sourced combustibles can cut-back total emissions by considerable amounts and are supportable in the medium to long term. Past use of biofuels has been centered around drop-in fuels produced from first-generation feedstock sources largely based on oil, such as biodiesel. However, recent European regulations are trying to move away from oil-based fuels and first generation feedstocks due to Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) concerns. Several studies have outlined alcohols (bio-methanol and bio-ethanol) as well as bio-methane as some of the best-positioned fuels for research and development.<br/><br/>Similar to first generation biofuels, a large concern surrounding these newly proposed fuels relate to the feedstock availability. The challenge with biofuels is therefore creating cost-effective supply chains that are able to meet market demands while still reducing life-cycle emissions.<br/><br/>This paper creates a MILP model under a set of scenarios to understand the best-suited fuels, feedstocks and supply chain paths for the period 2025-2030. Several biomass supply and energy demand conditions are estimated across Europe for the years in question and used to analyze distinct possibilities. It is found that while the supply of these fuels is feasible, a combination of the three is best suited to meet the energy demands. The biggest obstacle to all three fuels are the refinery capacities across Europe, which. It is also discovered that forestry residues represent the most likely candidate for fuel production and to a smaller extent, animal wastes. The production and small scale adoption of these fuels is possible (in terms of supply concerns) however, much is needed in the regulatory aspect to make sure the move towards these fuel options is achieved.","Biofuels; Biomass; MILP; Optimisation; Emissions; Costs; supply chain; demand & supply","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Their trajectories, however, have proven to be complicated to optimise due to the non-impulsive manoeuvres involved in low-thrust spaceflight. Even though shaping methods have been used extensively to reduce the computational burden, multiple-gravity assists and the presence of constraints create significant computational hurdles. Reducing the number of fitness evaluations during optimisation is one way of speeding up the search and can be done by `pruning away' regions of infeasible trajectories. In this research, we approach this by applying clustering, an unsupervised machine learning approach, to single leg trajectory optimisation problems based on a hodographic shaping trajectory model in combination with restricted two-body dynamics. Through clustering, groups of promising trajectories can be isolated so that unwanted regions can be discarded. Earth --- Mars, Earth --- Venus, and Earth --- 9P/Tempel 1 trajectories are used as test cases and are shown to exhibit periodic behaviour (related to the synodic periods of the departure and target bodies), which enables clustering on grid search-generated datasets. Different clustering algorithms were compared using the Silhouette, Davies-Bouldin, and Calinski-Harabasz internal validation indices. However, traditional clustering algorithms such as (H)DBSCAN, OPTICS, KMeans, and Gaussian Mixture Models, failed to robustly provide clusterings that can be used for pruning, because of the oblong shape of the clusters and the absence of data/noise density differences due to the artificial nature of the problem. Instead, a multimodality-based clustering model called SkinnyDip was found to be much more promising for this task. This algorithm comes with the additional advantage of having very few hyperparameters, eliminating the need for extensive parameter tuning.","Unsupervised Machine Learning; Low-thrust transfer orbits; Clustering Analysis; Shape-based methods; Hodographic Shaping; Global Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-21","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

To better understand the potential and tuning rules for these devices, tuning is investigated with a model-based approach and verified in pilot-in-the loop experiments using various aircraft dynamics.

Considering these issues, novel experiments were done to investigate the interaction between focused breaking waves and a ship at forward speed. The investigated interactions are global motion, global loads, and forces on a deck structure.<br/><br/>For the experiments focused, breaking waves were created, which served as loads of the green water events. First, wave focusing with prescribed characteristics was investigated in numerical settings. It was shown that focusing the waves with iterative methods does not lead to a converging solution. Three breaking waves were created in a wave basin. The characteristics of the waves were retrieved from 2D numerical simulations. The parameters of the spectrum of each wave were calculated from the simulation results.<br/><br/>The experiments were conducted systematically, where the position of the longitudinal center of gravity (LCG) of the ship was varied with respect to the focus point of the breaking wave at the focusing time. Using the same wave input resulted in green water events and loads on deck structure with different characteristics caused by different breaking stages of the focused wave. The effects of different ship velocities and different focused breaking waves were also explored throughout the experiments. It was shown that using the same focused wave, i.e., the same energy input, the breaking stage of the wave during the impact has a large influence on both the magnitude and time development of the loads on the deck structure. Force and pressure peaks were the largest and had an initial spike-like development when the wave during impact was in an unbroken stage. Impacts with the wave in its broken stage resulted in significantly lower loads and longer-duration load development. Such changes in the loads show that the ship's position with respect to the breaking wave is essential to consider even for the same input energy, posing additional challenges for establishing the maximum load in a sea state.","ship; green water; focused wave; breaking wave; wave impact; fluid-structure intera","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Hydromechanics","",""

Currently, analytical descriptions of the quadrotor are rudimentary and most data-driven quadrotor models are identified from flight data collected indoors. Therefore, existing quadrotor models are constrained to a narrow region of the flight envelope due to the inherent restrictions of these indoor spaces. In contrast, the flexibility afforded by outdoor spaces facilitates the exploration of the majority of the quadrotor's flight envelope. Subsequently, to enable the development of high-fidelity quadrotor models, a modular system identification pipeline that is compatible with outdoor high-speed flight and aggressive manoeuvring is created in the present work. Drawing inspiration from current state-of-the-art quadrotor models, polynomial step-wise regression, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and a hybrid approach fusing the merits of the two techniques are implemented in the pipeline. As a proxy for reliability, the confidence of the identified models' predictions are encapsulated through accompanying prediction intervals (PIs). As there are no analytical formulations for obtaining the PIs associated with ANN predictions, various ANN-based PI estimation techniques are also numerically validated. Using the system identification pipeline, for the first time, high-fidelity quadrotor models which accurately capture high-speed flight of up to 19 m/s and aggressive manoeuvres such as punch-outs, flips, and barrel rolls, are identified from real outdoor flight data, despite the contamination of unknown wind. Contrary to expectations, the simulations demonstrate that the polynomial model consistently produces the most feasible and useful models. The dense architecture of the employed ANNs, including those for the hybrid approach, appear to promote and propagate instabilities arising from the wind contamination. The associated PIs are found to grow in tandem with these instabilities and increasing uncertainty in the system, accentuating the utility of such PIs.","quadrotor; system identification; modelling; high-speed; aggressive; outdoor; Neural Network; stepwise regression; prediction intervals","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-12-21","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Increased traffic loads and ageing of concrete bridges and overpasses in the Netherlands make it necessary to reassess these existing structures. Consequently, the current condition and capacity of many concrete structures need to be evaluated. Residual capacity could be discovered during reassessments of concrete slabs due to a phenomenon called compressive membrane action (CMA). CMA is the formation of internal compressive arches caused by the lateral restraint. As a result, the load is not only transferred by bending action but also by arching action. Research has shown that the ultimate capacity can be significantly increased due to the occurrence of CMA. The goal of this study is to examine the influence of geometrical nonlinearity on this increase in capacity. Also, accurate quantification of the capacity enhancement for a variety of concrete slab variants can be scientifically useful and increases the knowledge on CMA. The study is confined to one way reinforced and restrained concrete slabs.<br/><br/>A new analytical model is presented to quantify the capacity enhancement due to CMA and the geometrical nonlinear (GNL) effect on the capacity. Calibration of the analytical model is performed with a finite element model in DIANA FEA. Also, the finite element model validates the analytical results and is used to study the failure mode of a restrained concrete slab in detail. <br/><br/>The enhancement factor – defined as the enhanced capacity divided by the conventional capacity – turned out to be varying between 1.35 and 4.7 for a large variety of restrained concrete slabs. Thus, the ultimate capacity of restrained one way slabs is significantly increased due to CMA. However, the capacity enhancement would have been even greater if geometrical nonlinearity was not accounted for. Geometrical nonlinearity reduces the increase in capacity because the formed compressive arches will tilt as a result of deflections, therefore leading to a relative decrease of the resisting arching moments. This GNL reduction effect varies between 3% and 37% according to the finite element model. The calibrated analytical model sufficiently estimates this effect with a maximum deviation of about 12%. An important finding was that the enhancement factor is larger for deep slabs than for slender slabs, while the reduction of the ultimate load due to geometrical nonlinearity is larger for slender slabs than for deep slabs. <br","Compressive Membrane Action; geometrical nonlinearity; concrete slab","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","With a growing global demand of clean renewable energy, offshore wind activities will extend to more harsh environments, including sub-arctic areas like the Baltic Sea. Sea ice can occur here which needs to be taken into consideration in the design of substructures, i.e. jacket substructures, of offshore wind turbines. Several ice mitigating measures exist for jacket substructures, of which one is disregarding braces crossing the waterline. In this way, ice cannot induce loads to the relatively slender braces in the jacket. However, disregarding these braces has disadvantages in terms of structural integrity in comparison to a jacket including these braces.<br/><br/>In Part I of this thesis, two types of jackets, one without (Type 1) and one with (Type 2) waterline crossing braces, are implemented in a numerical model and subjected to ice loading in order to conclude whether the use of a Type 1 jacket design can be justified or whether a Type 2 jacket design is also suitable in sub-arctic areas. <br/><br/>Since over the past years the modelling techniques regarding ice-structure interaction have been updated and improved significantly, assessing the loads at the jacket braces can be done more accurately, allowing to give a more thorough conclusion on whether to use braces crossing the waterline on jackets in sub-arctic areas. As a result, a design including these braces could become feasible, whereas in the past it would be disregarded.<br/><br/>Two types of ice failure are considered in this research, being ice bending failure and ice crushing failure. First, a model is developed to quantify the ice actions occurring at a jacket substructure as function of the approach angle of the ice direction relative to the structure and as function of an introduced 'threshold angle'. It was found that ice failing in bending is equally significantly present as ice failing in crushing. Subsequently, numerical models are introduced that describe the failure behaviour of bending and crushing ice and the force that both ice failure types will induce to the structure. The structure is represented by a 5 [MW] offshore reference turbine supported by a jacket substructure. Using these models, dynamic simulations are performed in order to investigate the local susceptibility to ice induced vibrations (IIV), as well as assessing the Ultimate Limit State (ULS) load at the braces. As a result, local brace IIV regimes could be recognised, however sustained frequency lock-in could not be observed. Furthermore, it was found that a Type 2 jacket could be suitable to use in sub-arctic areas considering the ULS load effects due to ice loading, but care should be taken for the ULS brace load, as that is of great importance for the design.<br/><br/>In Part II of this thesis, it is assessed whether coupled dynamic ice-structure interaction can be modelled using a dynamic substructuring modelling technique, also known as Craig-Bampton method, since it is industry practice to use such a method when jackets are involved. This method is based on a model order reduction of the full finite element model representing the structure, resulting in improved computational time and allowing assembly of multiple (reduced) substructures. The method is successfully implemented allowing to solve coupled ice-structure interaction problems and a framework to do so is provided. It is shown that excluding the loaded degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the jacket from the reduction leads to more accurate results and is considered convenient since few DoFs are loaded by ice, maintaining the effectiveness of the reduction method. As a result, IIV can be investigated using this reduction method, however challenges related to the accumulation of numerical accuracy errors arise with truncation of more higher frequency modes and require further development to be resolved.","Ice; Jacket; Craig-Bampton; Superelement; Ice-structure interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

To deal with these challenges, there are several opportunities to improve through the use of data and technology. The first part of this report examines the developments taking place in both the global maritime sector and the Dutch seaports. In general, we see that major changes are afoot within the maritime sector. Data is starting to play an increasingly important role in decision-making. With data, new insights can be generated and specific parts where quick wins can be made can be tackled. By optimising processes, efficiency can be increased, allowing more to be achieved with the same effort. This helps the sector to stay competitive. The sector is facing declining interest from employees and emerging local production, making transport a less important factor. To remain competitive, processes are being automated and cooperation between different companies is increasing. This allows innovations to be applied more widely and ultimately achieve more. The more important role of data also leads to risks concerning security and privacy. Soon, the sector will have to learn to deal with these risks. <br/><br/>KPN is a large, Dutch telecommunication company that serves a large part of the Dutch consumer and business market and is one of three companies with a Dutch mobile network. As people’s perception of mobile communications changes, KPN is seeing a decline in revenues from consumers and is having to introduce innovations despite receiving little additional revenue in return. As more companies can deliver connectivity, KPN is focusing on delivering extra services to companies on top of their connectivity. This way, KPN tries to create the financial space to keep their network up to date and to add new functionalities. In addition, KPN distinguishes itself within the Dutch market by operating in a climate-neutral way. KPN is now using the knowledge it has gained to help other companies make their businesses more sustainable. KPN believes that the use of technology can ensure that companies can operate in a climate-neutral way without compromising their business.<br/><br/>By deploying KPN’s capabilities within the insights gained from the analysis, the KPN Fleet ecosystem was designed. Within this ecosystem, KPN offers a platform to all kinds of maritime stakeholders, enabling them to make optimal use of the opportunities offered by data and new technologies. By involving all stakeholders in an ecosystem, every one of them can help each other get the most out of their processes and innovations. Data can be shared safely and quickly, allowing all stakeholders involved to use this data to optimise their processes or services. This further increases the quality of all services delivered within the ecosystem, which ultimately benefits all stakeholders involved. It also offers KPN the opportunity to use its capabilities and thus add extra value within the maritime sector. Within this report, more details about KPN Fleet are highlighted. In addition, a roadmap is presented to help KPN implement KPN Fleet and expand it in the future.<br/><br/>KPN Fleet helps KPN to expand their position in the maritime sector and increase the value they add to society. This allows them to remain relevant in the future and generate more revenue. In addition, KPN Fleet is fully in line with its vision of using technology to help other companies become more sustainable while improving business. Besides, it could help generate knowledge or experience for KPN to apply in other sectors they are active in, like automation or data spaces. In doing so, KPN can strengthen their strategic advantage in multiple sectors. Furthermore, the concept includes the development to collaborate with various companies that is seen in the market. So, it both fits KPN as the customers it is serving.","Strategic Roadmap; Maritime Developments; Ecosystem Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Carrier-selective passivating contacts (CSPC) have been proven to be effective in suppressing recombination losses at metal-silicon interface in high-efficiency crystalline silicon solar cells. The poly-Si-based CSPCs consisting of SiOX/poly-Si stacks are used in this thesis due to their compatibility with high thermal budgets. CSPCs with thin poly-Si layers are preferred since thicker poly-Si layers induce significant parasitic absorption at device level. The bifacial solar cell design could provide a higher energy yield than monofacial solar cells and largely reduce the consumption of metals such as silver, indium due to the contribution of reflected light. The objective of this thesis is to fabricate double-side textured copper (Cu)-plated bifacial poly-Si solar cells. It is achieved by developing thin poly-Si contacts, addressing the TCO sputtering-induced passivation damage, and optimizing the Cu-plating processes.<br/>Firstly, the passivation of the poly-Si symmetric samples and solar cells was optimized. 16 nm-thick n+ poly-Si and 16 nm-thick p+ poly-Si symmetric samples with intrinsic layer grown through PECVD demonstrated good passivation quality indicated by their iVOC of 713 mV and 665 mV respectively. To further improve the passivation quality of the p+ poly-Si, the layer thickness and the doping gas flow ratios were varied. Best passivation was achieved for a solar cell precursor with 42 nm-thick p+ poly-Si layers. The optimum doping gas flow ratio was found to be SiH4-B2H6=20/15 sccm. The highest iVOC achieved was 692 mV. <br/>TCO sputtering caused a severe passivation drop of ~90 mV in solar cell precursors. Post-deposition annealing treatments and 2-step TCO sputtering techniques were used to reduce such a passivation loss. However, it was challenging to reproducibly obtain solar cell precursors with good passivation quality before metallization step. The initial solar cell with double side TCO use showed cell parameters were: VOC 398 mV, FF 56.22%, JSC 30.55 mA/cm2 and η 6.85% (from n-side illumination).<br/>To maintain a good passivation quality of the solar cell precursor, an 8 nm-thick MoOX buffer layer was introduced on top of the p+ poly-Si layer. This approach effectively reduced the passivation drop from 91 mV to 12 mV. However, the MoOX layer was observed to strongly react with the solution which was used for silver seed layer removal in Cu-plating metallization procedure. Different approaches were tested to obtain a well-plated p+ poly-Si side. As for the n+ poly-Si side, a TCO-free design was deployed. To ensure a good adhesion of the plated Cu fingers, a Ti/Ag (8 nm/192 nm) seed layer was employed before Cu-plating step. Moreover, an additional SiOX layer, which acts as the anti-reflection coating, was deposited on the n-side of a complete solar cell. With these adjustments, the solar cell performance was improved to: VOC 610 mV, FF 64.98%, JSC 36.95 mA/cm2 and η 14.64% (from n-side illumination). <br/>Furthermore, with reducing the Ti thickness in the metal seed layer to 2 nm. The solar cell performance was further improved to VOC 611 mV, FF 69.58%, JSC 36.16 mA/cm2 and η 15.38% (from n-side illumination).

Before we can come up with a method to achieve a goal, we first need to make clear what we consider privacy-sensitive data. We took the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as a starting point, and performed a crowdsourcing task to see how workers interpret this regulation. Interpreting legal texts can be difficult, there is room for interpretation and the perception of a legal text can change over time. Therefore, we need to take the input of the crowd, next to our own input, to operationalize this regulation to use in this context. Next, we took a machine learning model for detecting privacy-sensitive data in images in order to retrieve saliency maps, which helps us with explaining the inner-working of the model. Subsequently, the saliency maps are inspected through a crowdsourcing task, with the established privacy definition, to find out the strengths and weaknesses. From the results, we see that crowd workers can be efficiently used to find the strengths and weaknesses of a machine learning model, while keeping the privacy definition in mind. Workers are able to consistently apply their views about privacy across different images, whilst also increasing the trust people have in the machine learning model. This shows us that we can use crowdsourcing efficiently in a fairly difficult context of privacy, and paves the way for a more sophisticated approach to privacy-sensitive elements in images, and even for contexts other than privacy.","Privacy; Privacy Detection; Machine Learning; Crowdsourcing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent times, the use of numerical reservoir simulation has not only become possible but has increasingly been used in the petroleum industry in the forecasting of output and money to be made. However, this numerical modelling and automated history matching is not without its problems. The inner workings of sophisticated commercial reservoir simulators are often taken for granted, i.e., ``black boxes''. These simulators are constructed around a numerical method, with its advantages and disadvantages. Herein, the input settings play a role in the stability and precision of results. For example, the chosen iteration method, grid spacing and time step size or even the choice of iteration parameters, all based on insufficient data, leads simulators to be unreliable and inefficient. Moreover, even under the assumption that such ``black boxes'' are able to produce a true prediction, this is entirely conditional on correctly establishing the current state and conditions. Thus, practitioners have many global settings given, many of which inaccurate. These many uncertainties can lead to costly mistakes.<br/>The aim of this study therefore: is to develop a tool that can quantify the uncertainty of a core flood model and a parameter estimation routine.<br/>Specifically, it investigates whether, given limited incoming data, an uncertain parameter can be estimated and then used to simulate and quantify the uncertainty of the water saturation and oil pressure in the core sample. In this context, we question if it be used to provide a history match of the core sample.<br/>To see how the uncertain input parameters are reflected in a model output, the tool, based on, the IMPES scheme simulates the two-phase flow, and the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to estimate the parameters. Building on the base twin experiment, a variety of twin experiments were performed to understand the parameter estimation, by presenting and visualizing the uncertainties in the data and states. We investigate the use of the EnKF for history matching and ways to improve are also explored.<br/>Based on the results of this study, it is concluded that the Ensemble Kalman Filter is capable of effective parameter estimation. With modification, it can also be used for history matching and uncertainty quantification. It clearly suggests that the utility of numerical modelling and automated history matching will continue to make contributions to the success of the exploration and extraction of fossil hydrocarbons.","Ensemble Kalman filter; EnKF; Data Assimilation; core flood history match; History matching; Core flooding; Parameter Estimation; Uncertainty Quantification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Computational Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Gijsen, F.J.H. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","b>Background</b>- A wide variation in composition is found within the thrombi retrieved from acute ischemic stroke patients. The composition of a thrombus and its mechanical properties have a significant influence on the procedural ease and success rate of mechanical retrieval procedures. If the composition and mechanical properties of a thrombus could be determined using admission computed tomography (CT) imaging, the treatment could be adjusted to ensure a good outcome in each case. This study aims to investigate and associate three thrombus characteristics related to this issue: composition, mechanics, and CT imaging characteristics. <br/><b>Methods</b>- Blood was drawn from three healthy volunteers. Analog thrombi of different compositions were prepared by combining red blood cells (RBCs) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in five different volumetric ratios: 0% RBCs and 100% PRP, 20% RBCs and 80% PRP, 40% RBCs and 60% PRP, 60% RBCs and 40% PRP, 80% RBCs and 20% PRP. To measure thrombus contraction, the weight of the resulting thrombus was expressed as a percentage of the weight of the original blood mixture. First, CT imaging was performed using micro CT and clinical CT imaging to obtain density and perviousness measurements of the thrombi. Secondly, the thrombi were subjected to a cyclic unconfined compression test to analyse stress-strain behaviour and to determine low and high strain secant moduli as a measure for thrombus stiffness. Lastly, thrombus composition was analysed using histological techniques to quantify RBCs, fibrin and platelet conglomerations, fibrin, and white blood cells. <br/><b>Results</b>- First, a positive linear relationship was found between the relative thrombus weight after <br/>contraction and the volumetric RBC ratio (r=0.98, p&lt;0.001). Secondly, with composition analysis, it was found that the thrombi with the 0% 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% volumetric RBC ratios produced thrombi with non-equivalent compositions of 0.0%, 89.8%, 95.1%, 97.4%, and 99.4% RBCs. This showed that only 0% RBC and RBC-rich (&gt;85% RBC) thrombi were created. Thirdly, on clinical CT imaging, the 0% RBC samples were found to be significantly lower in mean density compared to the RBC-rich thrombi (36 HU and 88 HU respectively, p&lt;0.001). Fourthly, the perviousness was significantly higher for the 0% RBC thrombi compared to the RBC-rich thrombi (An increase of &gt;81 HU and &lt;14 HU respectively, p&lt;0.005). Fifthly, for the mechanics, the secant modulus at high strain decreased with an increasing amount of RBCs in the original volumetric ratio. For donor one the high strain stiffness values were 263, 84, 72, 27, and 13 kPa for an increasing RBC content. Lastly, thrombus stiffness differed per donor. For example, the high strain stiffnesses for 40% RBC thrombi were 72, 432, <br/>and 33 kPa between donors. Thrombus density and perviousness on clinical CT imaging were significantly different for the 0% RBC and RBC-rich group (both p&lt;0.001). High strain stiffness was significantly correlated to the contracted thrombus weight (r=-0.68 p=0.006). <br/><b>Conclusions</b>- Both density and perviousness on clinical CT imaging were related to the RBC content of the analog thrombi. For the thrombus mechanics, the high strain stiffness of the thrombi was highly correlated to the relative thrombus weight after contraction and moderately correlated to the RBC content. This implicates that clinical imaging should strive to measure thrombus contraction as well as composition to estimate thrombus mechanics prior to mechanical retrieval.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The dispersion of these droplets is inseparable from transmission risk. Sneezing, coughing and breathing can be modelled in many ways. In this study several models of increasing complexity are proposed and compared. <br/>Three different models are distinguished. The first is a simple ballistic model, where the trajectories of particles of different sizes are simulated, given an initial velocity and particle diameter. This simulation gives a first insight in the movement of particles from Newton’s second law. <br/>Model 2 works by releasing particles in a turbulent jet. Mean properties of turbulent jets have been derived from experiments and computer modelling. By means of particle tracking, the dispersion of three different sizes of particles are monitored. The turbulent behaviour of the jet is captured by applying a stochastic discontinuous random walk model (DRW) in Model 2. The smallest particles (10 μm) are airborne, while the large (100 μm) particles fall out of the turbulent jet and settle on the ground. Medium size particles (50 μm) have the widest range of dispersion. The effect of evaporation has been studied in this research as well. Both relative humidity and relative velocity (the velocity between the surrounding air and the particle) influence the evaporation speed. The medium size particles are affected the most by evaporation. Depending on the ambient conditions, the medium size particles either behave more like the large particles or as the small particles. <br/>The third model contains the effect of an ambient crossflow, representing ventilation flows. Trajectories of bent jets have been calculated. Eulerian solutions for dilution have been found for such bent jets. No mean properties in literature have been found for bent jets and hence the Langrangian particle tracking model could not be used. <br/>Based on the results of model 2 we conclude that ventilation flows will have a tremendous impact on the dispersion of respiratory droplets, in particular the particles with initial diameter 75 - 100 μm. These droplets become airborne and will follow the ventilation flow. In dryer air droplets evaporate faster and will become airborne more quickly. <br/>Future research could be done to create a CFD model to generate analytical formulas for jets in ambient crossflows. More detailed room conditions like the stratification of air temperature can be taken into account. <br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

Since the thermal expansion of fresh ice is generally well understood, fresh ice thermal expansion experiments can be compared to sea ice, which has a more complex structure consisting of a solid ice matrix containing liquid and gas. Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) strain and temperature sensors enabled measurements of thermal expansion in fresh and saline ice samples under different boundary conditions in the cold laboratory. Experiments were compared amongst fresh and saline ice samples for three distinct applied thermal actions: air temperature change, floating in water, and flooding the ice surface. Fieldwork on fresh and sea ice under the same meteorological conditions was performed to compare thermal stresses. The thermal expansion air experiments yielded no significant differences in ECTE values for fresh, granular, and columnar saline ice. However, it was observed during the unconfined ice floating experiments that granular saline ice resulted in a larger ECTE than fresh ice. Negative values for ECTE were obtained for columnar sea ice air temperature change experiments and during granular saline ice floating experiments, both occurring during heating cycles. Flooding experiments described the thermal response of latent heat release during water freezing on the ice surface, and it was observed that fresh ice showed stronger hysteresis in results than saline ice. Thermal stresses monitored for approximately one month during winter in the Vallunden lake sea ice attached to Van Mijenfjorden and in a nearby freshwater lake demonstrated higher values for fresh ice than sea ice and increased over the depth for both ice sheets which experienced the same meteorological conditions.","ice physics; Svalbard; Arctic engineering; thermal expansion; sea ice; fresh ice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","","78.2232,15.6267"

Users tend to buy their vehicle for the 95th percentile of use-cases.

This means long-distance trips are the 95th percentile of use. <br/><br/>For mass-market BEV adoption, the Early Majority needs to be attracted. Within the Early Majority consumer segment, there are certain target groups that are most likely to adopt BEV driving. These are the potential BEV drivers and were identified through literature research. However, these target groups are not yet investing in BEVs due to the following adoption barriers that play a role in long-distance BEV trips: charging time, charging infrastructure and range. Through qualitative research such as interviews, observations and netnography, the reasons behind these adoption barriers were researched. <br/><br/>A solution has been created that mitigates these adoption barriers. The solution is a digital, data-driven, in-vehicle service system. The technical working principles of the service were designed with a new method that has been created along with the concept development, called Data Journey Mapping. This Data Journey Map shows how the different components within the data ecosystem communicate and what data they transmit. Together with Ford engineers, the working principles of the service system have been validated. <br/><br/>The solution has been validated with potential BEV drivers and current BEV drivers. Both groups stated the solution has significant added value. Potential BEV drivers stated that this solution would pull them toward investing in BEVs. Current BEV drivers stated that this solution could be decisive when comparing BEVs.<br/><br/>By launching this service system, adoption barriers of Potential BEV drivers are mitigated.

Instead, they put their visual aim point at an approximately constant time away, while they filter a constant distance after this. Moreover, drivers’ response time delays, lead time-constants, and position-to-heading feedback gains decrease with increasing driving speed. In a next step, a speed-dependent linear-parameter-varying (LPV) model was constructed to describe variable speed steering behavior. For some participants and parts of the trajectory, measured steering wheel deflections are modeled more accurately by this model than linear-time-invariant (LTI) estimates. However, simpler LTI models on average explain the measured variable speed steering better. Overall, this research clearly shows that drivers adapt their steering behavior to driving speed and how key steering behavior parameters are adjusted with speed. Modeling this adaptation for realistic driving, however, is challenging due to the still unknown dynamics between speed and parameter adaptation.","manual control; lane keeping; driver modeling; preview control; system identification; linear parameter varying","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-12-20","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

They are produced by the thyroid and their concentration is regulated by a negative feedback loop involving also the hypothalamus and the pituitary. Many studies have shown that each individual has a unique HPT axis set-point, which means that everyone has his or her own personal level of thyroid hormones. However, when the thyroid is affected by a disease, such as hypothyroidism, a change in the thyroid function modifies the levels of thyroid hormones, therefore they do not match the patient’s set-point anymore. Hence, the aim of this thesis is to investigate the relationship between the thyroid hormones TSH and FT4 in order to predict each individual’s set-point. Moreover, the variation in time of the two hormones in patients under medication is studied as well, which allows to determine around which values the concentrations of TSH and FT4 will stabilize and, if these are not matching the set-point, to adjust the patient’s medication dosage. This research was conducted using patients’ datasets from different hospitals. In particular, datasets of hypothyroid and thyroidectomized patients were included in this study. The analysis of hypothyroid patients’ measurements shows that TSH can be expressed as a negative exponential function of FT4. Furthermore, the individual set-point can be predicted as the point of maximum curvature of that function and this has been validated using data from thyroidectomized patients. Finally, a model of coupled differential equations, taking into account the effects of medication, has been developed to describe how the concentrations of the hormones are changing in time after a patient starts the treatment.","HPT axis; HPT set-point; Endrocrine system; Numerical Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Measurements of the salinity of the plumes (0.5-2%) and the size of the emitted particles, indicate a subsurface liquid ocean beneath the crust of ice. The vent temperature of the plumes were measured to be relatively high (170-210 K) compared to the cold surface temperature of Enceladus. The mass flow, velocity and particle size show a wide range of possible values, whereas the solid fraction is estimated between 7 - 20 %. Here we demonstrate a fluid dynamics model that accounts for nucleation, particle growth, wall accretion and sublimation and the viscous interaction with the walls. The channels behave as converging-diverging nozzles, which form supersonic plumes due to a pressure difference between the reservoir and the exosphere. The geometry of the channel, the reservoir conditions and wall interactions are studied to reproduce the characteristics of the plumes observed by Cassini. From a parameter study performed on the crevasse properties we find that the velocity and the solid fraction increase with the expansion ratio, whereas the exit temperature is inversely related to the expansion ratio. The interactions with the walls reduce the mass flow in the channel and start condensation earlier in the channel, this increases the solid fraction, particle size and velocity and reduces the exit temperature. The particle size is dominantly dependent on the length of the channel, large particles (75 *10(-6)m) must originate from up to a kilometre below the surface, while smaller particles (3 *10(-6) m) can originate from 150 m below the surface. The channel requires an expansion ratio close to Dthroat/Dexit = 4, to generate the observed exit temperature &lt;210 K with velocities up to 950 m/s and a solid fraction ranging from 0.07-0.2. The minimum width of the channel needs to be in the order of meters to withhold the channel from freezing up within days and a liquid reservoir at a temperature near triple point is most probable to agree with the observed exit temperature and velocity.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Some research effort has focused on incorporating crowdsourcing techniques into this field to check and correct errors in existing methods. However, since this is a costly process, improvements in efficiency are key to making these systems applicable for music transcription.

To design and evaluate this system, we have collected an extensive dataset of published music scores and their symbolic transcriptions. We have manually created annotations that map the symbolic scores to the printed scores on the measure level, so that we can obtain a ground truth from it. We have improved an existing staff detection algorithm and compared it to the original using our dataset. We have also developed our own barline detection algorithm and evaluated it against the dataset. We used both these algorithms to segment the pages of music into images of the individual measures of our dataset. We used the FastPAM k-medoids clustering algorithm with distances between measures based on Dynamic Time Warping to build clusters of measures that are rhythmically similar to each other. Using the ground truth, we evaluated the clusters we obtained. Although we notice that the selected method of clustering does not always separate the measures into clear rhythmic classes, we discuss possible solutions for it and suggest how the results can still be applicable in the crowdsourcing setting.","Optical Music Recognition; Music score mapping; Staff detection; Barline detection; Measure detection; Dynamic Time Warping; k-medoids clustering; Rhythmic similarities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the end, we have to change together to succeed within the Energy Transition. Because of the local character of the Energy Transition and a responsibility shift, the municipalities have got the challenging task to increase citizen involvement. Local energy initiatives can be a promising solution for the Energy Transition. Therefore, the local energy initiatives can be interesting for municipalities when increasing citizen involvement.<br/>The aim of this research is to find a way for the municipality to make use of these local energy initiatives when trying to increase citizen involvement in the Energy Transition. The specific context of this research is the city of The Hague. The following research question has been formulated for this purpose: How can the municipality of The Hague increase citizen participation in the Energy Transition through local energy initiatives? <br/>In order to answer the research question, a collective case study and a design process are executed. In advance, preparatory research was conducted to explore relevant theoretical concepts for the research and to analyze the stakeholder ecosystem of the local energy initiatives. The collective case study was performed by conducting nine in-depth interviews with local energy initiatives based on a research framework. This research framework was substantiated by the Transformative Social Innovation framework. Furthermore, the design process is based on the Double Diamond approach using divergent and convergent thinking. Within this design process, multiple participatory elements were included like workshops and prototyping sessions with local energy initiatives and civil servants of the municipality of The Hague. <br/>From the research, it appeared that the local energy initiatives in The Hague fulfill a basic role and five specific roles, namely ‘awareness creation’, ‘action perspective creation’, ‘collaboration with the municipality’, ‘voice at the table’, and ‘execution and ownership’. It also came forward that the potential of the contribution of the local energy initiatives to the Energy Transition is not reached. This has three reasons. Firstly, there is no shared vision among the stakeholders. Secondly, the relationship with the municipality is undefined and inconsistent. Thirdly, there are several small challenges as keeping the initiative going, reaching out to people, and not being representative for the neighborhood. When looking at the relationship, the core challenge seemed a way to prioritize and choose the municipal support to provide, to which initiative, and at which moment. <br/>Based on this, a final concept was developed to create a strategy and action repertoire for the municipal support per neighborhood and initiative. The strategy is created based on three main questions regarding which roles to support, which support to provide, and how to provide the support. These questions are answered through the three perspectives of Design Thinking (desirability, feasibility, and viability) to cover the multiple aspects to consider when creating the strategy. Possible further research could focus on the development of the final concept in real-life cases and on the applicability of the five initiative’s roles and final concept in other contexts.","Participatory City Making; Delft Design Labs; Municipality of The Hague; Energy Transition; Transformative Social Innovation; Local energy initiatives; Citizen participation; Strategy and action repertoire","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double degree in Industrial Ecology and Integrated Product Design","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

During this fuel cell reversal, the potential of the anode rises and the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) and Carbon Oxidation Reaction (COR) will occur. Applying an OER catalyst to the anode prevents the COR to destroy the anode. Therefore, a reversal tolerant anode (RTA) is created. In this research, the RTA was made by the introduction of an OER catalyst (IrOx supported on TiOx) to the anode. Electrochemical investigations on the RTA were done with a Rotating Disc Electrode (RDE), which allowed applying potentials on the RTA that occur during fuel cell reversal. However, these potentials on an OER catalyst with a RDE set-up is known to be troublesome. This can be devoted to the formation of oxygen bubbles, which are hard to evacuate in a RDE set-up and block reactant. Therefore, a special accelerated stress test (AST) has been developed in this research to diminish the effects of oxygen bubbles. This AST was used to investigate the effects of different processing techniques on the RTA performance and durability at fuel cell reversal potentials. Pt/C and IrOx/TiOx particles could be differentiated into bigger and smaller particles on the micrometer scale based on different ball milling times used during processing. This was confirmed by laser diffraction measurements, which supplied information on the particle size distribution (PSD). Besides, differences in the catalyst layer structure were confirmed by a laser microscope. In the AST, it was found that the activity towards the OER was higher for smaller particles, which could be explained by the increased surface area. It was found for all samples in the AST that there was loss of OER activity and Electrochemical Surface Area (ECSA) of Pt. Impedance spectroscopy, XPS and SEM/EDS showed that these losses could highly probable be devoted to the decrease of the ionomer content. Finally, to mimic real fuel cell reversal conditions in a RDE set-up, adjusted chronopotentiometry measurements were developed and applied. It was found that the higher OER active smaller particles had a worse tolerance against fuel cell reversal than the bigger particles.","PEMFC; Anode; OER; Reversal Tolerant Anode; Rotating-Disc-Electrode (RDE)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-15","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

With current techniques for investigation of bacterial resistance requiring a minimum of 24 hours to complete, a new technique is essential to reduce the widespread misuse of antibiotics worldwide. In the last decade, new methods of this so-called Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing have been on the rise, with an emphasis on the use of nanomechanical oscillators as highly sensitive sensors. In this thesis, a novel method based on cavities in silicon substrates is introduced to detect the motion of a single motile bacterium and is compared to a highly sensitive sensor based on graphene membranes. A sensor with bacteria attached will exhibit random oscillations and these oscillations can be monitored with a laser. The rigid silicon substrates are intuitively not showing any oscillations. Nonetheless, the motility of a bacterium can still be observed by the changes in the laser path. By using an interferometric setup and monitoring the fluctuation in the voltage signal, coming from bacterial biophysical processes, the Signal-to-Noise-Ratio is determined. The amplitude increase in the fluctuation of the signal is evidently correlated with the motility of the bacteria and is demonstrated to show an increasing trend when presented with a deterministically known topographical location of the bacteria. Subsequently, the ability to detect motile cells enables the capabilities of Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing on these substrates, by monitoring the change in motion of the bacteria prior and post exposure to an effective antibiotic. The motion change, due to antibiotic exposure, is observed to show a significant difference even for a single bacterium, which opens up opportunities for an elementary non-invasive monitoring tool based on silicon.","Nanomotion detection; Silicon cavities; Single-cell sensitivity; Graphene sensor; Antibioitic Susceptibility Testing; E. coli bacterium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Dynamics of Micro and Nano Systems","",""

An effect of this is that the part of the body that is exposed the most to the sun is also the body part where skin cancer is seen more often; the head. When the skin cancer gets removed surgically, the defect is sometimes so big that reconstructive surgery has to take place. This treatment is impactful for patients, since their face can abruptly change, impacting their social interactions. <br/><br/>This project explores the patient experience that facial skin cancer patients have throughout their treatment and how augmented reality (AR) could contribute in this treatment, to ultimately bring about a better quality of life (QoL).<br/><br/>In the first phase of this project qualitative research was conducted. Interviews with healthcare professionals (HCPs) and observations in the hospital helped to understand the context for patients. Contextmapping interviews with patients gave insights on the patient journey they went through. It was found that this journey can best be explained as an emotional roller coaster with a long recovery phase. <br/><br/>In the second phase of this project the final concept “Face it” came about through experimentation with AR software and co-creation with HCPs using the patient journey as a basis.

The final concept was evaluated as a good example of digitalization to evoke patient engagement in their own care and with that patient empowerment. <br/><br/>This design research showed that there is a need and opportunity for more digitalization in healthcare. Furthermore, the project has shown that solutions in healthcare can benefit from taking a more holistic approach to a problem.

In order to decide on whether it would be wise to reconstruct this dolmen, it is useful to understand the stability of potential reconstruction scenarios without having to perform invasive tests that could damage the structure. To this end, this research has focused on the application of non-destructive, digital methods to analyze the stability of dolmen D14. Laser scanners were used to obtain point cloud data from the zone around the dislocated capstone, with which 3D meshes were created. Furthermore, tests were conducted to estimate the relevant parameters to quantify the shear strength of the rock contact areas. This was done in the field using the Equotip and Barton’s comb and by performing tilt tests and Golder shear box tests in the laboratory. For the rock parameters, a basic friction angle of 33° was found with tilt tests and a residual friction angle of 31.2° and 30.5° was found for the Golder shear box on a flat sample. The meshes and rock parameters were used as input to conduct stability analyses in 3DEC. Two different models were analyzed, one based on the rock configuration as it was in 2019 (Model 1) and the second model with a rock configuration as it was in 1925 (Model 2). In the stability analysis, it was found that Model 1 is much more unstable compared to Model 2. The minimum pushing force for instability of the structure was 2 kN for Model 1 and 94 kN for Model 2, for the conditions under research. Furthermore, it was found that the number of cycles used in the analysis, mesh coarseness and rock joint friction angle all have a significant impact on the model results.

Based on those predictions, maintenance demand is scheduled.

Yet the weak gravitational fields of small bodies, coupled with the prominent influence of confounding accelerations, hinder the efficacy of this method. Meanwhile, quantum sensors based on Cold Atom Interferometry (CAI) have demonstrated absolute measurements with an inherent stability and repeatability, reaching the utmost accuracy in microgravity. This work addresses the potential of CAI-based Gradiometry (CG) as a means to strengthen the RS gravity experiment for small-body missions. Phobos represents an ideal science case as astronomic observations and recent flybys have conferred enough information to define a robust orbiting strategy, whilst promoting studies linking its geodesic observables to its origin. A covariance analysis was adopted to evaluate the contribution of RS and CG in the gravity field solution, for a mission duration of one week.<br/><br/>The favourable observational geometry and the small characteristic period of the gravity signal add to the competitiveness of Doppler observables. Provided that empirical accelerations can be modelled below the nm/s2 level, RS is able to infer the 6x6 spherical harmonic spectrum to an accuracy of 0.1-1% w.r.t. the homogeneous interior values. If this correlates to a density anomaly beneath the Stickney crater, RS would suce to constrain Phobos’ origin. Yet, in event of a rubble pile or icy moon interior (or a combination thereof) CG remains imperative, enabling an accuracy below 0.1% for most of the 10x10 spectrum. Nevertheless, technological advancements will be needed to alleviate the current logistical challenges associated with CG operation. This work also reflects on the sensitivity of the candidate orbits with regards to dynamical model uncertainties, which are common in small-body environments. This brings confidence in the applicability of the identified geodetic estimation strategy for missions targeting other moons, particularly those of the Giant planets, which are targets for robotic exploration in the coming decades.","Cold Atom Interferometry; Phobos origin; Space geodesy; Radio Science; Gravity gradiometry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This research proposes a new differentiator for estimating higher order derivatives of an input signal. The main reason why higher order derivatives are necessary is that Active Inference makes use of generalized coordinates. This means that it keeps internally track of higher order temporal derivatives of states, inputs and measurements. The difficult part of generalized coordinates are the generalized measurements, because these should be measured from a physical system. However, it is not always possible to measure all states of a system and it is definitely not possible to measure all higher order derivatives. A solution to this is to estimate the derivatives of states by using real time differentiators.<br/><br/>A short literature study about differentiators is conducted and found that the state of the art differentiator is the algebraic estimation approach differentiator (AEAD). However, this and other differentiators have the problem that when they are converted to discrete time, they cannot track polynomial signals anymore. For that reason, this thesis proposes a new differentiator: the recurrent<br/>low pass algebraic differentiator (RLPAD).<br/><br/>The proposed differentiator is compared with the (AEAD) in two experiments. The first experiment evaluates the performance based on three analytical inputs with known higher order derivatives. The three inputs are: a polynomial, a sine and a combination of the two. Additionally these three inputs are corrupted by Gaussian white noise. This experiment concludes that the proposed method outperforms the (AEAD) significantly when a polynomial or polynomial combined with sine input is used. They perform similar for sine inputs, although (RLPAD) is considered slightly better.<br/><br/>The second experiment evaluates how the two differentiators perform when real sensor data is used. In order to conduct the experiment, the raw data is smoothed by a Savitzky-Golay filter to create a ground truth about the derivatives. This experiment concludes that the differentiators have an optimal set of parameters, where either the one or the other performs better. The proposed method performs a lot better when few derivatives are estimated. On the other hand (AEAD) performs better when there are more derivatives estimated. However, this is not true when the noise gets stronger. (AEAD) is more sensitive to noise than the proposed method.<br/><br/>Based on the experiments, the proposed method (RLPAD) is the better differentiator for creating generalized measurements in Active Inference for three reasons. The first is that it can track polynomial signals. The second is that it has stronger noise attenuation.

This push created a need to place sustainability and numerous relevant technologies and approaches at the centre of the firms’ decision-making process. Within the financial industry, the combination of novel data technologies such as Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the inclusion of sustainability, or so-called “ESG”, Environment, Social, and governance data spearpoint this new ‘sustainable’ frontier. <br/>Literature shows that the implementation of the combination of ESG data, Big Data and AI, within a financial institution and as a corporate resource is a rather novel subject, with no directly related literature available. Thus, this thesis aims to address the topic of implementing ESG data, Big Data and AI within a financial institution. The main research question answered within this thesis is set out to explore this combination of sustainability data, also known as ESG data, Big Data and AI. This study aims to provide a starting point to fill this knowledge gap by creating novel theoretical propositions to be tested in future research. The following research question has been devised to address this research problem.<br/><br/>What observations can be extracted from assessing the introduction of a Big Data and AI toolset applying ESG data within a procedure?<br/><br/>The main research question is answered through the use of theoretical propositions. These novel theoretical propositions illustrate key observations made during the case study. For each proposition, future research directions are given. These propositions, thus, the answer to the main research question are:<br/>- The perception within a firm of using Big Data and AI within a process could affect the learning rate and the learning approach taken by the user. This affects the acceptance of the technology. Thus, the perception could affect the adoption rate of Big Data and AI within a firm.<br/>- If Big Data and AI are used within a process, people tend to be convinced by Big Data and AI used within the process, thus Big Data and AI can be used to convince people of the validity of the results of the process.<br/>- If conferred management information is substantiated by an information process using Big Data and AI, then people do not have the tendency to acknowledge the inherent biases in such processes.<br/>- If Big Data and AI are used within a process, data quality and source are perceived as of less importance.<br/>- There could be causation between one's knowledge of Big Data and AI, and the perception of bias when assessing a process that uses Big Data and AI.<br/>- ESG data is context-dependent, illustrating that a structured or unstructured approach to ESG data depends on the application of ESG data.<br","Big Data; AI; Artificial Intelligence; ESG; ESG data; Sustainability; Financial sector; Financial Institution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The linear growth of the disturbance in the form of a wave (also called the Tollmien-Schlichting wave) was of particular interest.

But the size of rotors is now limited by structural constraints as well as space constraints in wind farms. It is therefore important to use other innovative methods to increase wind turbine capacity without increasing size. One way to achieve this is by the use of winglets. Winglets increase power output by reducing tip effects, thereby producing a more efficient distribution of forces over the blade. The art of designing winglets is to find the best trade-off between the increase in profile drag of the winglet itself and the reduction of induced drag that the winglet provides. To do this, it is very important to fully understand the aerodynamics of winglets on wind turbine blades.<br/><br/>High-fidelity methods like CFD are capable of producing accurate and detailed flow fields and are able to offer greater insight into the complex aerodynamics of winglets on rotors. However, this comes at great computational cost which might be infeasible in the design and optimization of winglets. More common and cheaper models like the BEM method are incapable of modelling winglets and other out-of-plane features. The Lifting Line Method is a middle ground that is capable of simulating winglets but is also comparatively inexpensive. <br/><br/>The goal of this thesis is to study the performance of the Lifting Line method, in particular, ECN Aeromodule's AWSM Free-Wake Vortex Lifting Line code in simulating the case of winglets mounted on wind turbines. AWSM results are compared with results of normal and tangential forces and circulation distribution from a validated OpenFOAM model. The results show that over the outboard section of the blade and over the span of the winglet, AWSM performs well in predicting the performance of the blade-winglet configuration. This study shows that AWSM is a reliable tool for the design and optimization of winglets on wind turbine blades at a much lower cost than higher fidelity methods like CFD.","lifting-line method; CFD; Wind Turbine; Aerodynamics; Free-Wake Vortex Methods; RANS; Winglet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Additionally, the multi-stakeholder nature of UAM calls for a traffic mitigation approach that addresses the major concerns of UAM - safety and environmental impact. In order to address this problem, an Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) framework that follows a multi-path approach has been developed as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model in this paper. Compared to flights that follow a single fixed path, this multi-path approach is seen to show a delay cost reduction of upto 96.3%. On incorporating an impact mitigation part to the original ATFM framework, it was seen that delay cost increased by 25% compared to the multi-path model. On the other hand, the impact of traffic densities in urban airspace was seen to reduce by 43.47%.

(TU Delft Industrial Design Engineering)","Schoormans, J.P.L. (mentor); Cankurtaran, P. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The initial goal of this graduation project was to find a way to establish a reliable digital relationship with PostNL’s consumer. This is considered an important part of a digital transformation strategy that is necessary for traditional postal companies to stay relevant in a digital era. One of the main challenges of this digital era, relevant for PostNL, is the increasing uncertainty of knowing who one is dealing with online. This assignment focuses on the idea of implementing a digital identity (eID) that can be used during digital and physical encounters with PostNL and is able to provide the desired certainty to ensure a more safe and seamless service. Thereby the focus during this project is especially on how this digital identity can be established, with whom and which certainties are absolutely necessary for doing so. Digital identities that enable a consumer to prove who he or she is online, can exist out of multiple attributes that define this (online) user. Worldwide these digital identities are increasingly being adopted by companies active in multiple service industries, including LSPs. However, this does not mean that companies can simply request all kinds of data from their consumers to confirm the needed attributes. With regard to regulations including those concerned with privacy (GDPR), they are required to keep data processing to a minimum and are therefore only allowed to request data that is absolutely necessary. For PostNL, it was found that sufficient desired certainty would be possible to be established by personal validation or address validation. Although consumers do see PostNL as a reliable party (the most reliable within the Netherlands), they do not seem to be willing to (digitally) share sensitive personal information such as a picture of their ID with PostNL. Address validation on the other hand does not require too much personal information about an individual but does provide the assurance that that individual has a high probability of righteous access to the address he/she uses online. For PostNL this is most important since they provide logistics services at these addresses. As a privatized company that is not allowed to simply make use of governmental databases, PostNL is currently mainly dependent on other (commercial) parties. However, it is highly desired to establish certainty themselves, create and keep data internal. This resulted in the suggestion of a multilayered address validation system enable to establish different types of address certainty. In the ideal situation, a consumer should be processed through as many layers as possible to realize maximum certainty. Thereby the starting point is to make it as convenient as possible for consumers while raising a threshold as high as possible for fraudsters. Not only does this strengthen security, but it also increases the reach as each type is being preferred by a different group of consumers. It also enables PostNL to create, use and keep internal data while offering significant added value for the consumers in return. One element of this system has shown high potential and was selected for further elaboration, namely Stikky: a smart solution that combines the physical with the digital. It enables consumers to prove that they have righteous access to an address, while simultaneously adding significant value to them. As a result, this enables PostNL to achieve a higher first-time-right while simultaneously making it more difficult for malicious people to commit package fraud. Interesting target groups for Stikky are considered: frequent orderers, digital-savvy millennials living in urbanized areas, and worried receiving consumers. Finally, a design roadmap has been discussed that shows the long term strategy towards a multi-purpose eCommerce-ID. To have a starting point for this, also a short-term implementation plan has been provided that guides Stikky the way to a successful market introduction within six months.","Digital transformation; Digital identity; Logistics solutions; Design strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

This has several reasons. It comes partly because of the overdue of the maintenance (Amsterdam, 2019) but also because the traffic load for which the bridge has been designed, is lower than the present traffic load (Amsterdam, 2019). The current Eurocode 4 does not guarantee the safety of this type of bridge decks. To guarantee the safety and the remaining service life of the historical bridges in Amsterdam, the municipality has started an investigation on historical steel-concrete-composite-bridge-decks. The focus in this thesis is on historical steel-concrete-composite-bridge-decks (a.k.a. Verbundträger brücken in German) because this type of bridges does not contain shear connectors in their configuration. This leads to the fact that the capacity of the bridge deck is almost not determined in the longitudinal and completely not determined in the transversal direction. The bridge deck in the longitudinal direction satisfies the unity check based on the protocol of the municipality of Amsterdam to check this type of bridges on safety, where they only consider the steel profile to define the capacity of the bridge in this direction. This is very conservative because the concrete is not taken into account during the calculation of the cross-section. In the transverse direction, the bridge deck does not fulfil the necessary unit check limit, because the municipality takes only the shrinkage reinforcement into consideration during their calculations. In addition to this, the state of the bridge decks and relevant research about how the bridge deck is build-up, is investigated. The main conclusion that can be taken from the cross-section of these type of bridge decks is that there is a lot of variation in all the components of the bridge decks. <br/><br/>Furthermore, during the investigation of the bridge decks it is decided to choose three typical bridge decks (A, B, C), which will be simulated to gain more insights about the cross-section of these historical bridge decks. The current Eurocode 4, which is implemented to guarantee the safety of the type of cross-section containing steel and concrete, does not provide an answer to calculate the load-bearing capacity of historical steel-concrete-composite-bridge-decks, because of a significant difference between the designed current Eurocode 4 model and the designed cross section of the historical model.<br/><br/>The behaviour of the bridge is studied in two directions based on the available literature. In the longitudinal direction, the focus is on the interaction between steel and concrete and how this interaction can be described. In the transverse direction, the aim is to find the relevant failure mechanism and corresponding modelling approach to define the behaviour of the bridge deck in the transverse direction of these bridge decks. The failure mechanisms that were evaluated are: Punching shear failure, compressive membrane action, and failure of concrete strut.<br/><br/>The assessment of the aforementioned failure mechanisms is carried out and the most logical model which can be used to validate during the FEA-simulation is the failure of concrete strut which can be modelled by strut and tie model. This model will also be carried out on the other two chosen bridges, next to bridge A on which the in-situ-load-test is done, to validate this model on more than one bridge deck. There was made use of an analytical model based on Eurocode 2, which has been compared the values of the numerical simulations…","bridge deck; Composite","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","Bruggen en Kademuren","52.362222, 4.891667"

Designing flexible and reliable future energy systems is a big contributor to meeting these goals. While energy system models have improved in the last few decades, they remain vulnerable against parametric and structural uncertainty due to the varying characteristics of parameters and the hardship of modelling all constraints and drivers accurately. This thesis proposes a method that addresses both uncertainty types in energy system modelling by applying SPORES cost optimisation and Monte Carlo scenario modelling simultaneously. <br/><br/>The main case study uses 27 input scenarios with varying outcomes for grid electricity price, solar yield and energy consumption to provide insight in a 100 household neighbourhood energy system with heating, cooling, electricity and hydrogen as energy carriers.

These configurations are tested for cost, security of supply, CO2 emissions and grid dependency. Those results are visualised through ridge plots and statistical tables to provide a clear overview between each configuration’s trade-offs. An example is included to show how those results can be used for improving energy system design in practice.<br/><br/>This thesis shows that two methods can successfully be combined into one universal one, while providing valuable design insights for energy systems under uncertainty.

(mentor); Foppen, Jan Willem (graduation committee); Chassagne, C. (graduation committee); Kianfar, B. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Colloidal particle swarms can show settling velocities over a thousand times as fast as that of a single particle. The transport of colloidal particles is thus strongly affected by the formation and behaviour of these particle swarms, which could have important implications for the widespread use and prevalence of colloidal particles. Swarming effects may for example pose possibilities and limitations to the use of (colloidal) DNA tracers in various systems. Furthermore, contaminant transport in blue-green porous infrastructure may be greatly enhanced due to the rapid settling of swarms of colloidal contaminants, resulting in rapid spreading of contaminants into the environment. To better understand colloidal particle swarms in these systems, this thesis studied the effect of particle concentration on the behaviour of colloidal swarms in varying confining geometries. To this extent, colloidal particles were injected at various concentrations in a macro-model that was suspended in a stagnant water column. The macro-model consisted of three different artificial confining geometries: a smooth fracture, a rough fracture and a pore network. Released swarms were imaged to determine their velocity, width, travelled distance to bifurcation and particle leakage rates from the swarm. In the smooth and rough fracture, the settling velocity of colloidal particle swarms was modelled with the Hadamard &amp; Rybczynski (HR) equation, using the particle leakage rate of the swarm. The average swarm velocity in the pore network was modelled with equations that described the Boycott effect. In both the smooth and rough fracture, the average velocity of the swarm showed a slight decreasing trend with increasing particle concentration. Presumably, this was caused by the linear relationship between particle concentration and width of the swarm. Consequently, wider swarms experienced lower velocities due to increased hydrodynamic drag forces imposed on the swarm. In the pore network, a strong linear relation was found between the average swarm velocity and the particle concentration. A larger mass of the swarm may have been the cause for this. The travelled distance before bifurcation took place did not show a clear relationship with particle concentration. However, in the performed experiments, swarms did bifurcate at a threshold width in both the smooth and rough fracture. This threshold width increased with concentration. The HR model did not fit the swarm velocity in the smooth fracture well, because confining forces of the fracture walls enhanced swarm velocity, which was not accounted for by the HR model. Yet, in the rough fracture the HR model did fit well to the observed swarm velocity since the increased drag forces of wall on the swarm counteracted the confining forces. The effect of particle concentration on the average swarm velocity in the pore network was sufficiently well modelled in terms of the Boycott effect. It was recommended that in future studies laminar flow is introduced to enable better interpretation of results for natural systems. In addition, a more simple pore network geometry provides a more gradual transition to the used complex pore network geometry. This would allow for clearer investigation of swarm behaviour in porous media. Also, more research on swarm behaviour after bifurcation may provide more insight in the longevity of swarm effects. To determine if colloidal particle swarms may occur in natural fractured media, results of this study should be compared to a field study. Both physical and chemical disturbances may severely hinder colloidal swarms. For both fractured and porous media, injection into a natural sample may provide more insight in behaviour in natural systems. It is however unlikely that swarming effects play a big role in urban colloidal contaminant transport in porous media.","Colloidal particles; Microparticles; Particle swarms; DNA tracers; Fractured media; Porous media","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Secure communication between these entities is established using cryptographic symmetric keys loaded beforehand. Train and trackside entities across Europe are maintained by different Key Management Centres (KMC), making the distribution of the symmetric keys challenging. The involved parties would benefit from using a single European key distribution system. Nevertheless, a recent study concluded that a centralised approach of such a single system is not feasible.<br/><br/>This work presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first decentralised key management system to be used by railway KMC across Europe. Existing procedures mandate that key distribution activities concerning key generation, distribution and deletion must be logged. To meet this requirement, the proposed decentralised system is based on a private and permissioned blockchain. The network is maintained by the KMC making use of the system and access to the system is granted by Registration Centres. <br/><br/>During the design of a single system to replace several one-to-one solutions between KMC, it came into light that train and/or trackside equipment owners might not accept revealing certain types of relationships, as these could, for example, reveal commercial strategies. To overcome this, the proposed decentralised system introduces privacy-preserving and verifiable combinations of train and trackside entities. The protocol is based around the decisional Diffie–Hellman assumption witness indistinguishable proofs.<br/><br/>The proposed design enables European railway KMC to use a single decentralised and scalable system to exchange cryptographic material in a secure and privacy-preserving way. Scalability is shown by building a proof-of-concept based a Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus protocol. Performance analysis shows that the proposed system is scalable when a proof of concept is implemented with settings close to the expected railway landscape in 2030.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These particles are partly responsible for cloud formation and are detected amongst others in (forest fire) smoke, dust, volcanic ash or sulfates. Aerosols have a large influence on the Earth’s climate as well as on air quality. Currently, SPEXone is one of the most promising instruments considering aerosol research due to the versatile nature of measurement methods based on multiple-angle polarization observations. Therefore, the SPEXone instrument will be implemented aboard the PACE satellite, designed primarily for aerosol observations for climate research of the Earth. The PACE satellite will be launched by NASA in 2025. The measurements of SPEXone provides highly relevant information on aerosol type for source apportionment. This raises the question whether SPEXone can serve as a stand-alone air quality monitoring system, thereby responding to the increasing awareness of the importance of monitoring air quality worldwide. Thus, this thesis focuses on the applicability of the SPEXone instrument regarding air quality monitoring by investigating plume polarization detection based on two relevant use cases. In this study, the plumes were simulated according to Gaussian plume behaviour in combination with a collection of observation scenarios. SPEXone measurements were simulated by using a radiative transfer model and instrument noise model to simulate the degree of linear polarization at the satellite sensor. This study found that for very optimistic emission rates, plume detection was possible for about 90 percent out of 144 measurements and between 79 and 67 percent out of 144 measurements at a wavelength of 670 nm. However, lowering the emission rate to realistic values showed that, apart from some very rare cases, no detection was possible. This leads to the conclusion that polarization signatures from the emitted aerosols in the simulated plumes are too weak in order to be detected above the polarization signature of the background. Nonetheless, due to the complexity of aerosol modelling, not all contributing factors were given the same level of detail, i.e. varying microphysical properties and the exact influence of the vertical height profile of the plume. Future research needs to focus on these aspects in order to yield a conclusive result of the applicability of the SPEXone instrument regarding air quality monitoring. Additionally, a different approach to characterize the background noise may increase the probability for plume detection.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

A root cause, among others, is poor information management. Recently, the ISO 19650 series have been released to offer the construction industry a guideline for the organization and digitization of information in construction assets when building information modelling (BIM) is used. However, a uniform application of standards in projects is not recommended as it can hamper flexibility and versatility. An essential document of ISO 19650 is the BIM Execution Plan (BEP) which appears more and more often in projects that use BIM, aiming to facilitate information management. However, organizations struggle to set up a process to customize a BEP that fits the project's needs. Therefore, this research focuses on the BIM Execution Plan (BEP) and how this can be tailored to fit the needs of a project. In addition, this thesis focuses on the preparation phase of infrastructure projects where the post-contract BIM execution plan applies. To conduct this study, first, the literature was reviewed, and a questionnaire was distributed to practitioners to evaluate the literature's findings. Next, semi-structured and structured interviews captured the practitioners' perceptions. As a result, influencing project characteristics for the BEP customization were found, mostly related to a) The experience and capability of the involved parties, b) The existence and use of ICT systems in the project, and c) The clarity of the project' and client's needs. The main research result is a) a process for customizing a BEP based on a list of project characteristics and b) a decision support tool that practically captures this process. Both the process and the tool aim to help BEP authors and recommend the extent of development of the BEP contents as per the project's needs. The validation results of the decision support tool are encouraging. More specifically, the tool's results have a small deviation from what experts recommend without the tool.","BIM Execution Plan; BIM, Building Information Modelling; ISO 19650; Standard Customization; Standard tailoring; Project characteristics; Tailoring process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Implementing renewable energy generation and more sustainable consumption behaviour in the future inland shipping industry is necessary. Electrification of the inland shipping fleet leads to an increase in electrical energy demand on the consumption side. The generation of decentralized photovoltaic (PV) energy systems on board of general cargo vessels can be one solution to these challenges. To estimate the potential of these decentralized energy systems, accurate simulation models are needed. The objective of this research is to determine the photovoltaic potential of the Dutch general cargo inland shipping fleet. <br/>A method is developed to simulate the energy yield of moving general cargo vessels. The estimated energy yield is based on hourly power calculations. A difference is made between container and bulk vessels. This simulation model consists of a skyline, a vessel, an irradiance, a PV module temperature, and an energy model. In the skyline model, skyline profiles for 3036 waterway points are generated using LIDAR AHN3 height data. The waterways skylines are corrected for every vessel individually. In the vessel model, AIS (automatic identification system) data is used to simulate the sailing behaviour of 2746 vessels. In the irradiance model, the diffused, direct and ground reflection irradiance received by the PV panel is simulated. The diffused irradiance is calculated according to the Perez model. The PV module temperature is estimated according to the fluid-dynamic model. The additional air caused by the forward movement of the vessel and the water temperature is taken into account. Finally, the PV energy yield is calculated by the received irradiance, the suitable PV surface and the corrected PV module efficiency. <br/>An experiment is performed to validate the developed model, where a PV panel is installed on the vessel Harmonie. Equipment is installed to monitor Harmonie during one docking week and two sailing weeks. A co-variance linear regression model describes the relationship between the measured and the estimated PV power. According to the co-variance linear regression model, the P-value for the simulated PV power is below 0.05 and, therefore statistically significant. The outcome of the linear regression model is overestimated by 4 % with a 95 % confidence interval between 0.87 and 1.05. <br/>740,958 PV panels can be installed on the general cargo fleet. Together, these panels have an installed peak power of 267 [MW] and an annual estimated PV potential of 230 [GWh]. The annual PV energy per unit area of a container vessel is 171 [kWh/m2 ] and for a bulk vessel 168 [kWh/m2 ]. The annual PV energy per installed power for a container vessel is 864 [Wh/Wp] and for a bulk vessel 852 [Wh/Wp]. When the outliers are removed from the annual specific power [Wh/Wp] dataset, the complete fleet can be modelled by a Weibull distribution. A t locationscale distribution is suggested when the outliers are not removed from the dataset. The average annual energy demand of a container vessel is 1440 [MWh], 7.17 % of this demand can be supplied by the PV panels installed on the vessel. Bulk vessels have an energy demand of 1350 [MWh] on average, of which the installed PV panels can cover 5.82 %.<br","Photovoltaic systems; Inland shipping; LIDAR; AIS; General cargo vessel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-17","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

In this study, a portable fog generator system was designed and assembled to visualise the airflow pattern of exhaled droplets in a classroom. The system consists of five components: medium, fog generator, buffer, pump, and manikin head. The medium was made of a combination of glycol and demineralised water, which produced a fog composed of droplets mimicking to some extent human breath. The fog was produced with the fog generator and passed through a pipe into the buffer for build-up. After accumulation, the fog is pumped through another pipe and is exhaled out of the mouth of the manikin. The experiments were conducted in a simulated classroom. The lights of the room were dimmed and six lasers were used to make the fog more visible. Four different ventilation regimes were examined: no ventilation, natural ventilation (open windows and door), mixing ventilation (600 m3/h), and a combination of natural + mixing ventilation. The experiments were recorded with a camera and analysed to determine the horizontal distance of the path taken by the fog and to measure the time it remained visible after exhalation from the mouth. During the experiments, it could be observed with the naked eye that the glycol droplets travel much further and linger in the air for longer than what is captured in the recordings. Furthermore, not all the droplets were visible with the camera, especially the smaller ones of a few micrometres in diameter. The recordings showed that at the natural ventilation regime the droplets travelled the furthest distance (1.8 metres). This wind coming through the door pushed the drops further into the room. The combination of natural + mixing ventilation regime had the highest indoor air velocity, causing the droplets to reach the shortest distance (0.5 metres). In conclusion, the type of ventilation, classroom layout, and exhalation location play an important role in determining the airflow pattern, as they affect how long and how far the glycol droplets travel. Applying any type of ventilation is critical in transmission control and reduces the possibility of aerosol accumulation in the classroom as smaller droplets can linger in the air for many hours until they settle on a surface.","covid-19; Aerosol; respiratory droplets; visualisation; sars-cov-2; coughing; breathing; sneezing; Experimental design; lasers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","","52.00703303642124, 4.369603946094858"

(graduation committee); Luttikholt, Arjan (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The submerged floating tunnel (SFT) is a conceptual idea that originates from the 19th century. The idea consists of a tunnel tube floating underwater where it is kept at a fixed depth by its buoyancy and by tethers that are anchored to the seabed and or by floating pontoons at the water surface. The tunnel is placed deep enough to avoid extreme weather conditions and to not hinder marine traffic but also not too deep to avoid high hydrostatic water pressures. The dynamic behaviour of this structure differs largely from classic immersed tunnels as it is not embedded in the bed and also from that of (suspension) bridges due to the hydrodynamic environment. This makes the dynamic behaviour of the SFT largely complicated and to this day still raises a lot of questions. This limited understanding contributed to the fact that worldwide not a single SFT has been constructed yet.<br/>For this study, the dynamic response of a tether-supported SFT due to an earthquake will be analyzed. The main goal is to identify the main behaviour of an SFT due to these seismic events, to get an idea of how severe the damage could be and to know which measures in the design could be applied to reduce the impact.<br/>To do so, a case study is introduced where the main dimensions of the tunnel are described. Next, a cross-sectional analysis is performed. This is done both analytically and by the use of the finite element model (FEM). The purpose of these analyses is to verify the input of the FEM. For the analytical model, a singular tether is described as an Euler-Bernoulli beam. By applying the Fourier transform method of analysis, the dynamic behaviour of this tether due to a simplified input signal is obtained. Subsequently, the same tether is modeled as a FEM by the use of DIANA FEA. By performing a time-history analysis for the same simplified input signal, the same results as for the analytical analysis are obtained which verifies the input. After that, the simplified model is used to model the entire tunnel which is used to study the dynamic behaviour of the SFT.<br/>To perform the seismic analyses for the total tunnel, three different accelerograms of three different earthquakes are used. Before applying these signals to the model each of them is scaled to the spectra described by Eurocode to gain a more general input. The model is then used to perform two types of analysis. First, an eigenvalue analysis to gain the eigenperiods of the structure. Next, a time-history analysis to gain the seismic response of the structure. For the time-history analyses, the input is applied in the transverse and in the longitudinal direction, each as a separate analysis. From these analyses, the displacements and tension stresses in both the tunnel elements as in the tethers are obtained.<br/>The last part of the study is used to analyze the effect of different design aspects of the tunnel. By using the case study as a starting point, multiple configurations are tested in where the effect of the number of mooring lines, number of tethers, tunnel alignment, tether inclination and the appliance of base isolation systems are examined.<br","submerged floating tunnel; seismic analysis; Earthquake analsyis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Previous research has found that mineralization shows the ability to permanently store large amounts of CO2 while at the same time delivering a product of potential added value, however it still faces many technical and economic challenges. The present study explores the role that the technology could play in the transition towards a fossil-free society by investigating how a mineralization process can be developed that is cost-effective. <br/><br/>To this end, a novel conceptual process design was formulated, modeled and evaluated. The resulting design proposes an alternative process for the production of calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN), a fertilizer conventionally composed of ammonium nitrate and dolomite (a naturally occurring carbonate) as a stabilizing inert filler. The dolomite portion is replaced by hydromagnesite produced by mineralization of olivine ore. The ammonium nitrate portion is produced as a result of addition of nitric acid and ammonia as auxiliary chemicals during processing. The novel fertilizer product is thus of high Mg-content and is named Magnesium Ammonium Nitrate (MAN).<br/><br/>Using various modeling tools (OLI Stream Analyzer, AspenPlus, Python), the design was simulated and optimized such as to tackle the main technological barriers, i.e. the simultaneous enhancement of gas absorption and crystallization processes, the large energy penalty associated with the production of a concentrated ammonium nitrate melt through evaporation, and controlling the production ratio of hydromagnesite and ammonium nitrate such as to achieve the desired product composition. A techno-economic assessment revealed that the total production cost amounts to 345€/ton-product. In a CO2 balance analysis, it was found that the process emits 0.54ton-CO2/ton-product, which is just 2\% lower than the conventional process. In the form of case studies, different processing conditions were simulated and compared with the base case in terms of techno-economics as well as CO2 impact. The results show that the main factors that help improve the CO2 balance are producing magnesite instead of hydromagnesite, increasing the solid to liquid ratio during extraction and using steam produced as a result of heat integration with nitric acid production. <br/>The process could potentially reduce CO2 emissions attributed to the conventional process by up to 22%.<br/><br/><br/>It was concluded that mineralization could be a cost-effective option to reduce emissions in the fertilizer industry due to the economic benefits of saving ETS costs as well as by-product sales, however this reduction is limited by the carbonate content of the final product. Moreover, the technical feasibility has yet to be proven as the current process does not adhere to safety requirements imposed by the use of ammonium nitrate. The results of this work have shed light on the most important opportunities as well as hurdles in the development of mineralization processes and could act as a seed for future research.","Carbon utilization; mineralization; Process Design; Process modeling; Techno-economic analysis; CCUS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Our food production systems are responsible for 26% of the total human induced global greenhouse gas emissions, with the meat and dairy industry being responsible for over half of that. Our planet is in dire need for more sustainable food choices and cutting back on our meat consumption is a great start. However, it is proving to be a difficult transition for both the industry and its consumers. The assignment for this project was to develop a new vegetarian restaurant concept for Cirfood, a catering company of Italian origins. This was done on the basis of one of their already existing restaurants which is located in the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Technology in Delft. The focus of this project lies on the design of a new customer journey and a new customer experience, with a customer centric approach, in order to better cater to the needs and desires of the restaurants customers. During the research phase two key problems were found. The first finding was that generally people want to reduce their meat intake. However, they experience barriers towards achieving this. The most important barrier in this is the perceived lack of skills and knowledge on vegetarianism that are needed to make the switch towards a vegetarian diet. The second key problem had to do with the stance of the customers towards the current restaurant: it is one of apathy and indifference. Additionally, the main drivers for the interviewees to come to the restaurant were found to be ‘laziness’ and ‘convenience’. In short, the Ketelhuis customers don't see the added value of the restaurant. The new restaurant concept aims to inspire its customers in order to change its apathetic attitude into one of enthusiasm. Furthermore, the new restaurant concept aims to engage its customers in order to equip them with the knowledge and skills that are needed to adopt a vegetarian diet. To achieve this the new restaurant has been built up of two sections: a ‘Grab &amp; Go’ area for inspiration and a ‘Make &amp; Enjoy’ area for engagement. The new concept took the form of several deliverables: a visual representation of the restaurant with design elements that inspire, engage and educate its customers and a customer journey map that explains the intended new customer journey and customer experience from the customers point of view. This paper concludes with the following insights. With a global shift towards more plant based diets, the needs of Cirfood’s customers are changing. To accommodate for these changes Cirfood needs to create new value by taking on the vegetarian expert role, through which it can empower its customers. It needs to change its restaurants customer experience and customer journey. Not to one that is as smooth as possible, but to one that is challenging its customers to think critically about their food consumption.","Customer Experience; Customer Journey; Restaurant; Vegetarianism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The majority of our everyday life products hold their share in the pollution of the environment. By unearthing resources, processing, transporting, use and disposal. Here, industrial designers and innovators have long been a substantial contributor to the problems we face and many inadvertently still are. Now, production and consumption must change as quickly as possible to prevent the worst effects of the ecological crisis and to keep the earth habitable in the future. <br/>In this context, designers often try to improve the current situation by inventing and innovating greener solutions. However, sustainable design efforts are not enough, as long as we merely focus on innovations which keep exploiting resources, fill “sustainable” market niches, cause rebound effects and offset environmental gains. Given the urgency, we now need to focus more on mitigating the impact of existing unsustainable products. <br/>This goes under the umbrella of exnovation. In recent years, the term has gained traction and is increasingly perceived as an essential element of sustainability transitions. It targets the removal or reduction of existing technologies, products, structures etc.<br/><br/>This graduation project aimed at exploring exnovation efforts in context of design.<br/>The initial research phase focused on how designers can facilitate the exnovation of products in the most harmless way possible. Literature review showed that not only the environment itself should be taken into account, but designers must also persuade the users of products in order to achieve a lasting effect. Only when considering the consumer behavior and the product’s related practices, uses, and other interconnected aspects an exnovation can be successful. The research resulted in a compilation of several independent approaches, methods and leverage points for design action.<br/><br/>The second phase was an investigation of a real exnovation case. The removal of the charging adapter from the Apple iPhone box served as subject of an analysis. The study showed that users were not willing to give up the adapter for sustainability concerns for several reasons. Based on the findings and the previous research, several design interventions were developed that aimed at increasing the acceptance for exnovation. These interventions were tested with participants to inform the final design.<br/><br/>The final outcome is an online toolkit for designers. It walks the user through various factors to consider when exnovating a product. After the user answers a set of questions, the most suitable exnovation strategies are presented. These strategies emphasize design possibilities, considerations and give tips. In this way it does not only sensitize designers about the topic in general, but also inspire further steps for the particular product exnovation.","Sustainability; Exnovation; Customer Behaviour; Persuasive Design; Climate engagement; Climate Change; degrowth; Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The hydrological models in climate models (also know as Land Surface Models) aim to represent hydrological processes and interactions at a global scale. In this research, one Land Surface Model, HTESSEL is introduced. Previous studies have shown that HTESSEL is not reproducing hydrological fluxes well at a catchment scale. <br/>In this study, the problems in representing discharge in HTESSEL can be summarized in three aspects: mismatch in peaks, slower recession,and the monthly delay. Thus, the aim of this research is to investigate the reasons of the poor performance in HTESSEL, and provide possible suggestions for a better fit. Therefore, the hydrological models HBV and GR4J (that operate on catchment scales) are introduced to identify the problems in HTESSEL by model comparison.<br/>HTESSEL, HBV and GR4J models are used to simulate river discharge in 15 catchments are compared in terms of structure and parameterization. HTESSEL use tabulated parameter values, while HBV and GR4J are calibrated to match observations firstly. In order to investigate the influence of different model processes and parameters, a second calibration of the HBV and GR4J parameters is applied. Here, the model parameters are calibrated to the HTESSEL model output. Comparing the two calibration results, the parameter differences can be identified.<br/>The results show that the soil column in HTESSEL is a key factor that influences the surface and subsurface runoff. On the one hand, HBV and GR4J can reproduce the slower falling limb in humid region by increasing their slow reservoirs. On the other hand, the top 50 cm of soil column is the effective depth that influences maximum infiltration rate. Thus, the changing of effective depth and the parameterization of orography variable b, which influences the fast runoff in HTESSEL, are necessary in temperate and mediterranean catchments.<br/>According to this study, to solve the problem of mismatch in peaks this 50cm should be a spatial variable firstly. The increase of effective depth could overcome the overestimation in some places and the decrease of effective depth could overcome the underestimation of peaks in other places. In addition to effective depth, optimizing parameter b is also necessary, because it influences the fast runoff. Moreover, for the problem of slower recession and monthly delay, decreasing the size of soil column in HTESSEL is one way to get a better fit. Thus, in future, more study could focus on the interplay of the soil infiltration capacity and the fast runoff parameters.

Treatments exist, but early detection and treatment is crucial, due to the progressive nature of the disease. Algorithms can help with early detection. Machine learning algorithms are commonly trained to diagnose based on ECG data, but the interpretability is low. A physiological model that simulates the heart gives more insight into the situation of the patient. Current approaches, like the IPFM model, simulate only the SA node and generate RR intervals as output, while completely neglecting the interaction between the AV and SA node. By using an IPFM model and including the AV node as well, an extended and more accurate physiological model was built to more accurately detect Atrial Fibrillation. The AV node model is able to estimate PR intervals when the P waves are annotated. This result shows that the model extension is able to capture information about the signal conduction. When the SA node model and the AV node model are cascaded and only the R peaks are considered, the classification accuracy does not improve compared to the SA node model alone. The R peaks alone do not contain sufficient information for accurate parameter estimation. The parameters governing the behavior of the AV node seem different for NSR compared to AF, but more data is needed to confirm this. The ability of the model to predict PR intervals gives hope that the inclusion of P wave data should improve the performance of the classification with the extended physiological model.","Cardiac Diagnosis; Modelling; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Alderliesten, R.C. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The demand for sustainability in aviation is at a historical peak. Efforts from industry and institutions have made the conventional tube-and-wing aircraft greatly efficient, to the degree that a performance ceiling is being approached. Unconventional aircraft configurations promise to reduce fuel burn further, at the cost of design complexity and risk. One aircraft configuration which has the potential to allow for this increase in performance is the Flying-V concept. This research aims to contribute to a better understanding of the structural design methods of the Flying-V.<br/><br/>Several studies into the viability and performance of the Flying-V have been performed, showing promising results. However, these results mainly pertain to the aerodynamic and flight performance fields. Preliminary structural analyses have shown a significant reduction in structural mass. However, these structural analyses have not regarded the wing-fuselage enough as a novel structure, applying analyses which work well conventional wings or fuselages, but not on the oval fuselage structure. More specifically, the hoop stresses in the skins and frames were not assessed beyond the membrane response. Furthermore, a clear opportunity was identified in the inclusion of a fatigue analysis, beyond using the material fatigue limit. <br/><br/>The wing-fuselage structure was identified to be dominant in terms of weight. Furthermore, there is a knowledge gap in the understanding of the behaviour of the unconventional wing-fuselage structure. Therefore, the research goal was to determine an improved structural analysis and sizing methodology for the wing-fuselage. For the sizing procedure, failure modes in three categories were selected: static material failure, fatigue and stability. With the selected failure modes, the stresses were determined.<br/><br/>An extensive load case study was performed, resulting in a weight and load distribution over the aircraft for a large number of different load cases and different weights. Due to the favourable weight distribution and open cabin structure, the cross-section stresses were considered to be equally important as the longitudinal stresses in terms of failure. Megson's (2013) boom method was applied to determine the stresses in longitudinal direction, while an enriched 2-dimensional FEM model was used to determine the stresses in the cross-sectional plane. The first important insights were obtained in the stress analysis stage: the hoop stresses vary greatly over the constant arc sections, due to significant bending. The stress analysis was validated using a 3-dimensional ABAQUS model of a fuselage section.<br/><br/>With the obtained stress calculation approach, the failure modes were determined for each category. Static material failure was calculated in limit and ultimate load conditions for the yield and ultimate static material strength, respectively. The fatigue performance was assessed by calculating the crack initiation life and crack propagation life (including residual strength). A fatigue load spectrum was determined from the standardised load spectrum by Jonge et al. (1973). Finally, multiple stability-related failure phenomena were assessed. The well-known column and plate buckling phenomena were evaluated. Global buckling and panel buckling were assessed by using a smeared property plate buckling method. The buckling behaviour under combined loading was approximated with an interaction relation.<br/><br/>With the obtained failure index distributions, a sizing methodology was determined. The sizing methodology was based on the identification of the driving variable(s) for each failure mode using stress and failure distributions from a generic geometry. As the sizing and analysis loop proved to require a substantial runtime, the sizing procedure was reduced in scope. The critical load cases were selected, and an early material selection was performed, based on the failure index distributions of a solution using mean material properties. <br/>The wing-fuselage structure was sized for two selected concepts, leading to two similarly performing designs. The designs showed large frames and cross-beams compared to conventional fuselage frames. This was the case as high stiffness was necessary in the components, due to high bending and compressive loads, primarily induced by pressurisation. The frames show a large potential for reusing the same frame design along the constant cabin, potentially leading to significant economical gains. Secondly, the floor and ceiling needed a far higher amount of stringers than the pressure shells, as the high compressive loads lead to an instability-prone structure. A structural mass estimation was performed, for the two concepts. The mass of the original and NLES concept were obtained to be 65.4e3 kg and 67.2e3 kg, respectively. Additionally, a mesh convergence analysis and input sensitivity analysis was performed.","Flying-V; fuselage; pressurization; cabin; oval","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flying-V",""

Out of these interviews the underlying problem came to the surface: due to experience the senior members in the team know what they are doing but they miss the simple tools/documents to bring this across to juniors or people outside the team. This problem has been used as the basis for the design statement of this project, which is: design a tool for the X team that brings overview and gives the team the completeness to express their expertise. <br/><br/>Based on the earlier gathered insights the OD toolbox was designed. The toolbox consists of two tools: the OD expertise map and the approach generator. The toolbox was validated with seniors and juniors of the team and seen as valuable. It turned out that the purpose of the OD toolbox is to create a shared understanding among members of the team and in this way synchronization of the different mindsets between the seniors and juniors is facilitated. The tool works as a boundary object because it is used differently by seniors and juniors.

It is a commonly seen due to iatrogenic damage to the lymphatics after surgical and radiotherapeutic treatment of cancer. An important microsurgical treatment is lymphovenous bypass (LVB) surgery, during which a lymphatic vessel is anastomosed to a vein to bypass the site of lymphatic flow obstruction. Pre-operative imaging of the lymphatic vessels is a prerequisite for planning of LVB surgery. Imaging of these structures is challenging due to the small size of the lymphatic vessels and the lack of inherit contrast of the lymphatic fluid. In this thesis, we investigated the feasibility of lymphatic vessel imaging using light emitting diode (LED) based photoacoustic imaging (PAI) for LVB surgical planning. Chapter 1 gives an introduction to the physiology of lymphedema and (surgical) treatment options for lymphedema. Current challenges related to lymphatic vessel imaging and pre-operative planning are also discussed. The systematic review in Chapter 2 gives an overview of the existing imaging modalities used for pre-operative visualization of the lymphatic vessels. Findings of the systematic literature review emphasized the importance of adequate imaging for clinical decision making and showed the heterogeneity of the field. Indocyanine green (ICG) contrast mediated near-infrared fluorescence lymphography (NIRF-L) has become the most popular in recent years and is currently used at the Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam. NIRF-L facilitates lymphatic vessel depiction and lymphedema severity assessment based on the extent of DBF. However, NIRF-L has a low resolution and cannot visualize lymphatic vessels in the presence of DBF. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) using LED light pulses is a novel technique that has properties that may overcome some of the disadvantages of NIRF-L. Chapter 3 introduces the technical principles of PAI, and dual-wavelength PAI of ICG contrast and hemoglobin in blood is discussed. We performed phantom experiments to show the effect of several parameters on the image quality and demonstrate principle of dual-wavelength (820 &amp; 940 nm) PAI of ICG and blood. The experimental results showed that the ratio between the PA signal at 940 nm and 820 nm differentiates blood from ICG. The 940/820 nm ratio might therefore be useful for in-vivo imaging of the lymphatic vessels and veins. With regards to imaging parameters, there is a trade-off between the frame rate and the image quality depending on the application (static or dynamic processes), and absorber characteristics and depth. Finally, the light pulse width must be tuned based on imaging target characteristics, the desired resolution and signal strength, and the fractional bandwidth of the ultrasound probe. Chapter 4 describes preliminary results of a clinical feasibility study on handheld LED-based PAI of the lymphatic vessels in patients with secondary limb lymphedema. We investigated novel features such as the possibility of visualizing lymphatic vessel contractility and lymphatic vessel depiction behind DBF patterns. To date, three patients with breast-cancer related lymphedema were included in the study. We demonstrated that dual-wavelength, LED-based PAI can visualize lymphatic and blood vessels even in the presence of DBF. These findings suggest that PAI has potential for pre-operative lymphedema assessment, especially in cases with extensive DBF pattern hindering adequate assessment with NIRF-L. Chapter 5 provides an overall discussion and future challenges are discussed. In this thesis we demonstrated the potential for lymphatic vessel identification using PAI. However, LED-based PAI is still consistently being improved. Our findings need to be confirmed in larger groups of patients and additional clinical studies. Technological advances are needed to improve user experience, image quality and minimize image artefacts.","Lymphedema; Photoacoustic imaging; Microsurgery; Lymphatic vessel; Light emitting diodes; Lymphovenous bypass","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine","",""

(graduation committee); Wendt, E.A.F (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Since the behaviour of damage formation on steep slopes varies from mild slopes, a comprehensive definition of damage needs to be established for different situations. Knowledge about the transition of rock stability between steep and mild slopes is lacking. This study presents a reliable and efficient design method. The goal of this study is to describe the stability of rock slopes (1:6 - 1:10). Insight into governing processes and quantified damage characteristics are gained by analyzing wave attack in the transition zone of mild and steep slopes. The method is based on physical model test series with deep water wave conditions and perpendicular wave attack, which were performed to understand the stability of slope 1:6. The slopes were measured with stereophotogrammetry and processed in a 3D model with Agisoft Metashape software. Before wave attack, an initial profile is retrieved which can be compared with cumulative damaged profiles. Automatically detectable Ground Control Points are used as reference to assign scaling information and location recognition. The quantity and location of normative damage on mild slopes are identified for six damage parameters, based on different relations regarding erosion area and depth. The tests results have led to a number of key findings. Damage formations are developed by dominant downward (bar profile) or upward transport (berm profile). In general, a thicker layer and a milder slope give more upward transport. Besides the change in transportation direction, no significant differences in stability numbers were observed for various layer thicknesses with similar wave characteristics. For an increasing slope angle, the influence on stability significantly decreases between various wave steepnesses, due to the impact of a higher amount of more damaging plunging waves. The definition of initial, intermediate and failure damage limits are specified and the test profiles are matched per limit. Initial and intermediate damage are found at a constant value of _3_.3 for a varying layer thickness and slope angle based on the definition and matching profile analysis. Failure of the slope is defined by the event in which the impermeable layer or filter layer becomes visible, which occurs for a layer thickness of 2.53=50 at a damage level of _3_.3 = 1.5. Research at 1:6 slope shows that a higher failure limit is observed for layer thickness 53=50. Due to the lack of test results of other slopes (1:8 - 1:10), specific values cannot yet be indicated for the range 1:6 - 1:10. The lack of testing is also due to limits of the flume and wave machine. In order to remain at least 13=50 over the slope, an acceptable damage limit for a design with a layer thickness of 2.53=50 is found at _3_.3 = 0.9. For a layer thickness of 53=50, an acceptable value of _3_.3 = 1.5 holds a remaining layer of 2.53=50 due to the increase of bed mobility for higher damage numbers. The design formula of mild slopes is based on _3_.3 because this gives the lowest bias error, variability and measurement errors. The design formula for mild slopes is used to estimate stability, nominal rock diameter and acceptable damage for conditions within the applicability range of performed tests. This new method for mild slope design indicates that a higher allowable stability can be used compared to the previously used (extrapolated) method of Van der Meer (1988). A displacement is not necessarily linked to erosion due to alternating upward and downward transport on mild slopes. It can be discussed to what extent a rock, after displacement, contributes to the stability of the design. This can be investigated by the ratio of mobility and erosion over the entire slope. This study has shown that the damage parameters, based on displacements, are larger than the width-averaged erosion parameters. This appears to be a useful ratio for distinguishing mild slopes from steep slopes. In the latter these parameters are considered equal. Requirements for mild slope stability can also be imposed on the basis of the ratio between mobility and erosion as described in this research.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-02","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Filamentous fungi grow large networks of biomass with minimal energy input. This biomass consists of polysaccharide-based filamentous networks and adherent extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Recent reports show that this biomass can be formed into plastic-like thin film materials. Further, non-filamentous fungi have been applied as living coatings on wood. Even so, filamentous fungi remain unexplored for coating applications. This work fills that gap by studying how a selected filamentous fungus (Schizophyllum commune) and its lab-produced biomass interact with aerospace aluminum alloys, and to explore their potential as a sustainable resource to create coatings. Two complementary routes were explored in this work. In the first one, S. commune was allowed to grow—under controlled conditions—on the surface of bare aluminum alloys of different compositions and surface treatments. The growth extent, filament density, and structure were investigated as a function of the underlying metal composition, surface treatment, and nutrient availability. In the second route, thin-film coatings were produced from processed biomass extracted from liquid cultures of S. commune. The quality of the consolidated films and their scratch resistance and adhesion as a function of a range of processing parameters and aluminum surface treatments was investigated. S. commune grew further and more densely on AA6082 than on AA2024 and AA7075. Differences decreased after grinding, which suggests that the alloy-dependent near-surface deformed layer and alloy composition heavily influence fungal growth. The in-situ-grown fungi led to intense local surface corrosion and weakly adhered biomass. Alternatively, films produced from processed liquid culture biomass led to semi-transparent coatings with microstructure dependent on the processing conditions and fungal extract used. Although processing steps led to improvements in scratch resistance and porosity, coating macroporosity remained high and insufficient for barrier requirements. Surface treatments led to clear improvements, but even then, film adhesion remained well below that of more broadly studied and developed biopolymer coatings (&gt;10x better adhesion). This research showed the potential of fungi to create films on aluminum alloys with ample room for improvement toward fungi-based coatings. Future research should focus on more extensive species screening, adhesion optimization, decreasing porosity, and better understanding fungi-metal local interactions.","fungi; coatings; mycelium; aerospace; bio-coating; biodegradable; Living Materials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

A novel approach that is currently under development is to treat the waste collected in an engineered landfill in order to reduce the emission potential to an environmentally acceptable level. The main topic for this research is to improve the understanding of how leachate is distributed throughout the landfill Kragge and how this distribution varies in time. This is important for identifying the long-term behavior of the landfill and for managing landfill waste.<br/><br/>At the start of this project, we have a number of water level measurements obtained from various wells in the landfill. Straightforward spatial interpolation of this data leads to unexpected results. Most likely this is caused by the highly complex heterogeneity in this porous system. For this reason, this research aims to apply Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) technology to explain the water distribution variations between wells. The apparent resistivity along several lines are measured over depth using different arrays. Some scripts written in Python with 'pyBERT' and 'pyGIMLi' packages are used to get electrical resistivity inversion results from the apparent resistivity. It is known that the decrease in the water content leads to a significant increase in the resistivity. Therefore, the possible existence of saturated and unsaturated blocks in the waste body can be visualized from the inversion maps.<br/><br/>Initially, the interface between the saturated and unsaturated zones is expected to be identified from Laplacian edge detection, while the results indicate that this technique fails to represent the area boundaries under highly-heterogeneous situations. Subsequently, Archie's law and van Genuchten equation are coupled to give a relation between the resistivity and water pressure head. Archie's law is used to compute the resistivity from water content and van Genuchten equation is used to compute the water content from the water pressure head. There are two hypotheses during this analysis: (a) where the resistivity is 20(ohm-m) gives the interface of dry and wet zones; and (b) the landfill leachate is under hydrostatic condition. Then the water pressure head is the distance from the interface, which can be read from the inversion maps. By selecting a certain range of empirical parameters, the computed resistivity-pressure head curves provide relatively good fits to the measured results.","Landfill; Electrical resistivity tomography; Water distribution variations; water pressure head; Water retention curve","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","CURE",""

Therefore, in this thesis a safety risk assessment is performed for the system of Kitepower. The research question of this thesis is: Which third-party risks are posed by Kitepower operations and how high are these? Kitepower uses a kite attached to a fixed ground station via a tether to harvest energy. This tether is reeled out by performing crosswind manoeuvres with the kite. The tether is retracted in a situation where the kite is in a gliding configuration with different aerodynamic settings. Therefore, there is a net energy gain between these two modes.<br/><br/>Firstly, a pure hazard brainstorm is performed to identify the hazards of the Kitepower operations. With these hazards four safety-relevant scenarios are constructed. The identified safety-relevant scenarios are: the kite, KCU, and tether fly away; the kite and KCU fly away; the kite flies away; and the complete system slides over the ground. Only the first scenario is modelled in this thesis because the first scenario is the most likely scenario.<br/><br/>The first scenario is modelled by using a model framework that is developed to estimate the third- party risk posed by a drone-based parcel delivery service. This model is adapted to the situation in which the kite, KCU, and tether fly away. A flight path model is used from a preceding MSc thesis. The non-nominal descend model is developed by simulating the forces on the kite. These models have been integrated in a Monte Carlo simulation that simulates the tether failure and subsequent landing of the kite multiple times at the proposed test location in Rutten, the Netherlands.<br/><br/>In the results it is found that the individual risk is the most critical in terms of regulation limits. The operational zone should be enlarged to a radius of 500m in the dominant wind direction at location Rutten to comply with the individual risk limits. The system operations comply with the regulations in terms of collective ground risk. However, it is also observed that the population density and wind conditions have a large impact on the individual risk and collective ground risk. Therefore, these parameters should be adapted if the risk is assessed for new locations. Furthermore, the tether failure rate should be based on operational data and not on the Kitepower expert his assumptions. Lastly, the scenarios that are not analysed yet should be analysed in further research.","Quantitative Risk Assessment; Kitepower","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-15","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Air Transport and Operations","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The current commercialisation of spaceflight significantly boosts the amount of objects in space, resulting in an increasing risk of involuntary collisions between space debris and operational spacecraft. Collisions are catastrophic for the orbital environment, as they create thousands of pieces of debris flying around that will put other satellites in danger for decades. To sustain a healthy space environment, feasible and cost-effective Active Debris Removal (ADR) and On Orbit Servicing (OOS) solutions are required that can be implemented on a wide scale. Ideal ADR and OOS solutions require no prior information on the target. This research aims to support development in that field by investigating the use of monocular-based Simultaneous Localisation AndMapping (SLAM) for pose estimation around unknown targets. The research in this work is guided by a designed technical research framework that aims to assess the robustness of monocular SLAM under realistic orbital scenarios. The pose estimator requires robustness to images with high contrast and noise, but also to adverse and changing illumination conditions. Furthermore, it requires the capability to function in dynamic environments, where objects in the background are not fixed in the target body frame. This work also analyses the hardware requirements to obtain stable performance of the pose estimator. Apart from those challenges related to space imagery, it needs to be able to obtain pose estimates at accuracies specified by the mission type. Due to the complexity and novelty of the field, spacecraft pose estimation of unknown uncooperative targets is still in early phases, as the state-of-the-art algorithms have been tested on simulations and not yet been demonstrated in real-life. In this work, The algorithm of Campos Martínez et al.[12] is adapted for spacecraft relative navigation. Background robustness is achieved by implementing a distance threshold for feature storing. Features that are located further from the camera than a predefined threshold are discarded, thereby separating fore- and background features. Additionally, pose initialisation is optimised by enhancing the robustness under low-parallax conditions, while maintaining real-time performance. Finally, the feature descriptor distance threshold is tuned to improve the accuracy of the algorithm for spacecraft relative navigation purposes. The designed pose estimator is tested on synthetically and lab-generated datasets, both capturing the Delfi-n3Xt satellite. The designed datasets allow for analysis of relative motion effects, environmental effects, like brightness changes and background objects, and for the analysis of hardware requirements. The suitability of the pose estimator for spacecraft relative navigation is assessed on three factors. Firstly, achievement of robustness to orbital relative navigation conditions is required. This includes relative motion, background, space image quality, and illumination robustness. The robustness to these factors is demonstrated in this report. The second factor is based on the capability of this system to work in real-time on space hardware. In this work, it is found that a lower-limit of 800x600 pixels on image resolution guarantees stable performance of the pose estimator. Furthermore, the frame rate should be high enough such that the target’s orientation propagation between frames does not exceed 1 deg/frame. When observing hardware used on Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) systems, it is noticed that the RNS camera in [49] could capture resolutions of 1024x1024px at a frame rate of 3 Hz. Based on the fact that the design of that system was developed more than ten years ago, and the fact that technology advances significantly over the years, it is deemed feasible that the algorithm could be implemented on space hardware. The third and last point is related to the achievable accuracy. On average, this system achieved an accuracy of sub-degree level in orientation, and centimetre-level in relative position. For particular mission phases of Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO), strict accuracy requirements need to be met. For reference, the relative navigation requirements for the e.Deorbit mission [59] and the Servicing Mission 4 of the Hubble telescope [49] are observed. Since the required accuracies of both the e.Deorbit mission and Servicing Mission 4 have been achieved in this work, the designed pose estimation system is deemed suitable for spacecraft relative navigation. The novelties of this work related to robustness analysis of the implemented pose estimator to spacecraft relative motion, the capability of handling background objects in the frame, and the analysis of hardware requirements, provide a relevant contribution to the work already performed in this field.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(TU Delft Industrial Design Engineering)","Mooij, S.C. (mentor); Colenberg, S.E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The report describes the design process that led to an implementation strategy for a design intervention that fosters a sense of belonging and cohesion in working environments, by increasing opportunities of spontaneous face-to-face informal encounters. The research follows two different approaches: the classical double diamond process from the Design Council (Ball B. J., 2019) and the Empirical Research through Design (ERDM) in which a design hypothesis (expectation about the effect of the design on behaviour and well-being) is formulated and then tested (Keyson, D. V., &amp; Bruns, M.,2009). Since it was difficult to find an office physically open during COVID-19, the design process was developed at the IDE faculty involving IDE employees’, Team managers, experts in Social Sciences and Technology, the Human Resources and Facility Management department.The Discover phase of the project consisted of in-depth literature review and semi-structured interviews to explore the concept of social well-being in the workplace, and learn about the personal experiences and opinions of workers. The Define phase was devoted to scoping the problem, and the formulation of a design vision and hypothesis. The Develop phase aimed to explore several directions for the final design intervention, and consisted of three generative phases with different stakeholders involved through evaluation, co-creative and iteration sessions. The fourth Deliver phase, was aimed at defining the final design intervention in terms of feasibility, desirability and viability. This phase involved testing the prototype in the coffee corners of the IDE faculty (through observations and short interviews), and formulating an implementation strategy that emphasises the importance, methods and stakeholders’ benefits of adopting the final design solution.During the pandemic, the sense of cohesion and belonging between colleagues is significantly reduced due to the decrease of spontaneous face-to-face informal social interactions. As the hybrid working mode is expected to be the future of the way of working (de Klerk J. J., 2021), it is important that organisations emphasise the social aspect of the office by increasing the possibilities for social interactions between colleagues (Dahik, A., 2021). A sense of belonging and cohesion in the office benefits not only the well-being of employees, but also the performance of the organisation (Rosales, R. M., 2016). The final design is a demonstration that it is possible to increase the sense of cohesion and belonging among workers, by means of an interactive object that increases the chances of informal serendipitous encounters. For implementation, organisations need to maintain long-term contact with supplier partners (e.g. furniture companies) to produce, assemble and develop new design features. These change according to the evolution of the pandemic, and the insights generated by ongoing user testing. The organisation is responsible for monitoring and directing the social behaviour of the office (Team Managers and HR Department), and for the installation and maintenance of the object within the office café corners (Facility Management Department). The continuous sharing of research insights between companies and supplier partners contributes to the development of knowledge for a healthier and socially connected workplace in the post-pandemic era.","Social well-being at work; Post-pandemic; Sense of belonging and cohesion; Social collisions; Informal social interactions; Face-to-face social interactions; Design Intervention; Implementation strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

These critical connections can be of different dimensions and exposed to monotonic and cyclic loading. Despite being small components of a structure, bolts need to be maintained appropriately to ensure structural safety and reliability. The integrity of bolted joints can be assured by checking for adequate preload. In addition, fatigue failure resulting from preload loss is of primary concern, as it can occur suddenly without any visible changes. Hence, bolts should be re-tightened periodically to ensure sufficient preload. However, in offshore conditions, this countermeasure leads to high maintenance costs while exposing the crew to unfavourable conditions and risks. <br/><br/> This research focuses on the feasibility of condition-based maintenance of bolts using ultrasonic waves. An energy attenuation method has been implemented for this feasibility research. The main objective is to establish a proper methodology and hypotheses for preload detection. Furthermore, along with preload detection, the feasibility of crack detection was investigated. Finally, the proposed methodology and hypotheses were validated by performing experiments and numerical simulations. <br/><br/> The experimental and numerical results verify the proposed methodology by showing an increasing trend in the energy and the power of the transmitted ultrasonic wave for increasing preload. Also, the feasibility of crack detection using the same setup has been positively evaluated. <br/> <br/> The obtained results suggest that the ultrasonic waves can be employed to monitor bolts for condition-based maintenance.

As a result, Accenture Interactive now consists of several pillars that together can deliver a meaningful end-to-end experience. Delivering value to the client and the organization in projects by collaborating across pillars are called cross-pillar projects.<br/><br/>However, Accenture Interactive encounters that the current collaboration between the different pillars in client projects is not at the level they would like it to be. In line with this observation, the purpose of this thesis was to explore what goes wrong in the current cross-pillar projects, with the aim to reveal the influencing factors of these projects. <br/><br/>Therefore, this thesis aimed to improve the cross- pillar performance by defining the definition of cross- pillar working in the context of Accenture Interactive, and resolving the barriers towards the envisioned level of cross-pillar working. As a result, an integrated solution was created, consisting of improvements in existing communication channels and adding a proposition development approach to the existing initiation process.<br/><br/>This was examined by conducting twelve in-depth interviews with different pillars, from six completed cross-pillar projects. The interviews defined the context of cross-pillar work in Accenture Interactive and the elements that make up all the studied cross-pillar projects. Then, a deeper look was taken at differences emerged between the performance of the studied projects. This led to the problem statement that the performance of a cross-pillar project is influenced by the presence of awareness and willingness in the initiation of the projects.<br/><br/>A deeper study was conducted to determine which barriers are present during initiation preventing awareness and willingness. The design goal, was to develop means and approaches that could help employees to facilitate cross-pillar collaboration during the initiation of new projects. To facilitate implementation, it is proposed that existing activities, like Chapter Zero and Friday morning meetings, could help serve that purpose. The end goal of this approach is to learn to initiate cross-pillar projects by experiencing how to bring value to clients by collaborating between pillars. <br/><br/>Furthermore, a roadmap is created to guide Accenture Interactive in bridging the gap between the results of this project and the new practice of cross-pillar working. This roadmap aligns the different development processes within Accenture Interactive, reflects how this thesis’s outcomes fit within the intended timeline, and provides direction to Accenture Interactive’s vision.","Collaboration; Initiation Phase; organizational changes; Co-evolution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Within the domains of traffic assignment, there is a greater focus on the dynamic representation of traffic, which has proved to be more accurate when compared to their static counterparts. This has put Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) Models at the forefront of development. Departing from the classical traffic flow theories Macroscopic DTA’s simulates aggregated traffic analogous to the flow of fluids or gases. This aggregation enables high-speed computation with the ability to achieve a stable equilibrium state within feasible model run times. Due to the large number of Macroscopic DTA models developed worldwide, the model user is posed with the problem of using the correct model for the correct application. The current research aims to provide an answer to this problem through the design, development, and validation of an evaluation framework for Macroscopic DTA’s. The objective evaluation of the DTA’s is performed through certain Measures of Performances (MoPs). The subjective side of evaluation showcases the differences in importance associated with model features which vary from model users to application domains. Three macroscopic DTA models popular in the Netherlands are used for the application of the framework: the MARPLE (Model for Assignment and Regional Policy Evaluation), StreamLine: MaDAM (Macroscopic Dynamic Assignment Model), and StreamLine: eGLTM (event-based Generalized Link Transmission Model). From the results, it is observed that For a Strategic Planning application, both MARPLE and StreamLine: eGLTM proved to be better alternatives, as they performed exceedingly better in achieving a stable state of convergence. However, as the time horizons of application became smaller as is the case with Tactical and Operational planning, the final score for StreamLine: MaDAM improved substantially due to its accuracy involved in link-level propagation and queuing. The evaluation scores also showcase the fundamental trade-off between model complexity and computational speed was visible from the results. We can observe variations across model users, which validates our original hypothesis that the right choice of a model primary depends on the person using it and the application it is deployed for.","dynamic traffic assignment; macroscopic modelling; Evaluation Framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

Accordingly, farmers sign agricultural contracts with the company, that in exchange for the security to buy the product ask for sustainable practices' application. <br/><br/>The Barilla Sustainable Farming project spread throughout the Italian farmers successfully; then, the company decided to expand these sustainable projects abroad.

From a ship design perspective, the switch to an alternative fuel is often a downgrade with respect to the use of conventional fuels. For instance, most alternative fuels have a low energy density, rely on technology that is not fully developed or on systems with a short lifetime. The choice for an alternative fuel is therefore difficult to make, and many aspects from different disciplines must be considered. Though much research is being done on the implications of choosing different alternative fuels, iron powder as a marine fuel is not often considered. The use of iron powder as a fuel formaritime applications is only recently proposed and the technology is in its infancy. It has some suitable properties to be used as a marine fuel though. This research aims to investigate how the choice of iron as a fuel affects the ships design and performance.<br/><br/>To that end, a parametric design model is developed for container ships, with which the design space of these iron fuelled ships can quickly be explored. It was chosen to design the model specifically for container ships, because iron has good volumetric energy density, but poor gravimetric energy density. Because of that, iron suits volume carriers more than deadweight carriers. The model generates a multitude of preliminary ship designs as a function of some operational requirements. Using the results from the model, design trends can be identified withing the design space. The potential performance of the ship designs are assessed using some key performance indicators.<br/><br/>It is found that iron fuelled ships are feasible and can be economically viable for certain operational profiles.Based on contemporary freight rates, iron fuelled ships are best used for short voyages at low speed. This is mostly caused by the high mass of iron, which reduces the viability of operating the ship when a large<br/>energy storage capacity is required. The main dimensions of iron fuelled container ships are driven by the total weight of the ship whilst minimising resistance. That makes iron fuelled container ships deadweight<br/>carriers rather than volume carriers. Finally, the economic performance of iron fuelled ships is compared to that of other alternative fuels. It was found that iron fuelled ships are less profitable than ships running on other alternatives.","lternative fuel; Viability; Iron powder; ship design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Coral reefs are home to 25% of marine life and have therefore gained the nickname ’rainforest of the sea’. However, the reefs are being damaged by climate change and human intervention, resulting in an alarming rate of degradation. The combination of higher water levels on reef flats and the reduced friction due to reef degradation lead to greater risks of flooding and overwash on low-lying islands.<br/><br/>These aforementioned effects already present a threat to small islands that are naturally fronted by coral reefs. However, there is one more threat of damage to these islands: resonance. The characteristic bathymetry of the coral reefs can induce this type of threat, which is likely to be enhanced through climate change. Fringing reefs can display harbour-like resonance under the right conditions, because of their generally steep fore reefs and shallow horizontal reef flats. This has been shown to occur during various occasions, but the conditions that lead to are still unclear. What drives the occurrence and magnitude of resonance?<br/><br/>Resonance has been observed during high-energy events on various pacific islands, and though it occurs only 3.6% of the time, its damaging potential is larger than any other form of infragravity (IG) wave propagation. Various numerical models have been set up to study the behaviour and drivers of resonance, yet the defining characteristics and drivers of the phenomenon remain enigmatic.<br/><br/>To get a better understanding of the parameters that influence the occurrence and magnitude of resonance in fringing reef environments, a SWASH model is used. The amplification of the incoming IG wave is determined<br/>by comparing the incoming IG wave energy at the beach toe for a beach boundary to an absorbing sponge layer boundary. If the ratio of incoming IG energy is greater than unity, resonance is expected to occur.<br/><br/>The magnitude of the AR is largely dependent on the characteristics of the incoming SS wave field and coral reef bathymetry: a great modulation and a gentle fore reef slope lead to a large amplification. Additionally, a lot of incoming SS wave energy corresponds to a limited amplification of the incoming IG wave, likely due to the interaction of the released bound long wave and the IG wave generated through break point forcing, which are 180° out of phase. Therefore, the largest amplification occurs for a strongly modulated wave field without being too energetic. There is no clear relationship between the incoming SS wave periods and the amplification, the height of the incoming IG wave is similar for various situations. The amplification appears to depend on the combination of the fore reef slope and incoming SS wave periods. Different SS wave periods<br/>lead to different amplifications depending on the slope of the fore reef they pass over. The height of the incoming IG wave is largest for the steepest slopes under consideration. Thus, for these conditions, the risk of flooding is largest. However, the greatest amplification occurs for the gentler slopes<br/>under the considered conditions. It should be noted that this relationship is heavily dependent on the combination of incoming SS periods and the steepness of the fore reef slopes.<br/><br/>The period for which resonance occurs is always higher than the theoretical fundamental eigenperiod, which is found through water depth integration from the location of minimum IG wave height to the beach toe. Integrating the water depth from the most offshore point of break point forcing leads to a smaller deviation of the theoretical fundamental eigenperiod from the observed period, yet this method needs further exploration. <br/><br/>The insights acquired by this research can be used as a base for site-specific modelling, which can provide circumstances under which certain areas are at risk of flooding due to IG wave resonance.","coral reefs; resonance; infragravity waves; climate change; ocean waves; SWASH; modelling; fringing reef","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

The implementation of these projects is crucial for the future energy policy of the country, but has been hindered by low rates of implementation since the first commercially viable options, falling short on national targets consistently since the early 2000s.<br/>Due to the impending urgency of more wind energy capacity in the Dutch grid, and the need for an orderly execution, researchers and policymakers have been looking into possible design techniques for the creation of peaceful pathways towards a common goal. Value Sensitive Design, a theory initially applied within the ICT sector in America, has been found to be possibly applicable to the issue of public acceptance of wind energy projects.<br/><br/>The research starts by contextualising the development of wind energy in the Netherlands, from its first prototypes to the current days, focusing on the influence of the network of actors. It progresses with a review of the studies on public acceptance of wind energy, defining the notion as outcome of a collective process of adoption of the technology from a defined group of stakeholders. The design tool of the Socio-Technical Value Map (STVM) is presented as part of the framework of Value Sensitive Design, and applied to the research problem. The process includes three investigations: a technology mapping, where procedural and technological designs are reviewed in their current status and alternatives, a stakeholder mapping, where the networks of influence present in the sector are analysed, and a value mapping exercise, where the underlying values of the sociotechnical system are visualised through Value Hierarchies. The five identified values that have interplay with public acceptance are Trust, Fairness, Sustainability, Profitability and Well-being. The five values translate into norms and design requirements to be implemented in design initiatives (e.g. implementation of accountability frameworks relates to Fairness, thresholds for shadow-flickering to Well-being, etc.) The design requirements can be synthesised in three approaches to be implemented in process design for new wind onshore energy projects: Proactive Community Management, Public Tendering, and Co-Design and Co-Ownership. These possible solutions are drafted with a value-perspective and address the issue of public acceptance of wind energy projects from a multi-stakeholder perspective. While far from perfect, these approaches are subject to the principles of VSD and aim to improve the dialogue between different groups of stakeholders, as key step towards a comprehensive approach to value-based design of wind energy projects in<br/>the country.","valuesentitivedesign; Windenergy; VSD; Values; Ethics in design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Although high PV induced low-voltage grid overvoltage mitigation has been studied extensively, this research adds onto existing literature in three ways. It is the first generic approach to develop neighbourhood overvoltage mitigation strategies. Moreover, it considers spatial and socio-economic aspects. Lastly, it regards system integration and wider energy transition ambitions.<br/>The 6 steps of the transition-enhancing overvoltage mitigation framework (TENOMF) are described. Subsequently, the TENOMF is demonstrated on a case study in the Diamantbuurt in Amsterdam.<br/>The results of the case study show that conventional mitigation strategies are very effective in overvoltage mitigation, however, they lack in wider energy transition ambitions. In consideration of local energy transition plans, hydrogen conversion shows to be very effective financially and energetically. In combination with high electrification, home batteries prove to be effective in system integration. The final decision-making should be done with the involvement of local stakeholders. For the social acceptance of a strategy, co-ownership, local benefits and involvement in the planning process are of great importance.<br/>With the TENOMF, strategies mitigating PV induced overvoltage in the LV grid can be chosen that fit the local context of a neighbourhood. By using system integration, the TENOMF matches overvoltage mitigation strategies with energy transition ambitions. Therefore, using the TENOMF, overvoltage mitigation can be seen as an opportunity as it helps catalysing the energy transition as a whole.<br/>Largest limitations were caused by the used PtX model for the energetic assessment. It is recommended to improve PtX’s overvoltage modelling by using a higher time-granularity and by considering fundamental electrotechnical principles.","Energy Transition; Urban Energy Transition; Overvoltage protection; Overvoltage mitigation; Low voltage grid; Energy Storage; System integration; TENOMF; Energy system design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","","51.223079, 4.412812"

(mentor); van Gelder, P.H.A.J.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Offshore floating photovoltaic (OFPV) gain increasing attention in research and from project developers, due to the need for more renewable energy production. OFPV must be proven to be both technically and economically feasible to be a viable option in the offshore environment. Several incidents of floating PV systems have been observed for mainly inland applications of floating PV. These incidents, which occurred due to malfunction of the system, may induce several risks. Hence, the risks associated with OFPV technology should be assessed, as these risks may affect the feasibility and overall support of the developments. However, the current early stage of industrial development present a gap in the standards and guidelines, as well as the availability of data on all levels, to perform a risk assessment. The aim of this research is to outline the process of assessing technological risks resulting from loss of function (failure) of operating offshore floating photovoltaic systems. The general steps of risk assessment procedure are performed on an OFPV system in this thesis. In the initial step, a generalized OFPV system was modeled and analyzed, which includes the functional decomposition of the system to element-level and a quasi-static load analysis. Then, a preliminary hazard analysis (PHA) is performed to identify a broad scale of hazards and failure mechanisms of the OFPV system in its environment, followed by a qualitative failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA), to relate the identified hazards to the components of the OFPV system. Based on the FMEA and observed incidents, it was found that failures of the mooring lines are a major threat to floating PV systems. To determine the quantitative likelihood (probability) of OFPV system failure in relation to its components, a reliability analysis was performed with a fault tree analysis (FTA). The fault tree analysis includes sensitivity analysis with Birnbaum and Fussell-Vesely importance measures, to allocate the most important elements that contribute to failure of the system. Due to lack of probabilistic data for OFPV, element failure rates were estimated based on substitute data sources, which made the results are prone to data uncertainty. Therefore, structural reliability analysis is included, since this systematically includes uncertainties and correlations, by providing a probabilistic method to determine the failure probability of an element of the FTA. As mooring failures were identified as a major threat to OFPV, this element was analyzed in more detail. Initially, a limit state function was defined to describe the condition under which a mooring chain failure occurs, in terms of random load and resistance variables. The first order reliability method (FORM), including the Rackwitz-Fiessler transformation and the Rosenblatt transformation, was used to iteratively determine the probability of failure of the failure event. Metrics to assess the contribution of the random variables to the probability of failure are included with sensitivity factors. To determine the consequences of mooring failure, hypothetical accident scenarios were modeled with an event tree analysis (ETA). Finally, the results obtained from the previous steps of the risk assessment process are summarized and evaluated. The risk matrix and ALARP principle were introduced, to evaluate the acceptability of the risks. In addition, the contributors to uncertainty of the results are qualitatively assessed per step. This research presented the tasks and potential difficulties that an analyst may encounter when performing a risk assessment for an OFPV system. Guidelines and standards for risk assessment of OFPV are desirable to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of several concepts, towards further industrial development of the technology. Moreover, this research did not intend to obtain actual quantitative results for a specific OFPV design or concept, mainly due to the lack of descriptive and probabilistic data. With further development of OFPV technology, and as more data becomes available, this research can serve as a foundation for future risk assessments of offshore floating photovoltaic systems.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Nonetheless, the state-of-the-art SARs face challenges that prevent them from or limit them in assisting humans in the real world. Although current SARs display cues that simulate social behaviours, the interactions that they generate are often not realistic and fail to engage their users for long periods of time. Most of the challenges currently faced by SARs are a consequence of the lack of social awareness and understanding of the cognitive procedures of individual users. In human interactions, people develop cognitive models of each other to achieve social goals and to respond to the needs of their peers according to their emotional states. Therefore, the present research project proposes to develop a mathematical model of human cognition, based on Theory of Mind (ToM), and to implement it for SARs. To do so, the cognitive processes behind human behaviour in social interactions are carefully investigated and formalised, and a model of human cognition is presented. Two formulations of the model are proposed and compared. The model is implemented using Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM), and is then qualitatively analysed and quantitatively assessed. It is concluded that, to accurately estimate the cognitive states of humans, the model must comprise user-specific variables that describe agents throughout interactions, the linkages of the FCM must be represented as functions, and the model must be personalised to every user.","Theory of Mind (ToM); Socially Assistive Robots; Cognitive Model; Long-term interactions; User modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Having all mechanical parts above water not only makes them easier to inspect and maintain, but it also makes them less prone to fouling or obstruction by debris. In this way, the risk of premature gate failure due to failure of wheels/rails is expected to be lower, increasing the overall availability during the lifetime of the lock.<br/>Six variants are designed and evaluated using a qualitative Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) and the Cantilever rolling gate is evaluated most feasible. The Cantilever rolling gate concept is a system in which all the rolling supports are located on an extension to the side of the gate. The gate is balanced by a counterweight and in a way 'hangs' in the gate chamber. The carriages are connected to the gate by hinges, which ensure the perpendicular horizontal movement of the gate in closed position to seal the lock against rubber profiles on the sill, gate chamber and recess. <br/><br/>Subsequently the Cantilever rolling gate is further elaborated at the case study location by means of structural calculations. The focus of the design calculations is on the load balance of the gate and supports in the longitudinal direction. To minimise the required extension of the gate chamber, the added cantilever length is kept as short as possible. To find the most optimal cantilever length, limits are defined regarding the minimum required force acting downwards on the carriages to maintain equilibrium and the maximum design capacities of the wheels and rails with respect to strength and fatigue.<br/>Based on the performed calculations, the most optimal Cantilever rolling gate design for the Western lock in Terneuzen has the following properties; an added cantilever part with a length of 16.6 meters; a cantilever truss structure constructed of Circular Hollow Sections (69 t); a counterweight directly below the back carriage (1083 t); an 8-wheel front carriage and a 4-wheel back carriage.<br/>The added cantilever structure of 16.6 m extends the gate part of 44.6 m by 37%. The designed cantilever rolling gate fits at the location of the case study, but the lock chamber and rails should be lengthened by 16.6 m to fit the extended gate.<br/>Based on this research it is expected that the concept of a Cantilever rolling gate is technically possible. However, it is not yet certain whether the Cantilever rolling gate will also be feasible in practice. Some additional development is still required before the design can be considered fully technically feasible. For example, it is important that the horizontal force transmission and guidance is further evaluated. It is also recommended to calculate the actual availability and determine whether the difference in availability between the Cantilever rolling gate and the conventional rolling gate outweighs the cost.<br","Navigation locks; Rolling gate; conceptual design; Gate design; Locks; Cantilever; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","51.328330, 3.817108"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Background:<br/>The leading cause of the death of children under the age of 5 are complications associated with premature birth. A widely used ventilation modality is bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP),which is used predominantly for neonates and infants with respiratory distress. bCPAP makes use of a flow of air and oxygen from an oxygen concentrator which is administered to the patient via an interface. The expiratory tube is placed into a water bottle which acts as a pressure valve and regulates the pressure inside the system.<br/>Aim: The aim of this research is to identify and investigate the variables that influence the performance of the bCPAP system.<br/>Methods:<br/>The equipment that is used and investigated are different types of interfaces and tubings as well as different sizes of interfaces. The relation between flow and pressure setting on the oxygen concentrator and pressure output at the interface is essential to this system. Other variables that are investigated include leak, airway resistance, lung compliance and respiratory rate. Four different evaluation methods are used; Solidworks flow simulation, standalone testing, lung simulator testing and Simulink simulation. <br/>The Solidworks flow simulation investigates the flow patterns through the interfaces and tubing. The standalone testing determines the pressure output at the interface without a simulated patient attached. A lung simulator is used to determine the effects of a respiratory cycle on the bCPAP system. The Simulink simulation investigates the various physiological aspects of airway resistance and lung compliance as well as the simulation of leak.<br/>Results: The variable with the largest impact on the performance of the bCPAP system is the type of interface that is used. The Hudson prongs show a large increase in Work of Breathing (WOB) compared to the RAM cannula. The bCPAP system is mostly flow independent during continuous bubbling although Hudson prongs are more flow dependent compared to the RAM cannula. The air flow through the RAM cannula is slightly different for inspiration and expiration due to the connectors used, at the connectors the largest pressure drop occurs.<br/>The respiratory characteristics of potential patients are crucial to ensure an effective use of the bCPAP system. When leak is introduced the air delivery is decreased significantly and the possibility of not achieving continuous bubbling increases as well as the possibility of rebreathing of oxygen poor air. No clear differences are found in types of tubing or between the resistance of the two interface types. If the pressure in the water bottle is increased by 1 cm H2O, the output pressure at the interface is increased by 0.94 cm H2O on average.<br/>Conclusion: The variable with the largest impact on the performance of the bCPAP system is the type of interface that is used. The performance of bCPAP is above all dependent on matching the physiological characteristics of the potential patient to the possibilities and properties presented by the bCPAP system.<br/><br/><br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-14","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

An online platform acts as an intermediate between two people who can fulfil each other's needs. In addition to bringing the two sides into contact, a platform also facilitates payments that make purchase and sale possible. Hereby, an online platform exhibits the characteristics of a two-sided market. New challenges arise due to the large amount of two-sided markets on the internet. These challenges are related to technical and organizational aspects, generating problems such as decentralization of user data, privacy concerns, and platform competition. Those problems correlate with the rapid increase of the number of platforms on the internet and the large amounts of data that become available as a result, and call for a new inventive approach. This research aims to present a guideline that enables the development of an extension of two-sided markets towards multi-sided markets, whereby not just two sides provide value to each other, but multiple sides increase both the value to the user and the company. The user-generated data is converted into an additional revenue streams alongside a company's current core business. In addition to providing a guideline, this study aims to see which conglomerate diversification strategy can be used to enter the recruitment market on the basis of user generated data. The results of this research are obtained from empirical research, through interviews with actors from the recruitment market. This study shows that, when choosing the right diversification strategy, several barriers have to be overcome. Regulations that respond to the protection of personal data must be taken into account and the DNA of the company must be preserved. This research provides a guideline that, in addition to crafting the right strategy, should provide handles for companies like Stuvia that have access to redundant user data. The conclusion is that -based on the data available to Stuvia- the recruitment market is a potential market to enter. The strategy that should be used by Stuvia to expand into the recruitment market is segmentation on specific user profiles on the basis of advertisements. These user profiles arise from various aspects mentioned in this research, in which the matching of a user profile and the open vacancy is of great importance.","two-sided; multi-sided; platform; Data; diversification; Guideline; Growth strategy; Online Platform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

DeoxyriboNucleic Acid, well-known as DNA, is a suitable destination for this major collection of data, as it is a high-density storage medium with long storage endurance [1]. In the field of research about DNA-Based Data Storage Systems, people examine quaternary codes. The considered DNA-codes consist of equi-length DNA-words over the Alphabet {0, 1, 2, 3} representing the available DNA building blocks or nucleotides {A, T,C,G} standing for Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine and Guanine respectively. Combinatorial constrained coding is introduced to avoid DNA patterns prone to sequencing errors, that might occur when archival data is read from DNA-blocks [2]. If an error occurs anyway, an imposed minimum Hamming distance d that a DNA-code satisfies, enforces error correction and detection capabilities [3]. Methods are considered to optimize the number of DNA-words that can be stored in a DNA-code satisfying these restrictions. This research explores DNA-codes of which the DNA-words adhere to a fixed GC content referred to as the GC-weight w, as well as the no-runlength constraint r = 1 that will not allow adjacent symbol repetition. By increasing distance d, we build on the findings of Van Leeuwen [4] and Vermeer [5], who created DNA-codes satisfying d = 2 for r = 1 and r ≥ 1 respectively. The maximum size of a DNA-code satisfying d = 3 among other constraints is proven to be 12. Furthermore, we cover the case d = n where the length n of the DNA-words and the minimum distance d the DNA-code satisfies are equal. We derive maximum sizes of these DNA-codes for all possible GC-weights w. Finally, we present algorithms that create DNA-d codes satisfying d = 3 and d = 4 and succeed in improving sizes of the DNA-codes created by the algorithms designed by Limbachiya et. al.

Especially, quenching and partitioning (Q&amp;P) steels from 3rd generation AHSS can exhibit significant strength and ductility balance by combining martensite with retained austenite.

A current reoccurring challenge in the operation department is the coordination of the components involved in making a surgery successful. One of those components is the set of surgical instruments. They undergo a cyclic process using reprocessing methods during which various challenges arise. A few of these challenges are the complex and time-consuming instrument counts before, during and after surgery.<br/><b>Research question:</b> Various technological aids have been proposed to automate the instrument counts. Previous technologies all showed their own flaws when they were tested in the operation room (OR). A new research field for the purpose of instrument counting is the use of computer vision. Computer vision shows great promise as it is already widely used to detect and recognize objects in digital images. However, before developing an algorithm to be used specifically for surgical instrument counting in and around the OR, the various activities, working methods and environmental factors are investigated first. This is done using the following research question: <i>""What is the feasibility of using a computer vision algorithm to automatically detect and count surgical instruments and what are potential factors that influence the performance and the implementation in the OR?""</i>.<br/><br/><b>Methods:</b> The research question is answered using a converting thesis structure. Firstly,<br/>the most general steps of the instrument cycle are outlined and a description is given of a SIFT computer vision algorithm. SIFT is the proposed algorithm type for the investigated application. Secondly, the more specific steps of the instrument cycle at the Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis (RdGG) are described. The result of this description are different application options and different design scenarios. Thirdly, one application type and design scenario is selected: instrument counts in the OR. A blueprint is given for testing a SIFT algorithm in the OR. This blueprint could result in numerical results, valuable observations in the OR and staff survey results.<br/><b>Results:</b> A total of 35 surgeries were attended. Only results from observations and the survey are shown as the algorithm itself was not tested yet. The observations showed factors that could negatively influence the algorithm’s performance. The survey results gave valuable insights into personal opinions on the value, use and implementation of the algorithm. <br/><b>Conclusion:</b> The feasibility of a current SIFT algorithm in a current ORs is low as it will not be able to automatically detect and count all instruments. There are a lot of factors that need to be taken into account to improve performance and possible implementation.

The present and future times refer to the two different scenarios used to implement sustainable solutions. If the restaurant is allowed to stay at its current location, it is referred to as the Improved Irmão Scenario. If the location has to be changed, it is referred to as the Future Irmão Scenario. For the Improved Irmão Scenario, the boundaries and limits of the current restaurant are taken into account and the design is carried out within these limits. For the Future Irmão Scenario on the other hand, these limits are loosened and the design is carried out from scratch. <br/><br/>To provide Irmão with a consult how to establish and operate a more sustainable beach restaurant, three steps were taken. First, the current situation of the three subjects is analysed to get a clear understanding of the current situation. This is done to have a baseline against which the final improvements can be compared. Secondly, different solutions to make Irmão more sustainable, within the three main topics, are compared using a multi¬criteria analysis to determine the most promising solutions. Thirdly, the final solutions are elaborated for the Improved Irmão Scenario and for the Future Irmão Scenario. <br/><br/>Regarding the Water system, the analysis showed that the water consumed at Irmão partly originates from the water grid and partly from the borehole in the dunes. The water use is estimated to cause an emission of 182 kg CO2 annually, leaving little room for improvement in emission reduction as this is a relative low amount. However, the water system is currently not water-efficient because it does not contain any water circularity and the water system does not contain any water saving equipment. Improvements regarding water usage are therefore possible. Regarding waste management, the analysis showed that currently, only residual waste is not recycled. Therefore, the section on waste management focused on making residual waste more sustainable. Regarding the energy system of Irmão, it became clear from the analysis that Irmão currently consumes propane gas and electricity from the local electricity grid. Both the consumption of propane gas and electricity from the local grid contribute to an emission of 26.8 tonnes of CO2 annually. From all processes carried out during the operation of Irmão, only the consumption of propane gas leads to an emission of NOx, namely 382 kg NOx annually…","Sustainability; Beach restaurant; Irmão; Consultancy; Energy; Water; Waste","en","student report","","","","","","Multidisciplinary Project: Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering, Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering and Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","Multidisciplinary Project","38.6142165053931, -9.216371729873956"

The effectiveness of the micelles can be determined when their fate in vivo is known. Radiolabeling the micelles with diagnostic radionuclides allows for determination of their biodistribution and pharmacokinetics using nuclear imaging techniques. Besides imaging, therapeutic radionuclides can also possibly be applied to allow combination of radionuclide therapy and chemotherapy. In previous work, polymeric micelles were radiolabeled with ¹⁷⁷Lu, a therapeutic radionuclide. ¹⁷⁷Lu emits both β⁻ and γ radiation, β⁻ radiation can damage the tumor while the emitted γ radiation can be used for imaging purposes. For the clinical application of such micelles it is vital to determine their radiolabeling stability, i.e. the degree to which the radionuclides remain encapsulated in the micelles when exposed to serum or other conditions such as challenging with chelators. Size Exclusion Chromatography is a commonly used method to determine the radiolabeling stability but has proven to give inconsequent results when carried out in serum. In this research the radiolabeling stability of polymeric micelles was determined using Thin Layer Chromatography and DTPA as a competing chelator. Silica coated aluminum strips were loaded with sample, run using several different mobile phases, and analyzed through phosphor imaging and automated gamma counting. These experiments were then repeated under serum conditions. Experimental results of Thin Layer Chromatography with ¹⁷⁷Lu radiolabeled PCL-PEO micelles were then compared with Size Exclusion Chromatography results from earlier research. It was concluded that while the mobile phase used can influence the radiolabeling stability, Thin Layer Chromatography can provide an excellent method of efficiently determining radiolabeling stabilities of radiolabeled micelles under non-serum and serum conditions.","Chromatography; radiolabeling; PCL-PEO micelles","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Molecular Science & Technology",""

Considering that during the same period the cavity wall became standard in the construction of houses, a certain inconsistency can be recognized between the expected and observed (structural) behaviour of a modern wall during flood events. Nevertheless, failure, or collapse, of residential buildings is included in the Dutch flood protection standards as an important cause of damage and one of the main reasons for loss of life. It is generally believed that the developments in terms of building materials translate to a safer residence i.e. less prone to flood actions. This consensus is also found in the trade-off for certain mitigation measures, especially in areas where horizontal evacuation is difficult. An improved understanding of the flood fragility of a modern cavity wall is thus needed to prove the general consensus or to adjust the current mitigation measures to comply with the allowed fatality risks.<br/><br/>A window-featured cavity wall section was constructed at the Flood Proof Holland facility, using calcium silicate bricks, fired clay bricks, and a weaker mortar to partly account for the virgin effect of any newly-built wall. Both inner and outer walls were connected with adequate wall ties. The wall section was subjected to several hydrostatic pressures at both sides. These experiments were performed to physically grasp the deformations corresponding to certain flood scenarios affecting cavity wall sections from ordinary terraced houses. Additionally, the effect of the window was investigated; both on the stability and its contribution to the water height inside a residence.<br/><br/>Computations showed that the cavity wall in a one-way bending configuration starts to show significant cracks between 1.3 and 1.6 meters of outside water level. Because of the brittleness of the masonry, this would imply failure. It was further found that the non-linear deformations would reach 4 millimeters. Considering that for these water levels the internal moments were still far from their maximum capacity, the results suggest that failure occurred due to cracks that were forced to form because of the deformations. This indicates that modern cavity walls are still quite vulnerable for floods and their flood actions. The influence of the hydrostatic pressure, however, can be decreased considerably by a water level inside the residence that acts as a counter force. Contrary to what was expected, the window does not contribute to this inside water level, since its leakages turn out to be negligible. To keep the damages to a minimum and preserve the overall stability, it is advised to seal the residence to a height of 1.0 meter; floods that exceed this sealing should not be countered anymore and rather be allowed to enter the residence.<br","Flood fragility; Cavity wall; Flood Proof Holland; DIANA FEA; Window-wall interface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The growing demand for efficient propulsion systems that operate primarily in hover, has led the ducted rotor configuration to emerge as an increasingly popular design solution. One of the major design parameters for the ducted-rotor assembly is the radial distance between the blade tip and the circumferential wall of the duct, referred to as the tip gap. How a variation in the tip gap affects the performance of the ducted-rotor assembly is addressed in this current research work.<br/><br/>The aerodynamic characteristics and performance of the ducted-rotor assembly are experimentally investigated for a parametric variation of the tip gap. The aerodynamic performance of both the rotor and the duct are characterized through force measurements with load cells. These types of measurements reveal that, for typical operating conditions, the duct generates more than half of the total thrust of the assembly. The thrust performance of the duct was also characterized with a detailed mapping of the static pressure distribution over the duct inner-wall, confirming that the thrust-generating mechanism of the duct is a direct consequence of the relatively low pressure over the inlet area of the duct. Even though the diffuser of the duct generates a small amount of pressure drag, its presence is critical for the below-the-rotor pressure recovery and for establishing a high axial throughflow. From detailed flow measurements using the particle image velocimetry method it was furthermore found that the performance deterioration—with an increase of the tip gap—is associated with a contraction of the rotor slipstream in the duct-diffuser, since the less rapid breakdown of the tip vortices reduce the axial momentum near the diffuser wall. A set of preliminary acoustic experiments were also conducted and show that the noise radiated by the system is also strongly dependent on the size of the tip gap.<br","ducted fan; ducted propellers; ducted rotor; tip clearance; tip gap; hover; drone; MAV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(TU Delft Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering)","Botto, L. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Water electrolysis is a popular energy storage technique used in tandem with many renewable sources to convert the generated energy into storeable hydrogen. The efficiency of water electrolyzers is greatly affected by overpotential losses. Bubble evolution is a unique characteristic of flows in water electrolysis. The evolution of bubbles alter electrokinetics close to the electrodes and vary ionic mass transport. The localized flow features close to a bubble are often attributed to the variation in the current density and subsequently, the electrolyzer efficiency. For the purpose of modelling flows close to a bubble better, a Lagrangian method for the simulation of passive tracers is developed and programmed to be coupled to the flow field of Bluebottle, an open-source particulate multiphase flow solver that uses the Physalis algorithm.<br/>The dynamics of the tracers are modelled using a simplified Langevin equation. In the present work, the migration flux is omitted and priority is given to convection and diffusion with the objective of establishing a foundation for the simulation of ionic mass transport. Brownian motion is described using a random displacement term. The coupling with the flow field is achieved using trilinear interpolation. The domain boundaries in regards to tracer dynamics are modelled as either a rigid wall pair or as a periodic boundary pair. Specular reflection is programmed for the former ensuring elastic collision of a tracer with the domain boundary. For the latter, the tracer position is altered so as to place the tracer in the opposite side of the domain in the axis of intrusion. Particles are assumed to be non-penetrative and hence, specular reflection is implemented at the surface of each particle. Since the tracer module is coupled one-way with the flow field and executed after a Bluebottle time-step, a subroutine is developed to push the tracers out of a particle radially if a tracer is located inside a particle after a Bluebottle time-step. To ensure particle interaction is ensured across periodic boundaries, a subroutine is developed that places the particle in an apparent location that enables particle-tracer interaction. <br/>The module execution time is found to be linearly proportional to the number of particles and the number of tracers and consumes roughly 10% of a Bluebottle iteration execution time in nominal tests. The module is tested to ensure the Brownian displacement term obeys diffusion statistics and also to ensure that the trilinear interpolation works as intended. The numerically enforced no-penetration boundary at particle surfaces is also tested and observed to prevent intrusion of tracers. <br/>The tracer module is then used to stochastically simulate mass transport across a particulate suspension in a stagnant and a sheared flow field. The Sherwood number Sh determined from the tracer module is found to agree well with the expected experimental and numerical results of Wang et al. (2009). The tracer module is also compared to a scalar field solver of Bluebottle. The tracer module is observed to capture features of the flow field quite well. However, the transient tracer positions upon conversion to a transient continuous concentration field exhibits noise due to the discrete nature of the tracers. Hence, transient comparisons with a continuous field in terms of absolute magnitude requires a large number of tracers.<br/>Recommendations for improvement of the code is provided. The present work is intended to be followed up with the addition of migration flux to the equations of motion for the tracers through the solution of an additional equation for velocity of the tracer using a force equivalence of Coulomb's law and Stokes' drag law. Future challenges that will be encountered in the development of an accurate ionic mass transport solver is briefly discussed.","water electrolysis; passive tracers; Bluebottle; Physalis; particulate multiphase flow; mass transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research is focused calculating the allowable load for steel wheels with initial cracks as a function of the number of cycles.<br/><br/>The allowable load will be calculated using four different methods.

Several of these metrics, such as human arm manipulability and muscle fatigue, have taken their turns in the literature to set the base for arbitration methods reaching promising results. Human arm force manipulability represents the transmission between joint torques in the joint space and end-point force in the task space depending on the configuration of the joint angles. Muscle fatigue keeps track of the muscle activation and builds up depending on the muscle activation level and previous fatigue value. The first one has predictive value. The other has a reactive value.\par<br/>Nevertheless, no work in the literature explores the power of combining both metrics into an arbitration method.

Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) use hydrogen to produce energy without harmful emissions, and they can be used in a range of applications, from mobility to industrial power generation.<br/><br/>One hurdle that still stands between PEMFC and widespread commercial adoption is the durability. The electrodes, catalyst and membrane of the fuel cells degrade due to the reactive environment inside the fuel cell (temperature, acidity and the presence of catalysts). This is worsened by situations with dynamic loads or start-stop cycling. <br/><br/>Another factor that can affect the degradation of fuel cells is the interaction between the fuel cell and the power electronics it interfaces with. The power electronics are necessary to boost and stabilize the voltages from the fuel cell, but they introduce current ripple into the fuel cell. The main objective of this research is to investigate how current ripple influences fuel cell degradation. The relevance is that the desired lifetime plays a significant role during the design of fuel cell systems, and quantitative information about the relationship between current ripple and fuel cell degradation can be used in the design process of the power electronics, where trade-offs need to be made between ripple amplitude, complexity and costs.<br/><br/>An analysis has been made concerning current ripple in fuel cells. Two current ripple types are mentioned in literature, low frequency current ripple and high frequency current ripple. Low frequency current ripple is created by the conversion from DC to AC by a single phase inverter, it has a frequency of 100Hz or 120Hz. High frequency current ripple is caused by the high frequency switching that occurs in any power converter. The link between these current ripple types and fuel cell degradation has mainly been investigated using experiments, but only for very specific parameters, a handful of frequencies and amplitudes. There is an absence of a quantitative analysis on the effect of different current ripple shapes on PEMFC degradation.<br/><br/>In this report, a model is developed which predicts the degradation of the PEMFC catalyst caused by current ripple. The model consists of two sub-models. The steady state degradation model predicts the decrease of the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) due to the average current of the current ripple. It models the influence of electrochemical dissolution, chemical dissolution and Ostwald ripening on the ECSA over time. The ripple degradation model predicts the ECSA degradation as a function of the ripple amplitude and frequency, using an electrical representation of the fuel cell and experimental degradation data. The model can be used to help in the design process of power electronics that interface with fuel cells.","Fuel cell; PEMFC; current ripple; Degradation; ECSA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

However, recent river programmes have shown conflicts between safety against flooding and riverine nature rehabilitation with maintaining navigational water depths. Therefore, an integrated approach is called out upon to improve the river management within these programmes. Conventional groynes are typically used to improve functions within the river programmes, whose primary function is to maintain navigational water depth. Groynes are transverse structures in which large turbulent structures are observed around the groynes. Consequently, significant bed shear stresses are developed, leading to significant local scour. Investigations for improving alternative groyne configurations are often studied for optimizing the groyne structure. The flexible groyne is considered an optimization of the conventional groyne structure. The flexible groyne consists of steep slopes and has a permeable characteristic. Although a fair amount of research has already been carried out on various groyne configurations, detailed flow characteristics around and through permeable, sloped groynes are limited. Hence, this research aims to numerically quantify the effects of permeability and head steepness of groynes. A literature study is executed to investigate the critical processes required for capturing within the numerical model to answer the research question. From the literature study, it appears that the most important processes are the non-hydrostatic effects, adapting large turbulent structures and implementing the porous zone using a non-linear function. Multiple software packages have been analyzed. Fluent is chosen, which is analyzed to capture the required processes adequately.<br/>A new numerical model has been set up for investigating the research question by simulating flow around groynes. The model is validated against three experimental studies for various characteristics. The important mean flow characteristics have been validated within an acceptable range. Still, it appears that the numerical model tends to underestimate the mean streamwise flow velocities, overestimate the Reynolds shear stresses and shift the peak values of the Reynolds shear stresses downstream. Four configurations are identified for the simulations of varying head steepness and porosity. It appears that the increase of the porosity reduces the large turbulent structures and bed shear stresses close to the groyne and shifts the peak values of the Reynolds shear stresses, and bed shear stresses further downstream. The porosity reduces the maximum Reynolds shear stresses and bed shear stresses compared with the Reynolds shear stresses, and bed shear stresses for an impermeable groyne. These reductions are because of the momentum exchange between the free flow region and the flow through the porous structure, which reduces the mean flow velocity in the free flow region. For decreasing steepness, the large turbulent structures and bed shear stresses are observed close to the groyne due to increasing deflection. The flow appears to follow the geometry of the sloped groyne more smoothly. This research is seen as a first approach for modelling a porous, sloped groyne. Further improving and analyzing numerical modelling for porous, head sloped groynes are advised to increase the model's accuracy. Furthermore, more simulations for varying the head steepness and porosity is suggested to improve the relations between the increase of porosity and head steepness for the flow characteristics. In addition, including sediment transport models within the model is expected to increase the understanding of the hydrodynamics and morphology around these specific groynes.","Groyne; Numerical model; CFD; Turbulence; river; groynes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are considered promising alternative solvents for the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2). DESs are often characterized by high viscosities, which hinders industrial application. This problem might be solved by mixing the DES with an organic solvent. This study aims to assess the DESs choline chloride-ethylene glycol (ethaline) and choline chloride-urea (reline) mixed with methanol and propylene carbonate (PC) for their suitability as a medium for the combined capture and electrochemical conversion of CO2. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to obtain the densities, the viscosities, the self-diffusivities, the ionic conductivities and insight into the molecular interactions of these mixtures. Independent MD simulations are performed of these mixtures with low concentrations of the solutes CO2, oxalic acid and formic acid. Complementary studies within the Bio-cel project are conducted to characterize the solubility and electrochemical reaction of CO2 and the techno-economics.<br/>The viscosities of the mixtures monotonically decrease for an increase of mole fraction of organic solvent, which is benign for the application of CCUS. The self-diffusivities of all constituents increase monotonically for an increase of mole fraction of organic solvent. The ionic conductivity is calculated based on the ion self-diffusivities. Ionic conductivity optima are found at a mole fraction of DES of approximately 0.6 for ethaline-PC and approximately 0.2 for ethaline-methanol and reline-methanol. For higher mole fractions of organic solvent, the ionic conductivity decreases due to a depletion of ions. Radial distribution functions (RDFs) are used to analyse the intermolecular interactions. RDF peaks between chloride-choline and chloride-ethylene glycol show an increase for an increasing mole fraction of organic solvent, which was unexpected. The numbers of hydrogen bonds decrease for addition of methanol to pure deep eutectic solvent. For addition of propylene carbonate, this decrease is less pronounced. The depletion of hydrogen bonds at low mole fractions of deep eutectic solvent is in correspondence with the decrease in viscosity and increase in self-diffusivities. The results indicate that, for the studied properties, deep eutectic solvents mixed with organic solvents are more favourable than pure deep eutectic solvents for the absorption and electrochemical conversion of CO2.","Deep Eutectic Solvents; Molecular Dynamics; CCUS; formic acid; Oxalic acid; Transport Properties","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-13","","","","","Bio-cel",""

To maximize these benefits, a potential greenhouse module needs to provide a completely controlled environment for the plants.

The distribution can be adapted depending on the respective share of plant species. The important parameters to enable a favorable root environment for plants including the necessary technological capabilities are discussed. For the aeroponic system, diaphragm pumps are chosen that operate at a pressure between 7.6 and 10 bar. They are supported by accumulator tanks reducing pressure spikes and the required number of pump cycles, thus increasing pump lifetime. To provide the optimal root conditions with a minimum of required crew time, the electrical conductivity and the pH are measured and adjusted automatically. Two 550 l tanks are used to store premixed nutrient solutions and are refilled automatically from storage containers. Microbes in the nutrient solution are eliminated by an ozone concentration of 1-3\,mg l. The System is designed to operate autonomously for one month at a time.

The results were compared using CF, CFD the relative error between measured sea trial and CFD computed resistance. The uncertainty was defined as a function of accuracy of precision, represented by the mean μ and standard deviation σ of CF, CFD. First, it was investigated if the uncertainty of CF, CFD could be reduced by including more physics in the simulations and what the impact of more variety in ship dimensions was. Subsequently, an investigation to the driving factors behind the uncertainty was conducted by performing a linear regression. After which it was investigated if the total uncertainty can be reduced by replacing experimental uncertainty by numerical uncertainty. Finally, a statistical correction to adjust the resistance was used to predict the power-speed relationship. Two correction factors were investigated. The first is based on the sample mean X of CF, CFD, and the second is CF, CFD derived from a CDF.<br/><br/>It was seen that including more physics reduced the uncertainty of CF, CFD. The uncertainty decreased whilst comparing bare hull to appended hull simulations, and it increased whilst comparing appended hull to actuator disk simulations. Thus, it was concluded that the actuator disk does not lead to a more realistic simulation of the flow. More variety in the ship dimensions lead to a larger uncertainty of CF, CFD, which was expected. The variance was found to be caused by the ship speed, the mean wave height and mean wind speed, and also by the block coefficient if different ship types are considered. By computing the hull efficiency ηH numerically instead of experimentally, the total uncertainty of CF, CFD was reduced. The power-speed relationship can be predicted accurately, but not precise with CF, CFD based on X.

This island serves a purpose to lower water levels in the IJssel- and Vechtdelta during high water, by being inundated. This inundation is meant to result in lower water levels in the IJssel near Kampen. However, the flooding of the Kampereiland is a complex case. There are numerous stochastic variables that are used to determine the water levels, as well as breaching possibilities and a compartment structure which is present on the Kampereiland. All these aspects have influence on inundation of the island. In this thesis research, the flooding of the island is analysed, during multiple different types of high water scenarios, as well as with a variation of breaches or no breaching. This is all done while taking the compartment structure on<br/>the Kampereiland into account.<br/><br/>To analyse how the Kampereiland floods, three main types of highwater scenarios have been analysed. These types are stormdominated scenarios, which are defined by high wind speeds and low discharges. The second type of high water is the discharge dominant scenario. The high water levels in these scenarios are reached by high discharges from the Vecht and the IJssel rivers, in combination with low wind speeds. Lastly, a number of extreme events have been analysed, to give a worst case perspective of the flooding of the Kampereiland. In these scenarios, high wind speeds coincide with high discharges from the two rivers, resulting in extreme water levels in the Ketelmeer, ZwarteMeer and in the Ganzendiep. <br/><br/>Each of the analysed scenarios have outside water levels exceeding the crest height of the flood defenses surrounding the Kampereiland. The scenarios have been analysed for multiple breaching cases. Three different breach locations have been determined. The locations have varying crest heights, type of flood defense (overflow resistant or non overflow resistant), type of high water (storm dominated or discharge dominated) and different hinterland compartments. Each scenarios has then been used to run the model to determine water levels in each compartment. This is done for situations without a breach, a single breach or two breaches at one location. The determination of the water levels is calculated by the use of spillway formulas.<br/><br/>The results show that the Kampereiland mainly floods from west to east. Storm dominated scenarios lead to high water levels in the Ketelmeer, leading to overflow from here. In scenarios up to 32 m/s wind speeds without breaches, the flooding is contained to the compartments to the west of the N50. The entire island floods once water levels increase due to wind speeds of 37 m/s and higher. Adding breaching into the storm dominated scenarios, the results are shifted. Now the evaluated scenarios with 32 m/s also lead to flooding<br/>of the entire island. This case still leads to less high water levels on the Kampereiland than the scenarios of 37m/s without breaching, but every compartment is inundated.<br/><br/>The discharge dominated events are contained in the Willem Meyer- and Stikkenpolder. This is due to the presence of the old flood defense, which contains the flooding in cases with and without breaches.<br/><br/>Finally, the extreme events flood the majority of the Kampereiland, similarly to the stormdominated scenarios. The water levels that occur in the Zwarte Meer and Ganzendiep are higher during the extreme events. They also last longer than in the storm dominated scenarios. This results in a small inflow from the north<br/>and southeast, while the western side of the Kampereiland rapidly fills up. Breaching during these extreme events leads to higher water levels when the breach occurs in the overflow resistant part of flood defense 225. The rising velocities in the west are also the highest in this case. Eastern compartments have higher rising velocities in case of breaching in flood defense 101 (along the northern boundary).","Flooding; Breaching; Kampereiland; Compartments; Trajectory 225; Trajectory 101","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","52.58434, 5.88969"

(mentor); Muraro, S. (graduation committee); Pisano, F. (graduation committee); Chao, C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The coefficient of lateral earth pressure at rest (K0) is an important parameter in any geotechnical problem since it provides information on the initial stress state, which governs the response of the soil to the proceeding stress changes. A proper determination of the stresses in any geotechnical problem is required to be able to predict the soil behaviour. Any change in the conditions the soil is subject to can alter the value of K0, how this value changes for conventional stress histories such as loading and unloading is defined well. However, the influence of unconventional stress histories such as creep or drying/wetting cycles is not thoroughly understood. Since every soil is subjected to natural environmental stresses, resulting in creep and unsaturated conditions, it is interesting to look at their influences of the soil stress state expressed by K0.<br/><br/>The goal of this work is to determine if it is possible to better understand what is happening to K0 during creep and under unsaturated conditions and if the prediction of K0 can be improved by accounting for these phenomena, with the focus being on clays. Literature showed that for saturated samples, the value of K0 increases with time during creep. For unsaturated conditions it was found that K0 decreases with an increase of suction.<br/><br/>In order to see if it is possible to improve the prediction of K0, a model needed to be constructed. The starting point of this model was a saturated, elastoplastic model based on the SANICLAY model. The first step in extending this model was to include viscosity which was done by adopting Perzyna’s overstress approach. The model was validated to experimental data on OostVaardersPlassen (OVP) clay obtained from literature and the validation showed that the model was satisfactory in predicting the soil behaviour. Accounting for unsaturated conditions was done by adopting the average soil skeleton approach. Implementation was initially done in the original elastoplastic model. Again, the model was validated to experimental data obtained from the literature, this time unsaturated loading/unloading tests on London clay (LC) were used. The results showed that the model prediction was accurate up to suctions up to 600 kPa. The final step in the model development was to include both Perzyna’s and the average soil skeleton stress approach in the basic model giving an unsaturated elasto viscoplastic model version. Unsaturated creep tests on London clay were used to validate the model but the results showed that an uncoupled stress-suction approach gave inaccurate predictions. The viscous nucleus in Perzyna’s approach was changed to become suction dependent and the results showed that the experimental data could be reproduced reasonably well.<br/><br/>The unsaturated elasto viscoplastic model was then used to analyse K0 during the unsaturated creep tests. The results showed that the model predicted a decrease in K0 with time for low loads and high suctions. For higher loads and low to moderate suctions, the model predicted an initial increase followed by a decrease. For all cases it was found that the value of K0 decreased with suction. The role of anisotropy on the model prediction was analysed by predicting the change in K0 using an isotropic version of the model. This version also predicted a decrease at low loads and high suctions but an initial increase was no longer predicted to decrease. The decrease of K0 with suction was still observed. No experimental data was available to confirm either of the findings, comparing the results with the literature study showed that the decrease of K0 with suction was previously observed. The decrease with time on the other hand was not found in previous work. However, the creep tests in previous works were performed on saturated samples and in general for a shorter time period which could show different results.<br/><br/>It is concluded that by accounting for creep and unsaturated conditions, the qualitative prediction of the soil behaviour can be improved. By accounting for coupled behaviour through an unsaturated viscous nucleus, the currently available unsaturated and time dependent experimental deformation data can be simulated accurately. The prediction of the change in stress state, due to these natural phenomena, is likely to be improved as well since the outcome of the model matches findings from the literature. However, due to the lack of experimental unsaturated time dependent data stating the change in K0, no conclusions can be drawn on the importance of anisotropy and the quantitative model performance. What this work does offer is a good modelling tool to support future experiments or investigations into unsaturated creep behaviour.","Coefficient of lateral earth pressure; Creep; Unsaturated Conditions; SANICLAY; Perzyna's approach; Average soil skeleton stress approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Rising polarization within national borders and stranded dialogues between nations on mutual problems, daily reach the headlines. It is argued that current models of opinion only scratch the surface of actual human opinion formation with the traditional value based exact approach. Developments in the domain of natural language processing highlight the overlap between real world cultural biases and biased language models. Although within their own domain these biases are seen as problematic, it is argued that it is exactly this associative prejudice that can be used to model human like opinion formation. This idea is emphasized by an conceptual approach on opinion, belief and knowledge, in which only the probability of an association distinguishes between 'objective' and 'subjective'. Through this concept, and by using identified significant cognitive tendencies, a framework is developed for inferring an opinion from text. Using this framework, an opinion model based on a language model is proposed. The contribution of this thesis is two-fold. Firstly, the proposed model provides evidence that agent perception through language is a significant model element, in which the bias in a language model can possibly be exploited to approach cultural perception. Secondly, as the bridge between the two domains has not yet been build, the findings of the results as well as the research process give direction for much needed future research.","opinion model; language modeling; association","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

It is important to understand the interplay of these engineered solutions with their natural environment to minimize hazardous side effects to our ecology, economy and coastal safety. In a numerical study by Rijnsburger (2021), a flow recirculation with a diameter of 10 to 20 km - similar to an eddy - was identified in the North Sea. It remained unclear what causes the recirculation, but its location in the Rhine region of freshwater influence and near the artificial Maasvlakte headland, suggest that the recirculation could both be baroclinic or barotropic. This numerical model study is set out to understand what processes drive the recirculation. Identifying these processes is important to understand what is required to properly model the hydrodynamics along the Dutch coast, and accordingly, the spreading of sediment, pollutants and phytoplankton.<br/><br/>A realistic 3D hydrodynamic model was used to assess the recirculation during a validated spring-neap cycle. Our analysis shows that the recirculation has a maximum diameter of roughly 15 km during neap tide and 5 km during spring tide. The recirculation occurs in the buoyant top layer of the water column and grows offshore from its onset north of the Maasmond around HW+3 until it is overtaken by ebb tidal velocities around HW+5. This study shows that the onshore advection of negative (clockwise) vorticity water results in most water flowing back to the river mouth into an expanding clockwise recirculation, the vorticity and strength of which are strongly influenced by buoyant river outflow. <br/>Our analysis shows that the headland is not a prerequisite for its onset. Nevertheless, two mechanisms are identified of how the headland influences the recirculation. First, during spring tide, the headland is found to ‘shelter’ the recirculation from strong ambient currents in the midfield which would otherwise hamper the recirculation. Secondly, the geometry of the river mouth influences the vorticity input in the North Sea associated with the buoyant river outflow. <br/><br/>To further investigate what processes influenced by the river outflow could contribute to the recirculation, a scale analysis and particle tracking study were deployed. Although, the study is not yet conclusive on what drives the onshore advection of the spinning water that flows into the recirculation, several potential processes have been identified.<br/><br/>For future studies that want to model the spreading of freshwater, pollutants or suspended sediment near the river mouth of the Rhine-Meuse system, this study underlines the importance of using a three-dimensional numerical model that accounts for density differences and the influence of the studied recirculation. The latter is especially important when the boundaries of the numerical domain are located close to the river mouth, due to which the influence of the recirculation is not resolved unless explicitly accounted for in the boundary conditions. This study therefore contributes to the improvement of future modelling studies of the Rhine ROFI and to our understanding of the processes that govern the hydrodynamics along the Dutch coast.<br","Stratified flows; Recirculation; CFD; Maasvlakte 2; Hydrodynamics; bulge circulation; headland eddy; Coastal structures; Flow; North Sea; Algae; D-Flow FM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","52.02, 4.07"

Pure ammonia exhibits poor combustion characteristics, so several researchers have already operated small-scale internal combustion engines (ICEs) with ammonia-hydrogen blends. However, nitrogen oxides NOx and unburned ammonia are major objections that require the after-treatment of exhaust gases. Experimental studies with solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks up to 1 kW demonstrated that SOFCs can convert ammonia to electricity with the highly endothermic ammonia cracking reaction at the fuel electrode or before the SOFC as an intermediate step. Although SOFCs tend to be more efficient and emit fewer NOx compared to ICEs, their power density, dynamic behaviour and investment costs are inferior. Different authors came up with integrations of mostly methane-fuelled SOFCs with gas turbines or internal combustion engines. <p class=""MsoNormal"">This work presents an ammonia-fuelled SOFC--ICE hybrid system in which hydrogen off-gas from an SOFC enhances ammonia combustion in an ICE. 0-D components models are developed in an integrated model to quantify the effect of different parameters on fuel efficiency, power density, and heat management.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">The hybrid system simulations vary three parameters, all in three different ways. First, the SOFC provides either 25, 50 or 75% of the hybrid system power, resulting 25/75, 50/50 or 75/25 SOFC/ICE power splits. Secondly, either 0, 50 or 100% of the hydrogen in the SOFC is obtained from external cracking before the stack. Thirdly, the share of hydrogen in the ammonia-hydrogen ICE fuel blends is varied: 20, 30 and 40%. This leads to 27 distinct simulations, all at 5000 A/m2 SOFC current density. Besides, current density is varied from 2500 and 5000 to 9000 A/m2 in the 50/50 SOFC/ICE power split configuration. </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Full internal cracking of ammonia in the SOFC results in an electrical efficiency of up to 58% and 54% (based on the lower heating value) for a 75/25 and 50/50 power split, respectively, but it leads to heat management failures in the 25/75 power split; where 50% external cracking results in 47% efficiency. Complete external instead of internal cracking decreases efficiency by at most 10 percent points (75/25 power split), because additional fuel is needed heat to the external cracker. Moreover, external cracking results in increased power consumption by the cathode air blower. The ICE efficiency, 41% (standalone system) or 43% (being part of the hybrid system), is outperformed in all 27 simulations mentioned above. The after-treatment model predicts the formation of highly unwanted N2O. The computed SOFC--ICE specific volume is 2, 3 or 4 times larger than an ICE, but less fuel tank space required could cancel this out.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">This research indicates that an SOFC reduces fuel consumption compared to an ICE, but using hydrogen off-gas with ammonia in an ICE is advantageous for power density and efficiency. Furthermore, operational parameters of the SOFC can be adjusted in favour of the system efficiency until there is too little electrochemical waste heat compared to the heat absorbed by ammonia cracking in the SOFC. Amongst many other topics, future research should include part load and dynamic operation because of the expected benefits of the hybrid system. </p> <p class=""MsoNormal""> </p> <p class=""MsoNormal""> </p> <p class=""MsoNormal""> </p> <p class=""MsoNormal""> </p> <p class=""MsoNormal""> ","SOFC-ICE Hybrid System; SOFC; ICE; Solid oxide fuel cell; Internal Combustion Engine; Engine; Hybrid; Maritime; Ship; Ammonia; AmmoniaDrive; Hybrid System; Propulsion; Hydrogen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy, Flow and Process Technology","AmmoniaDrive",""

(mentor); Zwart, S.D. (graduation committee); Goyal, N. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Even though carbon tax policies are fundamental for low-carbon growth and energy-effective investments, empirical evidence shows that longstanding continuation of a carbon tax is not self-evident. The sheer complexity of carbon tax continuation is reflected by the adoption – and subsequent reversal – of the carbon tax in Australia. In July 2014, two years after implementation, the carbon tax was repealed by the right-wing coalition government led by Tony Abbott. Whereas Australia has a tumultuous relationship with carbon tax implementation, Sweden has been acknowledged for its longstanding carbon taxation policy to achieve cost-effective emission reduction. In 1991, Sweden was one of the first countries to implement a carbon tax and has since then been able to gradually increase tax levels per metric ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). This study aims to explain Sweden's continued carbon tax and Australia's carbon tax reversal. Given the broad breadth of this objective, this study focuses on the agenda-setting, formulation, adoption, and implementation phases of Sweden's and Australia's policymaking processes. To structure the contrastive case study, two theoretical frameworks are utilized throughout the study. First, the Multiple Streams Framework (MSF) is used to explore the role of policy entrepreneurs in coupling problems, politics and policies during policy windows. Policy Feedback Theory (PFT) is used to identify policy feedback loops once the carbon tax is adopted or implemented. PFT differentiates between (1) resource and incentive effects and (2) interpretive effects. Based on the comparative analysis, the following conclusions are identified. First, it is evident that in Sweden, the broader tax reform in 1991 was an essential factor for the continued support for the carbon tax. In the end, the continued support was significant to guarantee political support from both right-wing and left-wing politics and its associated voters. Second, in terms of carbon tax design, this study showed that earmarking collected revenues for green spending does not guarantee success. Moreover, the analysis revealed that increasing the tax rate in a step-wise manner (starting with a relatively low tax rate) is a factor contributing to carbon tax continuation. In line with the theoretical frameworks, for the case of Sweden, it is shown that through an effective policy design and policymaking process, the resource effects (allocation of benefits and burden) as described by the PFT allowed for further strengthening (continued coupling of the three streams of the MSF) of the initially formulated carbon tax policy. In contradiction, the carbon tax in Australia was accepted during a period characterized by a fragmented political landscape and an increased divergence in perceptions towards the carbon tax among the public. Put differently, this study emphasizes the significant importance of civil society actors who not only bring policy problems to the forefront of public debate and encourage policy answers, but also support government decisions to pursue these once disclosed. Moreover, the reversal of the carbon tax in Australia highlights the critical nature of high-level political commitment to contentious policy issues – even ones with compelling evidence and precedence for implementation in analogous settings. Specifically, in Australia the carbon tax was politicized, disputed and subsequently used as tool to win the elections and control the government. Within the adoption phase of the policymaking process, the exclusion and discouragement of discussions between opponents and proponents of the carbon tax is a factor that contributed to the reversal of the carbon tax in Australia. Considering the theoretical frameworks, this study showed how the design of the Australian carbon tax induced negative feedbacks through ineffective resource allocations and interpretive effects that negatively shaped the setting and condition in which the carbon tax policy was received by the public and policy makers.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

By signing and ratifying global treaties, the groundwork for this revolution is laid. The objective is to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, before 2050. This requires a carbon-free electricity system, which implicates that existing fossil sources of electricity need to be replaced by renewable sources. Most of these sources are weather-dependent and follow seasonal patterns. This leads to a variable, uncertain, and uncontrollable electricity supply. Energy system integration is posed as a key concept to provide the much-needed flexibility to the electricity grid and has been the subject of extensive research. However, there still is a considerable need for further research in the field of energy system integration. Part of the research gap is validation and substantiation of the proposed energy system integration policies and investment decisions. An indispensable component for filling the research gap is a numerical model of the energy system.<br/><br/>In this context, the author of this thesis developed a numerical model of the Dutch high-voltage electricity grid. The model can be used to analyse proposed energy system integration policies, optimise the electricity system investment decisions, and prioritise the bottlenecks in the electricity system. The model is used to analyse the effects of several power and heating sector integration scenarios for 2050. <br/><br/>The model is constructed in the pandapower framework. The framework is coded in the Python programming language. The model parameters are based on open data and the model input is derived from national sector outlooks and the Energy Transition Model from Quintel Intelligence. Due to the unavailability of operational data from the reference system, the accuracy of the model is determined by evaluating the underlying assumptions and performing a sensitivity analysis. Once the model is validated, the effects of power and heating sector integration on the Dutch high-voltage electricity grid are analysed and the bottlenecks are identified. The results show a substantial increase in grid loading. The highest grid loading occurs when a large portion of the heating demand is electrified, and a large portion of the electricity supply is generated by variable renewable energy sources.<br/><br/>The bottleneck analysis of power and heating sector integration scenarios presents one of the use cases of the created representative model of the Dutch high-voltage electricity grid. As the model is based on open data, it is the intention of the author to make the model publicly available as well. This allows other entities to perform a broad range of analysis on the electricity system.","Energy Sector Integration; Scenario Analysis; Power-to-Heat; Power System Modelling; High-Voltage Electricity Grid; The Netherlands; 2050","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Therefore, a Bayesian model was developed by Wang et al.

In this study, this proposed model is implemented into the Python coding environment after which the functionality is verified by conducting a case study on a 23 푚 CPT profile from the Groningen area (NE Netherlands). For the given CPT profile, the model distinguishes 6 separate soil layers from which the position and thickness are in agreement with the deterministic analysis and the available borehole data. However, the case study suggests that the model fails to correctly identify the most probable soil types for CPT measurements within the vicinity of the edges of the Robertson chart. This is most-likely related to a “cut-off”-effect of the joint Gaussian distribution describing the uncertainty of a single datapoint. A subsequent study on the integration of the statistical parameters within the model is therefore required. Additionally, the code includes several optimizing strategies, but remains time consuming for very complex model classes. Further optimization is suggested to achieve greater model precision and efficiency.","Bayesian; CPT; soil strata; probabilistic identification; Wang et al.

In this thesis, the nuisance that has been reported by citizens during the summer recreation season from 2020 has been analysed by coding the reports in Atlas.TI, and using a survey from the Muncipality of Amsterdam as a verification. There are two locations where large amounts of nuisance reports have been filed, the Bogortuin and Park Somerlust, and several smaller locations with quay walls in the Oostelijk Havengebied and on the Amstel river. The content on the individual nuisance experience in the reports has been separated in observations, providing the nuisance causes, and evaluations, providing the nuisance impact. Recreation in it self is not problematic per se, but the presence of large groups of youngsters and recreation during the evening hours and at night is. This impacts local residents because of noise nuisance, especially at night, and pollution of waste and public urination. The character of summer recreation nuisance can be classified as both physical and social nuisance that is experienced during the evening hours, on weekend days and when it’s dry and warm. Implemented interventions have been evaluated and together with proposed interventions been analysed with the prevention pyramid. The measures that deal with the physical nuisance, temporary public toilets and an increase of waste capacity are in general reviewed positively. One successful intervention on social nuisance is the anchoring ban with a buoy line in the water to prevent noise nuisance from boats. None of the measures has been designed in an integrated way, using all the levels of the pyramid.  ","summer recreation; nuisance; citizen reporting; interventions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

(graduation committee); von Terzi, D.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The potential gain in energy production and profit by improving the placements of turbines within a wind farm is driving interest. However, finding the optimal placements provides a complex problem. A large number of inter-dependent design variables create a design space that is difficult to solve. Therefore there is much attention for offshore wind farm layout optimisation (OWFLO) in practice and literature. Most of the research is done in selecting and creating the best optimisation algorithms, wake models and cost models.<br/><br/>This is not yet another study into better modelling or optimiser selection for OWFLO. Instead, this study aims to provide insight into what performance can be expected from OWFLO and to know when further optimising is not justifiable anymore. The study consists of three parts. All three parts make use of a referent. A referent can be considered a close representation of reality, obtained by a best-practice implementation of the optimisation problem and its associated models. It is assumed that the referent has the same characteristics as reality and that deviations of other implementations of OWFLO from the referent are representative of their deviations from the true optimisation problem.\\<br/><br/>In this study, the referent is defined by, amongst others, the use of the Bastankhah and Porté-Agel Gaussian wake model, a 12 sector wind rose with a Weibull distribution per sector and the gradient-free covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. The referent is used to maximise annual energy production (AEP). <br/><br/>The first part uses the referent to find and understand the characteristics of the OWFLO problem. Wind farms with 9, 25 and 64 turbines have been optimised 100 times with the referent. The results show a small spread in the performance of the found optimised layouts, indicating that many local optima exist with similar performances in an OWFLO problem. The spread between the highest and lowest found performance decreases with increasing numbers of turbines. A special form of the response surface is used to visualise the response surface. The visualised response surfaces, with only two design variables, showed that the wakes of the turbines created multiple local optima.<br/><br/>The second part compares performances from optimised layouts with 25 turbines resulting from optimisations with alternative implementation choices, evaluated by the referent model. The performances are represented in boxplots for 100 optima each. The boxplots show that the influence of alternative implementation choices depends on the slightly different locations of the local optima in the design space and the roughness of the response surface they create. The influence of the shifts in locations of the local optima on the performance turned out to be minimal. An increase in the roughness of the response surface meant an increase in the spread of the performances. The difference in performance resulting from the alternative optimisers indicates that improvement of a state-of-the-art optimiser is not expected to lead to much better results. <br/><br/>The third part explores the need for improvement of the analysis by adding a phenomena currently not considered in OWFLO. The influence of neighbouring wind farms on layout optimisation without including atmospheric stability is explored. Three cases have been defined to show the influence of neighbouring wind farms on layout optimisation. It is concluded that adding neighbouring wind farms for accurate energy yield assessments is necessary. However, for layout optimisation, the benefit of including neighbouring wind farms is not evident.","Optimization; Offshore; WInd Farm; Layout","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This will result in the emissions of CO2 from the aviation industry alone, to be higher than what the entire transportation industry is allowed for, according to the Paris Agreement. While the High Speed Rail in­dustry has partially helped to suppress these emissions, it cannot really compete with aviation in speed or costs. And so, now more than ever, it is important to start thinking about alternative transportation modes, which will not only reduce the carbon emissions but will also be able to compete with aviationin terms of safety, comfort, speed and cost. A viable alternative, on which scientists and engineers have worked on since the beginning of the 20th century is Hyperloop. This system comes with a dramatically lower energy consumption compared to airplanes and even high speed trains. Furthermore, the Hyperloop system has shown capability to reach speeds which are comparable to, or even higher than those of airplanes. And so, this thesis work investigates the application of a primary segmented permanent magnet linear synchronous motor as a driving source in a high speed transportation system. The motor con­sidered has a short primary and long secondary (mover), with the primary being the static part hence resulting in an active guideway transportation system. The segmentation of the primary, into several stator blocks, results in discontinuities of the electromagnetic circuit of the motor which gives rise to ac­celeration and thrust losses in the form of dips. These irregularities will also lead to high jerking motions which result in a very uncomfortable travelling experience and may also lead to mechanical stresses and breakdowns in the system. Here, a preactivation strategy is proposed, which will be incorporated in the control domain of the inverter units and will suppress the distortions occurring in the acceleration and thrust characteristics. The uniqueness of this proposal lays on the fact that no complex control strategies are involved in the solution, the approach is very practical and can be easily incorporated in the control system. The work carried out and presented in this thesis report includes the design of an algorithm used to describe the magnetic interaction between the primary and secondary and a predic­tive algorithm used to generate an inverter activation command signal which will be responsible for the preactivation of any inverter unit. Moreover, considerations and implications related to the particular solution are also given. The strategy proposed results in significant improvement of the behavior of the motor system during propulsion, accompanied by the reduction of the dips in the acceleration and thrust profiles.Furthermore, an extensive thermal analysis has also been carried out with regards to the thermal developments in the power modules installed in each inverter unit that will be supplying each stator block. Considering the fact that the duty cycle of these inverter units is rather short, the aim of this part of the research is to prove whether underrated power modules can be used in this application. Referring to the obtained results it can be concluded that such a strategy can be applied provided that several technical requirements are satisfied. The successful implementation of such strategy has the potential to lead to substantial financial benefits in terms of product costs.","Maglev; Hyperloop; PS-PMLSM; Primary Segmented Permanent Magnet Linear Synchronous Motors; Segmentation; Stator block; Mover transition; Short primary; Long secondary; Vehicle transition; Preactivation; Preactivation strategy; block to block transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These systems are concentrated, highly used and vulnerable to rainfall-induced disruptions. Improving the resilience of infrastructure systems to these disruptions has become a vital aspect of managing an urban area that is both economically viable as well as liveable. Studies show that disruptions disproportionally impact low-income and minority groups and with that lead to increased inequalities. Cities have increased their focus on resilience assessments but have stopped short of how different societal groups are affected by a disruption, and how interventions can impact societal groups differently.<br/><br/>In this research the effect of different equity principles in the context of decision-making for resilient transport infrastructure is being addressed. Three different equity principles, namely Equal Sharing, Rawl’s Theory of Justice, and Utilitarianism, are being compared to understand how the benefits that arise from possible interventions are being distributed over society. To do so, a methodology has been developed and applied to the case study of The Hague. This research studied the accessibility in business-as-usual conditions, accessibility after a rainfall-induced disruption and accessibility for different societal groups after interventions are placed based on the three equity principles. <br/><br/>The results show that i) depending on the underlying equity principle a different intervention location is prioritized. Simply changing the underlying assumptions on which the interventions are placed, changes the impact significantly for the most socially vulnerable group and the general population. To reduce inequalities in accessibility, it is important to increase awareness amongst policymakers and researchers that the most common (sometimes unconsciously) used equity principle underlying decision making is the Utilitarian principle. As is being illustrated in this research, there are other options that could greatly influence the preferred intervention and with that the impact to different societal groups. <br","Accessibility; Urban planning; Pluvial flooding; Equity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","52.078663, 4.288788"

Currently, within this context, one possibility that is explored at ASML involves an increase in the number of alignment markers on a wafer, for a more accurate mapping of local wafer deformations. The current alignment marker metrology system consists of a diffraction-based sensor that is space consuming and measures the markers one-by-one. To prevent a longer total measurement time due to a larger number of markers, parallel read-out is pursued by miniaturisation of the sensor. The technology that is explored for this miniaturisation is integrated optics, in which classical optical components are replaced by their waveguide-based equivalent structures on a chip-sized sensor. Contributing to the feasibility study of integrated optics for ASML’s wafer metrology, this work focuses on the design, construction and verification of an experimental setup for photonic integrated circuit (PIC) alignment sensors. The setup is capable of characterizing the output beams of grating couplers, important PIC components, by imaging their intensity profiles at different locations along their propagation direction. Spots of 40µm can be imaged with a spatial resolution of 0.3µm and an expected Z-position accuracy of 6µm. The setup is also able to scan alignment marks with a PIC alignment sensor, with an expected repeatability of 1.1nm. Anticipating completion of the first PIC alignment sensor designed by the TU Eindhoven, measurements on an alternative PIC containing elementary structures were conducted. Successful coupling between angle polished fibers and 15x15µm grating couplers was achieved, with a verified coupling efficiency of 21.4±3.6%, compared to a coupling efficiency of 28% with the conventional flat end-face fiber coupling method.","Alignment sensor; Photonic integration; Experimental setup","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

While some problems require dynamic analysis, simulating the (infinite) continuous domain using typical Dirichlet (fixed) boundary conditions induce spurious reflections causing (1) unrealistic stress increments at the domain oundary and (2) the appearance of multiple unnatural stress waves in the domain. Aiming to eliminate this numerical artifact in MPM, two solutions for absorbing boundary conditions found in FEM are implemented and investigated; these are (1) a viscous boundary condition and (2) a viscoelastic boundary condition. The use of such dynamic boundary conditions in MPM is scarce and no validation of them has yet been presented in the literature. In this work, these absorbing conditions are implemented alongside other recent developments, which improves the numerical stability (Double-Mapping, Generalized Material Point Method, Composite Material Point Method), using two approaches: (1) directly imposing at the external active boundary nodes and (2) imposing via shape function interpolation. The proposed solutions are then validated with a one-dimensional benchmark: a soil column under dynamic load in small-deformation and large-deformation, and a 2D symmetric plane strain model under one loading pulse. The benchmark results demonstrate that the numerical reflections that lead to inaccuracies of stress and velocity can be removed using GIMP interpolation and, together with the other numerical technics, render high-quality and realistic results. A study of shallow foundation failure under repeated loading is also presented, showing the potential of applications of the proposed solution for modelling extreme geotechnical events.","Material Point Method; DM-GC; Absorbing boundary; Shallow foundations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

This makes these piles ideal for construction works in urban areas where surrounding structures can be affected by vibrations that would be produced from the installation of a driven pile. Since their initial production in the 1980s in Europe, multiple variations of screw piles are on the market today. This Msc thesis focuses on the Screw-Injection piles (SI-piles) commonly known as Fundex piles. SI-piles are a type of partial ground displacement piles where only a portion of the soil surrounding the pile is being pushed radially outwards during the rotational motion of screwing in the installation process. The other portion is transported back with grout flowing to the surface. <br/><br/>The current Dutch practice already have NEN guidelines on how to predict bearing capacity for SI-piles. These guidelines consist of CPT-based methods with an empirical correlation factor, the $\alpha$ pile class factor, which helps to relate the bearing capacity to the soil surrounding the pile. Nevertheless, one aspect that is not well understood is the effect that different properties of the injected grout have at the soil-pile interface and for bearing capacity. In this thesis two grout properties are being manipulated which are the Water/Binder and W/C ratios of the grout mixture, and the injection flow rate of the grout with the purpose to see whether and/or to what extent a difference exists in the shaft bearing capacity for SI-piles.<br/><br/>A full-scale experiment was conducted on 15 piles in order to evaluate the effect of these varying parameters. This research is composed of four targeted variations of W/B ratio and two injection flow rates, 5 groups of 3 piles each to be more precise. The piles were subjected to a static pile load test in tension, which means that the bearing capacity is composed of mainly the shaft resistance of the pile. The analysis breaks down in four main parts to analyse the indirect relationships between the properties that are accounted for in the empirical parameter $\alpha$. These four parts include the assessment of the load-displacement behaviour of the SI-piles, assessment of radial soil stress (CPT data), assessment of the records during the installation process (torque, RPM), the grout properties during installation and after 28 and 56 days of curing, and lastly, the pile shape (volume) after extraction of pile. <br/><br/>The assessment of the load-displacement behaviour showed that the predictions using the NEN guidelines for bearing capacity were extremely accurate for most pile groups (above 0.970 measured/predicted ratio). But for the pile groups with higher W/B ratio and with the highest flow rate (Groups C and D respectively) the measured shaft capacity would be much lower. A direct relationship between the W/C and W/B ratio is difficult to conclude since for pile B2 and C1 that had the same W/C ratio, the difference in the measured/predicted ratio was about 21\%. In the case of flow rate it is entirely seen that a higher flow rate leads to a significant decrease in measured shaft capacity. The NEN suggests a value of $\alpha_t$ for SI-piles of 0.009, yet the shaft capacity for groups with a higher W/C ratio and flow rate could be better predicted with an $\alpha_t$ $\approx$ 0.00793. Additionally, another important research objective is to try to optimise the $\alpha_t$ parameter by comparing the $q_c$ values for the pre-installation, the average post-installation and minimum value of the post-installation CPTs. This resulted in the $\alpha_t$ derived from the pre-installation CPT to have a much lower Coefficient of Variation, CoV, of approximately 0.08 whereas the average and minimum post-CPT $\alpha_t$ had a CoV of 0.12 and 0.11 respectively. <br/><br/>The assessment of the soil stresses is comprised of an analysis of the changes in cone resistance, $q_c$, throughout the field. The analysed data collected shows that for varying W/B ratios there is no solid relationship that relates the change in $q_c$ after the grout installation. However, a higher flow rate seems to have a significant impact on the cone resistance, leading to a general decrease of $q_c$ after installation, having a decrease as low as -16.53\% for pile D1, whereas for all other pile groups there was an increase in $q_c$ after installation, increases as high as 30\% (pile A3).<br/><br/>The assessment of the records during installation include the analysis of the torque during the installation process. It is seen that in both cases, high W/B ratio and high flow rate, there is a decrease in torque, but the flow rate of 115 [l/min] had a more significant impact than the increase in W/B ratio.\\<br/>% Moreover, the 2D interpolation analysis aimed to see how post-installation CPT data should be considered. Pre-installation CPT data is sufficient to make a prediction on bearing capacity, but in this analysis both situations are being compared. This comparison resulted in that the difference between the two is minimal, the maximum difference found was in the order of $\pm$5 MPa.<br/><br/>The assessment of backflow grout resulted in higher W/C ratios having higher increases in density of the backflow fluid, and that high flow rate leads to a lower backflow density, this was supplemented with the sand transport data which suggests that higher W/B ratios lead to more sand transport out of the soil body. Furthermore, a inversely proportional relationship was found between W/B and W/C ratios and both the axial and bending stresses; the same inverse relationship is found with the flow rate. Additionally, the shear stress of the grout and of the soil were compared in order to determine if the failure is purely geotechnical or also structural.<br/><br/>The pile shape assessment resulted in a higher W/B ratio leading to a higher pile diameter, regardless of the flow rate during injection. There is also a very clear, almost perfectly linear, relationship between the mean diameter of the extracted pile and the measured shaft capacity. However not all piles were extracted and this includes piles installed with the highest W/C ratios (group C) and thus the aforementioned relationship has only been shown for a limited set of piles.","Geo-Engineering; Screw piles; Bearing capacity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS) aim to combine these two properties and provide steels that can increase safety and lower CO2 consumption in automotive applications, by decreasing weight. To further decrease the environmental impact, novel quenched and partioned (Q&amp;P) martensitic stainless steel is considered to prevent corrosion. Quenching and partitioning is a heat treatment that aims for a martensite/retained austenite microstructure with specific phase fractions to optimize strength and ductility. While mechanical properties are well researched for Q&amp;P treated martensitic stainless steel, the corrosion properties are not that widely documented. This thesis aims to discover the influence of the microstructural development in terms of phase fractions due to the Q&amp;P treatment, and the manganese content on the corrosion properties of martensitic stainless steel. Two alloys with chemical composition 0.2C-12.5Cr-0.35Si-XMn, where X stands for 0.7 for the low manganese alloy, and 3 for high manganese alloy, are considered for this study, and are compared to a commercial AISI 420 martensitic stainless steel. The microstructure was investigated by the use of optical microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM). This was combined with electrochemical experiments including Open-circuit potential measurements, potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). When compared to commercially available AISI 420 martensitic stainless steel, the novel Q&amp;P MSS showed improved corrosion properties. This can mainly be attributed to the lack of chromium rich carbides (Cr23C6 or Cr7C3) in the Q&amp;P treated MSS. However, this improvement in corrosion properties was only observed for the samples with low manganese content. The increase of fraction retained austenite did show an increase in corrosion potential, making the steel more cathodic, but the improvements in terms of pitting potential and passive film properties are limited. Samples with high fresh martensite fractions also showed an increase in corrosion potential, but only marginally increased in terms of length of the passive region. EIS data shows that the addition of fresh martensite reduces the passivity properties of the material. Volta-potential measurements done by SKPFM showed a clear difference between primary martensite and fresh martensite of up to 20mV and were overlapping with the topography maps. This can be an indication of increased tendency to form micro-galvanic cells between martensite phases. Manganese was found to be detrimental for the corrosion properties of the Q&amp;P treated MSS. A clear drop in the length of the passive region shows that the high manganese samples are more susceptible to pitting. EDS measurements and EPMA elemental distribution maps showed local zones of decreased chromium and increased manganese and silicon. This indicates that there are secondary phase particles present in the material in the form of manganese silicide or manganese sulfide. Volta-potential measurements done by SKPFM showed these particles behave more anodic in comparison to the matrix of the material. The number of particles per unit area was increased for the samples with high manganese content. These inclusions greatly reduce corrosion performance, showing that the addition of manganese is detrimental for corrosion performance. Several other microstructural features are discussed in terms of influence on the corrosion performance of the material. Which include prior austenite grain boundaries, elemental banding of chromium and manganese and Volta-potential differences between martensite laths.","Martensitic Stainless Steel; quenching and partitioning; Corrosion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","One of the biggest threats that humanity is currently facing is the climate change. The amount of greenhouse gases emissions and specifically the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased and is projected to increase even more in the next years. One possible solution is the use of supercritical CO2 as an alternative working fluid in power cycles (e.g., Rankine and Brayton cycle). Supercritical fluids operate at pressures and temperature higher than their corresponding critical pressure and temperature value. They behave as a single-phase substances with variable thermophysical properties. CO2 at supercritical conditions is denser than supercritical water and steam which can affect the efficiency and the design of multiple mechanical components. printed circuit heat exchangers due to their unique design are suitable for supercritical application. They are compact heat exchangers which can operate at high pressures and temperatures and they can achieve high effectiveness. Because of the rapid variation of the thermophysical properties, heat transfer and flow characteristics in supercritical conditions are affected. Three typical heat transfer modes can occur: 1) Normal Heat Transfer, 2) Deteriorated Heat Transfer and 3) Enhanced Heat Transfer. Furthermore, induced forces due to the density difference also known as buoyancy effects are observed in these conditions and can affect both the flow, the heat transfer of the fluid and thus the performance of the heat exchanger. <br/>The main focus of this study is the induced buoyancy effects inside a printed circuit heat exchanger at laminar flow. Initially, a printed circuit heat exchanger is designed based on the literature. Using this heat exchanger geometry two sets of simulations are conducted in OpenFOAM. In the first set of simulations the Reynolds number and the flow thermal capacity are kept constant while the Grashof number is kept nearly constant in order to determine the dependence of Grashof number on the buoyancy effects. In the second set of simulations the Reynolds number, the flow thermal capacity and temperature difference are kept constant to evaluate the performance of the heat exchanger under real working conditions. Three geometries are under investigation (0.015/ 0.03/ 0.06 m) in three different orientations. 1) Vertical Upwards (Assisted Buoyancy), 2) Vertical Downwards (Opposed Buoyancy) and 3) Horizontal.<br/>In the assisted buoyancy cases the induced buoyancy effects produce an M-shape velocity profile due to the acceleration of the flow near the walls and the deceleration of the flow in the centre of the channel. In this orientation the heat transfer coefficient and the Nusselt number increase and enhanced heat transfer is observed. On the other hand, in the opposed buoyancy cases the velocity near the walls decelerates and accelerates in the centre of the channel resulting to the formation of a Bell-shape velocity profile. Both the heat transfer coefficient and the Nusselt number in this orientation decreases and therefore deteriorated heat transfer is observed. It is also shown that in the opposed buoyancy cases the intense buoyancy effects can produce instabilities of the flow and recirculation zones inside the heat exchanger. Instead of the expected deteriorated heat transfer, the produced instabilities result in enhancement of heat transfer. In the horizontal cases, depending on the conditions, heating or cooling, the maximum streamwise velocity is shifted at the bottom surface (Heating conditions) and at the top surface (Cooling conditions). The formation of the secondary flow inside the horizontal heat exchangers produces an average increase of the heat transfer coefficient and the Nusselt number, thus enhancement of heat transfer. <br/>The performance of the printed circuit heat exchanger in the three orientations is also evaluated. It is shown that buoyancy effects can directly affect the effectiveness and the performance of the heat exchanger. In the cases where enhancement of heat transfer is observed (Assisted Buoyancy and Horizontal) the heat exchanger’s effectiveness increases. For the Opposed Buoyancy cases decrease of the effectiveness is observed due to the deterioration of heat transfer inside the heat exchanger. Important parameters when investigating buoyancy effects inside the heat exchanger are the diameter of the geometry (Directly proportional to the magnitude of the buoyancy effects) and the Grashof number (Differentiates between all the cases and can be used as an indication of the importance of the buoyancy effects). In all the aforementioned cases the overall heat transfer coefficient is affected which has a direct impact on the design (Length) and the cost of the heat exchanger. <br","Buoyancy Effects; Heat Exchanger; Flow Deformation; Heat Transfer; Assisted Buoyancy; Opposed Buoyancy; Horizontal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

By communicating the intentions of each vehicle, the vehicles can spread out over multiple stations. This thesis investigates the eect of such a routing system on the profitability of charging stations. In particular, the influence of a charging station's location on its profitability has been researched. In order to do this, a pricing model has been developed to extend the routing model. It has become clear that due to the intention-aware routing, the number of visits at stations is harder to predict, and there is not always a clear pattern to be found between the location and the number of visits.

One of the factors that can contribute to safety is the way urban spaces are designed. Previous work has highlighted the importance of natural surveillance: a type of surveillance that is a byproduct of how citizens normally and routinely use the environment. However, studying this concept is not a trivial task. Manual approaches such as observation studies are costly and time consuming and have therefore often limited themselves to smaller geographical areas. <br/><br/>In this work, we present a methodology that can automatically provide an estimate of natural surveillance by detecting building openings (i.e. windows and doors) in street level imagery and localizing them in 3 dimensions. The proposed method is able to estimate natural surveillance at the street segment level, while simultaneously being able to gather data on a whole city in a matter of hours. We then apply our method to the city of Amsterdam to analyze the relationship between natural surveillance and urban safety using the Amsterdam Safety Index. <br/><br/>We conclude that our chosen operationalization of natural surveillance (road surveillability and occupant surveillability) is correlated with decreases in high impact crime and nuisance as well as increases in perceived safety. Furthermore we provide evidence for the existence of a threshold after which extra natural surveillance is no longer associated with higher degrees of safety.","Urban safety; Natural surveillance","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/timovanasten/natural-surveillance Github repository","","","","","","","",""

With the expected increase in the earth’s population, coastal areas will experience a further increase of inhabitants. Floating city development could therefore be an interesting alternative for land-based urban expansion on land [41]. Expanding an urban settlement towards the ocean however, will make it more susceptible to extreme forces such as a tsunami waves. By generating more knowledge on how a floating structure interacts with a tsunami wave, it can show the potential value that a floating city can bring. If a floating city limits the effect of (extreme) events such as tsunamis, it can protect the coastal zone which is located near a floating city. To provide an answer to this question, this research will focus on how a floating structure can reduce the transmission of a tsunami. With the construction of an analytical model, representing the floating structure and the tsunami wave as simplistic as possible, the system can be understood more quickly. If the problem is solvable by generic programming language, this would mean that it can solve a larger range in the spectrum of the problem. The conceptual model features two options: one where the platform has no freedom of movement, the other where the platformcan move vertically. They both assume that hydrostatic pressure holds during wave propagation and a linearization of the momentum equation describing the water particle interaction. For each option, the transmitted wave height is determined based on varying the floating structure dimensions. This gives an indication on which parameters are of influence in the transmission of the wave. First, the conceptualmodel is analysed by changing the platformdraft and the length for both the motionless and the vertically moving platform. Both options are influenced most by the length of the structure. The situation with the motionless platformshows this effect earlier, by a higher wave attenuation percentage for the same platform length. Whether the draft also has an influence is strongly dependent on the value representing the length of the platform. The difference between the two platform movement options shows that the effect of changing the allowed movement of the platformis significant. Next to the reduction in transmission, the conceptual model shows signs of resonance. The moving platform option in the model is formed by a second order differential equation. Fitting this equation, resonance is evident and therefore visible for certain combinations of the platformdimensions. In addition damping is present, ensuring that there are some parts where, despite the natural frequency pointing there, no resonance occurs. The amount of damping is strongly linked to the platformlength, with a higher level of damping for a longer platformlength. Finally, the results from the conceptual model are compared to the outcome in SWASH. This numerically based model has the possibility to simulate a tsunami wave in its development towards the coast and also features a buoyancy function for structures. This comparison serves as a validation of the conceptual model. In general, the conceptual model always results in a less reduced wave attenuation percentage and can be said to be more conservative. Due to the assumptions of leaving out the non-hydrostatic pressure and a lower level of detail, a maximum of 5% deviation in both model results occured. This however, matches with the fact that it is a less detailed model and adds to the reasoning that the conceptual model provides what it is meant for. Next to the effect of the structure itself, the positioning of the structure is also of large importance. Wave height and intensity of the wave will vary due to the surrounding local coastal features. Next to that, the local water depth is determinant in compressing the wave, therefore decreasing the wave length when the water depth decreases. The maximum wave attenuation that can be achieved according to both models is 10%, considering platform dimensions and location variations. The conceptual model appears to work for which it is intended: modelling the resulting transmission between a floating structure and a linear tsunami. It is expected that modelling programs can be expanded and/or improved, so that more realistic floating structures can be modelled. However, it will remain difficult to accurately model a tsunami as it is complex in behaviour. Yet, this research brought the field one step closer to evaluating the transmission of tsunami waves when interacting with a floating structure of certain dimensions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

Several SE methods have been applied and developed for the electric power system in the transmission level in the past several decades. Meanwhile, SE for the distribution level remained in the background for a long time since the distribution networks were mainly radial with uni-directional power flows, making classical monitoring and control functions sufficient. Recently, due to the liberalization of the energy market, growing penetration of distributed generation, mainly renewable energy sources, and distributed energy resources such as electric vehicles, the distribution system has been gradually changing from passive into active grids. This requires more sophisticated monitoring and control of the distribution network via a distribution management system (DMS) to ensure optimal integration and maximize the grid hosting capacity. Since one of the key functions of DMS for real-time operation is the SE procedure, this calls for the following: (i) development of SE techniques for the distribution level, so-called distribution system state estimation (DSSE); (ii) more deployment of time-synchronized devices like phasor measurement units (PMU) that can directly measure and acquire accurate and time-aligned phasors with typical refresh rates up to 20-60 times per second.<br/><br/>Two types of DSSE algorithms were developed and implemented on the real-life 50 kV ring distribution grid composed of PMU devices by using the real-time simulation platform. The first is a static approach. The problem is formulated as a WLS problem to be solved based on the iterative Newton method, known as static state estimation (SSE). The second is a dynamic approach, which is more advanced, known as the forecasting-aided state estimation (FASE). It is one of the particular applications of the dynamic state estimation (DSE) concept based on the quasi-steady-state operating conditions. The dynamic formulation is solved using the extended Kalman filter (EKF) technique. This research aims to implement distribution system state estimation (DSSE) algorithms coupled with the auxiliary function, the so-called anomaly detection discrimination and identification (ADDI), into the distribution network. Both normal and abnormal operation scenarios of the power system are simulated to validate the algorithms.<br/><br/>The results reveal that the FASE is superior to the SSE algorithm in terms of estimation accuracy and computational time under normal operating conditions. However, under abnormal conditions, if there is no ADDI module, the performances of both algorithms are degraded significantly due to erroneous measurements. The FASE algorithm loses the system states' trajectory when sudden load change occurs. These issues point out the necessity of using the ADDI module against possible disturbances in real-life networks. In the end, the results show that the proposed FASE algorithm coupled with the ADDI module can accurately estimate the states under both normal and abnormal operations. One significant contribution is that the proposed algorithm can perform adequately fast so that it can process every high-speed measurement from PMU devices.","State estimation; weighted least square; extended kalman filter; distribution system state estimation; phasor measurement units; static state estimation; forecasting-aided state estimation; quasi-steady-state; bad data; sudden load change; anomaly detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-30","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

It affects approximately 180.000 infants per year in sub-Saharan Africa. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an advantageous imaging method to diagnose hydrocephalus and examine the amount of fluid in the brain for treatment. Unfortunately, in sub-Saharan Africa there is limited access to MRI scanners. That is why an inexpensive, portable, low-field MRI scanner is being built for the treatment of hydrocephalus in Uganda. One main restriction of this scanner is simplicity in use. Therefore, the goal is to make software for the MRI scanner that automatically makes and processes the scans. Part of the processing is the automatic segmentation of the scan into CSF and brain tissue regions. Automatic segmentation is complex due to noise and artifacts present in low-field scans. Also, automation of segmentation processes is complicated. Therefore, in this thesis project we aimed to realize the foundations for a fast, practical and automatic 3D segmentation method for brain scans obtained by the low-field MRI scanner. First, analytic segmentation methods were investigated. Multiple segmentation methods were applied to different high-field and low-field scans. Data analysis showed that Li’s method, where the intensity non-homogeneity artifact was corrected for during segmentation, improved the segmentation results evidently when the scan was affected by a distinct bias field. The major disadvantage of Li’s method was the number of parameters and initialization values that had to be chosen. Therefore, it would be complex to satisfy the automation requirement by using an analytic segmentation method. However, this led to the idea of integrating Li’s method with a neural network. A neural network would solve the problem of automation, while the incorporation of Li’s method, would lead to the fitting energy of the segmentation being minimized, which could improve the segmentation results. A neural network for the segmentation of CSF, white matter and gray matter and the prediction of the bias field was built. Unfortunately, a low-field dataset was not available to train on. Therefore, for the training of the network, artificial high-field data was used, together with its ground truth segmentations. Then, the network was trained by not only comparing the predictions with the ground truth segmentations and bias field, but also by minimizing the fitting energy of the predicted segmentation. To evaluate the segmentation results Dice scores were computed between the ground truth and the predicted segmentations. The Dice scores of the train and test set showed that the segmentation results of the neural network improved when the analytic segmentation loss was added to the network. To further investigate the promising effect of the analytic segmentation loss, the trained network was transferred to a new dataset containing infant brain scans, for which the ground truth segmentations were ignored. The network was therefore trained on this new dataset by only using the analytic segmentation loss function. Unfortunately, the results of segmentation became worse. This occurred due to non-brain tissues wrongly being segmented in the brain tissue clusters, since the signal intensities were close to each other. After the non-brain tissues were removed by brain masking, the results of segmentation for all tissues had improved. When more low-field brain scans are available the neural network should be transferred to these scans, since automatic segmentation of low-field scans is the final objective. It is recommended to first implement an automatic brain masking technique on the scans for optimal results. The promising results of Li’s method applied to the low-field scans and of transferring the neural network to the infant dataset show excellent future perspective for the fast, practical and automatic 3D segmentation of low-field scans.","Segmentation; Deep learning; MRI","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double degree in Applied Mathematics and BioMedical Engineering","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Airlines are affected by disruptions in the order of billions of dollars. Managing disruptions effectively is therefore paramount for an airline’s long-term commercial success. In spite of decision-support tools being introduced to facilitate Airline Operational Control Center (AOCC) decision-making, their adoption rate is low. For the foreseeable future, humans will unquestionably remain in the loop when it comes to AOCC<br/>disruption management and human-factors will continue to come into play in AOCC decision-making. To<br/>improve AOCC decision-making, the effects of human factors on decision-making must be well understood. Bias is a human factor that affects decision-making and a relationship bias is a bias where previous negative experiences, between two individuals, will negatively affect future interactions they may have. A lack of trust, unwillingness to concede (in negotiations) or even a reluctance to interact, are a few examples on how a relationship bias may operationally manifest itself. AOCC decision-makers collaborate with one another to arrive at a integrated solution that mitigates an airline’s disruption. If a relationship biases exist within the AOCC, this negatively affects collaboration among AOCC decision-makers the development of solutions. The effect of the relationship bias on the solutions selected to mitigate an airline’s disruptions motivates the study of the effect of the relationship bias on AOCC performance. The fact that the relationship bias on AOCC decision-making has never been research, further motivates its study. We hope to address this research gap by evaluating the effects of the relationship bias on AOCC performance. More precisely, the research objective is to evaluate the effects of the relationship bias on AOCC performance, by modelling AOCC decision-making through a Naturalistic Decision-making framework using Klein’s Extended Recognition-Primed Decision model, and modelling AOCC social decision-making and interactions<br/>using Chow’s Co-Ladder model. The methodology involves formalizing AOCC goals through a framework [Popova and Sharpanskykh, 2008] which enables us to measure organizational performance. Furthermore, it involves formally integrating Bruce’s extension [Bruce, 2011a] of Klein’s extended Recognition-primed Decision (RPD) model with Chow’s social interaction model [Chow et al., 2000]. The model is finally simulated for a scenario where a scheduled flight suffers a mechanical disruption and the performance is evaluated based on a goal satisfaction and operational costs. There are three main contributions of this research. Firstly, the individual cognition model developed makes it possible to model AOCC decision-maker’s individual cognition within the complex and dynamic AOCC environment. The second contribution is the proposed integrated model, which make it possible to integrate agent individual cognition and agent social decision-making and interactions. The third contribution is the evaluation of various possible relationship biases, which makes it possible evaluate the effect of different relationship types on AOCC performance. The research conducted led to a few interesting findings. For example, only some relationship biases lead to a significant decreased in AOCC performance, whereas other relationships have a negligible effect. Another interesting finding was that if there is a relationship bais between two agent, they are both not equally affected. The relationship bias only affects the AOCC control agent who requires information from a counterpart in order to develop their partial solution.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); de Haas, Michael (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This paper introduces a new two-stage stochastic optimisation approach for the strategic airline crew planning problem with uncertain demand. The developed model provides the airline with a cockpit crew composition plan per crew position before the flight schedule and crew demand are known. This is done by estimating future crew demand and by treating it as a stochastic variable. Historical crew demand is analysed and is assumed to follow a Beta probability distribution. Since demand at different crew positions is correlated, demand scenarios are generated from these distributions by using Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) for correlated variables. The generated scenarios are multiplied with a trend value to account for a predicted demand increase or decrease. In the<br/>first stage, the model determines the number of permanent employees, while in the second stage we consider hiring temporary crew members, the transition of crew members between compatible positions and the option to fire permanent crew members. This second stage comes with a recourse cost. Three case studies are performed for a holiday airline with both scheduled and charter flights to validate the model and test its possibilities. Results show that the model provides a cost reduction of 2.1% with respect to the airline’s current practice and a further 4.5% when affluent crew members can be fired. Results also show that the model is adjustable to assist the airline with its strategic crew plan in the post-Covid-19 recovery phase. Furthermore, it is concluded that the model is flexible and that it can handle demand fluctuations.","Two-Stage Optimization; Stochastic Optimization; Strategic Airline Planning; Scenario Generation; Latin Hypercube Sampling; Uncertain Crew Demand","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-23","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

But these narrow coastal areas experience pressure from both land and ocean side. In order to regulate sustainable coastal development, protect coastal areas from natural forces, implement ecosystem protection strategies and mitigate the impacts of climate change on coastlines, it is crucial to observe and quantify the changes along coastlines that are vulnerable to these pressures. Among the various coastal environments, the focus of this master thesis is on muddy coasts. A muddy coast is defined as a coastal depositional environment that is usually formed along an unsheltered coastline exposed to low energy conditions and that consists mainly of fine sediments, which are smaller than 63 micrometres in diameter. So far, few methods have been developed to detect sandy coasts and the rate of change of sandy coastlines at global scale, but little is known about the detection and behaviour of muddy coasts. The main objective of this thesis is to develop an automated classification method to identify muddy coasts along all the coastlines of the world. The main objective can be translated into the following research question: How can a reliable global mud classification be obtained by analysing the characteristics of muddy coasts using publicly available satellite remote sensing techniques and globally available coastal datasets? To obtain a reliable global mud classification, a method based on the spectral properties of individual mud patches and on the physical geographical characteristics of muddy coasts is proposed.<br/>The spectral properties of individual mud patches are studied at pixel level using multispectral satellite images and the physical geographical characteristics of a muddy coastal system are studied using seven globally available coastal datasets. The information from the multispectral images and the information from the coastal datasets are used as the input of the development of a hybrid coastal transect classification model, in order to obtain a more reliable and robust classification model that can detect muddy coasts at global scale. With supervised machine learning the hybrid coastal transect classification model is developed, which can classify global coastlines into five coastal types: plain beaches, muddy coasts, coastal cliffs, vegetated coasts and other. 85 percent of the muddy coasts are correctly recognised by the hybrid classification model. The accuracy of the hybrid model is still increasing significantly, meaning that the model could perform even better if more training data is added to train the model. The large amount of training and validation data at both pixel and transect level resulted in a reliable, robust global mud classification model. With the addition of the coastal datasets, the model performs better than when only the multispectral satellite images are used for classifying muddy coasts. The hybrid classification model is used to classify 100000 global coastal transects from which 12 percent are classified as muddy coasts; 60 percent of the classified muddy coasts are in the tropics.","mud coast; remote sensing; machine learning; hybrid modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-07","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

Coastal systems are understood to be hypersaline when the salinity exceeds values of 30 parts per thousand throughout the year.<br/>Being located in the arid climate region of North Africa the lagoon is subject to year-round extreme weather conditions which are dominated by high air temperatures, extreme evaporation rates, and limited precipitation. All the above in combination with the lagoon’s shallow bathymetry and restricted freshwater input causes Lake Bardawil to inhibit hypersaline conditions throughout the whole year. For Lake Bardawil this means average salinity values in the order of 42 – 51 parts per thousand. <br/>The here conducted study is the first in the line of five successive studies focusing on three-dimensional hydrodynamics. Making use of the three-dimensional hydrodynamics, the movement of the water and salt through the lagoon is considered. Here the response of the system to the extreme meteorological conditions around Lake Bardawil is investigated. The meteorological forcing causes subtidal flows in coastal waters which are responsible for the propagation of waterborne materials such as salt and pollutants.<br/>The results show that during periods of extreme meteorological forcing the response of the lagoon and its inlets is in line with expectations one might have from literature. During periods and events of high evaporation, the lagoon shows an overall increase in top and bottom layer salinity. Furthermore, the largest compensation flow due to evaporative losses of approximately 34 m3/s from the Mediterranean Sea into the lagoon is observed. While the lagoon waters act rather inert as shown for the average conditions during the month of April, it is the wind that initiates the motion. Successively the phenomenon of gravitational circulation in the deeper areas around the inlets can be observed with more saline waters propagating towards the inlets, along the bottom layer. At times, these processes cause subtidal velocities up to 0.15 m/s, which were computed in the inlets. <br/>Crucial for the overall response of Lake Bardawil to meteorological forcing is the complex lagoon geometry and shallowness. Here the tidal divide, on the verge of the western bottleneck to the eastern basin is found to be of great importance. At this location very calm flow conditions are present promoting stagnant waters. The eastern basin with its vast areal extent experiences wind-driven circulations, while the western bottleneck is bound by its narrowness and tide dominance. As a consequence, the western inlet Boughaz 1 can be described as continuously well-mixed, while its eastern counterpart, Boughaz 2, experiences periodic stratification.<br/>The application of system adaptations as proposed by The Weather Makers (TWM) proves to increase the exchange flow with the Mediterranean Sea. Here the dredging of two new inlets as well as dedicated tidal gullies through the lagoon established a more dynamic system where the inner lagoon connectivity is significantly enhanced. This is evident by the widespread presence of Mediterranean waters and the decreased salinity in a broad stretch along the barrier island as well as on the full lagoon scale. However, the lagoon waters in remote locations along the fringes of the large eastern basin remain of high salinity and show still little interaction with the tidal flow. <br","Lake Bardawil; 3D Modeling; hypersalinity; subtidal flows; Density driven currents","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","","","","Civil Engineering","","31.151774,33.142986"

It is also involved in the creation of so called telomeres, end-caps that protect chromosomes from degradation and are linked to aging. ssDNA is also used extensively in modern DNA nano-fabrication. Examples of this include DNA-origami, which can be used to create nanometer scale structures in programmable shapes and aptamers, ssDNA architectures that bind with high affinity and high specificity to a target that show great promise in use as novel therapeutics. This makes ssDNA structure an interesting topic of study. Such structural assays have been done using various techniques, including but not limited to: FRET, NMR, optical/magnetic tweezers and AFM. A downside to all these techniques is that only a couple of sequences can be measured at a time, making it difficult to sufficiently sample the vastness of sequence space available. In this thesis I demonstrate a novel technique combining single-molecule FRET combined nextgeneration high-throughput optical sequencing. I show that the two different measurements can be performed on the same chip and effectively mapped to each other. First, using traditional lowthroughput methods, the FRET efficiency was measured for a cy3-cy5 pair separated by a 8 nucleotide piece of single-stranded DNA. This was done for 12 different sequences that were selected to vary in terms of base stacking, bulkiness, hydrogen bonds and other structural factors. The experiment was repeated using the high-throughput platform. The results of the high-throughput method were compared with the results from the low-throughput method, and show a correlation<br/>factor of 0.75. These experiments show that this technique can be used as an effective tool in performing FRET measurements on a minimum of 1500 sequences up to possibly 910,000 sequences in onemeasurement, making it an exciting new tool for structural research into ssDNA.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-07","","","","","",""

Especially, the reduction of energy consumption for heating of residential dwellings has gained more and more interest in the last decades. Although some reduction has been achieved by implementing passive or active strategies and improving the thermal performance of new or renovated dwellings, the decrease is found to be lower than predicted by the energy performance models. One possible reason is that the existing thermal comfort models, the PMV and the adaptive thermal comfort model, are not appropriate for all different types of buildings and climates, resulting in inaccurate predictions of thermal comfort and leading to amounts of energy use different than the actual ones. In addition, the occupants’ behaviour, which is determined by their thermal comfort preferences might play a significant role on the energy use which needs to be explored. Therefore, the main topic of the current thesis is to explore the relationship that different parameters such as dwelling and installation characteristics, indoor and outdoor climate parameters, household and physiological characteristics as well as occupants’ behaviour have with thermal comfort and energy use.<br/><br/>A measurement campaign took place within the context of the OPSCHALER project and data related to thermal comfort perception, indoor climate and energy consumption was collected for 96 dwellings in the Netherlands during periods ranging from two to twelve months over a one-year period (2017-2018). The gathered data included both quantitative and subjective data. The quantitative data included the indoor climate data (air temperature, relative humidity, CO2, presence), the gas use and the electricity use collected through smart meters and sensors. The subjective data related to comfort was gathered by a comfort mobile application where users recorded their thermal sensation and other comfort related parameters (thermal preference, clothing, metabolic activities, actions), while questionnaires and inspections did also take place. This data was analysed using different types of graphical representation (bar charts, pie charts, stacked bar plots, scatterplots) as well as statistical tests such as chi-square tests, regression analysis, Kruskal-Wallis and correlation tests. Due to limited or unavailable data only 78 dwellings were included in the analysis, while the reliability and generalisation of the results entails some uncertainty due to the number of dwellings and data points available.<br/><br/>All in all, it was found that the thermal sensation is correlated with the four comfort related factors (thermal preference, clothing, metabolic activity, action), the indoor air temperature as well as the energy labels and the ventilation types, while only age was resulted in not being associated with thermal sensation. Indoor air temperature was found to be related with the energy label of the dwellings, but not with their ventilation type. In addition, the results indicated that the heating energy use is related with the outdoor air temperature as well as with the indoor-outdoor air temperature difference, but not with the indoor air temperature. Energy labels and ventilation types were found to be related with the heating energy use, while thermal sensation, actions and income did not show any correlation with it.<br/><br/>Based on the findings it is concluded that the adaptive thermal comfort model is more accurate and closer to the reality of a residential environment in comparison with the steady-state PMV model, where no adaptations take place. However, it is highly recommended that instead of improving the existing thermal comfort models, personalised comfort models could be developed for each single person separately by gathering data using sensors. This would help to trace all different parameters that influence the thermal comfort and the energy use as well and lead to more accurate prediction and lower actual energy use.","Thermal comfort; Energy consumption; Smart meter data; Data analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

Dynamic Programming (DP) aims to provide a framework to deal with a category of such problems, namely ones that involve sequential decision making. By dividing the original control problem into sub-problems and solving it backwards in time, from the end of the time horizon to the start, the method can compute a map of optimal solutions with respect to the initial condition. In order to divide the original problem into subproblems the DP method takes advantage of the principle of optimality, which states that a sub-solution of the optimal solution should be the optimal solution for the equivalent subproblem. In control systems, where the state and decision spaces are continuous, the original DP framework can be intractable due to the size of the discretization needed to simulate the continuous space. Therefore, efficient approximations are needed to solve such problems. One promising method is called Conjugate Dynamic Programming (CDP). The CDP algorithm is able to transform the original framework and solve problems in the conjugate domain providing a computational advantage over the standard method. In this work, we aim to improve and extend the setting under which the CDP algorithm operates, thus providing a more concrete advantage over standard method . In that regard, we will extract the optimal control actions from within the CDP algorithm, eliminating the need for solving an extra optimization problem for their computation. In addition, we will introduce a different interpolation technique that can outperform the current one, in certain scenarios, thus granting the user more choice when solving a decision making problem.","Dynamic Programming; Legendre Transform; Approximate Dynamic Programming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

This paper demonstrates how an RFID overhead system can be designed that has 98\% reading performance for inventory. Furthermore is showed how this access to better information can already lead to a reduction between 30-50\%, depending on the type of distribution the demand follows. If there are obvious seasonal trends, then the better information in combination with optimal control can have a reduction of 90\% in disposed products with the same availability of products. These reductions are significantly sufficient to conclude that the benefits comfortably break-even with the investments from the inventory system.","RFID; Optimal Control; short shelf-life; inventory management; Efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

Precipitation is crucial for agriculture in countries like Ghana, where ~95% of farming is rainfed. Accurate rainfall observations are limited in Ghana. The sparse rain gauge network and the lack of weather radars make remote sensing methods a potentially attractive alternative source of rainfall data. Radar satellites, such as Sentinel-1, emit radiation that passes through the atmosphere and is scattered back to the satellite by the Earth’s surface. The backscatter measured by the satellite is correlated with the wetness of the soil but the existence of vegetation hinders straightforward quantification of soil moisture. By choosing sites with a simple and, more or less, constant phenology, it may be possible to eliminate the effect of vegetation on backscatter. Soccer field may qualify as sites with such a simple and constant phenology. The main objective of this study is to use the Sentinel-1 data over soccer fields and assess them as rainfall detectors. A machine learning approach will be used to reach this objective. This research assessed the stability and the generalization capabilities of a classification model (rain/no rain). The model was trained with and applied to different locations and periods (2019 &amp; 2020). Ground observations from 53 Ghanaian (TAHMO) and 1 Greek stations were used. Soccer fields in Ghana and Greece were selected and their suitability as rainfall detectors was checked based on the correlation between modeled soil moisture and backscatter strength. The rain/no rain classification of the soccer fields was made with a stacked classifier that was trained and validated with both spaceborne and ground data. The classifier was tested on six different datasets from Greece and Ghana 2019 and 2020. The stability of the model was assessed by a Leave-p out cross-validation approach. The generalization in space was tested by using different environments. The generalization in time was tested by using different time periods. The results showed that the classification was stable. The minimum and maximum performances for the different testing datasets were 0.43 to 0.85. The median performance of the algorithm in Ghana for 2020 is 67%. The stacked classifier was found to have the best performance compared to other classifiers. Finally, the performance of the stacked classifier was competitive in comparison with the performance of the well-known IMERG algorithm. The study showed that there is a potential for using radar backscatter from suitable fields to detect rainfall. The classifier is stable and can be generalized in time and space under certain conditions.","Sentinel-1; Rainfall Detection; Machine Learning; Google Earth Engine; TAHMO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","TWIGA","7.944325, -1.022833"

However, a potential energy barrier needs to be overcome before this interwell motion can occur. If there is no interwell motion, the power output will be severely reduced. A topology optimization is performed on a beam so that the buckling loads approach almost equality. This leads to lowering of the potential barrier and thus interwell motion is eased. Numerical simulations and experimental measurements show that the stiffness can be reduced by a factor of 10 by removing material. Another topology optimization is performed to increase the stiffness.

These biological examples illustrate the effective utilization of hard rigid and soft flexible materials in particular. The proper composition of such hard-soft materials exceeds the structural limitations found in their individual material counterparts. The manufacturing of hard-soft material structures is especially relevant today due to recent developments in additive manufacturing that certify the technology with local material-specific functionalities and enlarged design spaces. However, to unravel the next generation of unprecedented structural performance, today’s state of engineering and research has yet to overcome the challenges encountered in multi-material design. The dissimilar material junctions within multi-material structures are prone to load transmissions, so they carry a crucial structural responsibility. Therefore, the interface design process must be subjected to representative interface characteristics which are often overlooked in the literature. In this work, we present a method to characterize and model multi-material structures to provide an optimal interface design in terms of the multi-material’s joining strength.<br/><br/>We consider the joining strength of 3D printed hard Verocyan and soft Agilus30 by its fundamental joining principles of material bonding and mechanical interlocking. Material bonding is characterized by the extent of allowable traction between the two materials. We experimentally quantify the loading-dependent critical stress at which interface debonding initiates through mapping of digital image correlation deformations on a finite element model. We numerically define the extent of mechanical interlocking by the force required to achieve an unlocked multi-material state. The finite element models contain experimentally calibrated elastoplastic and hyperelastic material models to represent the hard and soft material behaviors, respectively. Subsequently, a structural optimization based on a genetic algorithm iteratively updates a constrained parametrized interface design according to material bonding and mechanical interlocking objectives.<br/><br/>The numerical evaluations of calibrated hard and soft material characteristics show good agreement in structural response with their real-world equivalents. The digital image correlation deformation method successfully acquires the loading-dependent critical stresses at which the two materials debond from one another. The finite element analyses of individual joining principles adequately determine a design’s material bonding and mechanical interlocking performances. The optimization’s objective function value evolution suggests a trade-off in joining contributions where mechanical interlocking maximizes performance in more shallow, wider interface designs, whereas material bonding performs better in narrow, deeper ones. Validation experiments illustrate the dominating contribution of material bonding in A30-VC structures. Optimizing for two distinct hypotheses of interface failure equations shows no significant difference in physical joining strength. However, they do support the concept that the interface characteristics affect the optimal joining shape. Despite adequate estimation of the individual joining principle performances, a more accurate approximation of the multi-material physical joining strength necessitates the consideration of the effects induced by the interaction of material bonding and mechanical interlocking. Nonetheless, this work underlines the emphasis regarding interface characteristics in the promising structures of multi-material.","hard-soft interfaces; additive manufacturing; Structural Optimization; Experimental","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-03","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Biomaterials and Tissue Biomechanics","",""

Measuring contact mechanics of the mosquito is technically challenging due to the small length and force scales. Because of this, many aspects of blood feeding are still poorly understood. We developed an optic measurement set-up that enables the observation of contact dynamics when mosquitoes are host-seeking and blood feeding. Using frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) we were able to record contact dynamics of freely flying mosquitoes at a spatial resolution of 25µm2 per pixel and a temporal resolution of 500 Hz. While useful given its non-invasiveness, FTIR as a technique may lack reproducibility due to the subjectivity in defining an intensity threshold that signifies contact. At these time and length scales, low signal-to-noise ratio may amplify variations in contact areas measured given selections in intensity thresholds. We developed a systematic approach to select contact thresholds for large image sets, allowing for standardized high-throughput FTIR studies. Our results suggest that probing behaviour, characterized as rapid pulling of the fore and mid legs towards the body during contact, might be less related to surface evaluation via sensing than previously thought, and more related to establishing sufficient grip to insert the proboscis. This new perspective illustrates the need for further investigation into the contact dynamics of mosquitoes during blood feeding to understand the mechanisms that enable the transmission of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, between hosts.","Mosquitoes; Malaria; Adhesion; imaging; host-seeking; Blood feeding; Dipteran flight","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Bioelectronics","",""

In this thesis, neuroimaging data acquired with fUS at Center for Ultrasound and Brain imaging at Erasmus MC (CUBE) is processed. Due to the fact that fUS data is inherently multidimensional, we propose using tensor decompositions, tensors here referring to generalizations of matrices, for processing of fUS data.<br/><br/>We define two main research questions regarding fUS data analysis. First, for compressing the large-scale raw beamformed fUS data, we apply sequentially truncated multilinear singular value decomposition. This compression method is compared against ensemble averaging used in the conventional pipeline, and shown to provide a higher compression rate while preserving more temporal resolution for specific ranks. Furthermore, it is observed to denoise the data, resulting in a more precise extraction of the active region of Superior Colliculus using correlation maps.<br/><br/>Secondly, in order to investigate the advantage of multi-slice processing that incorporates 3-D informa- tion, blind-source separation methods are applied to single slice and two-slice fUS recordings. After applying independent component analysis (ICA) to the matricized data as a benchmark method, block term decompo- sition (BTD) is used as a way of processing the data as it is, in its natural 3-D structure without vectorization. Through a simulation study, it is shown that the method is able to separate two images even when using a rank that is lower than the true rank, as well as in noisy conditions. Subsequently, BTD is applied to real 4-D fUS data formed by concatenation of slices in a new dimension. However, this method is seen to perform worse than single slice ICA in terms of extracting the active regions. In order to amplify common information between slices, a new 3-D data structure is then formed by summing the fUS data of two slices. For extraction of this common information, a BTD is then applied to the aggregate 3-D data. The findings of this decomposition reveal that both taking a longer portion of single slice data and incorporating the second slice helps to achieve better results.","neuroimaging; block term decomposition; independent component analysis (ICA); blind source separation; compression; multilinear singular value decomposition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in a fast-evolving world with increasing environmental issues, inequalities and crises, conferences seem to only change slowly. Besides the irresponsibility towards the environment, due to the large usage of resources and vast amounts of travelling to conferences, also the exclusion of groups of people are still widely a result of the current conference system. <br/>Therefore, we need to investigate the context of the future conference in order to design a better conference of tomorrow.<br/><br/>This graduation project dives deep into the purpose of scientific conferences and how this purpose can evolve in the future to propose a new visionary concept. It investigates changes within the domain of the academic society and its conferences but also takes into account factors that can have an impact on the domain, such as climate change, societal and technological developments or the COVID-19 pandemic. The result of this project is a new conference vision that proposes design interventions within the organizational and interaction level in order to create a more inclusive but also impactful conference.<br/>The report presents the investigation for designing a future experience for academic conferences. The exploration revealed three main driving forces that can play a big role within the world of conferences: <br/><br/>1. The growing relevance and awareness of academics’ impact on climate change and on society will continue to increase academics’ sense of responsibilities. There will be more focus on creating knowledge and doing so in a meaningful and respectful way towards environment and society.<br/>2. The growing relevance and awareness of inclusion will highly impact the social value. The community is going to become a safe and welcoming space for people to celebrate uniqueness and distinctiveness rather than fit and sameness.<br/>3.

This shall help to make it easier for people to participate (inclusion) as well as creating a more effective space for knowledge creation (impact).

Articulating instruments can regain some of the manoeuvrability that is lost by using a small incision. However, in endoscopic neurosurgery such articulating devices do currently not exist, due to scale dependent assembling and manufacturing challenges. We explored the use non-assembly additive manufacturing to circumvent the infeasible assembly and enable production of a 2 mm articulating forceps. Four different designs were made to explore different levels of articulation intricacy, with a distinction in planar or spatial, and concentrated or distributed bending. Eligible 3D printers capable of printing surgical instrument-sized parts including sub 2 mm mechanisms need relatively large clearances between moving parts. This poses a serious challenge that we solved by using compliant grasping and bending mechanisms. Three out of four designs were successfully 3D printed on a 5 mm and 2 mm scale, and their geometrical requirements were validated. The designs fitted through a 2.2 mm dummy trocar, reached bending angles up to 70°, and an forceps opening angle of 40°. The distributed planar and distributed spatial bending design were deemed infeasible due to their lack of bending stiffness upon external forces. The two remaining designs proof that 3D printed non-assembly forceps for neuroendoscopy are possible, with planar and spatial articulation. With these articulating devices, many more neurosurgeries could be executed in a minimally invasive manner. However, simulated surgical tasks should be performed to further test the designs, before they could be commercialised.","Non-Assembly Mechanisms; Additive Manufacturing; 3D Printing; Minimally Invasive Surgery; Neurosurgery; Surgical Instrument","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Greenhouses have proven to be very effective in increasing crop yield since they offer a sheltered environment that can be controlled. Greenhouse growers need to take care of many processes, among which are maximising the crop yield while using as little resources as possible and controlling the indoor climate. An approach to alleviating demand for experienced growers is to automate processes within the greenhouse that aid in setpoint generation and setpoint tracking. Existing literature has presented multi-level architectures to cope with the two different timescales on which the two greenhouse subsystems act, i.e., the crop and greenhouse indoor climate subsystem. Current approaches in literature employ model-based techniques, which need tedious calibration<br/>per considered situation due to the influences of the local weather, environment and highly non-linear underlying physical processes. Therefore, these model-based approaches are scarcely used in the horticultural sector. Thus, this thesis proposes a data-driven control scheme that deals with long-term crop production control while taking into account resource usage.<br/><br/>The proposed control scheme uses temporal and functional decomposition of the overall problem to accommodate the different timescales on which the greenhouse indoor climate subsystem and crop subsystem act. With the focus on the entire growing season, this thesis emphasises the importance of the climate strategy for crop production control. The aim of this thesis is threefold. Firstly, a non-linear simulator model for the crop dynamics has<br/>been selected, adapted, and calibrated, using the Autonomous greenhouse challenge (AGC) dataset. Secondly, the overall crop production control problem has been decomposed into a hierarchical structure, including two subproblems with different objectives, acting on different timescales and using different system representations. The communication protocol between the two layers has been determined, and the setpoint tracking controller is established for the lower layer and tested on a benchmark temperature reference trajectory. Thirdly, the Data-enabled<br/>predictive control (DeePC) algorithm is leveraged for the crop production control problem and compared in simulation against a conventional Economic model predictive control (EMPC) setpoint generating controller. Both use the aforementioned established setpoint tracking controller for controlling the greenhouse towards the generated climate strategies. <br/><br/>In simulation, it is shown that the DeePC setpoint generating controller results in a climate strategy that results in a lower crop yield by 1.51% when compared to the EMPC climate strategy and 0.54% less when compared to the predefined benchmark reference trajectory. Furthermore, the resource usage needed for the climate strategy proposed by the DeePC setpoint generating controller uses 1.75% more heating resources when compared to the EMPC setpoint generating controller and 11.1% more when compared to a predefined temperature setpoint trajectory. The DeePC climate strategy results in 7.92% and 5.27% less electricity use when compared to the EMPC and predefined benchmark climate strategy, respectively. The DeePC climate strategy CO2 usage is 11.4% less when compared to the EMPC climate strategy CO2 usage and 20.8% less when compared to the predefined benchmark climate strategy. The decrease in resource usage compensates for the lower crop yield of the DeePC climate<br/>strategy. According to the metric of net economic profit, the DeePC generated climate strategy outperforms the benchmark climate strategy and EMPC climate strategy.","deepc; crop control; Hierarchical Abstraction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Climate change is a major problem for today's society, which has a huge impact on water safety issues. Recent IPCC scenarios show that sea level rises of 1m by 2100 and 2m beyond 2200 should be seriously considered. Several scenarios show an increase in river discharge of between 10 and 20 percent of the Rhine generated by extreme precipitation by the year 2050. The combination of the sea level rise and the increase in river discharge has consequences for the flood risk in the Netherlands. The area where most people live, about 3,5 million, and where most of the gross national product, around 65 percent, is earned is the area of dikering 14. This thesis determines how the flood risk changes for future climate change scenarios, considering a sea level rise up to 2m and an associated increase in river discharge. One base case scenario with the current situation and four future scenarios with a sea level rise up to 2m with increments of 0,5m were evaluated. The river dikes along the trajectories of the Hollandse Ijssel, Nieuwe Maas and Nieuwe Waterweg and the dunes between Hoek van Holland and Ijmuiden were assessed and the consequences of flooding due to a dune or dike breach were investigated for all scenarios. <br/><br/>Flood risk is determined by the probability of failure of a flood defence and the consequences in case of a flood, which are expressed in economic damage, casualties and affected persons. The influence of climate change on the probability of flooding of 8 river dike profiles was investigated by assessing the failure mechanism overtopping and overflow, using a relationship between height shortage and the probability of failure. The safety of the dunes was evaluated using the Duros-plus model, with which dune erosion calculations were made. The results show that climate change has a big impact on the probability of failure, which is highest for the trajectory along the Hollandse Ijssel with a probability of failure of 1/370.000 per year in the current situation and 1/170 per year in the scenario involving a 2 m sea level rise. Although the failure probabilities of the dunes are very low in the current situation, the influence of sea level rise is shown for the dunes with failure probabilities that are a factor of 2000-3000 higher in a scenario with 2m sea level rise compared to the base case scenario. <br/><br/>For determining the consequences, both existing flood scenarios for the river side and new flood scenarios for the seaside were used. The new flood scenarios show the effect of sea level rise on the increased flood extent caused by a dune breach for each scenario. The potential economic damage, which is determined by the flood depth, damage curves and the land use map, is highest for a dike failure along the Hollandse Ijssel, as the highest flood depths are reached in these deep polders. The highest number of casualties, 7900, determined by the mortality rates based on flood depth, flow velocity, rise rate and evacuation factor, are expected in case of a dike failure along the Nieuwe Maas, as the densely populated cities of Rotterdam and Schiedam are flooded. By assigning monetary values for casualties and affected persons, the total damage is determined, to which the damages resulting from casualties and affected persons contribute most. <br/><br/>After determining the costs of several reinforcement projects, these costs and the potential total damage were used as input in a cost-benefit analysis, where economic optimums were determined expressed in a probability of failure and associated investment costs. The conclusion is that it is economically efficient to reinforce all flood defences except for the trajectory along the Nieuwe Waterweg in case of a scenario corresponding to 2m sea level rise. It was also examined whether the economic optimums met the requirement that everyone should have a maximum risk of dying due to a flood of 10^-5 per year. A total length of 40,5 km river dikes and 63,5 km of dunes will need to be reinforced, for which the costs of reinforcing the river dikes are significantly higher per km than for the dunes, approximately 20 and 3,8 million euros/km respectively. The total estimated costs determined in this study are around 1 billion euros for a 2m sea level rise scenario, but these costs for keeping the area safe will be a factor of 2-3 higher, as the method used for determining the costs of river dikes leads to an underestimation compared to the costs in reality. In addition, hydraulic structures and future subsidence are not included, which will also lead to higher total costs. With these investments the flood risk will remain acceptable and the river dikes and dunes will continue to offer sufficient protection against floods with a total potential damage of 230 billion euros, consisting of 70 billion euros in economic damage, 20.000 casualties and 2,5 million affected persons. <br","Flood Risk; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Loss of life estimation; Probability of failure; Reinforcements","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

As land is becoming scarce, the use the water surface will contribute to ease this scarcity. Therefore in recent years, floating structures covering large areas have been developed, also called flexible floating structures.<br/>In this project the focus is set on the mooring system very flexible floating structures (VFFS). At the TU Delft, two towing tanks can be used to investigate the mooring system of VFFS, however first a reliable measuring system is required that is able to examine a specific part of the mooring system. Conventional setups that measure the mooring forces consist of large instruments, as these instruments only have a small effect on their investigated structure (vessels). The response of VFFS is dominated by elastic deformations and differs from conventional rigid structures. For VFFS, these type of instruments will have a large effect on the structure motions and thus these conventional setups cannot be used. Therefore, a new measuring system is required to conduct small scale experiments with VFFS, and the following objective is formulated: Develop an instrumented mooring system for VFFS at model scale for the towing tank at the TU Delft and determine its accuracy.<br/>A new concept is developed in this project. This concept resulted from an extensive concept development where all functions of the system were analyzed. With the use of a Morphological Chart and a Multi Criteria Analysis the best concept was selected. For this concept, it was determined that the focus should be on the sensor configuration and calibration procedure.<br/>First, the optimal sensor configuration of the concept was specified by analysing the working principle of the concept. Second, the calibration procedure was further analyzed. From this analysis, three calibration procedures were developed: the single sensor calibration matrix, the full fixed calibration matrix and the full rotated calibration matrix. From literature and theory, it was not possible to determine in advance what calibration procedure should be selected, and therefore the performance of the procedures were verified with experiments. All calibration procedures were executed, whereafter the performance of the different procedures were compared. The two main considerations for the comparison were the accuracy and the usability of the procedures. After performing the comparison, the main conclusion was that the full upright calibration procedure is the optimal procedure.<br/>To verify the concept under realistic conditions, an example application was performed in the towing tank No.1 at the TU Delft. By doing this, the concept has proven to be suitable to measure the mooring force and transform them into usable data.<br/>In this project a new concept was developed into a working system. This system forms an excellent base for extensive research into the mooring system of VFFS, and is a good addition to the measurement instruments for the towing tank at the TU Delft. It is concluded that the system is able to measure the mooring forces and the direction. The accuracy of the system still has to be improved, and with additional research the working concept can be further developed.","Very Flexible Floating Structures; Model testing; force sensors; Multi axial force; calibration; sensor development; Model scale","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research aims to compare the accuracy and efficiency between the applications of 22 selected reliability methods in 9 selected geotechnical engineering problems with various number of independent variables and modes of failure. The accuracy of the reliability methods are determined based on the Probability of Failure (Pf) errors, while the efficiency is based on the number of realizations (N) each method needs. The Monte Carlo Simulation is found to be the most accurate method despite its shortcomings in efficiency (ranked as the least efficient). Moreover, the FOSM method is found to be the most efficient despite its serious shortcoming in accuracy where it is also ranked as the most inaccurate. However, putting both accuracy and efficiency into account, the AK-MCS 0 order is proven to be the best method when applied to the discussed geotechnical engineering problems.

(mentor); Lizy-Destrez, Stéphanie (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Satellite swarms are an emerging mission architecture which offer a flexible, robust alternative to traditional space missions. Drawing inspiration from naturally occurring swarms such as honey bees or ant colonies, satellite swarms consist of individual satellite agents working cooperatively towards a common goal. Distributed multi-agent space systems are, however, inherently problematic from the point of view of space sustainability. Given the increasingly likely prospect of operational satellite swarms, and considering that mitigating the build up of space debris is necessary to preserve our access to space and space-enabled services, the question of how to sustainably operate satellite swarms requires answering. This report presents two projects to explore how satellite swarms could be made more sustainable. In the first project we explored cooperative localisation in a satellite swarm. Using the well-studied Starlink satellite internet mega-constellation as a model swarm, we established the potential performance of cooperative localisation between 1584 Starlink satellites and 87 ground stations by calculating the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) at 573 simulated time steps. Our results show that the average Root Mean Square Error for localising the Starlink satellites has a constant value of approximately 10.15 m and varies between a maximum of 36.5 m and a minimum of around 2m. This result is determined primarily by the geometry of the Starlink mega-constellation and the characteristics of the inter satellite links, and gives values comparable to GNSS hardware currently on satellites. The values are also in agreement with previous research. In the second project, we introduce a satellite health indicator, a composite indicator capturing the health of a swarm satellite. We also present ongoing research modelling swarm satellites with Markov chains using CubeSat subsystems as a basis for the subsystems of swarm satellites. We also present an analysis of historical CubeSat failures using data from the CGEE CubeSat database, which shows that 18.1% of all CubeSats launched currently present a risk to space sustainability. We conclude both projects with a discussion of next steps and future research in these emerging topics.","satellite networks; Satellite formation; Swarm Satellite Constellation; space sustaianbility","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/simulated-megaconstellation-ephemerides Starlink Constellation Position Data","","2022-02-28","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In the awareness of the complex multi-layered phenomena of change in the public sector, this deductive research adopted the theory of Kuipers et al. (2014) and implemented it for a holistic multiple case study. For the concretization of the holistic multiple case study, a total of three cases over different time periods, from Rijkswaterstaat and the Water Authority Delfland have been reviewed. In this, the multi-method qualitative research strategy has been adopted, where both secondary and primary data have been gathered with respect to these three cases. At length, both types of data have been analysed using the concept-driven analysis procedure, modelled accordingly to the five-factor framework of Kuipers et al. (2014). Substantively, the conclusion of this research is two-folded; that public authorities are driven by extrinsic as well as intrinsic drivers. Firstly, in two of the three cases, the effects of the (external) contextual factors could be seen as direct triggers in the process of change. The significance of extrinsic drivers was already traditionally known and corresponds primarily with the institutionalist perspective. Essentially; the predominate presumption that changes are ‘made to’ organizations. Be it that this research found that the conjunction of these triggering factors was less intricated than priorly expected, only one or two macro external factors per case. Secondly, in the remaining case - the intrinsic motivation of the organisation could be seen as the principal driver of the change. This finding is in accordance with the change management perspective. A perspective with its roots in private sector research, that only recently emerged as a theory for public sector research. Principally, this rational-adaptive theory places significant attention on the intentional actions of agents. Herein, the main attention is focused on the roles, activities and behaviours of individuals, rather than an orientation that highlights the personality, character or traits of the leader (Burke, 2017). In view of this, however - this research found that for one case - the intrinsic drive from an organisation was predominately based on the personal believe system of an individual leader. Therefore, for future research, the objectivistic-based positivism philosophy that underlies both previously mentioned perspectives - should be complemented with more a subjectivistic-based research philosophies such as the social constructivism theory. In sum, future research that aims to identify driving factors for specific changes at public authorities, specifically for first and second order changes – should focus on both the macro level and micro level, in order to minimize the possibility of drawing unintentional preclusions. Therein, striking a balance between subjective and objective (primary) data.","Change; Contract strategy; DESTEP; Public Paradigms; Infrastructure sector; Change Management; Institutionalist perspective; Process of change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The length of the available observations is an important aspect when performing EVA. It is generally known that more available data results in better estimates with less uncertainties. The main objective of this research report was to assess what the influence of the length of the observations is when inferring rare events. This was done by first analyzing the sensitivity of inferred return levels from synthetic data from three known distributions. Also, three case studies were analyzed to observe the sensitivity of inferred return levels and return periods from the observations. The results of the analyses were that a larger sample size generally leads to a higher confidence in the estimates of inferred return levels from synthetic data. However, there will always remain some uncertainty associated with the estimates. The confidence in the inferred return levels from observations also generally increase for an increasing sample size. However, this can not always be observed and other aspects can be more dominant than an increasing sample size. No correlation could be observed between the sample size and the inferred return periods. The conclusion of the research was that, while there is a positive correlation between the sample size and the confidence in the estimates, there will always remain some uncertainties. It is therefore important to always communicate the uncertainties associated with estimates.","Extreme value analysis; Uncertainty; Rare events; Sample size","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

This research presents a first impulse to incorporate climate change uncertainty and interdependence into the decision-making process. Under the scope of a case study, the renewal of a pumping station, relevant interdependencies are identified. Next to the original design alternatives, new design alternatives are created based on the theory of Adaptivity, Engineering Options and Modularity. The influence of the alternatives on the interdependencies is assessed, and their life cycle costs are calculated. The findings are presented in a proposal for a decision-support framework. This research shows that incorporating interdependence and climate change uncertainty makes inherently flexible design alternatives more desirable than static design alternatives. For the identified interdependencies, the adaptive design alternatives have a more positive effect.

The human-produced CO2 is the largest contributor to global warming, which drives the climate change. Many countries around the world have committed to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the next coming decades. Power-to-X (PtX) technologies in combination with carbon capture technologies might contribute to a carbon-neutral future, since they can convert electricity and captured carbon to synthetic gases (e.g. hydrogen, methane), chemicals (e.g. propylene, ethylene) and liquids (e.g. methanol).<br/><br/>This thesis aims to research the techno-economic potential of a system that is able to produce methanol at industrial scale via a PtX scheme, which is coupled with carbon capture technologies. The system of this thesis consists mainly of PV panels, an alkaline water electrolyzer, a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) CO2 electrolyzer and a single-stage Lurgi quasi-isothermal methanol reactor. The feedstocks for this system are water and carbon dioxide (captured from the flue gases of a cement plant).<br/><br/>The whole production process of this system has been designed and modelled in such a way, that both electrolyzers can follow the intermittent power supply from the PV panels. The electrolyzer's dynamic operation is controlled by a deterministic control logic, which takes into account the variable energy efficiencies of the electrolyzers and the intermittent power output of the PVs. Moreover, it has been decided that the methanol synthesis is based on the CO2 hydrogenation process, which converts syngas (i.e. a mixture of CO, CO2 and H2) into methanol with the use of the methanol reactor. Hydrogen is produced by the water electrolyzer and the captured CO2 is reduced to CO by the CO2 electrolyzer.<br/><br/>As far as the sizing and production results are concerned, the system is able to produce 3.999 kT of methanol per year, consuming 2,147 tons of CO2 per year and requiring an energy input of 30.3 GWh/year. The installed peak PV power is equal to 18 MWp and 99.60% of their energy yield is exploited by the system (the rest is dumped). Due to the implemented control logic, the operating energy efficiency range for the CO2 electrolyzer is 45.07-55.32% and for the H2O electrolyzer is 75.83-81.71%.<br/><br/>In terms of economic analysis, the proposed system requires a total capital investment (TCI) of 195.7 M€ and its operational expenditures are equal to almost 2 M€ per year. The performed cash flow analysis showed that the system has an annual gross profit of € 855,535 per year. Despite the yearly profit, it was found that the system's net present value (NPV) is negative and equal to -179.5 M€ at the end of its lifetime (i.e. 20 years). Also, the levelized cost of methanol (LCOM) was found to be equal to 4.44 €/kg, which is almost 10 times higher than the current market price of methanol. Therefore, such an investment would be economically unfeasible, despite its environmental benefit, because it would result in a net loss of capital.<br","CO2-to-methanol; Green Methanol; Power-to-X (PtX); Water electrolysis; Carbon utilization; CO2 electrolysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

While IWT has been identified to make goods transport more CO2- efficient, the long-term viability of the Dutch IWT sector is at risk.<br/><br/>Currently, Dutch IWT businesses benefit from increased demand for transport capacity during climate change induced periods of low river depth by being able to charge higher prices to shippers, thereby increasing short term profits. This thesis research project concludes that this behaviour is unsustainable due to the disregard for providing price competitive and reliable services to shippers, which will ultimately damage the reputation of the Dutch IWT sector. This can lead to shippers choosing other modes of transport, which will damage the long-term viability of IWT demand.<br/><br/>A lack of evident optimal climate adaptation measures that would better guarantee the long-term viability of an IWT business under any climate scenario is one of the reasons why IWT businesses have thus far been hesitant towards implementing climate adaptation measures. This thesis research project studies the potential of using a robust decision analysis in supporting IWT businesses’ decision-making on climate adaptation measures that could safeguard the long- term viability of the Dutch IWT sector.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The finite element method (FEM) is a numerical method that is used to approximate the solutions to partial differential equations when solutions in the classical sense do not exist or are very hard to find. The method is used to solve problems that are relevant for industries like the automotive industry, the petroleum industry, and the aviation industry. The finite element method uses a discretisation of the problem domain into sub domains and uses a variational form involving trial and test functions to arrive at a system of equations. For problems that are advection dominated (for problems with a large Péclet number), the FEM solutions start to oscillate and produce inaccurate results near boundary layers. In the past finite element schemes have been developed that use so called optimal test functions to reduce the oscillations of the solution and increase the accuracy of the method.<br/>In this thesis an attempt was made to use Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) to generate optimal test functions for the steady state advection-diffusion equation in 1D and 2D to improve the stability/accuracy of the finite element method. An advantage of using neural networks is that once trained they can take in problem specific parameters like the diffusion coefficient and produce optimal test functions for a wide range of problems almost instantaneously. It was found that the applicability of the DeepONets in this context varies and depends on the weak formulation for which the DeepONet generated optimal test functions are implemented, as the finite element method solution can be very sensitive to small perturbations in the optimal test functions. The approach does look promising as a DeepONet was able to improve the finite element method significantly in a 2D setting by generating optimal test functions, while using the problem specific diffusion coefficient as a variable.","FInite Element Method; Deep Operator Networks; VPINNs; PINNs; Optimal Test Functions; Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin Method; Petrov-Galerkin Method; Deep Learning; advection-diffusion equation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Correljé, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Societal concern is growing regarding the effect fossil energy use has on our planet and societies. Many promising sustainable energy solutions, like hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and district heating, require long-distance distribution and transmission through networked infrastructure. Often, existing infrastructure can be repurposed to reduce overall network costs. Examples are the repurposing of natural gas infrastructure for hydrogen transport or the repurposing of oil pipelines for transport of CO2. This repurposing of existing infrastructure is expected to have a major influence on future network layouts, which uncovers an interesting research question. What is a suitable network optimisation approach that aids in the design of costeffective future network layouts, taking into account repurposing of existing infrastructure?. Reviewing the available literature on network optimisation modelling in relation to repurposing of existing infrastructure, we find that Geometric Graph Theoretical methods are the most promising approach to the problem at hand. Mixed Integer (Non-)linear programming approaches are computationally heavy, and do not provide the flexibility necessary to gain quick insights into design implications. Agent Based models provide more than enough flexibility, but no suitable methodology for integrating repurposing was found. A network optimisation model by Heijnen et al. (2020) is selected for adaption because of its already integrated existing pipeline functionality. Limitations of the existing model are that it does not take into account costs related to the repurposing of existing infrastructure, and that it can not work with cycles in the network. These cycles, defined by a multitude of paths between two points, are necessary because existing infrastructure often contains cycles, and the optimal addition of new infrastructure can include cycles that contain existing infrastructure. To address these limitations, first, repurposing costs were integrated into the objective function of the model. A novel variable called the repurposing cost coefficient is used to allow model users to input the cost of repurposing relative to the building of new pipelines. Three novel heuristics are also introduced. The network simplex repurposing heuristic creates optimal network layouts for a single moment in time and allows for cycles in the network to be created if this is the most optimal layout. When investigating supply and demand patterns that differentiate over time, the heuristic is supplemented by the timesteps merged heuristic that combines the networks created for each separate moment in time into one network. Finally, the joined edges heuristic removes redundancies from the network to create a cost optimised network layout. The model was unit tested by applying it to small experiments, and the basic functionalities of the model were verified...","repurposing; network optimisation; Hydrogen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

InSAR is a geodetic technique that estimates millimeter-level relative displacement time-series in an opportunistic network of a multitude of coherent points on the Earth’s surface, in a local datum. GNSS uses ground-based instrumentation to acquire time-series data over a limited number of specific and well-defined points in a known geodetic datum.The Integrated Geodetic Reference Station (IGRS) is designed to combine these (and other) techniques into one common instrument, establishing an integrated benchmark, i.e., a GNSS antenna and two radar corner reflectors, ensuring an identical kinematic behavior. This enables a geodetic datum connection, effectively enabling the InSAR results to be represented in a common geodetic datum, instead of a free network.However, the efficacy of the IGRS has not yet been proven, i.e., a thorough analysis of the first empirical results of an IGRS network has not yet been performed.Here we show that by using three years of data from a spatio-temporal network of 29 IGRS stations in an area of 60×60 km, and 742 independent Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) acquisitions, we reach a high level of agreement, demonstrating that IGRS can be used to connect InSAR information products to a well-defined geodetic datum.By using an Overall Model Test with a significance level of 5% we found that 96% of the double-difference arcs in time and space, sustain the null hypothesis that both the InSAR and the GNSS results stem from the same distribution. We found that the main reason for rejecting the null hypothesis for the remaining 4% of the double-difference arcs is that the results of both the InSAR and the GNSS are affected by a leakage of signal from the functional to the stochastic model. For the InSAR observations there is inadequately modeled atmosphere leaking into the stochastic model, while for the GNSS it appears that the precision estimate of the periodically moving stations is worse than the non-periodically moving stations, which suggests that the stochastic model is influenced by the the functional model.In the end, this study proved the efficacy of the IGRS to connect different geodetic datums, and this enables the InSAR results to be integrated in a well-defined geodetic datum.","Integrated Geodetic Reference Stations; InSAR; GNSS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

This creates problems regarding the responsibilities and the distribution of risks of all parties involved in the project. It is therefore of great importance that the contracts and agreements made are clear and of practical use. In the Netherlands, the UAV-GC 2005 is used to regulate this. However, the UAV-GC 2005 turned out to contain several weak points and that is why in February 2021 a consultation version of the UAV-GC 2020 was presented to improve the UAV-GC. The question according to experts is whether this improvement will solve the problems concerning the distribution of risks and responsibilities. A possible solution to the problems is the NEC 4 ECC contract from the United Kingdom. <br/>Therefore, the following research question was asked: <br/><br/>“What elements or characteristics of the NEC 4 ECC could be of added value to the UAV-GC 2020 for the Dutch construction market, and could possibly complement and be implemented in the UAV-GC 2020?” <br/><br/>During the study it appeared that the structure and clarity in the UAV-GC 2020 can be improved, especially in the division of risks and tasks, which can be better structured. Another improvement that can be made is the communication and provision of information because these are points where communication and provision of information fall short. Finally, the way in which payment is handled in the UAV-GC 2020 can be improved, as payment and costs in the UAV-GC 2020 are currently made and determined in advance and this can be done based on wrong or insufficient information. In the NEC 4 ECC, there are several payment methods and, based on the characteristics of the project, the appropriate payment method can be chosen. This seems to be a great improvement to the UAV-GC 2020, as the way payment is regulated in the NEC 4 ECC will improve cooperation between parties and reduce the likelihood of a dispute arising.<br/><br/>With the answers to the sub-questions and the main questions, it is possible to answer the general research question. It can be concluded that there are three important elements of the NEC 4 ECC that could improve the UAV-GC 2020 and thus be of added value. These are the obligation of communication and continuous provision of information, the various options in the NEC 4 ECC and especially the way in which payment is dealt with in the NEC 4 ECC. The way payment is handled in the NEC 4 ECC could help the UAV-GC with a better allocation of risk and responsibility. It also creates a better understanding of the project and better cooperation between the parties if necessary.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Current solutions of UWB ranging however either focus on achieving a high accuracy or focus on scalability. In this research a positioning algorithm for UAVs is presented that combines high accuracy performance with a high level of system scalability. The localisation method uses commercially available off the shelf components and is implemented by connecting two UWB sensors to a micro aerial vehicle. From<br/>both sensors, time-difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements were collected during flights and additionally, a tag-TDOA between the two UWB sensors was measured which estimates the angle-of-arrival of the incoming signals. It was found that state estimation using TDOA measurements from both UWB sensors has a reduced positioning error compared to the algorithm using TDOA measurements from one UWB sensor, without significantly affecting yaw estimation accuracy. Furthermore, the tag-TDOA measurement did not improve the estimation accuracy at the implemented baseline of 0.22 metres as the<br/>measurement error was too large compared to the baseline.","UAV; Localisation; UWB; TDOA; Angle of arrival; MAV; MAVLAB; EKF; State Estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","To fully optimize the synergy between human operators and machines in modern day’s highly automated vehicle control tasks, a real-time quantitative feedback of skill level is required. Direct feedback of skill level could be used to enable scalable levels of autonomy of the controlled system, or to provide a warning when sudden skill level deterioration is detected, improving safety. Cybernetics has proven to be a useful tool to assess pilot skill level, but most traditional methods suffer from the fundamental issue of assuming the human controller to be constant over time, ignoring subtle changes in control behavior. Employing deep artificial neural networks directly to raw time series of control behavior may be a solution to this problem. Using a deep residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) architecture, this research shows that 1.2 second windows of experimental human control data—from a previously conducted compensatory tracking experiment in the SIMONA Research Simulator at Delft University of Technology—can be classified as either ’skilled’ or ’unskilled’ with an average validation accuracy of 92% in a moving-base setting and 88% in a fixed-base setting. Results indicate that the trained network is not a one-size-fits-all classifier in its current state, as the skill levels of isolated subjects with off-nominal learning curves are difficult to predict. Introduction of SHapley Additive exPlanations and class visualizations with activation maximization add transparency to the trained classifier’s predictions, offering a new perspective on distinctive characteristics of manual control skill level in the time domain. This explainable deep learning approach to skill level identification enables real-time quantitative evaluation of control behavior, opening a new realm of possibilities to enhance safety in automated systems that rely on smooth interaction with the human operator.","manual control; time series classification; deep learning; explainable artificial intelligence; pilot modeling; skill level","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-01-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

(mentor); Correljé, A. (mentor); Ponsioen, Coen (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","class=""MsoNormal"">Hydrogen is widely considered an essential energy carrier that has the potential to accelerate the energy transition. The Netherlands does not have the resources to fulfil the expected hydrogen demand by domestically produced hydrogen. By realising hydrogen import terminals, the Port of Rotterdam can maintain its dominating position as the (renewable) energy port in North-West Europe. This study, in which the Port of Rotterdam is used as a case study, focuses on the uncertainties hampering the realisation of hydrogen import terminals. While earlier studies have been conducted on hydrogen import, we identify two research gaps: 1) the necessity to optimise the scaling of hydrogen import terminals and 2) the inclusion of hydrogen use in multiple sectors. Through a literature review, three categories of uncertainty have been identified that are often present in hydrogen systems; economic, technical, and geopolitical uncertainties. The categories of uncertainty have been used as a guideline to identify uncertainty present in assessing the integrated hydrogen system in the Port of Rotterdam. A model that represents this system has been developed in Linny-R. Linny-R is a graphical specification language to solve Mixed-Integer Linear Programming problems. This model allowed us to adjust input parameters such as production capacities and prices, hydrogen demand, and infrastructural changes to study the identified uncertainties through sensitivity analyses and scenarios. The results of this research illustrate the need for hydrogen import to meet the projected hydrogen demand. However, hydrogen import is not cost-competitive compared to domestically produced hydrogen. This study highlights the potential to reduce costs in the production, conversion to the carrier, and shipping stage of the supply chain. Currently, Ammonia (NH3) is the cheapest hydrogen carrier followed by Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC), and Liquid hydrogen (LH2). Long-term contracts are required to manage the hydrogen import transactions to resolve economic uncertainty. Technical uncertainty relates to the scaling of hydrogen import terminals and the end-user sectors’ preferences for a specific hydrogen carrier. Based on the technical characteristics of the three hydrogen carriers, LH2 shows the highest potential to supply all end-user sectors. However, LOHC and NH3 also have advantages in specific areas. Moreover, the early stage of development in LH2-technology fuels the need for LOHC and NH3, leaving the debate on which hydrogen carrier is preferred open. Furthermore, the scaling of hydrogen import terminals is complicated by the presence of salt-caverns in the northern part of The Netherlands because they provide a cheap alternative for large-scale hydrogen storage. Geopolitical uncertainties related to the hydrogen import supply chain processes are highly dependent on the production capabilities in the export countries and the distance of those countries to the Port of Rotterdam. Additionally, other nearby located ports can also realise import terminals, attracting hydrogen import, diminishing the potential dominant position of the Port of Rotterdam. However, a first-mover position could manifest the Port of Rotterdam as a dominant player in the global hydrogen market. More generally, hydrogen import terminals could provide security against geopolitical forces as it safeguards the diversity of the Dutch energy mix. We identified several avenues for future research. First, researchers interested in expanding the model’s functionalities could focus on 1) modelling a variable renewable electricity price, 2) including salt-caverns and specific hydrogen export, 3) adjusting our model by allowing only filled vessels to arrive, 4) including the Willingness To Pay (WTP) of various end-user sectors, 5) applying a method that allows the investigation of numerous possible futures. A more general recommendation is to add a new model to analyse investments and support companies’ business cases by integrating hydrogen end-user sectors’ WTP. Finally, we especially encourage policymakers to explore and support the possibility to realise one or more hydrogen import terminals, even in case of a lacking business case, to improve the strategic position of the Port of Rotterdam with regards to economic and geopolitical advantages.","Hydrogen import terminal; LH2; LOHC; NH3; Port of Rotterdam; MILP; Linny-R","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

This paradigm is based on the consumption of resources rather than the preservation of their value. If this model remains dominant, it will lead to material scarcity, thereby increasing materials prices. The linear economy has a negative effect on nature as this model creates a tremendous amount of waste. Minimising the waste, maximising the value and facilitating the reuse of materials is the foundation of the Circular Economy. Lack of information regarding materials is recognised as one of the primary causes for waste generation. As a result, material passports were created to facilitate information sharing. However, some barriers hinder the application of these material passports. This research analysed the barriers and requirements of material passports and whether these barriers can be addressed through the characteristics of Blockchain technology such as transparency, distributive nature and security. However, a traditional blockchain has its challenges, such as scalability and an unsustainable consensus mechanism. In this research, a conceptual framework of Hyperledger Fabric (Private-permissioned Blockchain) based material passports is developed to tackle these barriers and meet the requirements. The framework developed aims to be helpful to create Hyperledger Fabric-based Material Passport by Material Passport Developers. Additionally, this helps the stakeholders within the built environment to understand the working of Blockchain-based material passports. The framework's validation was carried out by developing two scenarios, i.e., the Blockchain-based material passport and the BIM-based material passport and comparing them. This step was carried out to see whether the proposed Blockchain-based Material Passport framework will address the barriers of BIM-based material passports. In addition, semi-structured interviews with different stakeholders who use material passports to validate the framework.","Circular economy (CE); Blockchain; Hyperledger Fabric; Material Passports; BIM-based Material Passport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The cultural significance they convey, such as attributes and values attached to them, are not only represented by physical assets, but are also reflected in people’s meanings, experiences, and perceptions that derive from the interaction between an individual or collective and an (urban) artifact. The interest in the notion of sense of place in assessing cultural significance of heritage buildings grows, and participates in the identification of these inherited values and attributes, and gives direction to the reasons underlying heritage conservation. This paper aims to investigate the role of collective memory as a design tool for sense of place in the adaptive reuse of vacant heritage, using the vacant heritage building of the V&amp;D Leiden as a case study. Furthermore, it introduces a method to explore a new type of repository, the social media platform Instagram, in which people’s individual memories are shared and reflect similarities between them. The theory of Montgomery (1998) is used to connect these collective memories to the components of sense of place, defined by form, activity and meaning, in order to acknowledge and show that collective memory can be of great importance in sustaining and creating a sense of place.","Vacant Heritage; collective memory; Sense of place; Adaptive Reuse; Cultural Heritage; Social sustainability; social media; Instagram","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","Vacant Heritage",""
