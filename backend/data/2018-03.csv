Dealing with high water levels in residential areas is of great importance. The delta area of Macabebe, in the Manila Bay, has to cope with daily flooding, caused by the river and the sea. Groundwater is pumped and used for local industry, causing land subsidence and worsening the problems. Where once rice fields were the main source of income, these fields are now fishponds where fish escape during a large flood. Additionally, typhoons strike the region regularly. Due to climate change and the ongoing ground subsidence the problems won’t lessen, so a solution needs to be found. In the Netherlands, multiple organizations are working daily on finding solutions. One of these is Finch Floating Homes, who designed a typhoon resilient, floating home for in the Philippines. This design had to be elaborated on before construction of a pilot project. This report contains the needed changes and advice for the design of the floating home. Through research, local interviews and analysis, the design of the house has been improved on the roof, sanitary system and mooring system and a construction plan has been created for the pilot project. <br/> <br/>Based on a revision of the roof shape, the hip roof turned out to be the best shape in a typhoon prone area. During the design, the geometry of the housing unit was slightly changed into a double symmetrical geometry, increasing constructability and simplicity of the house. The design of the roof structure and its connections, consisting of four identical prefabricated frames, is presented. After prefabrication, the frames will be connected on-site, after which the newly designed foldable balconies will be placed in the frames. The material used in the design is corrugated steel roof sheeting.<br/>The final roof shape is used to calculate the rainwater collection. The floating house requires a self-sustaining system that fulfils the needs of drinking water and wastewater treatment. This<br/>system consists of three separate systems: (1) rainwater harvesting, consisting of a drainage system, first flush barrel system and sand filter. (2) Storage of water, capable of storing sufficient water for one-third of the total usage over 80% of the year. (3) Wastewater, based on natural treatment before discharge into the surface water, containing a septic tank and wetland filter. <br/>The water management system within the foundation, the wind load on the house, waves and currents influence the motions of the floating structure and the forces on the mooring system. An analysis of the options for mooring systems leads to the decision of using mooring piles. The total stiffness of the piles influences the horizontal motion and rotation of the platform. The vertical motion is a free behaviour; it is not influenced by the mooring piles. It is needed to choose a specific combination of pile length and bending stiffness, after which the strength of the pile is checked. <br/>The design is used for the project construction plan, focussing on the time, risk and change management of the pilot project. The resources and construction activities and their duration were identified to develop a schedule for controlling the construction phase. Preparations and construction of the pilot will take 13 weeks, but includes several risks. Response strategies for these risks are proposed, to use for a risk mitigation plan. Finally, advice is given on how to manage possible design changes regarding new research, development of design and up-scaling changes after a successful pilot project.<br/> <br/>With the use of this report and more detailed research and design, the pilot project will be an optimal test of the floating house in the Philippines.<br","floating house Philippines; pilot flooding typhoon","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","MP254","14.908133, 120.715156"

Flexible risers used in the oil and gas industry are one of these applications, where noise is produced due to corrugations present at the innermost layer of the riser. Dry-gas flow through a corrugated pipe generates an unstable shear layer over each of the corrugations. Under certain conditions, this shear layer can roll up into discrete vortices, which impinge on the downstream cavity edge, producing pressure pulsations. When the frequency of impingement matches with one of the natural pipe frequencies, a ‘lock-in’ mechanism causes intensification of the associated noise and vibrations, which can have serious implications on the structural integrity of the corrugated pipe. This phenomenon is called Flow Induced Pulsations (FIP). Liquid injection in a corrugated pipe with gas flow has shown the potential to mitigate whistling caused by FIP. A number of mechanisms play a role in the whistling mitigation. It is shown in literature that the filling of cavities due to liquid film or rivulets present on the pipe wall is an important mechanism. The cavity filling results in an altered cavity geometry, which changes the shear layer dynamics. The effect of liquid and gas flow rate on the cavity filling, however, remains unknown. The present work aims to study the liquid filling behaviour of a single cavity, due to a gas flow driven liquid film. <br/>An experimental setup is constructed which consists of a rectangular channel containing a cavity. Liquid is injected in the channel as a film at the channel wall, which is driven upward by gas flow. The liquid film thickness upstream of the cavity is measured first, followed by the cavity filling itself. Both measurements are performed using a Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) based technique. After several post-processing steps, the film thickness and cavity filling are quantified. <br/>At low liquid flow rates, a partial film is created at the channel wall with a dry patch at the center. Increasing the liquid flow rate results in a full film covering the entire channel width. The film thickness varies in the transverse direction due to the presence of localized horseshoe shaped disturbance waves on the liquid film. Overall, the film cross-sectional area increases with increasing liquid flow rate, either due to an increase in film thickness of full films, or an increase in width of the partial films. The liquid film fills up the cavity, accumulating mainly at the upstream edge. The downstream edge remains relatively free from liquid. The amount of filling is found to increase with increasing local film thickness at the measurement position away from the channel side-wall. Changes in the cavity geometry due to liquid filling are estimated based on the cavity effective depth and length. The effective cavity depth does not significantly change and only decreases by 8% with a 25% increase in filling ratio. However, the effective length decreases substantially by 30% with a 25% increase in filling ratio. This could lead to a mode parameter value (ratio of cavity length to incoming gas momentum thickness), such that it does not fall in the range where whistling is observed, resulting in mitigation of whistling.","multiphase flows; cavity flows; Laser Induced Fluorescence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This includes the Netherlands (Rijkswaterstaat, 2014). The use of performance contracts for maintenance is relatively new and agencies encounter numerous difficulties in working with these contracts. Many studies exist on the topic of performance contracts, but studies specifically aimed at understanding the problems in performance-based maintenance contracts are few (Sultana, Rahman, &amp; Chowdhury, 2012, p. 288). This research contributes to filling that knowledge gap, by researching performance-based maintenance contracts used for highway maintenance. The Dutch highway network grew significantly during the 60s and 70s. Many new kilometres of highway, bridges, and viaducts were constructed to accommodate the growing traffic needs (Rijkswaterstaat, 2007, p. 7).

Why is bad posture so bad, and what problems does it create?<br/><br/>Bad posture is a prolific problem across the globe. Poor posture is highly linked to interaction with technology. In today’s society, that means nearly everyone is likely to suffer from poor posture. Positioning in miss aligned postures for extended periods of time create muscular imbalances. These imbalances strengthen certain muscles, while the opposing muscles weaken. Because of this, imbalances are cyclical, once created, you are more likely to continue the imbalance due to the strength/weakness of your musculature.<br/><br/>Consistent poor posture, and the imbalances that come with it, can make it difficult to perform active activities such as sports or hobbies. These imbalances alter the way the body moves and puts people at a higher risk of injury. Specifically, users who have a 9-5 mostly sedentary job interacting with technology, but also have an active hobby are at the most risk. Therefore, the target demographic of this thesis is the ‘active hobbyist.’<br/><br/>Today’s solutions available to users trying to fix their posture focus on fixing the symptoms, not the incredible amount of time a day we spend in compromising postures. The issue with this tactic is that no matter how much stretching or strengthening you do, nothing can counteract the 75+ hours a week spent sitting in awkward positions in front of your computer. These solutions also include hard electronics that impede the natural movement of the body and interfere with clothes and other daily interactions.<br/><br/>Changing one’s posture is hard. Most people sit up straight, but soon become distracted by Netflix, their phone, or work and slouch down again. In fact, a study done in this thesis found that the average user will need reminding about their posture about once every 2.5 minutes. This is because our brains actively work against us maintaining postural awareness. <br/><br/>Therefore, a solution to help users to maintain awareness of their posture is needed. <br/><br/>The skin of a person’s back stretches in a way that correlates to the posture of that person. A sensor that monitors stretch could be used to measure posture.<br/>An on-the-skin sensing mechanism is made from a conductive, stretchable silver ink printed onto a plaster-like platform. The sensor functions by measuring the change in resistance as the sensor is stretched. This sensor is the first disposable sensor skin concept for its market. Its functionality is improved over the course of this thesis to become more robust and resilient. <br/><br/>Five concepts are developed to demonstrate how this sensor could be designed and implemented as a product for the market. These concepts are optimized to show the qualities of the stretchable ink printed sensor.<br","stretchable; strain; sensor; design; industrial design; emerging materials; posture; muscle imbalance; silver; stretch","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

A specific characteristic has been found in the exponential relation between lateral lipid diffusion and temperature. The finding was reported to be surprising as a linear dependence was theoretically predicted. In this study, the gap between simple theoretical models and experimental in vivo results on lipid diffusion is investigated by studying model membrane systems experimentally. Specifically, lateral lipid diffusion is further characterized as function of temperature, lipid charge and asymmetry. To induce anomalous diffusion, a peripheral protein known to act as a diffusion barrier, fly-septin, was associated to the lipid bilayer to explore its effect on lipid slow-down.<br/><br/>Lateral lipid diffusion was measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) on a bare, or with associated septin, model phospholipid membrane system. The supported lipid bilayer (SLB) model membrane systems were formed by vesicle fusion (VF) or Langmuir-Blodgett/vesicle fusion (LBVF), specifically for asymmetric<br/>SLBs. Temperature variations were induced by using an in-house built sample heater. The quality of the lipid bilayers was defined by investigating influencing variables; lipid batches, substrate surface treatment, SLB formation methods and lipid tracers.<br/><br/>Results show that membrane viscosity exhibits linear scaling to lipid diffusion. Furthermore, lateral lipid diffusion appears to be charge dependent and influenced by lipid composition of both leaflets. Considering the influence of septin, lateral lipid diffusion is reproducibly increased as compared to a bare membrane, in contrast to the reported septin induced lipid slow-down due to a diffusion barrier mechanism. These findings have brought the gap between theoretical models and membrane dynamics one step closer together.","Plasma membrane; Lateral lipid diffusion; Septin; Lipid charge; Supported lipid bilayer; Asymmetric SLB; Temperature dependence; Membrane fluidity; Vesicle fusion; Langmuir-Blodgett; Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The continuous production has been resulting in several micro-seismicity activities, particularly for the past decades. One of the reasons for the production-induced-seismicity is fault reactivation at depth. The fault that initially in the non-active state becomes active and starts slipping due to pore fluid extraction. The modelling of fault reactivation induced by production can be simulated by coupling of flow and geomechanics.<br/><br/>The project studies the coupling of flow and geomechanics for an idealistic subsurface model with fault. The flow occurs due to pore pressure depletion and is predicted by solving mass conservation. The corresponding deformation is estimated by momentum balance equation.<br/><br/>The observation will be limited to rock deformation that is quantified by effective stress and displacement on the fault due to a pressure change in the subsurface. The simulation is performed using Stanford's Automatic Differentiation General Purpose Reservoir Simulator (ADGPRS).<br/><br/>In the proposed model, the flow equation is discretised using finite volume method, and poromechanics is discretised by finite-element Galerkin's approach. Both problems share the same grid model, and there is no error associated with the information exchange.

The impact of variability in production dynamic on fault reactivation is studied. The variations in production rate and production strategy are applied in different formation configurations. It is found that the correlation between the production rates and the stress state in the subsurface depends on the formation offset. However, the stress field does not depend on continuity of the production scheme.

The company VFO, world leading in assistive technology for VIP, proposed the assignment after finding out that VIP still watch television but do not experience it like sighted users. <br/><br/>First, background information was retrieved by literature research. Common causes of having a visual impairment and what kinds of impairments exist were derived. Existing knowledge of television watching by VIP was still undersized; no recent study has been done. The main insight obtained from the literature research was that VIP do watch television as much as sighted people. However, VIP experience several problems while watching television that they are not yet able to solve, such as difficulties with understanding a story or missing important details. Currently some products exist to enhance the television experience of VIP but none of them fit to all visual impairments or solves their actual problem. <br/><br/>During this project a study was done to understand the context of VIP watching television and what problems come to light while using the television. In addition to struggles with positioning and using the television, VIP are having a hard time following the content of TV-programs. Details are missed, subtitles are too small to read or disappear too quickly and fast-changing images make it hard to focus on the subject.<br/><br/>In this thesis, a solution will be presented for the inability to follow a conversation because of fast-changing images and the incapability of reading subtitles. Several ideas were generated. Four concepts were formulated after discussions and brainstorms with experts of different expertises such as visual aiding products, vision of VIP and about possibilities of tracking content in a video fragment. These four concepts were tested with VIP to validate the working principle. One concept was found to be applicable for all kinds of visual impairments and a genuine help for VIP: Voices. The concept changes the single voice of spoken subtitle equipment into four voices (two male and two female). This concept needed some improvement according to VIP: making the voices more natural. Furthermore, the Dutch voices that can be used by VFO are Xander and Claire, just one male and one female voice. This evoked one more improvement that should be made: developing dual voices out of one existing voice. <br/><br/>Several possible voices were made with editing the existing ones. A survey was done that indicated the best voices and the needed pitch difference (two semitones) between two voices to perceive them as a different personality. <br/><br/>Video fragments of Dutch television with subtitles were edited with these voices to test the final concept; SubSpeech, with VIP. This last research provided the insight that two semitones distance between two voices was not always perceived as two different personalities. However, the concept was perceived as intended and participants mentioned that several voices do help them understanding a conversation due to the indication of a changing speaker. With current knowledge SubSpeech will help VIP understand conversations of foreign languages better and will make them watch television more easily.

Concerning school subjects, there are also gender role stereotypes for boys and girls. Boys seem to be more interested in mathematics and natural sciences whereas girls seem to be more motivated for language, arts and writing (Jacobs, 2002). According to the attribution theory (Heider, 1958), the performance of an individual can be attributed to the person themselves (internal) or to the situation in which they are in (external). There might be a link between these existing stereotypes in school subjects and level of self-confidence of boys and girls.<br/>Strategic design tasks entail aspects of business, engineering and design. Therefore, it entails aspects of both stereotypical boys (mathematics, natural sciences) and girls (language, arts, writing) school subjects. It would thus be worth knowing whether there are also gender differences in attribution when dealing with a strategic design task. The goal of this research is to find out how the attribution theory applies for boys and girls when performing a strategic design task. The main research question is: <br/>How does attribution theory apply for boys and girls when performing a strategic design task? In order to answer the main research question, thirteen sub research questions with corresponding hypotheses were formulated. The research consisted of both quantitative and qualitative research methods. A sample of 46 third year high school students was used. The participants were divided in gender equal teams of three. The participants performed a strategic design task as a team. Three questionnaires were conducted among the participants; one before, one after and finally, one after grading the strategic design task. At the end of the research interviews were held to give the quantitative data more body. The data analysis mainly consisted of statistically analysing the effects of independent variables on dependent variables. The dependent variables of this research, in general, are type of attribution, self-confidence and interest (and performance). The independent variable is gender. The moderators are the strategic design task and grading. To create more overview, the results are documented in six variable themes. The results of this research suggest that stereotypes do not exist within this group of participants. Interest and performance in school subjects contradicted the existing gender stereotypes. Furthermore, no differences in interest in the strategic design task were found. Boys and girls both scored high on self-confidence in each measurement, no significant differences were found here. In line with this high self-confidence, both boys and girls attributed success to internal factors and were highly self-confident about performing a strategic design task in the future. This report concludes with a discussion of the results, limitations and recommendations for future research on the subject.","attribution theory; gender stereotypes; self-confidence; strategic design; design task; high school","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In the modeling of fractured reservoirs, the spatial representation plays an important role to enclose the heterogeneities present in the subsurface. The reservoir flow response obtained from simulation in time is determined by the type of method and by the scale of the representation (fine or coarse). As a deterministic model cannot capture the range of possible scenarios, a set of different realizations associated to an ensemble is required to evaluate the variability of flow responses. The challenge is to determine if the coarse scale simulations, practical in terms of performance, can capture the variability present in the set of realizations. This thesis attempts to quantify the uncertainty of different hierarchical levels for fractured reservoirs and determine the possibility of using coarse scale simulations in uncertainty quantification. <br/>The uncertainties, associated to the flow response, were estimated via clustering to a representative subgroup for each ensemble and using Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) distance technique for analysis. Uncertainty trajectories were built in order to analyze the effect of coarsening to the spread in flow response. An advanced framework was built which allows generating an ensemble of realizations with different fracture distributions and connectivity. This framework provides a stable numerical model with the conformal unstructured grid for Discrete Fracture and Matrix (DFM) model at high resolution. Based on this high-fidelity model, we created a coarser DFM representation and numerically upscale it to EDFM models to obtain flow responses at different scales. <br/>It is shown that the representatives of the ensemble at coarser scale do not behave similarly to the finest scale ensemble solution. While, the intermediate coarse levels show an accurate flow response in some realizations, it does not hold for all of them.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Simulation to predict the well and reservoir performance is a very important and established process in reservoir engineering. Integrated production modeling allows improving the understanding of the field’s performance and production network, fluid flow behavior and optimization at any stage and level during the life of the field through reservoir modeling processes. <br/> <br/>This work forms an in depth study of the production data from the K5-F field in the Dutch sector of the Southern North Sea in which the field is analyzed through integrated production modeling to remove the uncertainties coupled with this field. Due to the absence of individual flow meters for the three wells producing from the K5F field, a first step was the determination of a production split per well. This production split is then used to quantifying the water gas ratio which forms the input data for material balance modeling. The effect of a changed production history per well on analysis and parameter estimation is also studied. <br/> <br/>The well test analysis results and corrected production history incorporated in the material balance software allowed the estimation of other unknown reservoir parameters such as volumes, saturation, relative permeabilities and compartmentalization per well. Using material balance modelling as a tool for history matching, and taking into account the local geology the K5-F reservoir showed that the K5-F1 is a segmented reservoir behaving as separate compartments. Through interference testing it was found that is communication between K5-F1 and K5-F3 through a shared aquifer that is giving additional pressure support to the K5-F1 field. K5-F2 is not in communication with a different reservoir. For both K5-F1 and K5-F2 a reservoir pressure and water saturation match within a 2% range is found <br/> <br/>Even though the K5-F field is one that has many production difficulties, unknowns and uncertainties, the workflow used and presented in this thesis allowed for the successful development of an integrated production model based on the most recent ideas and developments. The designed and simulated reservoir model resulted in cumulative production match around 3% and good reservoir pressure, wellhead pressure and gas rate match for K5-F1. K5-F2 found a cumulative production match of 4,8% which is above the acceptable 3%. With the assumptions and optimizations made throughout this study it was possible to create a reservoir model capable of forecasting the K5-F1 and K5-F2 well performance. <br/> <br/>This research has shown that the amount and quality of production history available for a field and/or wells can have a huge impact on the analysis on reservoir parameters and model estimations. Besides the quality of the production data being used, the amount of production history plays a large role in well test analysis. Small amounts of production history for instance can influence in the late stage of the pressure build up derivative which can lead to an underestimation of the skin. Even something as simple as a new production split has led to a 16,76% lower cumulative production for K5-F1 and a 13,21% higher cumulative produced volume for K5-F2. Therefore it can be stated that the quality of a reservoir model and history match of a field has a direct correlation with the quality of the production and field data.","Petroleum Engineering; history matching","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

Even though the PowerWindow<br/>does not produce asmuch power as a traditional rooftop installed photovoltaic solution, it can still<br/>be viewed as a step in the right direction to achieve sustainable development.<br/>This thesis project aims at modelling the energy yield of the PowerWindow by developing a simple framework<br/>with optical, thermal and electrical models. This thesis also evaluates the electrical characteristics of the<br/>PowerWindow under solar simulators. Furthermore, opto-electronic parameter values like current, voltage,<br/>reflectance and so on found through experimentation are used as input to the models. The optical model<br/>deals with a ray tracing approach to find the incident irradiance on the solar cells inside the PowerWindow.<br/>This incident irradiance along with the weather data is used for the development of a thermal model to predict<br/>the temperature of the solar cells using a fluid dynamic approach. To model the electrical characteristics<br/>of the PowerWindow, a one diode equivalent circuit is used. However, the current source is modified to incorporate<br/>the effects of inhomogeneous irradiation on and the temperature of the solar cells.<br/>The results of this work show that the maximum power produced by the PowerWindow, currently manufactured<br/>by Physee, is approximately 3.5 W under a solar simulator. This work also compares the incident<br/>irradiation profiles of all the edges of the PowerWindow, which produce power on different days, orientations<br/>and locations. The effects of shading on the PowerWindow is evaluated in terms of irradiation and is found<br/>to be present only in the summer months in Eindhoven. Furthermore, the daily energy yield calculated for<br/>a typical summer, winter and overcast day in Eindhoven is found to be 13, 5 and 3 Wh. It was concluded<br/>that a west and east facing PowerWindows in Eindhoven produce more energy in the summer and less in<br/>the winter as compared to a south facing PowerWindow. Additionally, the most performance effective circuit<br/>configuration is found to be the one with both blocking and bypass diodes.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-29","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

This model stems from the inherent inability of the Boussinesq approximation to model anisotropy and therefore flow features such as: swirl, stream-line curvature and secondary motions (Lumley, 1970; Pope, 1975; Craft et al., 1996). The focus lies on the limitations of using global-coefficients calibrated on a square-duct flow when applied on a rectangular-duct and a wing-body junction. The calibration is done with the Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) results from Pinelli et al. (2010) at a Reynolds number of Re = 1, 100. It is shown that using a global-coefficient NLEVM the velocity prediction on a square-duct and rectangular-duct is successfully corrected, i.e. secondary motions are present. On an attempt to improve the corner flow separation on a wing-body junction poor performance is observed. Stability issues led to only 3 models converge out of 21. Differently to Bordji et al. (2014) who found a large corner flow separation reduction with a Spalart-Allmaras Quadratic Constitutive Relation (SA-QCR) turbulence model when compared to a standard SA model, the global-coefficient NLEVM only showed limited corner flow separation reduction. Apart from correcting the anisotropy the near-wall resolution and treatment is found to be of large importance for flow field predictions. In the square- and rectangular-duct a wall damping function destroyed the secondary motion prediction, whilst in the wing-body junction improving the junction and corner flow prediction.","CFD; RANS; Turbulence Modelling; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

Second, the scalability of the pressure losses associated to the perpendicular flow through large-scale and actual-scale perforated sheets was investigated experimentally. This development is required to predict the pressure losses of generic HLFC surfaces. It was found that the scalability of these pressure losses is limited, because the frictional losses inside holes decrease continually with decreasing hole diameter.

Accurate prediction of emissions requires a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism to be implemented but doing so, directly in CFD, is prohibitively expensive. Hence CFD is used to obtain the combustion flow field, which is influenced mainly by the evolution of major species, whereas the minor species are obtained from the implementation of detailed chemistry in a CRN derived automatically from the CFD mesh. Such a calculation is feasible because ideal reactors, which are the building blocks of a CRN, have a simplified fluid dynamic model and can hence process the detailed chemistry at an affordable time cost.<br/><br/>A software package implementing the Automatic CFD-CRN process is developed and factors affecting the results from this computational tool are studied in this research work.","Combustion; Emissions; Chemical Reactor Network; Combustion Simulation; Graphs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-04-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Numerical reproduction of these results has not yet led to a good understanding of the reasons for this behavior. Currently, an analytical approach is used for determining the mode II fracture toughness from an mTCT test. In this research, the validity of the analytical relation is investigated for the case of an added compressive stress. The behavior of the material in the<br/>test is therefore numerically investigated in a qualitative manner. A mesh, using a material model for plasticity and a cohesive law for interface elements to form the crack, which have been proven to give good results, has been build. A refinement on mesh and geometrical dimensions, focused on the pressure zone of the specimen, ensures the degree of detail required to investigate the local behavior. A parameter study on the inlfuence of geometrical and material parameters is performed and linked to results from previous conducted experiments. A standard mTCT test without compressive stress shows a linear load displacement relation until crack initiation and then a constant load at which the crack grows through the specimen. This crack growth load is used for the analytical approach. The results from this research show a change from a constant crack growth load to a linear crack growth load range in the zone of the applied compressive stress. After crack initiation, the crack growth load through the compressed zone has an increasing, nearly linear relation, based on the compressive stress and length of the pressure zone. The analytical approach, in<br/>which the highest reached load on the specimen before failure is used as input, no longer applies for this case. The failure load is now dependent on the length of the pressure zone and pressure magnitude.","Composite; fracture behaviour; TCT; mTCT; Compressive; Mode II; Numerical; Interlaminar; Fracture toughnes; Fracture energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","",""

More than half of the change programs that are started are not completed successfully. One of the most influential factors to this low success rate is the resistance of employees. Informing and involving them in the organisational change is essential to gain their support and understanding for the change. <br/><br/>The design is specifically aimed at the employees of KLM Component Services. Roughly 800 employees will be affected by a move, renovation and a revision of all processes. What makes this context specific are the large number of non-desk workers and the relatively high average age (52). Many of these employees are not comfortable using modern technologies such as social media and smartphones and spend most of their workday on the repair of aircraft components. Not being able to read all newsletters or spend time searching the intranet, an alternative communication channel is needed. Based on this need, the design goal for this project was established: to design a tool to keep all employees at Component Services informed on relevant developments and help to overcome resistance by involving them in organisational change.<br/><br/>Current trends and existing solutions for communication during change were explored. Increasingly, digital media are used and a strong emphasis is put on visual content. Several other qualities were drawn up, setting requirements for the final design. Usability being the most important quality, experiments with various design solutions were conducted. The outcome of these experiments was the basis of a design concept; a large timeline showing the stages of the change program, situated in a central location in the building. <br/><br/>This concept was further detailed, resulting in a large interactive timeline, projected onto a wall. The key element – using motion sensors to establish an immersive interaction – was tested with a simplified prototype. The results were used to further optimise the design.<br/><br/>Still, there is still considerable opportunity for detailing this design, as several deficiencies were identified regarding the prototype used in the user test. The most influential of these was that the design had to be explained to participants. In further testing, it is suggested to have an autonomously operating prototype, to allow the researcher to observe if employees will also be able to use this design without any further guidance. A potential opportunity for the design lies in the customisation of the content shown in the timeline, using a smartphone. Further design and testing is needed to fully develop this idea.<br/><br/>Despite the limitations, the design was positively received by employees. These positive results indicate that this design has the potential to be an appropriate tool for informing and involving employees during organisational change. The design will stimulate conversations among employees and helps to reduce uncertainty. This helps to gain employees’ support for the change program and thereby reduces their resistance to change.","Change; Change management; Organisational change; Interaction; Information system; Design for Interaction; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","","52.306027, 4.801553"

(mentor); McCall, R.T. (graduation committee); van der Biezen, T.F. (graduation committee); Hofland, B. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","This thesis discusses the morphological modelling of the gravel revetment on artificial composite beaches. A composite beach is a combination of a sandy lower beach and a gravel upper beach. These beaches are found in nature, but can also be created artificially by placement of a gravel structure on a sandy beach. Artificial composite beaches are widely acknowledged as an effective type of shore protection against runup and overtopping (Blenkinsopp, 2016), but an assessment of such a beach with a numerical model has not been attempted yet.<br/><br/>Therefore this work explores to what extent the morphological developments of these artificial beaches can be modelled with a numerical model. The numerical models that were used in this work are XBeach and XBeach-G. The aim is to reproduce the short term (3 to 6 hours) cross-shore morphological developments of the DynaRev experiments (a series of physical model experiments to investigate the stability of an artificial composite beach under sea-level rise), with a focus on the beach section on which the gravel revetment is placed. The first step was to find the relevant processes that are missing in the currently available numerical models. The missing processes were identified by combining knowledge acquired through the modelling of composite beaches with the currently available models, substantiated by analysis of the DynaRev experiments and literature research.<br/><br/>It was concluded that the numerical models were lacking two important processes: namely the absence of a gravel transport formulation in XBeach and transport of sand in the gravel revetment. The missing processes were implemented into XBeach and the updatedmodel’s performances were verified with the DynaRev experiments as benchmark. The implementation of the XBeach-G gravel transport formulation in coherence with the existing XBeach code for sand transport required under-the-hood adaptations to improve the switches that are already in place for multiple sediment fractions. It was found that a combination of sand transport and gravel transport is possible, but this combination presents difficulties regarding suspended sediment transport in combination with the hydrodynamics and the groundwater dynamics.<br/><br/>The second process was transport of sand in the gravel revetment. This was first analysed by looking at the initial transport rates of sand inside the revetment with a newly introduced equation for transport of sandinside a filter layer (Jacobsen et al., 2017). It was shown that transport fluxes of sand inside the revetment are likely to occur as results of the groundwater dynamics. To see bed level changes due to these transport fluxes this transport equation needs to be implemented into the XBeach code. This was not possible with the current architecture of XBeach and the way it accounts for multiple fractions. Therefore a new accounting system for multiple fractions was introduced in this work and implemented in XBeach, named the two-line model. In this experimental model sand transport gradients in the revetment are translated into visible sinking of the revetment (erosion) and settling of sand within the gravel revetment (deposition). In the model’s current state the erosive locations appear to match with the DynaRev observations, whereas locations where deposition occurs are no match. The two-line model was sensitive and showed instabilities, mainly due to high groundwater velocities that were caused by wave breaking in themodel. The results of the experimental model can possibly be improved by including vertical groundwater velocities to model sand transports, possibly also in combination with the addition of suspended sediment transport of sand inside the revetment.","XBeach; XBeach-G; Morphodynamics; Composite beach; Modelling; Multiple fractions; Gravel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Korevaar, Marc (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Ever since the commercial growth of PV installations, soiling has been a crucial factor to decrease its performance ratio. Environmental factors such as irradiation, wind, rainfall, and back module temperature affect the yield of a system, but, in many environments, soiling of PV modules carries the largest impact. Cost effective soiling measurements within a production area can provide reliable insights into the soiling behavior and allow developing an optimal cleaning schedule.<br/><br/>The deposition of dust, soil, and microfibers resulting from the surroundings as well as the growth of minute pollen like moss and fungi are categorized as PV module soiling. It is a lesser acknowledged factor that significantly reduces the power production by acting as a barrier for effective light photons utilized by a module. The estimated loss in the irradiance and power can be determined with the help of a soiling ratio (SR) parameter, which is the ratio of short-circuit current (Isc) or maximum power produced (Pmax) by a soiled module to the clean one.<br/><br/>The first step to address this issue was to analyze the different soiling effects on a module. Various outdoor and indoor soiling experiments were carried out in the rooftop PV system to examine the angular dependency, inhomogeneity, optical losses, and color impacts of the dust. Another aspect of this research project was the development of a novel soiling detection system, the DustIQ. The two sensors with the help of on-board mini-PV module measure the soiling ratio of a soiled module. A wide range of dust color test was also carried out for the color calibration of the sensor. This report also introduces an empirical equation based on incident angle modifier (IAM) for soiled and cleaned PV modules. The proposed equation was used to determine SR over the course of the day for three conditions of high, medium, and low daily average irradiance.<br/><br/>The modeled SR, when compared with the measured data resulted in RMS deviation of ±0.21% on a high irradiance day. Additionally, analyzed soiling behaviors were used to estimate the annual energy loss due to in Delft, The Netherlands. The average irradiance and power loss was found to be 0.083% and 0.165% per day respectively due to the natural accumulation of soil. This resulted in an annual energy loss of 16.22 kWh for a system of 1.62 kWp, considering rainfall (≥ 2 mm) as the only source of module cleaning.<br","Soil; Soiling; Angular loss; Soiling sensor; DustIQ; Short-circuit; homogenous; Power; Soiled module; Clean module; Soiling ratio; Transmission Loss; Energy loss","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-29","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","Development of a novel soiling sensor, The DustIQ",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Spaceplanes represent a new promising concept for space flight. A spaceplane is a reusable, safe, efficient and economical space transportation system that can generate lift during its atmospheric flight, analogously to an aircraft, and it is able to travel in space as a spacecraft. What makes spaceplanes so attractive is the possibility of reusing the system for more than one mission, and the flexibility that they allow in mission. The growing interest in hypersonic spaceplanes requires that these vehicles have adequate properties of safety of flight and ease of controllability in nominal and off-nominal conditions. From this it follows the need to study their flying qualities and controllability characteristics. The current thesis addresses the flying-quality and controllability analyses, together with the development of a control system capable of improving these properties. The analyses are conducted along the ascent and re-entry trajectory of a representative single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane, the Festip System Study concept 1. The stability, trim capabilities and flying qualities of the open-loop system are analysed by studying the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the state matrix of the state-space model. Comparing the obtained results with the requirements specified in the military documents MIL-F-8785C and MIL-HDBK-1797 for subsonic vehicles, it is possible to conclude that the reference vehicle is dynamically unstable. Thus, the need for an advanced control system arises. One concept seems particularly interesting for this application: the adaptive control system, which is characterised by a low sensitivity to disturbances thanks to its adaptive gains. Not only the control system is design to be optimal in terms of integrated control error and effort, but also a robust design methodology is applied to identify a control design that is as insensitive as possible to uncertainties of the input and design parameters. The responses for both longitudinal and lateral control in nominal and off-nominal conditions are simulated and evaluated. It results that the system behaviour is strongly related to the control system performance. The robust and advanced control system is able to stabilise the vehicle with relatively low control effort and minimise the effect of disturbances, guaranteeing safety of flight and mission success.","control; spaceplanes; hypersonic; robust control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-28","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Liu, Y. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The decision on the dynamical model used to design a spacecraft’s trajectory is a fundamental choice influenced by many factors. The complexity of such a model affects the accuracy of the designed trajectory but also the difficulty of the design process. One approach to simplify this task consists of splitting the trajectory design process into two phases. In the first phase a first-guess reference trajectory is generated through the usage of a simple dynamical model considering the most important forces in the system. In the second phase this reference trajectory is taken and refined with the addition of the perturbing forces that have been neglected in the first phase. The success of this approach depends on the proper sharing of the perturbing forces between the two phases. In this sense the backbone of the trajectory is designed in the first phase and it is fundamental that in this phase the main forces are taken into account to not avoid to consider them as negative perturbing effects in the second phase, that often is performed using an optimization technique.<br/><br/>The research covered in this report is focused on the first phase of this process, in particular for what concerns the gravitational influences generated by multiple bodies. In this sense the simplest dynamical model that could be used considers only the gravitational influence of the main attracting body. Such model however is not able to capture interesting and useful phenomena existing in a more realistic multi-body environment that allow to save a considerable amount of ∆V . This aspect is of crucial importance for missions such as EQUULEUS and DESTINY, whose limited ∆V capabilities need to be compensated by a clever design process actively exploiting both lunar and solar perturbation effects. <br/><br/>This is achieved in this research through the usage of a patched Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem model describing the motion of the spacecraft under the influence of two primaries at a time. Such a patched model is an approximated model that represents the trajectory of a spacecraft under the influence of three bodies. A graphical technique called Tisserand-Poincaré graph exploits this dynamical model to design trajectories in several multi-body environments. The applicability of this technique however is strongly tied to the definition of the so-called Tisserand parameter. The latter however exists only about the primary, limiting the patching between different Circular Restricted Three-Body Problems to those systems sharing the most attracting body such as the Jupiter-Europa-Ganymede or Sun-Earth-Jupiter systems. To overcome this limitation, that would make it impossible to apply the same technique in the Sun-Earth-Moon system for the EQUULEUS and DESTINY missions, the theoretical framework of the technique is extended in this research. In particular a modified version of the Tisserand parameter defined about the secondary that possesses the same constancy property of the classical Tisserand parameter but on a specifically defined family of Poincaré sections is derived. The concept of the modified Tisserand parameter is based on a relationship between the parameter and the Jacobi constant of the system that can be expressed by the fundamental equation J = T +P .The new parameter and associated Poincaré sections are used to characterize the Earth-Moon and Sun-Earth systems. Through the usage of a graphical tool, the definition of the modified parameter and the definition of a specific family of Poincaré sections, both solar and lunar perturbations are characterized and exploited in the trajectory design process in the multi-body environment. A database approach to be used for the EQUULEUS trajectory design in a quasi-four body problem is developed. Databases of flyby trajectories about the Moon and Jupiter in the Earth-Moon and Sun-Jupiter CR3BP models are also developed. A standard patching procedure is tested in the Sun-Jupiter-Europa environment to demonstrate a capture trajectory about Jupiter.","Multi-body; Tisserand; Extended-Tisserand; Trajectory design; Modified Tisserand parameter; Sun-Earth-Moon; Extended Tisserand-Poincaré; patched CR3BP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-06-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","35.558411, 139.395272"

Most compositional simulators are designed for standard (unconfined) reservoirs. Additional physical phenomena occurring in confined spaces such as capillary pressure, diffusion and adsorption are not taken into account. Moreover, most studies conducted on this topic only focus on shale gas, without regards to the presence of a liquid phase. This thesis focuses on the effects of capillary pressure on a multiphase flow and describes the modified production profiles.<br/>Recent studies have shown that elevated capillary pressure in confined spaces modifies the phase behavior of the hydrocarbon mixture, namely causing a reduction of the bubble point, which in turn affects the oil density and viscosity. These modifications will alter well produc- tion dynamics.<br/>Standard compositional simulators couple a mass balance equation with conservation laws and thermodynamic equilibrium, which comes in the form of a nonlinear constraint describ- ing the equality of chemical potentials. This research work replaces the last condition with a modified K-value constraint. The K-value is simply the ratio of a component’s composition in its vapor phase to its liquid phase. The latter is specific to the pressure, temperature and the hydrocarbon sample’s molar composition; and is derived from equations of state (EOS) which are employed to describe the phase behavior of a system. Capillarity is introduced in the K-value by adding the Parachor model, which determines the interfacial tension and the Laplace equation to the EOS derivation.<br/>The modified K-values are incorporated into Stanford’s Automatic Differentiation General Purpose Research Simulator (ADGPRS) based on a fully implicit approach. Other necessary modifications were made to include the effects of heterogeneity in the system.

The polymer based piezoelectric composites offers high flexibility with low dielectric constant, hence having potential application in energy harvesting systems. Currently quasi-structured and fiber based piezoelectric composites offer the highest piezoelectric properties having the required flexibility for energy harvesting application. The polling processes of these composites though, are not so efficient due to the dielectric mismatch between the ceramic filer and surrounding polymer matrix. This leads to low piezoelectric charge constant than theoretically possible.

Their vessel 'Flintstone' makes use of an innovative closed fallpipe system to provide high accuracy subsea rock installation. <br/><br/>The presence of rocks in the water column of the fallpipe increase the density of the mixture in the fallpipe. The density difference between the mixture in the fallpipe and the density of the surrounding sea-water results in a water level drop in the fallpipe. To keep this water level drop within acceptable limits extra water is added to the fallpipe system which accelerates the fallpipe flow. The accelerated fallpipe flow can result in high outflow velocities of the rock mixture at the fallpipe exit. High outflow velocities of the rock mixture can eventually result in increased impact velocities of the rock particles on the seabed. Increased impact velocities of the rock particles on the seabed can lead to unsatisfactory rock berm shapes resulting in the need for remedials. To have their fallpipe system perform as efficient as possible Tideway Offshore Solutions was interested in possible measures to reduce the outflow velocity of the fallpipe which resulted in this thesis.<br/><br/>In the first part of this thesis different concepts, that could potentially reduce the outflow velocity of the fallpipe, are generated and conceptually analyzed. The information acquired from this analysis is used as input for a multi criteria analysis that resulted in the selection of the most promising concept, the use of a deflector. The deflector will act as a flow deflector at the fallpipe exit thereby decreasing the impact velocity of rock particles on the seabed. In the second part of this thesis a complete three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis is performed on the fallpipe outflow with and without deflector. The CFD program used to simulate these situations is ANSYS Fluent. The simulations for both cases are performed for two different turbulence models, the k – ε and k – ω SST turbulence models, the distance from the fallpipe exit to the seabed is varied as well and a range of deflector angles and dimensions are simulated.<br/><br/>The fluid flow velocities obtained from the CFD analysis are used as input in a MATLAB model to compute the rock particle trajectories in a two-dimensional plane. Combining the rock particle trajectories and their velocity components it is possible to compute the impact velocities of the rock particles on the seabed.

Simple COMSOL simulations were made using plate models to verify the effect of residual tensile stress in membranes as a function of temperature and pressure individually, as well as a combination of both. It was concluded that residual tensile stress does reduce thermal buckling. It also reduces the bulging due to pressure but bulging as a function of pressure can't be made zero. It also concludes thermal buckling is more dominant at lower pressure and pressure bulge is more dominant at higher pressure. <br/><br/>Different residual stress LPCVD SiNx films were deposited and material properties like Young's modulus, refractive index and density were characterized. A saturation to the deposition and residual tensile stress was found as a function of gas-ratio. Surface morphology and IR spectra were also determined using AFM and FTIR respectively. All the characterization done proves the change in material composition with fabrication parameters. The introduction of high residual stress questions the reliability of the membrane and hence, there was a need to check if high tensile residual stress doesn't break the membranes. Thus, a new device for wafer level pressure testing of membranes was designed and fabricated. The pressure bulge test was done and reflections were recorded for various pressure and stress levels. The membranes were found reliable up to a pressure of 1.5 bar. New generation of micro-hotplates were fabricated using this concept and an increment 400oC in the operating temperature of micro-hotplates and nano-reactors, without any-shift in 'z' direction due to temperature, was achieved.","Nano-reactor; Micro-hotplate; MEMS; Silicon Nitride; Bulging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-31","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

These changes can often alter the dynamics of the interaction between the coolant and the structural components and cause Flow Induced Vibrations (FIV) to become more prominent. As analytical methods are often insufficient to predict FIV in complex geometries, numerical approaches are commonly used to predict such phenomena.<br/>Of all the possible modes of excitation in a nuclear reactor, simulating Turbulence Induced Vibrations (TIV) is a particularly challenging problem due to the wide range of scales involves, and is the main focus of this thesis work. Ideally high fidelity fluid solvers using DNS or LES can be used to resolve all the scales involved, but such methods are computationally expensive for complex domains with high Reynolds numbers. In this work, an alternative method to using high fidelity solvers is presented, which involves synthetically modeling the turbulent fluctuations using the known turbulence parameters from U-RANS simulations. These fluctuation fields are then superimposed on top of the average fields and act as the required excitement at the fluid structure interface. The numerical framework in which this method is implemented is first validated with known benchmark cases and it is found that the solver produces accurate results which are in good agreement with the reference data. The capabilities of the synthetic fluctuation modeling in simulating TIV are then assessed by performing simulations of a configuration adopted from an experimental set-up. It is observed that this model is able to reproduce the dynamics of the vibrations observed in the experiments while classical U-RANS model fails to predict physical oscillations.","Turbulence Induced Vibrations; Fluid Structure Interaction; Synthetic Fluctuation Modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

Taking into account the large environmental impact caused by the massive production of structural materials, the change of the current structural design philosophy is becoming essential. Conventional structural engineering approach involves the design of structures fulfilling first strength requirements and second serviceability limit states. The latter applies strict deformation limits mostly related to the comfort of the users and their perception of safety. Adaptive structures get inspiration by organisms present in nature, which are able to adapt their shape and properties as a response to changing surroundings. The capability of a structure to counteract an external stimulus such as earthquake event or strong winds may lead to significant material savings. In particular, adaptive structures are able to react (deform) to applied loads through controlled shape changes and redistribution of internal forces. To this end members with variable length and variable stiffness are required.<br/>The current study focuses on the behaviour of SMP joints which experience two states: locked and released. In the first state, the joint maintains its main function to transfer the loads between the connected elements whereas in the released state the joint becomes softer allowing thus a degree of movement between the elements. 3D printed Shape Memory polymers are chosen as main material due to their variable stiffness properties when exposed to external stimulus such as temperature and their ability to recover their original shape unconstrained. The thermomechanical cycle of thermally triggered SMPs constitutes of the glassy, glass transition and rubbery phase. Glass transition temperature is a threshold temperature, at which the material changes phase and a significant reduction of the young modulus occurs.<br/>Shape Memory Polymers belong to the class of viscoelastic materials with time and temperature dependent properties. A number of experimental tests is performed for the thermomechanical characterization of the polymer. Namely, a rectangular sample is subjected to dynamic loading in a range of frequencies, while the temperature increases from 30oC to 90oC. The storage and loss modulus as well as the phase angle δ are measured as a function of temperature. The storage modulus describes the elastically stored and released energy and it is the actual modulus of the material while the loss modulus represents the dissipated energy due to friction between the molecular chains. From the storage and loss modulus, the Prony Series coefficients needed for the numerical simulation of the material, are calculated. Additionally, tensile tests are performed at various temperatures in order to define the strength and give an indication about the maximum elongation of the material. It is noted that at 25oC the strength of the material is approximately 36MPa. With the increase of the temperature the strength of the material drops while the maximum elongation increases. The shape memory effect of the polymer is also tested at different heating rates and ramp and isothermal temperature conditions. The aim of these tests is to define the factors that may influence the shape recovery phase of the polymer. It is observed that faster heating rates shift the transition phase of the polymer to higher temperatures causing delay on the onset of the recovery phase. On the other hand, slower heating rates enable the recovery process of the polymer at lower temperatures due to the intrinsic relaxation properties of the material. With respect to ramp and isothermal conditions, in both cases shape recovery occurs, with the difference that in first case the increase of the temperature triggers the recovery while in the second case the temperature is kept constant and the relaxation properties of the polymer contribute to the recovery of its original state.<br/>The numerical simulation of the joint is based on the viscoelastic theory and makes use of the Prony Series coefficients calculated by the Dynamic Mechanical Analysis. For the validation of the numerical model, the DMA and the Shape Memory tests are numerically conducted. The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental ones increasing thus the reliability of the results presented in the current study. Last, a truss structure is considered as a case study and the load bearing capacity of the SMP joint is assessed under permanent and variable loads. It is important to be mentioned that only the linear part of the material law is modelled numerically. Hence, the assessment of the load bearing capacity of the joint is realized until the end of the linear part of the stress – strain curve. It is concluded that at glassy state, the SMP joint is able to sustain 95% of the permanent loads and 45% of the Ultimate Limit State load combination. Upon heating, the load bearing capacity of the joint is decreased. At the temperature of 40ºC, the yield stress of the material is 26MPa which drops to 15MPa after necking. At the same temperature, the maximum strain of the material increases up to 150% meaning that it is able to accommodate large shape changes.<br/>To conclude, the current research studies the mechanical behavior of SMPs and their potential use in the field of structural engineering and especially in the design of adaptive structure where large shape changes are required. Although the strength of the material at its glassy state is comparable to other structural materials such as wood its relaxation properties need to be studied carefully. Last, it is proved that SMP can accommodate large shape changes but reinforcement of the material is needed in order to increase its load<br/>bearing capacity. <br/>The present master thesis is part of the research program “Lighthouse Project 2017” entitled “Adaptive Joints with variable stiffness” with principal researcher Qinyu Wang from TU Eindhoven.","Adaptive structures; Structural Joints; Shape Memory Polymer; Stiffness Variability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that distributes digital transactions peer-to-peer to a decentralized network of nodes that verify the transactions and keep a cryptographic secured copy of the entire history of transactions. The network automatically reaches consensus about the correct history of records, which makes the database transparent and immutable. This consensus role makes it possible to take away the third party in certain processes, such as the bank or the notary. Blockchain also enables digital payments and smart contracts. Smart contracts are digital contracts that can be executed automatically by the blockchain. This enables digital registration of for example identity, birth certificates and votes. But smart contracts have many more automation applications that can be coded in computer code, which has the potential of making many processes in both the public as the private sector more efficient and less costly. Governmental services are especially applicable for blockchain, as they could become more efficient and can even be made obsolete in some cases. <br/><br/>Project teams that develop blockchain powered smart contract applications have to work with nascent tools and technology, and a lack of real life use cases. This leads to a lack of empirical knowledge on how to implement smart contracts in governmental services. An overview of guidelines that assist developing project teams is non-existent, which slows down the implementation process. Blockchain technology is not well-researched and smart contract implementation research is even more scarce. A comprehensive overview that shows design phases, design principles and design dilemmas is non-existent, but could greatly assist project teams that implement smart contract applications. Such an overview would speed up the implementation process and can lead to an acceleration of use cases. Therefore, this research focused on answering the main research question: “How can blockchain powered smart contracts be implemented in governmental services?”. <br/><br/>We used the design science approach in order to answer the main research question. The design science approach allowed us for using several sub methods. We started with a literature review and desk research to understand and analyze blockchain technology and smart contracts, followed by a literature review in order to draft the first version of design principles. These were improved by conducting four case studies. With the second version of the design principles, we built the first version of the design framework. These were assessed by six experts, which allowed us to refine the design principles and design framework into a final version. <br/><br/>The 36 design principles are guidelines to aid project teams that implement smart contracts in governmental services. We incorporated these design principles in a framework, that shows which design principles are applicable in the following five phases of smart contract implementation: exploration, conceptualization, testing, implementation and expansion. Each of these phases has its own results and applicable design principles, which is comprehensively indicated in the framework. However, various pairs of principles affect each other, which we call design dilemmas.","blockchain; smart contracts; governmental services; design principles; design framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Many of them are still characterized by waste and inefficiencies, however, innovative digital tools are already changing the way large corporations operate in a variety of sectors. One of the fields that still have room for improvement is product data management (PDM) in the consumer goods industry. Supply chain partners spend huge amount of resources in just fixing manual errors and adapting large data formats. There is not enough standardization in the way product data is exchanged among entities. Inter-organizational information systems (IOS), and more specifically the Global Data Synchronization Network (GDSN), represent the most promising digital tool towards leaner PDM processes. IOSs are computer-based information systems that extend beyond the borders of one organization. They provide automated information exchange to support linked business processes among two or more organizations. The GDSN is a specific IOS for product data management that extends to all the supply chain partners that are exchanging product data, mainly suppliers and retailers. This system can have a big impact in PDM process, potentially reducing errors and inefficiencies to zero. This research aims at addressing the preconditions that are needed to successfully implement this system in a supply chain network. There is evidence that this critical phase can often be underestimated by supply chain professionals. Many FMCG organization have not been able to implement the system despite of the benefits that would bring to the network. A case study is the research methodology used to gather primary data. Other sources such as scientific articles and consulting reports are used to gather secondary data. Henkel and its retailers in the Netherlands and Belgium is the supply chain network used in this case study. The research is performed using an adapted IOS adoption framework. The IOS framework from Pang &amp; Bunker is adapted with the particular characteristics of the GDSN in order to be able to analyze the case using this stand-alone framework. This methodology proves the reliability and validity of the research, as it is founded in a scientific framework. The new research framework is used in the case study to identify the preconditions that play a fundamental role in the success of the project. Finally the critical success factors are outlined, discussed and validated.","Global Standards; Global Data Synchronization Network; Supply Chain Visibility; Operational Efficiency; FMCG Industry; Inter-Organizational Information Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

This means that all industry sectors including the transport sector have to become more energy efficient. The long and short haul trucks are, with 4.95% of the total CO2 equivalent emissions, a major contributor in the transport sector. In order to achieve a reduction in emissions, the European Commission is proposing new regulations that allow for front elongation of trucks. This elongation might improve the aerodynamic efficiency and hence reduce the emissions and fuel costs. Reducing aerodynamic drag for tractor-trailer combinations has been researched for a long period of time. In 1965 Hoerner published the results of his experimental research on 3D bluff bodies and identified that the drag coefficient at the front was related to the total drag coefficient. In 1985 Cooper determined that an optimal front edge radius based on the Reynolds number and the frontal area of the vehicle exists. These two studies concerning bluff bodies formthe basis of numerous follow up studies and this thesis. This thesis analyses how the geometry of an elongated bluff body can be optimized in order to reduce the aerodynamic drag coefficient Typically the flow around a bluff body is characterized instable and separated flow. At the front of the truck the incoming flow velocity reduces to zero at the stagnation point. A high pressure region is formed at this location. Further downstream the flow reaches the front edge corners of the truck, where the flow is accelerated. Flow separation might occur at these front edge corners. At the rear a large low pressure region is formed which contributes to the total drag coefficient. In this thesis numerical simulations are performed in order to identify the relative importance of several front-end design parameters. The numerical calculations are performed by means of the steady-state RANS k ¡! turbulence model. The domain is refined near the surface model and its wake using two density boxes around the model with different cell dimensions and an inflation layer around the model. A wall model is used to approximate the flow behavior in the boundary layer. The wall model and the local refinements reduce the computational time while retaining a high level of accuracy of the numerical solution. The numerical simulation is validated using the data from an already existing wind tunnel experiment. This wind tunnel experiment has been performed on a 1:15 scale model in the Low Turbulence wind tunnel at the TU Delft. First the influence of the mesh cell size is determined by varying the cell sizes of the two density boxes surrounding the model. One density box is close to the model and has small cell dimensions, while the second density box is encapsulating a larger volume. This resulted in chosen cell dimensions with a ratio of 1:4. The discretization error is 4.1%, while the number of cells used is 4.47¤106. The second part is the validation itself. The drag coefficient of the model is 0.297 for the wind tunnel experiment and 0.300 for the simulation,while the base pressure is slightly lower for the numerical simulation. The pressure distribution at the base is not correctly captured in the simulation results. The final part of the validation is the comparison of the boundary layer development. The results of the simulation obtained in this thesis show great similarity with the results found in the wind tunnel experiment.

For the vertical transport system it has been proposed to measure the volumetric concentration of solids inside the booster stations located every 1000m and predict the propagation of solids in between these measurements, it was found that this configuration has the disadvantage that measurement error in the booster stations results in an error over the whole length of a riser section. An unknown parameter of the slurry flow is the particle diameter, this parameter influences the transport velocity of the solids. These two topics resulted in the following question: ""How can the observation of solid concentrations inside a riser be improved?"". <br/><br/>In order to evaluate this research question an observer is designed for a scaled test setup of the VTS, on this setup designed improvements will be tested. Started is with an observability analysis, it was found that pressure difference measurements over a large distance of the riser will increase the observability of the system. In order to apply the observer to the test setup it has been investigated how the pressure difference measurements translate into a measured concentration, it was found that the pressure drop created by the wall friction of the mixture can be approximated with liquid wall friction. The Ensemble Kalman Filter was used to observer the concentration through the riser. An addition of the observer is an estimator for the particle diameter: A proposal for this observer is to adapt the particle diameter by using a proportional integral of the lag found between the concentration estimate over a large distance and the concentration measurement at that point. <br/><br/>The observer has been applied to measurements of a scaled riser section of 140m. It was found that by using a pressure difference measurement over the whole section of a riser, the concentration observation at the top of the riser can by significantly improved. Using the observer it has been enabled to distinguish different mixtures. There are errors in the outcome of the particle diameter estimate due to the fact that at the conditions of the test setup were not optimal, however it has been proven that by applying the particle diameter observer an improvement can be seen in the concentration observation. A sensitivity of the observer was found to be the relation of the pressure difference measurement to the wall roughness of the riser, the effect of this parameter needs to be accounted for by periodically re-determining the wall roughness. <br","Observing; Solid; Concentrations; Veritcal; Transport; Hydraulic; Sytem; Ensemble; Kalman; Filter; Pressure difference; experimental; Measurements; Observe; Observability; Centrifugal pump; Particle diameter; slurry transport; filtering; Unknown Input","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-15","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","Blue Mining",""

Discovering and exploiting the existence of ""redundant"" control strategies - particularly those in close proximity to an optimal strategy - is valuable since this offers operational flexibility in reservoir management. To identify such 'flexible strategies' this thesis proposes a workflow to characterize the space of feasible solutions. The feasible region or feasible solution space consists of all control strategies that deliver an NPV within some threshold from an optimal value. Ensemble-based optimization is performed with strong Wolfe line search to identify an optimal control strategy. The BFGS scheme is used to iteratively approximate the Hessian matrix. One dimensional exploration is performed along the singular vector directions that characterize the null space of the Hessian. A thorough exploration results in an accurate characterization of the feasible region. Such an approach however is computationally intractable in case of realistic reservoirs with multiple hundred controls. To address this, a high-dimensional polytope is first defined using the end points from the exploration step. Subsequently, an innovative cross-section constrained maximum volume ellipsoid is inscribed within this polytope to generate an ellipsoidal approximation of the feasible region. Validation results are then presented which show that even one ellipsoid centred at the optimum control vector coordinate provides a conservative description of the feasible solution space.<br","ensemble optimization; BFGS Hessian approximation; feasible region exploration; ellipsoid fitting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

Using reproductions of paintings opens up doors to interact with paintings like never before. The main challenge was researching how the use of these reproductions of paintings can create an added value in experiencing art for the young audience of the Science Centre (7 to 12 years old), and finding a way to incorporate the research outcomes in the design of an exhibit.<br/>Experiencing art is different for everybody. Although the content of the aesthetic experience is personally dependent, a general structure of the experience can be identified (Csikzentmihalyi &amp; Robinson, 1990). The viewer can be involved with the art on multiple dimensions: the perceptual dimension, the intellectual dimension, the emotional dimension and the conversational dimension. For an engaged aesthetic experience, it is important that the challenges of the work of art on one or more of these dimensions are in balance with the skills of the viewer. If these two are not in balance, the viewer should be facilitated in the process to enable him/her to have an engaged experience.How this facilitation should look like and on which of the dimensions of art it should focus, depends the interests and skills of the user.Research showed that because of the young audience of the Science Centre, the focus in this project should be on the perceptual dimension: facilitating the process of exploring the canvas and consciously looking at the art. This fits best with the aesthetic development of the target group and will enable the Science Centre visitor to have an aesthetic experience relevant to them (Housen, 2008).<br/>The final design of this project makes the aesthetic experience into a tangible experience, by providing the user with clear goals and tools to explore the painting. This way, an engaged aesthetic experience can arise that fits well within the Science Centre context. The design consists of three parts, combining different goals and stances.1) The first part focusses on the formal elements of art: the building blocks of an artwork. Small pieces of the painting are printed separately, for the user to find back in the painting. All search pieces are based on one of the formal elements, making the user aware of their existence.2) For the second part, flowers from the painting are printed separately. The visitors can create extra flowers onto the painting. Doing this, the user can experience how the formal elements are used, and how their actions have effect on the composition and balance of the painting.3) The third part evolves around a personal question. The painting is split into a grid, and the visitors are asked to choose and vote for their favorite piece. This question functions as a probe to look at the painting from a personal point of view.<br/>The design was evaluated in a thorough user research. The research showed that the exhibit enabled the Science Centre visitor to have an engaged aesthetic experience, in which they consciously explored the painting.","Aesthetic Experience; Science Centre; Art reproductions; Art; Exhibit; Museum Experience; Museum Futures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","Museum Futures Graduation Lab",""

However, the current network is limited in its’ capacity and therefore, more and more delay is experienced within daily operations. Research has shown that flightdelays have a high economic impact on the air transport industry. Therefore, the understanding of delay and how it propagates within a network is thus of relevance for the industry. A lot of research has been performed on identifying the causes of delay, as well as their impact on stakeholders’ costs and passengers’ satisfaction. However, it is of equal importance to characterize the propagation of delays within a network of airports thus identifying the role and the sphere of influence airports have with respect to the network. Based on this a research objective has been formulated as follows, The research objective of this thesis assignment is to investigate whether different sources of primary delay induce contrasting dynamics of propagated delay within a network of airportssimulated by a stochastic queuing network model. Based on this research objective, a new model has been proposed, which uses queues to simulate the different processes aircraft experience during the day, within the context of the United States National Aviation System. Each airport within the network has been represented by three queuing systems, which simulate the arrival, turnaround and departure of aircraft. Based on an empirical database of the US domestic market, the queuing parameters have been determined, which enables the simulation of both local queuing delay as well as propagated delay airports received from other airports. To fulfill the research objective, three experiments have been designed, which will be used to test the performance, accuracy and capabilities of the model. First, six days have been selectedwith differentweatherconditions. Then, a day of the week aggregation is performed to test the difference between different days of the week. Finally, a case study has been performed to see the influence of zero, one, and five airports underlow IFR conditions. Based on the results of the simulation model, it can be concluded that themodel is capable of simulating the relationships between airports and their delay sources with the identification of which airports are delaygenerators and which airports are delay receivers. Furthermore, the case study showed that it makes a big difference if one, five or zero airports are affected by capacity limitations. In the scenario with five airports it even resulted in a network-wide effect with propagation of delay from the East coast until the West coast of the United States. Altogether, this project demonstrated that with a relatively simple queuing model, the dynamics of propagated delay could be simulated within a network of airports, but is less capable tomimic the behavior under extreme conditions. At the same time, the model has shown to be able to provide more information on the propagation of delay and its’ source. Moreover, this study showed the identification of the different natural roles airports have within the network.","Case Study; Propagated Flight Delay; Dynamics; Queuing Theory; Stochastic modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Advances in<br/>digital image capturing technology allows for faster video rates, of higher quality, than has been seen before and that trend continues. With greater resolution and increased data flow there is also a need for faster and better hardware for image processing. As the trend introduced in Moore's law is slowing down, and possibly reaching saturation in the coming years, there is an ongoing search for new and different solutions in processor architecture. The trend went from single core to multi core and many core and now we are looking into other designs like memory streaming architectures and runtime reconfigurable computers. This thesis designs, implements and evaluates a programming interface for a dynamically-reconfigurable memory-streaming platform for image processing with a focus on programmability, power consumption, reconfigurability and performance. An application programming interface (API) is created to aid with new code development for the platform. The API is a library of functions that are run on an ARM processor and are used to setup, and communicate with, a stream of ρ-VEX soft processors running on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). In this research we look at other state-of-the-art solutions, for comparison and inspiration, that focus on programmability, reconfiguration and performance. The platform is reconfigurable at runtime and experiments show that it takes under 200 ms to completely reconfigure the fabric and initialize a new configuration of ρ-VEX processors. The platform is tested on a Zynq-7000 chip from Xilinx. Comparison is made between streaming architecture and a many core setup using the same amount of ρ-VEX soft processors. The results show a speedup of factor of 2 by using a single processing stream of seven cores compared with seven cores individually running the same algorithm.

Three subquestions are answered in to finally find the answer to this main question. <br/><br/>Emergency services often arrive too late. Only one out of three ambulances succeeds in meeting the standard. The arrival time depends on several steps in the process. There is a challenge in the end of the process where the collaboration between ambulances, the reporting room and emergency departments (EDs) can be enhanced. By doing this, the arrival times might improve due to an increase in efficiency.<br/><br/>The design goal was ‘Design an IoT based logistic concept that improves the collaboration between reporting room, ambulance staff, and EDs by giving the ambulance staff direct insight in patient stops set by EDs, and giving EDs insight in arriving ambulances’.<br/><br/>With the CommunicAid, the ambulance nurse fills in several fields in the ‘digitaal ritformulier’ (DRF). Based on this and several external factors the system decides which ED is most eligible. The real-time information will be shared with the certain ED and the reporting room. With the CommunicAid, patient stops at the ED will be set digitally. As soon as an ED does this, the reporting room gets an announcement and the DRF notifies it. It will make sure that the certain hospital is not available anymore in the DRF. One hour later, the patient stop is automatically canceled so the ED becomes available again. IoT is required for the information flows between the different devices.<br/><br/>However, implementing the system brings complications with it. In the healthcare sector, all parties work in their own systems that are not able to ‘talk’ to each other. To make it even more complex, also the systems differ between regions. This makes it complicated, expensive and unrealistic to design a solution that fits every region, unless we start from scratch. The CommunicAid should be used as a wake-up call to prove that IoT indeed can improve the ambulance service in the Netherlands. <br/><br/>The societal impact of implementing the CommunicAid in the Rotterdam-Rijnmond region will be direct and positive. Rotterdam-Rijnmond is chosen because the system is designed based on the outcome of the field research. Most elaborate research took place in this region. For the ambulance nurses the communication improves and time will be saved; the system prevents long waiting times at the ED. By creating insight in the arriving ambulances at the ED, the ED nurses can anticipate on the arriving ambulance patients and in this way efficiency can be increased. For reporting room employees implementing the CommunicAid will reduce their workload by automating communication flows. <br/><br/>An important future goal should be to harmonize the operations in acute healthcare in all regions for all involved parties. The dream is that all parties in all regions finally operate in one system for a perfect collaboration. VodafoneZiggo can start this major change in the ambulance service by supplying IoT-connections required for implementing the CommunicAid.<br","IoT; acute healthcare; ambulance service","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The PACT (Pure Air for Cities of Things) project aims to develop novel methods and tools for understanding and demonstrating how intelligent things can act in concert with people and connect to existing data and cloud services. In this context, things are connected artefacts that are able to connect to humans and non-humans via internet with data technologies. Therefore, things have a special influence on humans as compared to other artefacts. Currently, things in the city mostly serve as measurers, an added digital layer that is also referred to as the smart city, but what if things get the ability to act upon their own insights?<br/><br/>The aim of this graduation project is to identify design qualities for things with this kind of agency to perform appropriately during shared practices with citizens in the urban environment. The theme is Things as Citizens; as things are expected to behave conform the behaviour of a citizen in order to coexist with and to be accepted by citizens. The focus is the notion of co-performance in the smart city: a concept that regards the practices of humans and things with agency to be equally important. <br/><br/>A literature review on things and the notion of co-performance as well as practice based research with Dutch citizens: a creative session, contextmapping session and workshop at the yearly event Thingscon, an Internet of Things related conference. The studies showed that a democratic dialogue between citizens and things is needed in order to establish co-performance between both. The design qualities are identified by combining both the literature review and the outcomes of the practice based research into a synthesis. All design qualities are based on values for democratic citizenship: the right of truth, equality, privacy and granted authority. <br/><br/>The result is the design qualities model as can be seen at the right. <br/>In order to evaluate and validate the design qualities, a concept of things in the city is developed that serves as a demonstrator for the theme Things as Citizens. The concept is designed in the context for air pollution and is a provider and distributor of clean air.

The recent IMO Tier III legislation, entered into force in 2016, is forcing the engine manufacturers to meet a NOx reduction of more than 70% from Tier II for all the ships sailing in designated NOx Emission Control Areas (NECA). Although these zones are, up to now, limited to the North American and U.S. Caribbean Sea NECAs, future regions, such as the North Sea and Baltic NECA in 2021 as well as stricter national and port regulations, are increasing the uncertainty regarding the possible compliance methods.<br/>The Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) represents a flexible, proven and commercially available technology capable of reducing more than 80% of the NOx in the exhaust gas. Its adoption started in the ’70s and was aimed at the reduction of stationary source emissions. From early 2000, it has been extended to the automotive industry in order to meet the Euro and EPA legislation for heavy duty and light diesel engines. Despite the evident disadvantages of the high installation cost and the considerable space requirements, the application of the SCR is subjected to a number of operating limits such as the narrow optimal temperature window and the slip of byproducts originated from the chemical reactions. These limitations can be even more severe when the diesel engine undergoes transient and dynamic operations.<br/>The main objective of this research is to gain insights into the behaviour of the SCR technology under steady-state and dynamic operations of the diesel engine. After an accurate literature review of the working principles, reaction kinetics and modeling approach, a first principle model of the SCR has been developed to fulfill the scope. A 1D single channel approach, discretized along the reactor length, has been adopted to sim- ulate the heat exchange and the chemical reactions occurring in the catalyst. To facilitate the integration of the designed model with an existing diesel engine model available in the Maritime and Transport Technology Department of the 3me faculty, the resistance and volume approach has been selected. After the verification of the SCR model, the integrated system ""SCR+Engine"" has been tested under steady-state conditions, to an- alyze the effect that the added back pressure has on the engine performance, and under dynamic conditions, to simulate ""real"" load case scenarios that the SCR might experience.<br/>The designed model, although limited from the chemical reaction point of view, is able to predict NOx reduction and ammonia slip under steady-state and transient operations. It can be further used in an early design phase to investigate the feasibility of the SCR inclusion in the drive trains of ships. Future studies are recommended to optimize the model, by taking into account the sulphur influence on the reduction efficiency and the catalyst aging, and to validate it with real experiments on marine SCR systems.","NOx reduction; Selective catalytic reduction; System integration; Dynamic modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

To assure that the modules are placed on the intended location and to prevent the modules from moving during transportation, a guide and bumper system is used.<br/><br/>During set-down, it is possible that the module bumps into one of the guides. The relative motions between the vessel and the barge can cause significant impulse loads when the module and guide make contact. To prevent the module from being damaged, bumpers are welded onto the module to protect the module during the contact phase. Both the guide and bumpers are designed to only deform elastically and to cope with the expected impulse loads. the designs are based on internal standard criteria that state that the guide and bumper system will be designed for a maximum horizontal load that is 10% of the designed weight of the lifted module. During the design state, this load is statically applied on the weakest spot of the guide and bumper system. In reality, the loads are not applied statically but dynamically and it is still unknown how to correctly estimate the magnitude of the impact.<br/><br/>The estimated loads might differ from the actual loads due to unaccounted forms of energy transfer that occur during the impact, such as the rotation of the module, motions of the bumper and guides or deformations in the guides and bumpers. To analyse the energy transfer during impact and to say something about the magnitude of the impact an experiment was conducted with a scaled model. The scaled model exists of two standard steel guides clamped to steel plates and a squared module with a bumper that with the motions of a pendulum. The module is pulled back to a magnet, from where it is let go to hit both the guides once, after which the module is pulled back again. <br/><br/>The impact location on the guides and bumpers is enclosed with sensors that measure the potential energy in the form of strain and the kinetic energy in the form of accelerations. The sensors are situated so that they enclose the energy flow in every possible direction. For each of the enclosed segments, an energy balance was set-up. The guides were tested as a guide with an inclined brace and as a simple cantilever beam. A number of case studies were tested to analyse the energy transfer as a result of impulse loads and to estimate the magnitude of the loads; impact location on the guides, bumper height of the module (at the CoG of the module, above and below), weight of the module, deviation of the module and different damping materials around the guides. The energy balance consists of the external energy that enters the segment, which should be equal to the energy flux, the energy that exits or enters the segment through the cross-section of its boundaries, the energy rate of the segment and the energy that is dissipated. <br/><br/>Both the externally applied load which was needed to calculate the external energy that enters the system, as well as the rotational velocity that was needed to determine the energy flux, are computed with an analytical model. <br/>This model compares the response of a unit load of 1 to the responses of the experiment. The difference between the two is computed as the applied load on the system. The computed energy balance shows the energy flow through the structure as a result of the impulse load. From the results, it is possible to conclude that the impulse loads in this experiment can be assumed to be linear elastic. Based on these experiments a more accurately description of impulse loads can be used as an input for models, for both duration and shape. The second one is that based on these experiments, at least 97% of the energy is transferred back into motions of the module, the effect of energy transfer in a linear elastic response has little to no effect on the magnitude of the loads.<br","pulse load; guides and bumpers; dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The Q-experiment shows four shared perspectives among experienced battery electric vehicle users, which are all positive. Differences were found comparing these perceptions with perceptions from unexperienced consumers found in literature.

One scenario which contains these elements is drone racing, where pilots have to fly complex tracks at high speed, often in an indoor environment. In this work we therefore present an MAV capable of autonomously flying such a drone race track. The system has to operate in a GPS-denied environment, hence a visual navigation method is employed. Position is recovered from gate detections based on a novel least-squares method, while heading is estimated using an optimization based method. Experiments show that both methods have a higher accuracy than the standard P3P pose estimation method. Furthermore, a state estimation filter is designed to fuse the visual measurements with IMU measurements, by using an EKF with drag based prediction model. For high-level control different motion primitives are linked, which allow the MAV to fly the track without having a detailed on-board map. The overall approach does not rely on SLAM or Visual odometry, which results in low computational complexity. Also, it does not rely on downward optical flow velocity measurements, which enables it to work even in low texture environments.","High-speed; Autonomous flying; MAV; UAV; drone; Visual navigation; EKF","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-09-22","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

A relative new and cheap way of obtaining and collecting data is the use of <i>citizen science</i> or <i>participatory monitoring</i>. Therefore this project investigates if there is any support among the citizens of Myanmar to join participatory monitoring projects and to find out more about the different underlying motivations for people to participate. This research is done by making use of an interview method based on Q methodology and did not only focus on the different reasons for people to participate but it also checked whether the motivations of people differ for different groups in society by making a distinction in age, education level, geographical location and interest. The overall view is that people in Myanmar are open towards joining projects like this. Many young people seemed interested in the concept of participatory monitoring, also because this relative new method to collect information clearly involves normal people like them within projects in which they normally wouldn't get involved in that easily. The implementation of participatory monitoring does not need to cost a lot, since most citizens add little value to receiving payment or certificates in return for collecting measurements for the project. When there is enough attention for the social importance of the research and the 'duty of being a citizen' is emphasized, it must be possible to find a sufficient amount of volunteers that are willing to participate. But while the outcome seems quite positive, there are still a lot of questions that need to be answered, so future research is recommended.","Participatory Monitoring; Citizen Science; Myanmar; Q methodology","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16.871311, 96.199379"

Agent-based modelling is used to gain insights in the case study with regards to the workers’ perception of their own status, power, their skills, (un)employment and the company’s ability to hire those workers. The case is contextualised by the proposal of Santos and Magrini (2018) to sustainably develop the Norte Fluminense region through the implementation of an agro-industrial symbiosis network. It is analysed that an industry revitalised through industrial symbiosis could positively influence its local workforce in terms of job quality and occupational skills. However, this depends on the kind of industry involved, the incentives for the industrial symbiosis network for including the local workforce, and the context and history of that industry. The prerequisite for these positive effects is the provision of additional education needed for the workforce to be included in the revitalisation of the industry. When the appropriate education is organised, the workforce could positively influence the revitalisation of an industry by providing the local support that is needed for industrial symbiosis exchanges to take place. These exchanges are build on the mutual trust of the key personnel of the industrial symbiosis network. The emergence of an industrial symbiosis network from an existing industry should happen gradually; the education for the potential workforce and the creation of jobs should be aligned to avoid unnecessary mismatching between skills required and skills available.","Industrial Symbiosis; Agent-Based Modelling; social simulation; Brazil; sugar industry; local community; workforce","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While oil bank formation is generally successful in longer length cores, it is elusive in short cores (&lt;10cm). Core flooding experiments were performed in a specially designed setup allowing tests to be done on cores with varying length and rock properties. The cores were saturated with a model oil, dodecane, and the injected surfactant polymer slug was optimised using phase behaviour testing. The first objective was to see whether the chosen SP could efficiently mobilise the residual oil left after water flooding and create an oil bank. This was successful in the 17 and 30cm cores as expected, the tests were also successful for the shorter (7cm) cores. A small amount of tests were also done under a CT-scanner. Using iododecane as the dopant, the displacement of oil was visualised at regular intervals during the flooding stages. The images confirm oil bank formation and also gave insight into the rock properties. Although the cores were chosen for its homogeneous properties, many of the cores showed fingering and two layer displacement which would indicate otherwise. Recovery factors averaged around 80\% for the low permeability cores and up to 90\% for the higher permeabilities. Production data was the main source of output data and subjected to various methods of analysis with a focus on effective relative permeabilities. Using the analytical JBN approach which is normally applied on water-flood data, this relatively simple method was tested to see whether it could produce accurate relative permeability curves which are essential to EOR analysis. Current standard practice involves matching pressure and production data which is both complex and time consuming. The resulting relative permeabilities show that under identical displacement processes the surfactant polymer mobilises oil more freely in cores with higher pore volume. The results from the JBN method were compared to results using Shell’s in-house numerical simulator (MoReS). For most core lengths the results from the simulator confirmed the relative permeability curves obtained using the JBN method. In the experiments with large discrepancies further studies should be done to determine whether this was caused by an error in the method or by the heterogeneities in the cores as seen on the CT scan. Using this approach could offer an efficient and robust alternative to the current technique of establishing RelPerm curves.","Relative Permeability; Oil bank; Core flooding; Experimental","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Frozen soil is a powerful tool for engineering purposes due to its increased strength, stiffness and decreased permeability. Water between the soil particles bonds them together, making it possible to use frozen soil bodies as impermeable barriers and load-carrying structures. Furthermore, during a freeze and thaw cycle different processes cause deformations in the frozen and unfrozen soil. For example; frost heave, consolidation of the unfrozen zone, creep and thaw settlements. These phenomena are often called frost actions. Artificial ground freezing (AGF) is regularly used during the construction of cross passages between bored tunnels. The frost actions are expected to increase the loads acting on the lining of the main bored tunnels. This thesis investigates if a quantitative measure of loads due to frost actions on the main tunnels lining can be given with a numerical model, supporting the physical understanding of frozen soil. The objective is to determine if loads due to AGF may be a governing load case on segments of the bored tunnel lining.<br/><br/>Load situations that influence the interaction between frozen soil and the tunnel lining have been identified for the construction of cross passages using AGF. These load situations are based on the principles of ground freezing, construction stages in cross passage construction with AGF, the behaviour of frozen soils and case studies. The following five load situations are identified: frost heave, enclosure of water in the frozen heart, excavation, construction of the lining and thaw weakening. <br/><br/>The load situations have been investigated for one of the cross passages of the Westerschelde tunnel. The studied cross passage was constructed with AGF at a depth of -28,5 m in boom clay. The monitoring program for the studied cross passage of the Westerschelde tunnel was very extensive. Different types of monitors have been used to measure the soil stresses, deformations, water pressures and temperatures in the soil near the cross passage during construction. Before construction, several frozen and unfrozen soil test were carried out on the boom clay. The constitutive model used in the numerical calculation is the frozen and unfrozen soil model of Plaxis. The model requires seventeen model parameters. Furthermore six thermal parameters and three parameters for the soil freezing characteristic curve are necessary. Not all these parameters could be determined directly from the laboratory test, therefore correlations and default values were used as well. The determined parameter set is optimized and validated with help of available laboratory tests. Simulating these simple soil tests gave the opportunity to explore the capabilities of the model. In later stages the optimisation and validation of the parameters turned out to be crucial to obtain a plausible soil response in the large scale models of the cross passage. <br/><br/>The frozen and unfrozen soil model is only available in a two-dimensional version. Therefore, two numerical models have been made representing the construction of the cross passage: one axisymmetric model and one plain strain model. The model results have been compared to the measured data and to each other. The frozen and unfrozen model is able to describe important features of frozen soil behaviour. For more complex engineering challenges, like cross passages, some assumptions in the model are made that influence the capability of the model to simulate certain load situations. The fact that the deformations are independent of the temperature gradient has a large influence on the lining displacements, but also on pore water pressures inside the frozen cylinder. Beforehand it was already known that the constitutive model is rate independent and thus not capable to take creep into account.<br/><br/>Four of the load situations could be qualitatively analysed with the two numerical models .The enclosure of water in the heart of the frozen cylinder could not be simulated with the numerical models. On the other hand, soil stresses due to frost heave and excavation gave a good quantitative measure. In this research one case is extensively investigation, therefore this research is non-statistical. Henceforward, the conclusion cannot be drawn that this quantitative measure of frost heave stresses can also be obtained for other cases. A qualitative measure of loads due to frost heave in construction with AGF can certainly be given with these numerical models. Although not all loads due to AGF could be taken into account (i.e. creep, enclosure of water in the frozen heart), one of the most important load situations (i.e. frost heave) could be quantitatively defined for the boom clay. This load situation is worth investigation in AGF projects, since stresses can become 2.5 times higher than initially measured soil stresses. At the start of the project the boom clay was given a frost-susceptibility index of negligible to low. Even with this mild index the stresses due to frost action increased significantly. This factor and index are probably not the same for other soil types. However, this study shows that such large stress increases are a real possibility during cross passage construction with AGF.<br","Artificial ground freezing; Cross passages; Frozen and unfrozen soil model; Plaxis; Numerical modelling; Westerschelde tunnel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Discrimination between the two components of joint hyper-resistance, i.e. the neural reflexive and intrinsic tissue component, is important since the components require a different treatment method. To discriminate between the two components, objective methods are developed that make use of bio-mechanical modeling. This research aimed to address the agreement between a clinically easy applicable modeling method, the NeuroFlexor method, and a more comprehensive optimization method, which both objectively obtain the neural and intrinsic components of joint hyper-resistance. Furthermore, this research study addressed the agreement between the neural and intrinsic components obtained with the NeuroFlexor and ptimization method, and the external validation of the two components with clinical rating scales. <br/>Method NeuroFlexor based assessments and instrumented positional wrist perturbations were applied to chronic stroke survivors (n = 49) and healthy volunteers (n = 11). The neural and intrinsic components were estimated using the NeuroFlexor method, whose method is a force-relationship method, and a nonlinear electromyography driven wrist optimization model. The Modied Ashworth scale (MAS) was rated to all stroke survivors as clinical scale. Correlation analysis was conducted to nd the agreement between the components of both methods, and to nd the agreement between the MAS and the components. To analyze how well the neural and intrinsic components of both methods were able to predict the MAS, multiple regression analysis with a backward selection procedure was conducted for both methods separately and both methods together. On the healthy subjects, the optimization model was applied on the NeuroFlexor data to check differences in model structure.<br/>Results The neural components of both the NeuroFlexor method and optimization method had a strong correlation (r = 0.656), as well as the intrinsic components (r = 0.648). For both methods, the neural and intrinsic components were signicant estimators of the MAS, and the NeuroFlexor method and the optimization method were approximately equivalently able to predict the MAS (r^2 = 0.466 and r^2 = 0.519, respectively). For the multiple regression analysis with the intrinsic and neural component of both methods together, the neural component of the optimization method together with the intrinsic component of the NeuroFlexor method were more able to describe the MAS (r^2 = 0.605) than the two components of the methods separately. For healthy patients, the optimization model was not able to reliably estimate the two components from the NeuroFlexor data.<br/>Conclusion This study found evidence to support the use of the NeuroFlexor device for quantication of the neural and intrinsic components of wrist hyper-resistance post stroke. Further research is needed to establish the validity of the neural component of the NeuroFlexor and the intrinsic component of the optimization method.","Hyper-resistance; Stroke; Spasticity; Bio-mechanical Modeling; System Identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-03-21","","","","","",""

EVO-it provides the interface of the software that the companies can use for route planning and CQM provides the technology that is used to solve the route planning problems, which concerns a lot of mathematical programming. The difficulty of solving these problems is that real-life problems usually deal withmulti-attribute vehicle routing problems, which are problemswith multiple characteristics, such as time windows and vehicle restrictions. These characteristics influence the solving process and the quality of the solution of the method used to solve the problem. Since these attributes can vary a lot per company, it is a difficult task for CQM to provide the best solving method for all problem types. Even though CQM has provided a very complex method that can handle many problems, it is unclear how far from the optimum solution the provided solutions are.<br/>The goal of this project was to investigate the improvement possibilities of the current method used by CQM.<br/>In this thesis many different solving methods for the vehicle routing problem are evaluated and their qualities are discussed.

One of these methods uses a three-index flow formulation and the other one uses a set partitioning formulation and is based on the method described by Baldacci andMingozzi. It is shown that this latter method can be used to solve instances with up to 40 orders. In addition, both methods can deal with several complicated attributes, including capacity constraints, distance constraints, different type of costs and heterogeneous vehicles. Moreover, it can even deal with instances where not all orders can or need to be scheduled. In such a case, the orders that are not scheduled will get a penalty. To the best of my knowledge, no previous exact method was able to deal with such instances.","Vehicle Routing; Exact algorithm; Exact Method; Set Partitioning; Two-index flow; Three-index flow; heterogeneous vehicles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

INFRA is designed to provide high thermal performance to mass ratio radiator to accommodate increasing payload heat dissipation demands of future Communication satellites. The goal of the project is to deliver proof of concept of an innovative radiator technology which is based on High Performance Radiator (HiPeR) and Micro Mechanical Pumped Loop (μMPL) heritage. INFRA radiator system (RS) is developed in a collaboration project between by Airbus and the Dutch Aerospace Center (NLR), of which the Pump Assembly (PA) subsystem is developed by the NLR and the Foil Radiator Assembly (FRA) subsystem is developed by Airbus. The development of the FRA is covered in this report. The topics which are covered in this report are first the literature review which is performed to provide a knowledge base concerning the radiator systems and its physical/mathematical handles. Part of these theories deal with thermal and structural equations but also breadboard tests and environmental hazards are considered. Followed by the theory are the conceptual design and the system requirements, which focusses on the early development of the system and its characteristics, but also on the technical requirements as these represent the backbone of the technical design. These requirements represent feasible specifications to be able to achieve the system characteristics, which are developed from the wishes of the customers (which are Airbus and NLR). Other important aspects of the system are the interface between the PA and the FR, but also the flow rate and the pressure of the operating fluid. The flow rate is chosen to be 1 &#x1d459;/&#x1d45a;&#x1d456;&#x1d45b; and the absolute pressure is set to be 2 &#x1d44f;&#x1d44e;&#x1d45f;. Dimensioning of the tubing is found to be most important to satisfy the requirements based on these aspects, as they also provide the stiffness of the FR. Therefore, a minimum radius of 3 &#x1d45a;&#x1d45a; is found for the tubing, such that the FR does not deflect further than allowed during operation. The tubing should also be flexible and thin walled to be able to inflate during deployment. Since there are several possibilities available such as using adhesive or welding the tube, these options are considered however are found to be unreliable for the application. Therefore, a closed wall tube is identified which has the most relevant material properties. Since the number of materials are very limited to use for the application due to degradation of the material strength as a result of radiation, but also due to the high temperatures which are tested and the pressures which are expected, it eventually is decided to use Polyimide for the tubing. The foil is based on the developments of the HiPeR suite. The spacing of the tubing is based on a single loop as well as the maximum manufacturable FR width, the layout together with the thickness of the foil are capable of providing a sufficiently high radiator efficiency as the material is highly capable of transporting the heat in plane while maintaining its flexibility. The tubing is also equipped with connectors which are placed between the tubing at the corners of the loop as well as at the ends of the tubes where the interfaces with the PA are located. For the deployment of the FR in space and during the laboratory test, a Hold Down and Release Mechanism (HDRM) is designed which is mounted on the Foil Radiator Fixation (FRF). The HDRM holds down the Foil Radiator Roll Support (FRRS) which is used to roll-up the FR before launch and deploy afterwards. The FRRS is 3D-printed using an Aluminum/Titanium alloy to save time and budget while providing the required mechanical properties. The HDRM also houses a pre-tensioning disk, a lever and a redundant COTS resistor as thermal knife to cut the Dyneema thread that connects the mentioned parts. By rotation of the disk the thread can be pre-tensioned to form a firm grip that cannot be overtaken by the static launch load. The thermal knives are held within Vespel cylinders which are pressed against the thread, that can sustain the temperature required to melt the thread. After cutting the thread a lever is opened by means of a torque spring and the FRRS is released after which the deployment is initiated. The FRRS holds the corner connectors in place by means of Vespel parts, which isolate the tubing thermally from the Aluminum FRRS structure. The FRF is a clamp which compresses a stack of Norcoat Liege onto the base of the FR to transfer the deployment forces but also isolate the FR thermally during operation. The heat leakage to the structural parts is roughly 1% of the total heat transfer from the FR. The mechanical strength of the entire FR as well as metal items is calculated to be able to handle launch loads by using a first order conservative approach.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-21","","","","Aerospace Engineering","INFRA (Inflatable Radiator)",""

But the current power curve is typically univariate: only dependent on the wind speed and slightly adjusted for site density, turbulence intensity and wind shear. This method limits the amount of atmospheric conditions taken into account, which (could) affect turbine performance. Therefore the Power Curve Working Group introduced<br/>the concept of an inner power curve (for common conditions) and an outer power curve (for all other conditions). While this is an improvement, it would be desirable to have not 1, not 2, but a multitude of power curves for different conditions.<br/><br/>This multitude of power curves, for a range of atmospheric conditions, is the goal of this thesis. Using a non-parametric machine learning method, a neural network, the feasibility of modeling a wind turbine’s power curve from historical data is studied. This resulted in a model which provides a refinement on the warranted power curve (provided by the manufacturer) for certain conditions of 7 atmospheric parameters. These parameters are wind speed, turbulence intensity, wind shear, wind veer, temperature, pressure and humidity, but could in theory be extended to more parameters.<br/><br/>This model resulted in three sub-models, which: 1) assess individual parameter impact/sensitivity on turbine performance, 2) provide for a company tool to continue power curve verification after a few years and 3) provide a general model to refine long-term energy yield estimations for future wind farms. Despite<br/>the somewhat limited model and currently available datasets to train the models from, both predictive models show improved accuracy compared to the traditional power curve. Besides validation with theory, the impact assessment model allowed for investigation of the impact of certain atmospheric conditions on<br/>the performance of certain wind turbines.","Wind Energy; Power curve; Machine Learning; Neural Networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

Based on a series of past flights of Ariane 5 launcher, the aim is to analyze the fluid motion and the pressure fluctuations in the cryogenic propulsion upper stage Liquid Hydrogen (LH<sub>2</sub>) and Liquid Oxygen (LO<sub>x</sub>) tanks during the ascent phase. Pressure fluctuations (drops or rises) during the ascent phase are undesirable due to the need for relief or re-pressurization of the fuel tanks. Tank relief is obtained through relief valves, while re-pressurization is done using on-board gaseous Helium; both cases increase the failure probability of the system and/or the total weight of the launcher.The objective of the project is to find out why these pressure fluctuations occur, what are the parameters that affect the pressure evolution and at what extend the liquid fuel motion (sloshing) is responsible for this behavior.According to the literature several parameters affect the pressure evolution during sloshing. These parameters are further investigated through flight data analysis. The approach also involves CFD simulations of the kinematic behavior of the liquid fuel focusing on the sloshing angle. Finally, a statistical model is built attempting to predict the pressure change inside the tanks. Higher sloshing angles match with higher pressure rise inside the LO<sub>x</sub> tank. The magnitude of the pressure rise appears to be directly connected to the kinematic profile of the launcher as well as to the ullage volume of the tank. The maximum predicted ullage pressure is below the tank's sizing pressure limit. Regarding the LH<sub>2</sub> tank, no strong correlation of flight parameters to the pressure change is identified; no sufficient statistical model is built. The CFD simulation shows that relatively higher sloshing angle magnitude and duration exists near the pressure drop periods and that strong breaking waves are likely to be formed in the case of a sudden pressure drop behavior. The LH<sub>2 </sub>tank is more prone to the formation of breaking/splashing waves. The effect of vibrations, which is not included in the CFD study, is also important for the explanation of the pressure drop magnitude.","Cryogenic Tanks; Sloshing; Ariane 5 Launcher; Ascent Phase; Flight Data Analysis; CFD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This last development in the field of the air cargo road feeder service (RFS) is also known as Direct Trucking Pick-up (DTP). In the current air cargo business models, all cargo is delivered via a freight forwarder to combination carriers (carrying both passengers and cargo). In the existing organizational cargo structures, there is no direct link from customer to combination carriers. The traditional model of air-cargo transportation, has been challenged in recent years. This stresses the need for research regarding the green field of the DTP model, researched in this thesis. It is important for the combination air cargo carriers to consider how to deal with future competition. Using several theories, such as lean manufacturing and transaction cost economics (TCE), the performance of the current state of an in-depth case study for KLM Cargo was analysed. Based on the measurements and analysis, several problems were identified and a framework had to be developed as a test platform to test several improvement scenarios. Using the discrete event simulation tool Simio, a model was created serving as a test platform. Simulation was used to explore various opportunities of process improvements and the impact of the proposed changes before implementation. The 5 proposed improvement scenarios were tested using the test platform. It can be concluded that all scenarios improve / enhance the DTP supply chain.<br","Air Cargo; KLM Cargo; Direct Trucking Pick-up; Road Feeder Service; Line-haul Trucking; Transaction Cost Economics; Seamless Supply Chain; Discrete Event Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

The Model Code 2010 (fib, 2012) suggest several safety formats to perform non-linear finite element analyses with an intended reliability index β_R=3.04. The safety formats seems to be safe for statically determinate structures with a predictable failure mode. For instance a bending failure in a simply supported reinforced concrete beam. However it is unclear if the intended safety level is met for statically indeterminate structures. Since the redundancy of the structural system and the several possibilities to redistribute the internal forces could lead to unpredictable failure modes.<br/> <br/>In this thesis three reinforced concrete portal frame designs are used to evaluate the probability of failure of the structural resistance determined with the safety formats i.e. the safety of the safety formats will be assessed. The ductility of the portal frame designs determines the degree of redistribution of the internal forces. Therefore this case study will focus on three portal frame designs with all a different ductile behavior. The global design resistance is determined according to the following safety formats: the global resistance factor method (GRFm), the estimation of a coefficient of variation (ECOV) method and the partial factor method (PFm). A comparison is made with the local design resistance of the portal frame designs according to the Eurocode 2 using partial safety factors.<br/><br/>The reliability level of the structural design resistance according to the least conservative safety formats is determined for each portal frame design. Several response surfaces were constructed and the first order reliability method (FORM) was used to determine the reliability level. In case of relatively low material and geometrical uncertainties the safety formats lead to a structural resistance that can safely be used i.e. the intended reliability level is met. However when the detailing uncertainties in concrete frame corners are relatively large these uncertainties should be implemented in the safety formats. Further research and more experimental results are needed to make a better estimation of the (model) uncertainties possible.<br/><br/>Finally, the used methods are evaluated and several comments are given on the difficulties of using those methods. Constructing a response surface in combination with the FORM in order to find the design point is definitely not an automated process as the mathematical procedures seems to indicate.<br","non-Linear Finite Element Analysis; safety formats; safety assessment; first order reliability method; FORM; response surface; NLFEA; Model Code 2010; Eurocode 2","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

The rheological behaviour of elongated granular particles is therefore not well known. This thesis deals with suspensions of rod-like particles of aspect ratio 4 subjected to shear flow in a low-density, highly viscous Newtonian fluid. CFD-DEM simulations for a periodic shear box have been performed for a pre-estimated range of shear rates and volume fractions. Dependence of rheological properties like shear stresses, relative viscosity, granular temperature, pressure and normal stress differences on the shear rate and volume fraction have been studied. These granular rods show shear thickening behaviour. The spherocylindrical particle suspensions experience less collisional stresses than spherical particles due to preferred particle alignment in the shear direction. Herschel and Bulkley [1] model is used to fit the collisional stress data. Two different regimes have been identified for granular suspension based on the flow index. Interestingly, a relatively large range of shear rates and associated stress can be expressed in the form of a simple equation based on Broughton and Squires [2] model. This stress closure will further be used in more coarse grid models like MP-PIC which can simulate an industrial fluidized bed reactors of non-spherical particles.","Discrete Element Method; CFD-DEM Coupling; Spherocylindrical Particle; Rheology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

The tunnelling technique used is the ‘slurry shield’ method, which uses a tunnel-boring machine (TBM). The TBM consists of a steel cylinder with a cutting wheel at the front. At the face of the TBM, called bore front, a pressurised slurry is used as face support. The aim of a static tunnel face stability assessment is to determine the horizontal effective stress and pore water pressure acting at the tunnel face both during boring and a standstill. While the pore water pressure distribution along the tunnel is clear, the estimation of the horizontal effective stress distribution is difficult. At the moment many calculation models have been developed to calculate the latter, but none ever made it into a standard. The first part of this thesis consists of a comparative study between the Ruse-Vermeer (2002), Jancsecz-Steiner model (1984) and DIN4126+4085-model (2008). A theoretical background analysis has been performed for each model; by using a case study analysis, the effect of the models’ differences on the minimum support pressures has been determined. Thereafter, this theoretical analysis has shifted to a more ‘practical’ project analysis by including external aspects like project aspects, soil conditions and contract requirements. From the practical project analysis it resulted that at the entrance zones, the soil cover is limited and thus additional surcharge is required. The placement of this additional surcharge lead to consolidation in the subsoil which can subsequently influences the static face stability assessment. Within this research a model is proposed in order to incorporate a one-dimensional vertical consolidation analysis within face stability assessment. During tunnelling a continuous process of slurry penetration and excavation takes place and therefore, the interaction between the support fluid, advancement of the TBM and the soil needs to be taken into account. The combination of these two time-dependent effects can possibly lead to the build-up of excess pore pressures in front of the tunnel face which has a high influence on the minimum support pressure. The second part of this research investigates the possibility to include the time dependent effect of slurry infiltration and excavation within a face stability assessment e.g. transient face stability assessment. The last part of this research is based on the role of slurry TBM parameters on ground deformations. Due to overcutting and the tapered shape of the TBM, a joint (annulus) is present between the TBM and the soil formation. In this research it is assumed that the annulus is hydraulically connected to the face. This means that the annulus is pressurized with bentonite slurry originating from the face. Due to the slurry pressure gradient and hydraulic connection with the annulus, not at each location the exact geostatic stress can be reached and ground deformations will inevitably take place.","Face stability; Tunnelling; Consolidation; Excess pore water pressure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","De Rijnlandroute",""

However, the complexity, uncertainty, transforming potential and barriers to adoption associated with blockchain technology make it hard to assess its impact on insurers. Therefore, this research aims to help insurance industry business decision makers to anticipate the impact of blockchain technology on their business models, by finding the most important parts of the business model that need to be addressed. It does so by means of expert interviews and a business model stress test workshop. In this workshop, experts assess the impact of uncertain future developments on an insurance reference business model which is described using the STOF business model ontology.<br/>It has been found that currently, enterprise-grade blockchain solutions that meet the requirements of the insurance industry regarding governance, privacy, scalability, identity and access management, security and reliability are not available. Besides no concrete insurance use cases that will actually realize benefits have been found. Therefore, it is hard to justify investments that are specifically targeted at blockchain technology. However, there are two investments insurers should make that are not specifically targeted at blockchain technology, but will prepare insurers for technological innovation, whether blockchain will reach maturity in the near future or not. The first and most important investment is related to standardization. The workshops led to the insight that the most crucial uncertainty outcome is the strength of cooperation. The standardization of data formats and field descriptions is a prerequisite for this cooperation. Insurers just started this standardization in order to facilitate data exchange with other insurers. Insurers should continue their standardization efforts, as it will facilitate data exchange in the insurance value chain and being compliant with GDPR, regardless whether blockchain will be implemented. The second investment is related to rationalization, it will enable insurers to respond more quickly to changes in IT and be compliant with regulation. Blockchain can be a driver for thinking about how systems can be developed to support decentralization, a division of roles and agility, however, the rationalization process should not be targeted to a specific blockchain platform, as it is hard to choose from the scattered field of blockchain platforms.<br","business model; technology impact; blockchain; insurance; STOF; scenario analysis; tooling; stress testing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Kirkenier, Joost (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The increasing demand in renewable energy motivates the search for new renewable energy sources. The ocean is a vast energy source of both thermal and kinetic energy, however methods to harness this energy haven’t reached maturity yet. Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC), a method to harness the thermal energy of the ocean, could change this. In order to get to this stage of maturity, experimental and numerical research on the OTEC power cycle was done by Goudriaan [12] and Kuikhoven [23]. However, the numerical model developed showed inaccuracy for the condenser and lacked physical insight into the processes of heat transfer. The condenser and consequently, the cold water pipe, are a significant part of the investment costs of an OTEC plant. Therefore, the goal in this research was to increase the accuracy of the performance calculations of the condenser and to gain more knowledge on the physical phenomena in the condenser heat exchanger.<br/><br/>Two different methods were tested in order to improve the condenser model. In the first part a heat transfer correlation is fitted to the experimental data. A literature study was done on two phase heat transfer correlations to investigate what phenomena occur in two phase condensation flow. Relevant dimensionless quantities were chosen accordingly. The quantities used are the conventional Reynolds and Prandtl number. The mass transfer that occurs through absorption was represented by the Schmidt number.<br/><br/>The resulting correlation fit was tested on accuracy using the experimental data obtained by Goudriaan [12] and Kuikhoven [23]. To be able to compare the results of this research with their research, the in-depth validation was done for the same working fluid mass flow of 0.010 kg/s that was used by Goudriaan [12] and Kuikhoven [23]. The Schmidt number showed a positive effect on the accuracy.<br/><br/>The correlation was extrapolated for other working fluid mass flows as well. It was found that the correlation fit is a useful tool for the working fluid mass flows that have a large amount of experimental data available (the cases 0.007, 0.010 and 0.013 kg/s) but isn’t as accurate for working fluid mass flow with a small amount of experimental data available (0.005 kg/s).<br/><br/>In the second part of the report a detailed condenser model was developed using the method of Fernández- Seara et al. [10]. This model was used to provide more physical insight into the two phase mixture behaviour in a condensation process. The model is also capable of predicting the required pressure on the working fluid side to provide full condensation.<br/><br/>Literature research was done on different aspects of the condensation process in a plate heat exchanger. Film thickness correlations were tested. Different heat transfer correlations developed for plate heat exchangers were investigated. Flow pattern theory and flow pattern maps were used to predict the flow behaviour. The method of Fernández-Seara et al. [10] was used to predict mass transfer through the vapor-liquid interface in the working fluid. A pressure iteration loop was added to predict the condenser pressure on the working fluid side.<br/><br/>The initial results were slightly off compared to the experimental measurements. The reason for the inaccuracy is expected to be the neglection of surface tension effects on the wettability of the working fluid. Dry surface voids are expected to occur in the liquid film with decreasing concentration. A correction factor based on surface tension was added to include this effect. The 0.010 kg/s case was validated in detail and showed decent accuracy. At 0.007 kg/s working fluid mass flow deviations were slightly more significant but the trends of the characteristic variables were similar to the experimental data. The mass transfer iteration loop showed inaccuracies and instabilities at the working fluid mass flows of 0.005 and 0.013 kg/s.<br/><br/>The model showed that for the range tested the condenser performs better with increasing concentration of ammonia. The non-linear behaviour of the mass diffusivity decreases the mass transfer coefficients at decreasing concentrations. The surface tension correction factor also adds to the decrease in performance, however, if the mass flux of the working fluid would be higher, this correction factor might not be valid because the dry surface voids might not occur any more. The overall heat transfer coefficient increases towards the outlet of the condenser.","OTEC; Condenser; Ammonia-water; Numerical model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-19","","","","","",""

Children from the age of 2 to 5 are in the middle of their physical growth and development. This is also the age group with the highest risk of being diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The disease and treatment cause stagnation in the children's physical development. The body focuses on fighting the disease and that stops the children from moving and playing because they feel weak and insecure. Therefore, the goal is to create a (home) situation in which young children with ALL can freely play, while doing therapeutically relevant movements without professional supervision. What is missing from the current solutions like exercise programs from physiotherapists is a solution that attune to children’s natural way of engaging in physical activity, namely through play. Such solutions acknowledge the child as a child again, rather than a patient. <br/><br/>Hobble was created with the intention to hide the therapeutically relevant exercises and movements in the toy, so the children could freely play. Hobble can walk forward by means of two wheels that can be switched for others. Each set or combination of wheels changes Hobble’s behaviour and walking pattern. The result is that Hobble’s characteristics and role change, dependent on the child’s interpretation. Hobble can walk, chase, follow, stunt and get stuck. Hobble has a hard time walking straight and is intentionally clumsy so it needs help often. This stimulates locomotion and gives children a sense of control that boosts their confidence and motivation to play more. Thus, Hobble elicits therapeutically relevant movement that the physiotherapists want to seem.

The design space enables more informed design decisions when creating protocols and lays the foundation for further studies in finding desirable protocol properties that in turn improve the quality of the negotiation outcome.","Genius; Automated Negotiation; Multilateral; Turn-taking; Negotiations; Multiparty; Protocol; Protocol Evaluation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current strategy offering is too complicated to be taken as is and used by the Italian team, as no guidance on the use and application of such phase was provided. The strategy package needs to be redesigned for an easy application into an already running workflow. On the other hand, a second problem lies in the communication of such strategic offering. In fact, the addition of a new project phase needs to be properly communicated to ensure a successful integration. Unispace employees need to be educated on the values of workplace strategy and guided through its structure to learn applying it themselves. <br/><br/>The thesis goal was therefore articulated as follow:<br/>(01) Simplify a framework of strategic tools, (02) adapt it to the company market, <br/>and (03) design a communication strategy to illustrate the value of such strategic offering.<br/><br/>A deeper analysis was developed and highlighted what directions the final design could follow to reach the aforementioned final objectives. It emerged that (a) a greater engagement of the clients during the strategy phase had to be provided, as only technical activities were performed in the studio. This enables the projects to lose its foreign character and it supports Unispace in building a relationship with the client, enhancing the chance of being entrusted for the next project phases. For acting as a leader, Unispace team needs to have a clear understanding on the strategy steps to follow, as a confused guidance does not express confidence. Therefore, (b) the structure had to be implemented, separating the phase of strategy and design, which currently largely overlap. Also, the final design had to (c) support Unispace playing offence, anticipating clients’ needs, offering adequate support and acting as a project leader.<br/><br/>Having identified the problems, set the thesis goals and identified the design objectives, the final design was developed. This resulted in multiple tools for Unispace Italy to successfully perform strategy as an independent stage:<br/><br/>An easy to understand and simplified strategy offering, with clear explanation on the value of workplace strategy and a set of cards to organize and perform all the strategy tools offered to clients by Unispace. Also, InDesign and Illustrator template files are given to the company to have the basic materials to perform the strategy tools. These serve as a beginner guide for any Unispace Italy employees approaching to strategy. It is an internal communication tool for making Unispace Italy employees aware of the possibility of design strategy applied to workplace projects. <br/><br/>Based on Unispace Italy clients analysis and scholar research on Roger’s innovation adoption categories, a new tool is designed. This helps to identify the client’s approach to innovation, understand if it is worth investing strategy in the project and, where necessary, it suggests the correct strategy package to offer. Also,a new service blueprint is outlined. These enable Unispace Italy to play offence, anticipating client’ needs and confidentially leading the project.<br/><br/>At this point, Unispace Italy has all the tools to successfully integrate and perform the strategy phase into the current workflow.","workplace strategy; Communication; Service Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

Secondary wing is oriented in a biplane configuration above propeller and intends to improve propeller’s performance by decreasing propeller’s inflow velocity.

Eliminating viscous effects from the analysis, reduced the demanded computational cost of this study and could help this research to perform a broader investigation. The influence of isothermal flow condition on Euler calculation was examined to reduce the computational cost of optimization study; This study showed that the drag coefficient of system is sensitive to this assumption and that only by simulating the initial and final points of the optimization study with adiabatic flow condition, the use of isothermal flow condition could be justified.

The United States was caught by surprise and the attacks triggered a renewed interest in aviation security. It was well recognized that airport security was one step behind on intelligent attackers and this created the need to developed better risk assessment methods.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, none of the risk assessment methods developed has the possibility to quantify the vulnerabilities in an airport checkpoint. One of the main challenges in developing a method which can do this, is to find a technique that can account for the complexity of the airport environment from which the vulnerabilities emerge. Furthermore empirical research has shown that security operators do not necessarily follow protocol, but behave as autonomous agents which regularly bend or break the rules.<br/><br/>A method which can potentially identify vulnerabilities in such a complex environment is agent based modeling. This modeling technique has proven to be very powerful in modeling complex systems that emerge from the behaviour of autonomous agents. Some work has been done in this area, but until now this technique has not been used to quantify vulnerabilities in an airport checkpoint. Therefore, the aim of this project is to develop an agent based model of an airport checkpoint, quantify the vulnerabilities emerging from this checkpoint and analyze the effect of employee behaviour on these vulnerabilities. To do this, the behaviour of the security operators is modeled using models that are rooted in behavioural psychology and have strong empirical backing. The employees decision making is modeled using Decision Field Theory and the employee performance is modeled using the Functional State Model. <br/><br/>With the model developed, a set of experiments is performed to calibrate the model and analyze the vulnerabilities. These experiments result in the quantification of vulnerabilities for a predefined set of threat scenarios.<br/><br/>The analysis of these threat scenarios shows that employee behaviour mainly impact threats scenarios in which a weapon is hidden in the carry-on baggage. The reason that security operators have a large influence on the outcome of this screening process is that it is the process in which employees have to perform multiple activities and make multiple decisions. It is found that the vulnerabilities in this screening process are mainly dependent on the speed/accuracy trade-off as made by the employees. The perceived risk of the detected prohibited items plays a limited role, since most prohibited items are only seen as a small risk. The performance of the employees played a less important role on the outcome of the screening process and differences in performance are mainly caused by the personality type of the agents. The personality type that put more effort into a task, outperformed the other agents. The skill level of the operators however, did not significantly effect the outcome the simulation. This suggests that the effort an operator puts in is more important than the skill level of the operator.<br/><br/>Finally it is found that it is beneficial to minimize the number of steps in the screening process. This benefits overall performance, since adding steps to the screening process means adding opportunities to make mistakes.","Agent-based modelling and simulation; vulnerability; Airport Security; sociotechnical system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Many promising technologies of wave energy conversion have been developed, such as the Oscillating Water Column. BAM Infraconsult B.V. has developed the Ocean Falls concept of an oscillating water column that has the addition of a tube and a back wall which is able to move in order to change resonant characteristics of the structure to match incoming wave frequencies.<br/><br/>A numerical model has been made to capture the dynamic behaviour of the oscillating water column represented as a ""rigid piston"", where the system is modelled as a linear mass-spring-damper. The internal water surface is assumed to be horizontal and flat, both valid approximations for small chamber widths with respect to the wavelength of the incoming wave. The hydrodynamic coefficients, as well as the excitation force on the piston have been obtained using the ANSYS AQWA software. Thermodynamics in the chamber have been included by assuming a linear, adiabatic and reversible air flow. Furthermore, pressure oscillations in the chamber due to the oscillation of water are assumed small compared to the atmospheric pressure. The equation of motion of the piston is coupled to the pressure oscillations inside the air chamber, which includes linear turbine damping and air compressibility. The response of the system has been studied in the frequency domain for regular and irregular waves.<br/><br/>Model experiments have been performed to compare the linear model to experiment results for regular waves. The turbine damping has been modelled by adding a lid on the air chamber containing an opening where air can flow through. The area of the opening is related to the level of damping induced on the water surface inside the chamber. Two back wall positions and three different damping cases have been studied.<br/><br/>Air compression has been negated from the linear model while comparing to experiments due to scaling complications and the relatively small effect of air compression. For the case with no turbine damping the model experiments indicate a longer resonant period compared to the linear model. This difference, to a smaller extent, is also visible in the damping cases. The measured flow in the damping cases is slightly larger than the linear model. Pressure measurements compare well with the linear model. Efficiency is defined to be the power in the waves divided by the power available to a power take-off system, such as a turbine. For the low damping case the efficiency measured and efficiency computed in the linear model compare well and both give a peak efficiency of around 60\%, contrary to the high damping cases where the model under-predicts the measured efficiency, indicating a higher damping input into the model possibly due to the linearisation of the damping. For high damping the experiments also give an efficiency of around 60\% while the numerical model predicts this to be circa 50\%.","Oscillating water column; Wave energy; Hydrodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); van den Bos, J.P. (graduation committee); Scholl, Olaf (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The coastal waters of Nigeria are a difficult environment to build structures to control the local morphology and hydrodynamic conditions to ones desire. This difficulty is a consequence of the persistent high-energy swell wave climate and Longshore Sediment Transport (LST) in the order of one million cubic metres per<br/>year. Besides these tough conditions, the costs of conventional coastal mitigation solutions are high because of the lack of suitable material (rock) close by. These characteristics of the Nigerian coast led to the interest, whether it is possible to design and construct a ’Sand Breakwater’ for a planned port on the Nigerian coastline at Badagry. A ’Sand Breakwater’ is the complete construction which functions as the protection of the port and creates shelter from incoming waves for ships inside, consisting out of components (partly) made out of sand and hard structures. Especially the very uni-directional and consistent character of the wave climate creates an opportunity to embrace natural processes in the design. In addition, much sand needs to be dredged for the creation of the approach channel along with the port’s basin. This volume of sand might possibly be re-used for a sand breakwater.<br/>This report presents the feasibility of a sand breakwater on the Nigerian coastline at Badagry. This feasibility is determined both morphologically and economically. Long term coastline development was modelled with the one-line coastline evolution model LITPACK. Results show that the persistent uni-directional character of the wave climate prevailing at the coast of Badagry forces an equilibrium coastline orientation of 277.5 degrees with respect to True North (TN). Because of this, all other orientations of coast rather than the equilibrium orientation are vulnerable and will develop to the equilibrium orientation over time. The implementation of this equilibrium orientation in the design along with some hard structures led to multiple long term morphological<br/>stable conceptual variants for a sand breakwater. The coastline impacts of these variants west of the sand breakwater were examined on large scale. In 38 years after construction a maximum of 20 meters coastline retreat occurs, which is considered acceptable. After this period, only shoreline accretion takes place.<br/>To establish complete conceptual designs, the cross-shore profiles are first determined. The submerged part of the profile up to the top of the intertidal profile is constructed by integration of measured data in the design. The emerged part of the profile concerns the cross-section of a dune and was the critical part for the designing objective. To determine these profiles, first the design crest height is determined by applying maxmimum acceptable overtopping volumes (Tilmans, 1983). Knowing the design crest height, the dune width is determined by modelling storm impact. This width is established by examining storm impact and determine what minimal required width needs to be present for the sand breakwater to live up to its design criteria.<br/>Storm impact for the found conceptual variants is examined with the numerical software XBeach to determine cross-shore sediment transport during storm impact. The impact of storms with shorter return periods results to be relatively high in comparison to the storms with longer return periods. This is taken into account by adapting the design conditions. The design storm conditions are based on the impact of a storms with a 1/100 year return period along with an expansion for a consecutive storm with a return period of 1/1 year. With this<br/>storm impact known, the required crest width is determined and with that the minimal required cross-shore profiles for the multiple variants are established. Consequently, besides long term morphologically stable, the conceptual designs are capable to design storm impact, confirming the morphological feasibility.<br/>In order to define the economical feasibility of a sand breakwater, a comparison between the different conceptual variants and a conventional design is made. This comparison is conducted via a rough cost comparison along with examining future prospects. In order to be able to make this cost comparison, rough volume estimations are done for all conceptual variants and conventional design. These volume estimations combined with unit prices lead to a rough cost comparison. From this rough cost comparison appears that a sand breakwater<br/>showed to be in the same price range as a conventional design.<br/>Three future prospects of a sand breakwater are determined. First of all the by-pass of sand is compared for the conceptual designs to the conventional design. The characteristic LST is problematic due to the occurrence of sand by-passing causing sedimentation in the approach channel and port. One of the conceptual variants shows that a sand breakwater is proven to be able to provide a period without by-passing of sand in the same order of magnitude as a conventional design.<br/>Another future prospect is the required maintenance necessary to execute for the sand breakwater. The XBeach results of lower storm conditions show that maintenance costs are high. However, these results are assumed to be heavily overestimated. Results with more specific ’Nigerian conditions’ create reason to believe that maintenance for lower storm conditions will be much lower and in acceptable range.<br/>The last future prospect concerns the accreted land which arises due to the blockage of LST. A sand breakwater creates the possibility of acquiring land for new port space which is not possible with a conventional breakwater. In addition, the value of a Building with Nature component is present in this project and could enhance its economical interest.<br/>Not only the morphological but also the economical feasibility of a sand breakwater is confirmed.

Several ice shelves at the Antarctic Peninsula, a region that has experienced an atmospheric warming much larger than the global average, have retreated and disappeared. In order to assess the stability of the ice shelves, snowmelt amount can be used. Microwave remote sensing instruments are used in studying surface melting. The presence of liquid water causes a decrease in volumetric scattering that is dominant over absorption in dry snow, and increases absorption due to the increase of the imaginary part of snow permittivity. Thus, active microwave scatterometers can detect melt because of the decrease in backscatter. In this study, data from QuikSCAT (2000-2009) and ASCAT (2010-2016) are used for the investigation of the Antarctic surface melting dynamics for the period 2000-2016. The methodologies of Trusel et al. (2012) and Bothale et al. (2015) and two other threshold-based melt detection methodologies are applied and evaluated using in-situ meteorological records and are compared to passive microwave threshold-based melt duration results from AMSR-E and AMSR2. In addition, an attempt for a retrieval of a consistent melt time series is performed. The results support the use of a dynamic threshold-based melt detection approach for scatterometer data, but it is not possible to achieve consistency in melt duration results from the two scatterometers mainly due to their differences overpass timing. Overall, a high interannual variation in melt extent and melt index is found and results show that the extent of the areas that experience morning and afternoon melt consistently remains constant through the years. However, morning measurements underestimate melt and thus midday observations are important for melt detection studies, as melting varies throughout the day. In addition, although most of the large scale melting phenomena are captured by AMSR-E, the higher sensitivity of QuikSCAT to melt and its finer resolution result in differences in the derived melt metrics.","surface melting; scatterometers; radiometers; Antarctica","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The problem of reaching the global objective generally results in a consensus problem requiring communication amongst the agents. The cooperative manipulation problem, where a payload is manipulated using multiple robots, poses an attractive alternative: By using the payload's motion as the means of communication, the agents can reach consensus without using explicit communication. The advantage being that no additional bandwidth is required as the number of participating agents increases and all to all communication is effectively achieved.<br/><br/>Whereas previous works considered only the translation dynamics this thesis work considers the use of the full rigid body motion as a means of communication, such that the agents reach consensus on the desired wrench and the payload is stabilized at any desired configuration. As a possible application the towing of a payload by multiple UAV via cables is considered. This brings the additional challenge of underactuation from the perspective of each agent, since only forces can be used to control the full payload's motion.<br/><br/>The result is a decentralized nonlinear control law for the forces applied to a payload such that consensus is reached amongst the agents, the leader's control action is amplified and the payload is stabilized at any desired configuration.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In the European Union greenhouse gas emissions of heavy duty vehicles make up 30% of the total caused by road transport. By placing vehicles in a platoon configuration the aerodynamic drag can be heavily reduced. The effect of platooning has been studied on both American and European type vehicles. However many of these studies only disclose the drag reductions and do not fully explain the flow behaviour between the models which in the end is what is causing the reduction in drag. Next to this studies done on European type vehicles mostly used time-averaged simulations so a next step is understanding the effect of unsteady flow on the vehicles. In this study the flow field between two vehicles in a platooning configuration is analysed numerically and experimentally for varying intervehicle distance and front- and rear drag reduction devices. The GETS model was used in this study which is a simplified model of a European heavy duty vehicle. For the numerical analysis Exa PowerFLOW is used which is a transient CFD package based on the LBM. Turbulence is modelled using VLES together with a RNG of the κ - ϵ equations. A study of the mesh size showed the sensitivity on the drag coefficient of the single model. <br/>The experimental analysis was performed in the OJF of the TU Delft at a Reynolds number of 3.9 x 105 based on the square root of the model. Next to balance measurements CVV measurements in the gap between the two models were taken in order to visualize the flow field.<br/>The single model showed a toroidal recirculation region in which a vortex ring can be seen. The drag force fluctuates at a Strouhal number of 0.073, side and lift force at 0.058 and 0.102 and 0.130 and 0.160. These fluctuations are caused by pressure fluctuations in the wake where the highest magnitudes are seen in the shear layer. The models with a smaller front radius saw a rise in drag with flow separation occurring for the smallest radius for the numerical results and for both smaller radii in the experiment. The addition of a boat tail lowered the drag of the models. With increasing tail angles the drag reduction also increases which is caused by the increase in base pressure. The tails also decrease the force fluctuations due to decreased pressure fluctuations in the shear layer.<br/>At the closest spacing of 0.10 times the vehicle length all tested configurations benefit from the platoon. The flow between the two models is made up of a toroidal recirculation region much smaller in size compared to the single model. In general the flow takes an S-shaped path between the two models. From the underbody of the leading model it either stagnates on the front of the trailing model or moves into the gap where it ends up in the upper of lower vortex or stagnates on the front or rear of one of the models. When a sharper front edge radius is applied to the trailing model more flow is deflected into the gap leading to lower pressure vortices and a higher stagnation pressure. A small vertical misalignment of the trailing model, which was seen during the experimental campaign, leads to a higher stagnation pressure on the bottom of the trailing model, also here more flow is deflected into the gap. At this spacing the side-force fluctuations are a bit higher due to the vortices that leave the domain passing over the rounded edges of the model.<br/>At the middle spacing of 0.45 times the vehicle length not all configurations benefit from the platoon. The trailing models with the baseline frontal radius saw an increase in drag due to the lack of thrust generated by the rounded edges. The other models did see a drag decrease. At this distance the wake of the leading model is quite similar to that of the single model. Flow enters from the top, bottom and sides of the model and ends up in the recirculation region or it stagnates on the rear of the model before it leaves the wake and stagnates on the front of the trailing model or flows over the rounded edges where it accelerates and leaves the gap. The effect of a sharper radius applied to the trailing model has little effect on the flow field. When a tail is applied to the leading model the recirculation region has been reduced as was seen for the single models. Due to the upwash the stagnation pressure on the bottom front has been increased but the drag has decreased compared to the platoon without a tail due to the increased suction of the rounded edges. At this distance the force fluctuations are much higher compared to the single model. The magnitude of drag and side force can go up to 2 and 6.5 times the values of the single model depending on the configuration. This is due to the stronger vortices from the leading model which pass over the trailing model.<br/>For the last vehicle spacing of 0.91 s/L all the configurations benefit from the platoon again. For the baseline models the gains are only a few percent but for the trailing model with a sharper front radius the gains are higher than those at the middle intervehicle distance. This is due to the reduced stagnation pressure and almost undisturbed suction coming from the rounded edges. At this distance any effect on the wake of the leading vehicle has vanished. The unsteady forces still show an increased amplitude compared to the single model however compared to the middle intervehicle distance they are much lower.<br/>The comparison between the results from the numerical and experimental analysis is quite good. The drag and flow field results are very similar. For the pressure and the unsteady forces this is less the case. The mismatch seen in the pressure comparison can be caused by alignment errors that were observed during the experiment. Next to this while reconstructing the flow field from the experimental measurements the resulting coordinates were outside the expected range. A manual coordinate shift was applied which may have resulted in additional errors. For the unsteady forces it is assumed that the ground plate and its interaction with the model as well as additional vibrations are the cause of the much higher fluctuations seen from the experimental data.<br","platoon; bluff body; wake; CFD; CVV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

A detailed description of a new, cell-phone based, budget drifter system is given, along with an overview of the potential error sources and the magnitude of these sources. Drag related “windage” errors were found to be significant. As a part of the SEAWAD research project, the surface velocities on the ebb tidal delta of the<br/>Amelander Zeegat (the Netherlands) are measured over a period of two weeks. The drifters performed well in the field (no drifter losses) but the results showed relatively frequent data gaps and filtering resulted in significant data loss. The signal quality in the area appeared to significantly influence the data loss.<br/>The velocities on the ebb tidal delta vary around 0.7 [m/s], depending on location, depth, tidal phase and wind. The spatial structure of the velocities shows generally a uniform flow structure. Different wind conditions caused the most significant changes in the spatial distribution of the velocities, followed by the effect of the tidal range. Waves were found to have an insignificant effect<br/>on the flow velocities. A number different deployment configurations were investigated in order to shorten the measurement interval as much as possible. Due to the absence of spatial structure, spatial “resolution” can be exchanged for a shortened measurement interval by deploying the drifters in two or more groups across the research area. Methods for measurement verification using nearby ADCP-equipped measurement points are presented but not performed.<br/>Overall, the described drifter measurement method provides a cheap way of measuring the spatial distribution of velocity in an area. However, the accuracy of the measurement has not been verified. Until then, the accuracy of the results is uncertain.","surface drifters; SEAWAD; Ameland Inlet; spatial distribution; budget; ADCP; GPS-trackers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","53.458795, 5.556910"

The system consists of a PV array, a battery bank, a PEM electrolyzer, hydrogen tank, and a power control unit.<br/>The results are structured in two parts. First, simulations of three configurations between the panel and the electrolyzer: (i) direct coupling, (ii) including an MPPT, and (iii) including a battery. Second, simulations of several component sizes of PV modules, battery bank, and electrolyzer stack. These simulations were analyzed for yearly irradiance data from Delft.<br/>An analysis of energy yields, hydrogen production, system efficiency, and the impact on the electrolyzer lifetime, is performed for each of the configurations.<br/>Additionally, Wawa, a lab-scale solar-to-hydrogen system has been designed, built and tested. Wawa provides a practical hands-on understanding the hydrogen production via PEM electrolysis using solar power.<br/>Based on the simulation results, it is clear that the lifetime of the electrolyzer can be positively affected by including a battery as an energy buffer.

This is due to a lack of available and functional medical equipment, where up to 70% of the existing equipment is broken. Some reasons for this shortage in medical equipment are a lack of funding, maintenance, training, educated procurement and infrastructure. To improve access to affordable quality equipment in LMICs, the design of a low cost and high quality Electrosurgical unit (ESU) is suggested. An ESU is an essential operating tool to assist surgeons on various operations. To start the design process, critical design requirements are laid out in this paper based on the properties and thermal performance of three existing devices.Theoretical Background: Electrosurgery is used in various operations to cut and coagulate tissue through high frequency current. By changing the power intensity and waveform of the current, tissue can be heated to different levels. The coagulation of tissue occurs between 60-100°C, while vaporization occurs &gt;100°C. Hazards in electrosurgery include current leakage and the detachment of the return electrode, which can cause burns to the user, staff or patient. Methods: The design requirements were obtained by conducting experiments and comparing three ESUs. Two of the ESUs are regarded as high-end devices, while the third, due to a low price and a simplified design, can be seen as a low-end device. Through a Property Test and a Thermal Camera Test, cut and coagulation modes were tested for each electrosurgical device at different powers and loads. For the Property Test the power, waveforms, crest factor, current and voltage at activation were measured and analysed. To understand the effects of the measured properties, a thermal camera was used to measure the heat map on tofu samples (simulating human tissue) that were exposed to currents from each of the three ESUs.Results: The actual power was measured to be lower than the set power at rated loads for all three ESUs. The wave-shape of all three devices differed considerably, producing a different thermal output on the tofu samples. All devices dropped their power with an increase in load. One ESU exceeded the 100 mA current leakage limit set by standards. In the Thermal Camera Test, high end devices produced temperature values more similar to those expected from literature. Discussion: The most important design requirements to consider include an efficient waveform design and a steady power control. With a small, light weight, and repairable hardware using sterilisable accessories, the ESU would become more transportable, robust, and independent from the manufacturer; therefore also more suitable for a LMICs. A split return electrode and low leakage are important design criteria to prevent any injury to patients and users. Improvements to the study include a wider pool of different ESUs for a better market analysis, using a camera with a higher temperature measurement than 177°C and larger tofu samples for a better thermal analyses.","Electrosurgery; Erbe; Valleylab; RDE; LMICs; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-12","","","","","",""

The process of urbanization increases emissions and places an increasing pressure on resources and livability in urban areas. While challenged with the effects of climate change, governments show increasing interest in integrating sustainable development in urban policy. Circular Economy (CE) is proposed as a sustainable development strategy for policy makers. CE is a relatively new introduced concept to deal with resource depletion and efficient energy usage by adapting principles (reuse – reduce – recycle) and strategies. However, too often governments fail to operationalize CE in urban areas. <br/><br/>This research introduces implementation of CE in urban planning, as referred to Circular Urban Area Development (CUAD). A conceptual framework of CUAD is developed, based on a literature review of CE and sustainable urban area development. This lead to the formulation of four categories of urban planning (1) economic experience, (2) households, (3) public space and (4) infrastructure and mobility. These categories are interconnected through flows of resources and energy. Additionally, three layers (micro-, meso-, and macro-level) of CE implementation strategies and policy are incorporated in the framework. The framework is built upon findings, tools and methodologies of three research domains, namely: (1) urban metabolism, (2) stakeholder analysis and (3) future studies. <br/><br/>The CUAD conceptual framework is defined and tested on a single case-study at the Binckhorst, The Hague. The Binckhorst is an existing business area which is selected by the local government for a transition towards a circular working-living area. An analysis is done to the current state of the Binckhorst. <br/><br/>Some conclusions can be made concerning the Binckhorst. With the transition of the Binckhorst, the landscape of the stakeholders as well as the flows will change drastically. The residential units will strongly increase, leading to a shift in needs from the economic experience, public space and infrastructure and mobility. The three levels provide insights in modelling the flows and stakeholders on the appropriate levels and the complexity of closing loops of resources and energy. Observing the process of the backcasting analysis for the Binckhorst, provides the suggestion that implementing CE requires a vision and ambition from the most important stakeholder: the municipality of The Hague. It is suggested the municipality first sets out its ambition and specific goals, followed by involvement and starting the dialogue with stakeholders. <br/><br/>A distinction is made between structural tools and process tools. The literature and the field work point out that implementing CE is a process than a state of affairs. The traditional themes of urban planning are central to the framework.

As stress on the resources rises, the interdependencies between the sectors become more apparent and often lead to unforeseen chain reactions. An example of which is: a drought leads to disappointing hydropower generation that leave groundwater pumps inoperable, which in turn lead to disappointing harvests.<br/><br/>Because of these chain effects, synergizing water, food, and energy policy is no easy task. Unconnected institutional entities further complicate this. Farmers are promoted to grow water intensive rice while at a nearby city faces a drinking water crisis.<br/>Sustainability regulations encourage the replacement of food crops by biofuel crops while elsewhere forests are cut to make place for food production.<br/><br/>The ‘Nexus’, that is an acronym for the interrelated WEF system, and the need to obtain integrated policies was globally advocated. Several analytical Nexus models where developed but left a lot to be desired according to critics. The main critique of these models so far has been that many cannot serve as a<br/>decision support tool because they lack the ability to investigate specific governance actions or the implementation of technical interventions. These models generally have intensive data requirements and are not scalable and flexible enough to perform for many Nexus studies within a single model framework.<br/><br/>In this study an optimization model framework is proposed, titled ‘MAXUS’, specifically designed to address the shortfalls of current models. It was built to customize a model for a specific Nexus study. To test the methodology of MAXUS it was applied to a case study for Ghana and Burkina Faso. Allocation of water and land resources for the final supply of WEF was optimized over space and time, for the objective and constraints given.<br/>It demonstrates how sectors could respond in harmony to changes occurring in one of the sectors. The model shows non-trivial, multi-sectoral, spatial and temporal trade-offs for operational management and infrastructural planning of WEF sectors. For example, changing locations of proposed irrigation capacity because of an increase in electricity demand.<br/><br/>Moreover, the case study demonstrated how it can support in decision making on cross-border cooperation by means of separate optimization for Ghana and Burkina Faso. It showed how sharing resources and open trade would lead to a large reduction in infrastructural requirements. In case of non-cooperation, it<br/>would be beneficial for Burkina Faso to expand reservoir storage capacity and irrigation capacity on a much larger basis than in case of cooperation. Mainly because it would not benefit from hydropower production generated in Ghana in case of noncooperation. <br/>It also showed how thermal power production would have to fill up the gap in electricity supply and how food imports would need to compensate for the loss in food production.<br/><br/>MAXUS is built to serve in a wide range of nexus studies. Hence, it is scalable in time and space, has an adaptable data structure and allows customization of objectives, balances, constraints dimensions and decision variables.<br/><br/>Using Maxus to customize a model for a specific cases study requires broad expertise. It requires engineers to set-up the equations for the model, experts in different sectors that understand the interactions, and local experts that now the<br/>conditions that apply in the case study area. Furthermore, it demands policymakers to think through their ambitions, their preferences, their range of possible interventions and governance actions, and the influences of their decisions on each of the WEF sectors. Exploring strategies for responding to developments in the WEF sectors requires cooperation of all sectors.","Nexus; Optimization; Water management; Integration; Policy; Water; Food; Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7.9527706, -1.0307118"

Therefore, they can be applied as phosphors in LED lighting and television screens. The main issue regarding currently used quantum dots is that most of them are cadmium based (e.g. cadmium selenide). Because cadmium is highly toxic and carcinogenic, its use is restricted from most commercial applications. <br/>As solution to this problem is an indium based quantum dot, which is far less toxic. The main problem with indium based quantum dots, is a lower photoluminescence quantum yield, a lower stability and a lower color purity. For this reason, in this thesis we aimed to improve the photoluminescence quantum yield by a better quantum dot surface passivation, to reduce the number of non-emitting recombination sites (dangling bonds). To passivate the surface, zinc magnesium selenide was chosen as a shell material that has an improved lattice match compared to currently used materials (such as zinc sulfide and zinc selenide). Furthermore, this zinc magnesium selenide shell should protect the quantum dot from the outside, therefore increasing its stability to air and moisture. Also, the bandgap energy of this material is higher compared to currently used shell materials, so the electron and hole are more confined in the quantum dot core. This automatically should improve the color purity.<br/><br/>The research performed showed that the synthesis of zinc magnesium selenide is quite difficult and cannot be approached the same way as a zinc selenide shell is usually synthesized. Therefore, a method using organometallic precursors was developed to synthesize this material. Results showed that zinc magnesium selenide as a shell material has an improved effect on the photoluminescence quantum yield, stability and color purity of indium phosphide quantum dots, compared to a zinc selenide shell. The synthetic method needs to be optimized before the indium phosphide quantum dots with a zinc magnesium selenide shell are able to compete with cadmium selenide quantum dots. <br","Quantum dots; indium phosphide; Organometallic chemistry; Shell growth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-08","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

Incorporating uncertainties and flexibility to decisions by means of more information becoming available, adds value to new investments, life time extended maintenance and replacements. The traditional way to evaluate such projects, the Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) based on traditional Net Present Value (NPV) techniques fails to incorporate flexibility, and hence ignores extra value from expected future information. Decision Tree Analysis (DTA) and Monte Carlo Analysis (MCA) can actually allow for valuing flexibility in investments.<br/>If investments are subject to non-diversifiable uncertainties, investors should be compensated for associated risks by using time dependent risk adjusted discount rates for valuation practices. A discussion is taking place on difficulties that occur if this principle is applied to infrastructure investments. Conducted literature research shows that current techniques to correct for non-diversifiable cannot be applied directly to most engineering valuation problems.<br/>A MCA on investment alternatives regarding to the replacement of a bridge in the municipality of Amsterdam demonstrates how expected investment values can be calculated taking along multiple uncertainties and flexibility. Although the value of flexibility is always equal or greater than zero, case study results show that incorporating uncertainty and flexibility in the analysis can also affect the NPV negatively.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Their high thermal, mechanical and chem- ical stability make them more applicable in treating e.g. corrosive and hot wastewater. With their small pore sizes, the ceramic tight ultrafiltration (tight UF) membranes show a greater selectivity than ceramic UF or microfiltration (MF) membranes. However, low permeability and unstable membrane quality were observed using most commercially available ceramic tight UF membranes.<br/>Atomic layer deposition (ALD), have come up as an important technique for deposit- ing thin films, and have turned out to be a good potential alternative to produce tight UF ceramic membranes from ceramic UF or MF membranes, due to its capability of con- trolled deposition of a one single atom layer film.<br/>In this study, we explored the potential of ALD in the fabrication of tight UF ceramic membranes from normal sol-gel made UF ceramic membranes with various initial pore sizes. Since the resistance against flux within a porous membrane is mainly from the separation layer, we primarily focused on the coating depth of the coated membranes by the ALD technology. In addition a relation was found between the coating depth and the performance of the coated membranes.<br/>The results of the experiments demonstrate that ALD method could successfully be used in the fabrication of tight UF ceramic membranes and, to some extent, cure the defects in the original membranes. By applying different ALD settings, different coating depths in the membrane filtration layer were achieved, which influenced the water per- meability and solute rejection. Further, membranes with larger pore sizes tended to have a deeper effective coating depth since the precursors could diffuse more easily through the larger pores. The Carmen Kozeny model, used to determine the permeability and porosity for each studied membrane, showed results in the same order of magnitude with most of the measurement data, being thus able to predict permeability as a func- tion of porosity and layer thickness.","Ceramic membranes; atomic layer deposition; water treatment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-15","","","","","",""

Constitutive models are considered to be more valid compared to empirical models, because they comprise by equations that have actual physical meaning. Bounding surface plasticity theory is widely used by researchers and one of the most well-known models is SANISAND, established by Dafalias and Manzari (2004), which is the base for the model presented in this work.<br/>The development of offshore industry during last years, have created the need for models that will be able to simulate soil behaviour under high-cyclic loading, since models like SANISAND were not able to capture the actual number of cycles until liquefaction.

However, a rising sea level, changing wave conditions and degradation of corals threaten the coastal safety of these reefs.Numerical models can be applied to study the reef-hydrodynamics and the effects of coral degradation on the reef-hydrodynamics. When non-linear processes are important or the individual waves need to be determined, a phase resolving model is preferred. Within this thesis two issues regarding the application of non-hydrostatic models to coral reefs were studied.<br/><br/>Due to the large bottom gradient in front of a reef, the offshore boundary has to be located in deep water, which means that frequency dispersion becomes important. The accuracy of frequency dispersion within non-hydrostatic models depends on the number of vertical layers. However, the addition of a vertical layer increases the computational time extremely. Therefore, a reduced two layer non-hydrostatic model (XBeach-nh+) was developed with the assumption of a constant non-hydrostatic pressure in the lower layer. In theory, XBeach-nh+ is capable of modelling the wave transformation from deep to shallow water, but the applied boundary conditions cannot force deep water waves. On top of that XBeach-nh+ has never been properly validated for reef environments.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the corals (growing on the reef flat) have a large effect on the reef-hydrodynamics by dissipating a large part of the wave energy. There exist different formulations to include vegetation into a non-hydrostatic wave model, but these formulations are mainly applicable for cylinder shaped geometries, whereas corals are more complex in shape. Apart from the shape, the in-canopy velocity can be significantly different from the free stream velocity. Therefore, a porous in-canopy model was implemented to model the in-canopy velocity, which was used to determine the canopy-induced force on the depth-averaged flow computation.<br/><br/>Firstly, the inclusion of the second reduced layer improves the dispersion relation up to a relative depth ($kh$) of 5 for linear waves. A simulation of biochromatic waves over a plane beach showed that XBeach-nh+ is capable of modelling the energy transfer between the major wave components. Both steeping and reflection of the sub-harmonic were modelled according to the measurements. Furthermore, the validation of random waves over a fringing reef showed the capability of XBeach-nh+ to model the reef-hydrodynamics for different wave conditions (rel. bias of -0.003 for total wave height, -0.081 for LF-waves and -0.103 for the setup). Moreover, the addition of the second reduced layer gives a more robust prediction for all modelled wave conditions, whereas the one-layer model contains more scatter.<br/><br/>Secondly, the in-canopy model captures the canopy-induced force when the canopy parameters were known. Both the in-canopy flow of unidirectional and oscillating flow fields was accurately modelled when the results were compared to the measured velocity though cylinders and corals. Although, the canopy parameters were not always known, it was shown that an un-calibrated in-canopy model, based on porosity and canopy height, gives a competitive result compared to a fully calibrated shear stress formulation. The applicability of XBeach-nh+ in 2-dimensional domain with a coral covered reef flat was shown by modelling a 5 day Swell event at Ningaloo Reef. Reasonably accurate results were achieved when using the in-canopy model, based on the canopy properties.","XBeach; Non-hydrostatic; Coral reefs; Hydrodynamics; in-canopy flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They dampen the wave by dissipating the energy through wave breaking. Most studies of breakwaters have only been carried out on the seaward slope of the structure. However, few have conducted research on the landward-, inner-, slope of breakwaters. The existing accounts <br/> re all empirical design formulae, commonly denoted as applicable for conceptual design. Improvement of the design of the armour layer of the inner slope leads to economical advantages.This research focused on three main goals: (1) Presenting a theoretical methodology for the waves tested, (2) It veried the Wave Overtopping Simulator as built by Rietmeijer (2017) and (3) Performed stability tests for the inner slope by conducting physical model tests in the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of Delft University of Technology.<br/><br/>The first goal of this research has been to develop a theoretical approach to overtopping waves in combination with a simulator. This has been done by linking certain storm characteristics, being the significant wave height Hs and peak period Tp to wave characteristics; water volume, water layer thickness and the front velocity of the water body. These three combined lead to an impinging wave on the rear slope causing damage. Subsequently the storms have been altered to only select the highest percentage of waves, since these were marked as extreme storm conditions. This resulted in dierent signicant wave heights which were tested.<br/><br/>To verify the Wave Overtopping Simulator tests have been performed and specic elements have been measured and analyzed. This has resulted in relationships between theoretical wave characteristics and simulator settings. The relationships are the required water level in the reservoir to obtain a certain front velocity of the water body. To adjust the water layer thickness the valve settings have been changed. For a specic volume the overtopping period has been altered. These three elements have been measured using wave gauges and a high speed camera after which the data was carefully analyzed. <br/><br/>The stability tests have been executed using a model of a breakwater in the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of Delft University of Technology. Results of the preparatory calculations together with results obtained from former research have led to the design of the test set-up. A single armour layer of 20 mm cubes with an porosity of nearly 40% was built with an fixed toe. This configuration was tested with increasing storm intensities until failure. Subsequently the damage has been measured using photo camera's and laser technique.<br/><br/>This research has successfully verified the wave overtopping simulator by measuring individual waves and their specific discharge, water layer thickness and velocity. These measurements have been compared to an other method, using a high speed camera. The found values have been checked with found literature and it has been concluded that the Wave Overtopping Simulator together with the test set-up as built in the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory is useful for this research. By measuring the displacement of cubes by means of video camera and laser technique, the research has been able to identify damage and failure cases. The horizontal displacement has been divided into several classes ranging from settlement of the armour layer, to instant failure. In addition, this research has presented a possible link between the stability of a single cubic armour layer and the number of rows beneath the waterline.","Breakwater; Overtopping; Waves; Single layer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Karjadi, Erwan (mentor); Balder, Thomas (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Pipe laying projects are getting more challenging due to increasing operational depth of pipeline. The increasing depth requires more of the strength and load bearing capability of the pipeline and its girth welds. The assessment method used for checking the integrity of flaws in girth welds is called Engineering Critical Assessment (ECA) and is based on fracture mechanics (FM) formulas. A complete ECA covers both static and fatigue loading encountered over the multiple phases of the pipe laying process. The current ECA methodology for both static and fatigue load produces strict requirements that may cause unnecessary repairs of the girth welds. From within the industry it is now wondered if ECA produces (over) conservative results.<br/><br/>The current static ECA methodology uses a worst case (deterministic) load scenario as input to determine the maximum allowable initial flaw depth (MAIF) of a girth weld which is then directly used as NDT criterion for that specific pipeline project. The proposed methodology in this research uses a reliability based approach where the probability of failure (PoF) of the pipeline/girth welds is governing in order to determine the NDT criteria. By (conservatively) assuming girth welds in a pipeline form an independent series system, the required PoF of the pipeline ($10^{-4}$) can be converted to the individual required PoF of a girth weld ($10^{-8}$). This together with stochastic input variables provides the required information to determine the NDT criterion based on the required PoF of the pipeline.<br/><br/>The available data to determine the best probability density functions (PDFs) of the stochastic variables used in the reliability based approach is limited, introducing uncertainty in the accuracy of the results. However when using the limited data the two models already provide NDT criteria in the range of 5.05mm-5.20mm, while the deterministic approach dictates a NDT criteria of 4.45mm. A difference of 0.55mm-0.75mm is substantial in terms flaw assessment criteria. Experts on welding and flaw assessment within HMC estimate the impact of the increase in NDT criterion to result in one less offshore shift of 12 hours, potentially saving up to hundred of thousands of Euros.<br/><br/>From the research performed it may be concluded it is possible to provide NDT criteria on basis of a probabilistic ECA, it is found the current ECA for static loading on external weld flaws might indeed be conservative. Therefore using a probabilistic approach towards ECA for both static and fatigue loading can benefit future projects by reducing repairs and cost.<br","Monte Carlo simulation; Engineering Critical Assessment (ECA); Flaw assessment; Probabilistic design; Copula; Importance Sampling; NDT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-07","","","","","",""

The Eurocode uses a conservative form of these probability calculations and this could have a negative economic impact. Having said this, more advanced probability calculation methods are developed to decrease the negative economic impact this could have.<br/>Nowadays structural analysis in daily practise is mostly done through the finite element method. The finite element method uses either linear or non-linear structural analysis. The latter mentioned analysis is used for the analysis of materials in which the nonlinear effects have significant impact. However not only finite element analyses are used to determine structural behaviour. Analytical models remain an important tool to examine civil structures. Since the analytical models cannot address all the influences of the nonlinear parameters, conservative assumptions were made.<br/>On the one hand the modern design code uses semi-probabilistic in combination with the analytical model. Finite element analysis together with semi-probabilistic assessment is a possible use for design purposes as well. On the other hand full-probabilistic assessments, are not possible to execute in combination with nonlinear, finite element analyses. The reason for that the computation time becomes too large.<br/>The research question that is tried to answer in this thesis: “How does a semi-probabilistic compare to a full-probabilistic safety assessment for a statically indeterminate beam structure?”<br/>The 2-span statically indeterminate reinforced concrete beams that are studied in this thesis find their origin from the research done by Monnier between 1965 and 1970. This research had as goal to see what the influence of shear force would be on the bending capacity. This specific research is chosen because here statically indeterminate beams are dealt with. The experiments’ data generated during the execution of the four-point bending test is the starting point of this thesis.<br/>To answer the research question, the components of a reliability model have been investigated. The levels of model approximation (LoA) as stated in the model code 2010 together with the level of reliability calculations (Steenbergen 2011) were used. Two combinations between LoA and reliability methods have been analysed to assess their strengths and weaknesses. These two reliability analyses were both were based on an analytical model (LoA I). The reliability level I and III, the so called semi-probabilistic and full-probabilistic, calculations were used.<br/>In conclusion, the full-probabilistic reliability calculation is all cases applicable to determine the probability of failure of a statically indeterminate structure. However, semi-probability reliability are useful as well but it does allow only partly redistribution of forces. In case of statically indeterminate structures this can have significant impact on the failure load. The best reliability method for a statically indeterminate structure is dependent on the amount of redistribution of forces.<br/>The semi-probabilistic calculations treat structures, where a lot of redistribution can occur, conservatively. For instance, the semi-probabilistic calculation procedure that is used in this thesis allows for only partly redistribution of forces. The full-probabilistic calculation procedure is therefore beneficial to use for structures where a lot of redistribution can occur in the ultimate limit state.<br/>It turned out that the full-probabilistic calculation determines a higher reliability of the structure. In the full-probabilistic analysis, the limit state function is used in its analytical form. Whereas in the semi-probabilistic analysis is made with the use of approximations of the limit state function. However, when the cross-section of a statically indeterminate structure is designed in such a way that little redistribution will take place, the difference between the full- and semi-probabilistic is insignificant.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the absence of bivalent cations, silica is a limiting factor because a high concentration of silica can cause irreversible fouling of the membranes. To prevent silica scale formation during the further concentration of brine with RO, silica should be removed in a separate process. Silica gel beads have a large specific surface area and can be used to precipitate silica. Previous research on the removal of silica using silica gel beads for solutions with a relatively high silica concentration showed that a removal of 30-60% is possible.<br/>In this research the effect of the dosage of silica gel beads, pH, temperature and the presence of 1 or 10 mg/L of ferric and aluminum on the removal of silica using silica gel beads from a solution with a low silica concentration was investigated. Starting with a silica concentration of 180 mg SiO<sub>2</sub>/L a removal up to 30% was obtained after 8 hours (pH 8.5, 21°C). <br/>The removal of silica using silica gel beads was limited, because silica gel dissolved when the solution is unsaturated with regard to silica. The equilibrium concentration was approximately 102 mg SiO<sub>2</sub>/L. The difference between the concentration of silica in solution and the equilibrium concentration appeared to be a driver of the removal. The increase in removal efficiency as a result of using a higher dose of silica gel seemed to be limited. Operating at pH 10 instead of 8.5 resulted in a lower removal efficiency. Lowering the pH to 7 or 5 did not result in a decrease of the removal efficiency. Changing the temperature to 10 or 35°C or adding 1 or 10mg/L of ferric or aluminum did not increase the removal efficiency either, but even decreased the efficiency. <br/>The obtained removal efficiency might be too low for direct application of fixed bed column filtration with silica gel beads as interstage silica removal technique in a RO system that is used to concentrate brine. A combination of filtration with silica gel and a technology that can concentrate the brine without scaling to concentrations up to 500 mg SiO<sub>2</sub>/L could be an interesting solution to make brine treatment more energy-efficient, because the need for an evaporation step is minimized.","Silica; Brine treatment; Silica gel; Scale; Reverse Osmosis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management | Sanitary Engineering","",""

In order to further demonstrate the feasibility of this mission concept, this thesis investigates time-optimal solar sail transfers to these (quasi-)pole-sitters. In particular, (quasi-)pole-sitters which are achievable when assuming solar sail technology expected in a near- to mid-term time-frame. To reduce mission operational cost, the objective of this research is to minimize the time required for the transfer, which requires the solution to an optimal control problem. Initial guess solutions for this optimal control problem are provided through two completely different techniques, in order to compare and validate the individual performances: first, a technique derived from dynamical systems theory (a type of grid search) and second, a genetic algorithm. Subsequent optimization using a direct pseudospectral algorithm results in time-optimal transfers to the considered Mars (quasi-)pole-sitters that span 2.61 and 2.72 years, and 1.07 and 1.19 years to the considered Venus (quasi-)pole-sitters. Effects due to variations in performance of the ideal sail, non-ideal sail properties, and Earth departure orbit are investigated. In addition, this paper demonstrates that a genetic algorithm is well suited to generate initial guesses for similar interplanetary transfers in the inner solar system. It provides initial guesses that outperform the more conventional grid search technique, in terms of feasibility of the initial guess transfers, as well as in computation time and ease of implementation.","Solar sailing; Trajectory optimization; Pole-sitter; Quasi-pole-sitter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-05","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

In the Middle East solar power plants are built for prices around 3 cent per kilowatt-hour and bids below 3 cent have been placed. In Europe wind energy is the second largest source of renewable energy after biomass. Although, wind farms are being built without subsidy the total cost of a wind farm is much higher in the order of 14 cent per kWh and it can decrease to 10 cent by 2030. <br/><br/>In this research an concept study for the transport of electric energy is made to find an answer to the question: “is it possible to ship electric energy which is delivered in a port between areas of generation and consumption over a fixed distance with the use of a ship and deliver it for a levelised cost of electricity (LCoE) which is competitive in the market of unloading.”<br/><br/>The cost of a kilowatt-hour of electric energy in the Dutch market is 8.33 if it is produced by a modern gas fired power plant and if the cost for CO2 emissions are included according to the current prices in the European emission trading scheme. If higher carbon cost scenario's are applied the price could increase to prices over 17 cent per kilowatt-hour. The concepts in this study are tested against four different carbon emission cost scenario's ranging from 8 euro/tCO2 to 190 euro/tCO2<br/><br/>Most electrical energy is transported by electric energy power grids. For long distance high volume energy transmission a high voltage direct current energy cable is the most efficient way to transport energy but at larger distances the transmission system gets more expensive. In this research the electric cable is used as a reference case which the concept has to outperform. <br/><br/>To test the concepts a non-linear model is made which is solved with Matlab-integrated solvers to find the optimal transport concept. The model works by optimising the main dimensions of the ship. With this optimal ship design concepts are analysed. For this research: a concept based on a hydrogen-carrier (ammonia) and a concept based on thermal energy storage are discussed.<br/> . <br/>The hydrogen-carrier concept uses ammonia as a carrier. Ammonia has a high energy content and can be produced with the Haber Bosch process or with Solid State Ammonia Synthesis (SSAS). If the energy is produced using the well known Haber-Bosch process in 2018 the levelised cost of energy is 21.2 and 24.2 cent per kilowatt hour depending on the distance. Developments in the field of electrolysers will reduce the capital investment which can reduce the price to 17.8 to 20.8 cent per kilowatt hour by 2025 if the energy is supplied at 2 cent per kilowatt hour to the ammonia production facility. <br/><br/>The SSAS method offers higher energy effincies at lower capital investment cost. The LCOE calculated in this research is 11.4 to 16.4 cent per kilowatt-hour. <br/>The thermal energy storage concept is based on molten salt. Molten salt is being used in concentrated solar power plants as a storage of energy. In the concept used in this project the molten salt is transported to another part where the heat which is stored in the salt is used to generate electricity. The LCoE is already 28.5 cent per kilowatt-hour at a distance of 1,000 nm. The thermal energy storage concept is more expensive than the ammonia concept.<br/><br/>Depending on the distance and the carbon cost scenario's the concept can be competitive to the fixed connection with a cable and fossil fired power plants in the home market. If the low cost carbon scenario's (1 and 2) are applied by law makers the concept of electrical energy by sea is not competitive but if politicians would decide to increase the cost for carbon emissions the transport could become competitive. When the carbon emission cost increase to values over 100 euro/tCO2 the SSAS concept is competitive for distance up to 2,000 nm but it still more expensive than a cable connection. For this distances larger than 4,000 nm and carbon prices according to the 4th scenario (190 euro/tCO2) the SSAS-based concept can be a competitive energy supplier.<br","renewable energy technologies; electric energy shipping; electric energy costs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-31","","","","","",""

Research has shown that the onset of fracture highly depends on the full state of stress inside the material. Better understanding of fracture resulted in more advanced and complex fracture models being conceived, allowing researchers to predict fracture in ductile solids with improved accuracy. <br/><br/><br/>Nonlinear finite element analysis is a powerful tool at the disposal of researchers to predict the response of ship and offshore structures. When it comes to simulating accidental loads, such as collisions, often basic criteria are applied to include fracture in a finite element model. However, accurate fracture prediction is of great importance to determine the ice resilience of vessels, or to obtain reliable estimates of the sustained damage due to maritime collision. This research focuses on the latter.<br/><br/><br/>This thesis is concerned with bridging the gap between the recent developments in fracture prediction and the application of failure criteria in finite element analysis of ship collision. A selection of recently published fracture models has been made and experiments have been conducted on S235 structural steel for calibration and validation of these models. Four small scale experiments have been conducted. These experiments serve a dual purpose: first, to gather information on the material behaviour during deformation. Second, to obtain information on the effect of different stress conditions on fracture. An iterative method has been employed to accurately model the material behaviour. For the calibration of the fracture models a method has been conceived and applied that takes into account the full histories of stress and strain during the deformation process up to fracture.<br/><br/>Before application as failure criteria for finite elements, the calibrated fracture models require a correction based on the size of the elements: a modification to an already existing theoretical framework has been proposed and applied to obtain element-size dependent failure criteria.<br/><br/><br/>A large scale drop tower experiment has been designed to simulate a so called raking damage scenario. This experiment has been conducted on the same material as the small scale experiments and serves as a validation for a finite element model that has been created using the information on the material behaviour obtained from the small scale experiments. The different failure criteria have been implemented into the commercial finite element package LS-DYNA and have been applied to the finite element model. The results have been compared to the results of the raking damage experiment.<br/><br/><br/>It was concluded that the application of complex multi-parameter failure models in analysis of maritime collision does not necessarily provide an improvement over conventional fracture prediction methods. The inability of shell elements to accurately describe strain concentrations and the effect of the element size introduce uncertainties that overrule the benefits of stress-state dependent prediction of element failure.","numerical; fracture; stress-state; maritime; collision; offshore; LS-DYNA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore Engineering","",""

Especially for environments with sparse or misleading rewards it has proven difficult to construct a good exploration strategy. For discrete domains good exploration strategies have been devised, but are often nontrivial to implement on more complex domains with continuous states and/or actions.<br/>In this work, a novel persistent and directed exploration framework is developed, called Smart Start. Usually, a reinforcement learning agent executes its learned policy with some exploration strategy from the start until the end of an episode, which we call ``normal'' learning. The idea of Smart Start is to split a reinforcement learning episode in two parts, the Smart Start phase and the ``normal'' learning phase. The initial Smart Start phase guides the agent to a region in which the agent expects to learn the most. The region is constructed using previous experiences and the guiding is done using a model-based planning or trajectory optimization method. When the agent arrives at the region, it continues its ``normal'' reinforcement learning. This approach leaves the performance of the used reinforcement learning algorithm unchanged, but augments it with persistent and directed exploration.<br/>The Smart Start framework was evaluated using three reinforcement learning algorithms, a simple model-based reinforcement learning algorithm (MBRL), R-max and Q-Learning with epsilon-greedy, Boltzmann and UCB1 exploration. The evaluation was done on four discrete gridworld environments. Three environments with sparse rewards and one with misleading rewards. We showed that the performance of Q-Learning with Smart Start is comparable to R-max, which performs near optimal in the used scenarios. The MBRL algorithm with Smart Start is even able to outperform R-max in some of the problems. We show that Smart Start is a good framework for exploration that can be incorporated with any reinforcement learning algorithm.","Reinforcement Learning; Exploration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additional measurements on the grafeen structures will help to characterize the graphene-based Pirani better and allow for attempts to fit an analytical model to the measurement data.","Graphene; BICMOS; Pirani","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-02","","","","","",""

The need to explore the concept of resilience, in the context of socio-technical systems, is widely acknowledged in literature and industry. Nevertheless, this research topic is still relatively unexplored and no formal definition and metrics for resilience exists. It is encouraged by the current state of research, to develop a better understanding of mechanisms present in socio-technical systems that underlie the ability to be resilient. One of the resilience mechanisms identified is the mechanism of anticipation. Anticipation reflects the ability to predict future disruptions and consequences, and provide adaptive solutions to avoid performance loss. This research aims to develop a formalized model of an anticipation mechanism and analyses the working of this mechanism through a computational agent-based simulation study of airport security operations.","resilience; complex adaptive systems; sociotechnical system; Agent-based modelling and simulation; airport security; formalisation; operationalisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","51.9962559, 4.3758659"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","A Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) can achieve a considerably higher overall fuel economy than conventional vehicles. The fuel economy of PHEVs however, strongly depends on the supervisory control strategy of the hybrid powertrain. Compared to conventional, non-predictive, supervisory control systems, predictive control methods can further improve the fuel economy by anticipating on future driving conditions. This thesis presents a predictive optimal control method for PHEVs that minimizes the fuel consumption in real-time operation, based on the preview of the future topographic profile and velocity profile. This strategy is realized by a global estimation method that determines the optimal battery depletion strategy on the global range, which is tracked by a novel adaptive heuristic control method that optimizes the driving mode and power distribution between the two power sources on the local range. Compared to state of the art predictive control methods, this control method makes it possible to include feasibility and drivability conditions (such as the number of engine starts and variation of the torque demand) in the control strategy, while allowing high update frequencies of the control actions.<br/><br/>The proposed control method is fine-tuned on a P2 parallel PHEV model based on a Volkswagen Jetta HEV, and its effectiveness is evaluated by implementation in a high fidelity simulation environment. It was found that route-preview based control strategies can obtain substantial improvements of up to 7.3% in fuel economy compared to a non-predictive heuristic control method. Simulation results also demonstrate that the application of optimization based control methods without any drivability considerations (such as A-ECMS) often leads to unacceptable control policies. The proposed control method on the other hand, was able to take feasibility limitations into account, which led to a reduction of the number of combustion engine starts of up to 52%.<br","Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV); Intelligent powertrain control; Optimal control; Predictive energy management; Adaptive recalibration heuristic control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-02","","","","","",""

Metrics, and subsequent recommendations, have been established to provide uniform horizontal illuminance. In addition, performance-based metrics are developed. For example, various lighting levels for different tasks. However, the conventional metrics and current lighting standards fail to describe the spatial quality of light that provides a human observer with information about its surroundings contributing to one’s well-being. And so, increased emphasis is on three-dimensional light distribution in a space creating good lighting. Currently, renewed attention goes to the application of a theory to examine the visual appearance of light in a space: the light field. The light field can be subdivided in the light intensity, the light direction and diffuseness simultaneously. Hence, it is wondered to what extent the analysis of the light field is an effective alternative to predict visual comfort in a daylit office meeting space?<br/><br/>The research answers this main question in three parts, using literature review, in-field measurements and simulated data. The first part of the research concentrates on literature about the conventional visual comfort metrics (luminance Contrast Ratio and Daylight Glare Property), and the (mathematical) description of the light field. The second part of research deals solely with the light field. It examines how its properties can be measured and visualised, in researching the application of tool use. In part three knowledge about the conventional performance-based measuring techniques and the analysis of the properties of the light field (light intensity, light direction and diffuseness) are brought together and compared in a case study of a visual uncomfortable experienced office space. <br/><br/>Based upon the results obtained during the research, it is proven that the analysis of the light field is a promising candidate describing an uncomfortable setting in terms of light direction and diffuseness rather than luminance and illuminance. It is a view independent metric that can predict visual uncomfortable situations generated by a strong directional lighting combined with a low diffuseness, resulting in disturbing shades. Simultaneously, it is found that the current metrics for luminance Contrast Ratio and the simplified Daylight Glare probability, that try to predict the likelihood of visual comfort, lack a full description of the perceived level of visual comfort. Finally, the level of visual comfort for the human observer in the office space of the case study has been improved. <br/><br/>Keywords: daylight, light metrics, visual comfort, luminance contrast ratio, daylight glare probability, light field, light direction, light intensity, diffuseness, light field,<br","daylight; visual comfort; light field; light intensity; light direction; diffuseness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They were seeking new business opportunities and therefore wanted to investigate the opportunities for a furniture lease service in the expatriate market. <br/><br/>Introducing a lease service would have several consequences for the company as well as for the customer. The company would take on several responsibilities from the customer, and has to cover for the purchase costs, which are repaid in small monthly payments by the customer. In general the operation of the company would become more complex and the value for the customer would be closer to his or her needs. Houweling Interieur is able to handle this more complex operation. All the physical resources necessary are available to the company. However, some of these should be expended dependent on the size of the lease operation. <br/><br/>If Houweling would introduce a lease service, it should position it at the high end of the market, where the company currently positions itself as well. This, because it matches the current suppliers, company vision and the Houweling Interieur brand name. However, in the expatriate market appears only to be a demand for lease furniture in the low end of the market. In the high end of the market, shipping in one’s own furniture is preferred. <br/><br/>While the analyses show that targeting the expatriate market with a lease service is not advisable for now, furnishing house viewings and selling separate smaller pieces of furniture fitting the small houses in the Netherlands are opportunities that have presented itself in the different analyses. Furniture lease in other markets is still an option as well.<br","Furniture; Lease; Expatraites","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The algorithm is trained on several flow cases using DNS/LES data, and used to predict the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor on multiple test flow cases. Predictions are then propagated with a custom OpenFOAM solver to yield an improved flow field. Results show that the TBRF algorithm is able to accurately predict the anisotropy tensor for various flow cases, with most of the predictions being realizable and close to the DNS/LES reference data. Resulting mean flows for a square duct and a backward facing step show great resemblance to corresponding DNS and experimental data-sets.","machine learning; RANS; Random Forest; Turbulence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The worlds energy demand is increasing however, the majority of the energy supply is still based on fossil fuels. The consumption of fossil fuels results in the emission of carbon dioxide which is one of the main greenhouse gases responsible for the ongoing climate change. In order to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions, more and more energy is produced in a re-newable way. Mainly from solar and wind energy. This energy is however intermittent in char-acter and comes in the form of electricity. To overcome the intermittency, the excess pro-duced electricity has to be stored in an efficient reversible way, so that the energy can re-leased again when it is needed. One possible solution that tackles both problems is the elec-trochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in aqueous electrolytes into highly valuable chemicals, or so called solar fuels. In this study, a new infrared spectroelectrochemical cell with an easy exchangeable electrocatalyst is developed to study the reaction mechanism on a silver cata-lyst in 0.1 M KCl and 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolytes at applied potentials of -1.4, -1.6 and -1.8 V vs a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The performance of the new developed cell is compared to the already proven ATR cell configuration. Investigation of the infrared signal strength showed high infrared signals at angles of incidence of the infrared beam between 30° and 45°. The measured infrared absorption spectra in the thin layer flow cell show three absorption bands which are also present in the obtained infrared absorption spectra of the ATR cell. In the ATR spectra however, three further infrared absorption bands can be observed. Due to the lower number of absorption bands present in the FTIR spectra measured in the new designed thin layer flow cell, it can be concluded that despite the high IR signal no new insights on the reac-tion mechanism of the carbon dioxide reduction reaction can be acquired.","infrared spectroscopy; carbon dioxide recudtion; electrochemical cell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The exponential growth of the EV market requires a significant expansion of the public charging infrastructure. This causes challenges especially in cities in terms of parking pressure, grid reinforcements and investment costs. There are two charging technologies for electric vehicles: normal charging and fast charging. Fast charging technology is developing rapidly, with charging speeds that allow a full charge in fifteen minutes in 2020. Local governments however, currently mainly support and subsidise normal charging.  <br/>Currently, there is no scientific study that combines the technical, economical, social and political perspectives to evaluate the feasibility of fast charging. This research determines the current and future feasibility of fast charging in Dutch cities. An exploratory case study of the major Dutch cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht is performed. The political economy theory on transport innovations by Feitelson and Salomon is used as the theoretical perspective. From the research it is concluded that fast charging is increasingly feasible as a charging solution in Dutch cities. Currently, there is a focus on normal charging in cities caused by the current EVs and charging technology. The developments sparked by larger batteries and faster charging however increase the feasibility of fast charging. As EV adoption accelerates, a more hybrid mix of normal and fast charging solutions is needed in crowded cities to accommodate the charging needs. The increasing industry interest, consumer attitude and high charging capacity make fast charging an important factor in the future public charging infrastructure.","Electric Vehicle; Charging Infrastructure; Policy; Fast Charging; EV; Urban Environment; Socio-technical transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-02-22","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""
