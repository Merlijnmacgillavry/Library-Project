(mentor); Langeveld, L. (mentor)","2010","Assignment Sailing is my true passion; competing in the Tour de France à la Voile (TFV), the sailing equivalent of the cycling competition, with Team Delft Challenge meant a dream comes true. The TFV is a highly intense sailing regatta that leads student, amateur and professional sailors around France. Within Team Delft Challenge I was responsible for the Public Relations. During the gruel offshore stages I wanted to film the action on board. This hostile environment forced me to use a waterproof camcorder, however this solution compromised image quality and impact protection was not part of the solution. Analyse showed that the market does not provide proper solutions for use of camcorders in hostile environments, however video sharing is really popular nowadays. The assignment is to development a customisable shatter-, waterproof, shock absorbing and compact camcorder case. The project is called “Thinking out of the Box” customisable waterproof camcorder case. The reason for this title is because a waterproof camcorder case had to be developed which is regarded as a box, referring to the unique aspect to customise the camcorder case for specific camcorder completes the title. It was my intention to do a graduation project together with a company, in Freedom Of Creation (FOC) I found the perfect partner. FOC is a pioneering design and research company specialized in designing for Rapid Manufacturing, however for this project total freedom was given to use any production method adaptable with FOC’s unique design and business model; design and production on demand. A feasibility study showed the possibilities of implementing a suitable production method in a product with high mechanical demands and that customizes design on demand. This graduation project combines experience attained from Team Delft Challenge, competing in the TFV and industrial design knowledge. Analyse Analyse of the company started with the internal an external situation assimilated into a SWOT matrix. From this analyse the conclusion stated that FOC is an innovative and economical feasible company. FOC´s special Rapid Manufacturing process brings new designs and production processes within reach and changes the traditional design methodology and production chain. The Failure Mode and Effect Analyses (FMEA) is a systematically method to determine the high risks factors, executed with an existing market solution and later to evaluate and optimize the final design, subjecting the prototype to the FMEA. The target group for this product can be divided in early adapters and the more conservative and experienced. Early adapters are more likely to pursue a waterproof camcorder case and were regarded more significant as target group. The distinction between the early adapters and conservatives is balanced in the final design product style and function. A good overview of the available Rapid Manufacturing techniques was attained when I was asked to prepare and give a workshop about Rapid Prototyping/Manufacturing techniques for students of the faculty of architecture of the University of Technology, Delft. Usefull experience was acquired with filming on board during the TFV and the user-product-interaction analyses formed informative story boards, showing the use and thereby requirements needed to successfully operate a camcorder on board. Instead of a camcorder within a waterproof case a waterproof camcorder has been used for filming on board. The outcome was assimilated into the list of criteria and requirements and story boards were used to communicate the outcome of the user-product-interaction analyse. Development The generation of ideas was based on the list of criteria and requirements. After selection of promising ideas, three principal concepts have been developed with the focus on a universal waterproof solution to operate the camcorder. The principal to use a flexible membrane was selected; this principal was elaborated in four concepts. Within the concepts, different production methods were investigated, the combination of a standardised extruded transparent tube and a Rapid Manufactured body was selected to meet the important customising and production on demand criteria. Sketching did not provide the confidence of the camcorder to fit in and therefore carton mock up models were used to elaborate the concepts. The carton mock up models proved very useful and were also used to elaborate the prototype’s basic shape. Additional style mood boards were used to further develop the prototype’s styling. Besides the carton prototype, a 3D CAD model with all the additional features was modelled. The 3D file was 3D printed into a 3D functional prototype. This was evaluated and optimized using the FMEA and recommendations were incorporated into the final design. The final design was 3D printed for presentation purposes, but also to conduct functional tests and a user-product-interaction analyse. Several functional tests are relevant considering the list of design criteria and requirements; the final design had to be waterproof, shatterproof, shockproof and have the ability to float. Destroying the 3D functional model for a shatter- and shockproof test was considered not economical feasible for this graduation project and therefore left out of the project. Conclusion Experiences and expertise from Team Delft Challenge have been used beneficially to combine sailing knowledge with industrial design skills. The FMEA proofed effectively for quantifying risks factors, in order to reduce the risks of damaging a camcorder in a very hostile environment. The production process have been key to this project to meet the customising and production on demand criteria. Extensive user–product-interaction analyses resulted in optimising the handling of the final design. The Rapid Manufacturing technology has its disadvantages for example a lack of knowledge of the material properties, head distortion and decolouring, Furthermore extensive experience in CAD/CAM is needed to get the full potential out of the technology, however a gradation project that results in a nearly functional product is quit unique.","customise; waterproof; camcorder case","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Cunningham, S. (mentor)","2010","Julia Kasmire is writing her PhD dissertation on technology transitions in the Westland greenhouse area. She is looking whether Universal Darwinism (UD) can explain these processes and could lead to could policy recommendations. As a prelude to her research this report focuses on, the less ground braking, technology diffusion in the Westland greenhouse area. UD is not taking as a point of departure to be able test without prejudice whether the concept holds. In this report an answer is given to the following main research question: How does a technology diffuse through a network of greenhouse farmers in the Westland and which factors are important to this process? This is done by answering three sub questions. The first sub question is the following: What methodological individualistic framework on technology diffusion in the Westland can be developed? To answer this question first an overview is given of the literature on technology diffusion from which a preliminary framework is constructed. Central in this framework are the decision individual greenhouse farmers make. Based on their own characteristics, the characteristics of the environment and the available information on the characteristics of technologies decisions are made. This framework has been taken as a point of departure for an interview with a greenhouse farmer and subsequently questionnaires were sent to other greenhouse farmers. After this the framework was enriched with the information retrieved from the interview and the questionnaires. Important results were the fact that greenhouse farmers may be considered boundedly rational, that they value information from peers quite high and that an innovativeness/risk attitude is a differentiating characteristic. How can technology diffusion in the Westland be modeled? For the second research question an Agent Based Model (ABM) was developed. The model combines the physical and social layers of technology adoption. In the physical layer technologies are acquired and used as well as products are sold. In the social layer agents communicate about their satisfaction of their currently owned technologies. Because the agents are heterogeneous and they can only communicate about sets of technologies (not the individual benefit of one technology), they send limited information. Depending on the characteristics of the technologies the model behavior may result in technology diffusion. This has been discussed when answering the last research question: Which factors are important to technology diffusion in the Westland? Four experiments with the ABM have been performed and discussed. The first two experiments show that, at standard settings, technology diffusion does occur for technologies that are beneficial for all companies. The second experiment shows that having a high percentage of innovators (10-20%) is slowing diffusion down at first but leads to higher diffusion rates in the long run. Valuing the opinion of peers highly leads to high diffusion rates in the short run but is not the best strategy in the long (when self obtained knowledge is the most valuable). The fourth experiment shows that talking to many peers is beneficial for overall diffusion but that this effect diminishes with an increasing number of peers with who is communicated. A general important conclusion for the third sub question is that time is a very important variable in technology diffusion. The characteristics of the greenhouse farmers have different effects at different times and this research cannot tell at which point in time one should look exactly.","agent-based modeling; diffusion of innovations; greenhouse horticulture","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructure Systems & Services","","Energy & Industry","",""

(mentor); Jellema, A.H. (mentor)","2010","This graduation project focuses on the design of a “Stand-by Mobility Device for Local Purposes” (SMDLP). The SMDLP is a multi-functional mobility device, designed for supermarket visiting. The concept can be best imagined as a fusion of a carrier cycle, shopping cart and baby stroller. Namely the SMDLP has three comparable configurations: (1) cycling - riding mode, (2) shopping - walking mode and (3) storage - stand-by mode. This enables people to use the same device for both transportation and supermarket visiting. This idea of combining three yet existing functionalities into one device came forth from the idea that current transportation means are lacking in efficiency in case of supermarket visiting. (Travelling by car may cause traffic-jams, environmental pollution and fatal accidents; using the public transport may result in delays and by riding a bike one is unable to transport bigger loads safely; walking requires a lot of effort and time). In case of supermarket visiting people have to decide whether they go by car, public transport, bicycle or walk to the supermarket. Especially citizens, living in highly urbanised areas are limited in transportation abilities; because of limited parking space for cars and bicycles, busy travel routes and crowded supermarkets. The SMDLP intents to be the alternative: the device is ‘dedicated’ to supermarket visiting. People living in highly urbanised areas could use the SMDLP to transport (over short distances of 0-1km) themselves to the supermarket, gather shoppings (average is 7,5 kg and max 15kg) inside the supermarket, cycle back home and take the SMDLP along inside when storing the shoppings in the fridge or closets. The SMDLP can be folded into a compact package so people are able to store the device itself; ‘stand-by’ in the hallway, balcony or in any desired room. The SMDLP has been enriched, in terms of creating a more ‘intelligent’ product by implementing both (1) a rental system and (2) a payment system. When implementing a payment and rental system, the main idea would be to sale the SMDLPs to the supermarket (guarantees high sale quantities) and implement some sort of customer bonding; users can freely make use of the supermarket’s SMDLP rental system (no cost of ownership for consumer) but are bond onto that one specific supermarket chain when using its transportation mean. With this system supermarkets can transform into a new formula where less conventional shopping cart, car parking spaces and bicycle racks are needed.","design; mobility; vehicle; supermarket","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

The idea behind this design is basically a combination of trimming followed by Dynamic element matching (DEM). Test chips are fabricated to test the functionality and performance of the new concept. The DC accuracy obtained from the mirror is 0.18% and AC ripple is suppressed by 50X compared to state-of-the-art. The chip area (without padring) is 0.84mm2. The supply voltage ranges from 11V to 40V. This design was done using a high performance analog process (50HPA07HV) from Texas Instruments (TI).

The field is currently being developed by Maersk Oil and Gas (MOG) offshore Qatar, using large-scale water injection on very long horizontal wells. The studied reservoir consists of a laterally uniform, tight matrix. However, undesired water short-circuiting between injectors and producers due to localized heterogeneity leads to reduced sweep efficiency and increased water production, thereby reducing the economic life of approximately 10% of the wells. Smart well technology combines monitoring and control capabilities with multi-segment completions in order to optimize flooding mechanisms. In this study two different optimization strategies were simulated on a sector model containing different level of heterogeneity. The first method comprised a reactive, measurement-based approach, where injection segments were shut-in when increased water production was observed in production segments. The second method comprised a proactive, model-based approach where the optimal shut-in timing of injection segments was obtained from gradient information. The evaluated flooding mechanisms include water injection and Water-Alternating-Gas (WAG) injection. Results show optimization with smart well technology can significantly improve recovery and reduce water and gas circulation under varying conditions of reservoir heterogeneity. The measurement-based optimization confirms that the technology can improve reservoir engineering by its increased downhole monitoring capabilities. Results from measurement-based optimization approach the optimum found by model-based optimization.","optimization; optimisation; Al Shaheen; Al-Shaheen; smart; gradient","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Petroleum Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","Raw magnesium chloride can be recovered using solution mining at a depth of a 1500 to 2000 meters. Underground caverns are formed in stacked layers of bischofite , carnallite and halite. The salt layers consist for a large part of NaCl and but contain a minimum of at least 35% magnesium chloride. Recovery is implemented by injection of fresh water in the salt layer, which becomes saturated with magnesium. The carnallite and bischofite layers largely consist of the less soluble NaCl, with interdispersed magnesium salts. A cylindrical model of magnesium recovery is presented that consists of a central open space, an annular space filled with a porous salt (NaCl) layer with an outer boundary that consists of a bischofite layer or carnallite layer. The central cavity is an open cylinder filled with a solution of NaCl and MgCl2. The presence of KCl can be disregarded. Fresh water is injected into the centre of the central cavity. Brine is extracted at a distance below the injection point. The natural convection flows of the fresh injection water in the cavity are investigated. Calculations show that the central cavity contains a solution of more or less constant composition except near the central axis of the cavity. Fresh injection water is lighter than the brine and therefore it migrates to the top of the cavity while mixing with the brine. The concentration of the brine near the injection point at the axis of the central cavity increases rapidly so that the roof will not be exposed to brines that are able to dissolve significant amounts of NaCl. Adjacent to the central cavity there is a concentric annular space, which consists of a skeleton of crystalline NaCl. This acts as a porous medium. The outer radius of the porous medium is adjacent to the undisturbed bischofite layer. At the outer radius the concentration of bischofite and sodium chloride are given by the saturated equilibrium conditions. Also at the outer radius there is a no flow boundary. At the inner radius the concentrations are constant due to the mixing conditions in the central cavity. The values of these concentrations are given by the cavity growth model. The Elder model is used to simulate natural convection flows through a porous annular cylinder of low permeability. The enhancement in the transfer rate due to natural convection flows with respect to mass diffusion is expressed in the Sherwood number. Simulations were conducted on porous media with a permeability of 2e-12 m^2 or less. The maximum enhancement factor resulting from the simulations is two and a half. For higher permeabilities the Brinkman model is used. The cavity growth model describes the rate of change of the inner and outer radius of the porous medium. The rate of change of the outer radius is determined by the diffusive mass flux of MgCl2. The rate of change of the inner radius is determined by the dissolution of the NaCl skeleton. However, the equilibrium concentration of NaCl in the presence of dissolved MgCl2 is rather small leading to a low dissolution rate of NaCl. Results of the cavity growth model are presented in terms of the inner and outer radius of the annular cylinder as a function of time. The cavity growth model requires enhancement factors in the order of 1e5 to get magnesium concentrations that are comparable to field data. Such high enhancement factors can possibly only be obtained using the Brinkman model. ?","natural convection; solution mining; bischofite; carnallite; porous media; cavity growth; Veendam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Resource Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","Meta Products are the next generation product systems that will connect us in new ways with the Internet by combining a physical and a digital part. Bits and atoms have never been so close, and so the design challenge has never been greater. In this project, an extensive literature analysis was conducted to identify the most relevant theories and their issues. Then, an exploratory research was performed to categorize the technologies, applications and industries related to Meta Products. Several interviews were held with experts in practice to get insights and inspiration. And a series of tests and observations in focus groups were performed for validation. All this was synthesized in a method to design Meta Products and this report shows the whole process. It was found that in theory and in practice the relevant domains for Meta Products are Ubiquitous Technologies (UT), User Experience (UX) and Service Design (SD). It was also found that these domains have different mindsets and mostly work in ‘silos’; making it very complex for industries to identify the value of Meta Products. Moreover, the evolution in these domains has gradually turned the role of the user from a passive and unaware spectator to an active generator of environments. This role brings a multi-layered challenge for designers because of the complexity of the human dimensions involved (social, cultural, psychological) in Meta Product design. In this work, a transdisciplinary method is suggested. The basis of the method presented in this report, is the theoretical integration of the main principles behind Ubiquitous Technologies, User Experience and Service Dominant Logic. The main propositions of this method are that the willingness of a user to perform an action or ‘connection of exchange’ is based on his aspirations. Second, that this ‘connection of exchange’ per se, is the unit of value in the user’s network. And the third proposition is that the user’s network is the basis to encourage meaningful experiences. This is a network-focused design method that helps designers to understand how meaning and value is created in order to design successful Meta Products. It is holistic, abductive and iterative. It provides a guideline but at the same time provides the freedom to the designers to use their intuition, empathic skills and experience.","internet of things; physical web; meta products","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

In this research the efficiency of using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to acquire a detailed model of the cobble beach and extracting information from it will be explored. Using a 3D terrestrial laser scanner, a dense point cloud of the cobble beach can be generated. Then through scan registration, data processing (e.g. removal of outliers) and surface reconstruction a solid model will be created. The volume of the solid can be calculated and compared to the volume of a subsequent scan to identify any changes.

(mentor)","2010","Full-scale structural testing of of aircraft structures has been and still is the task of the aircraft industry when new aircrafts are developed. The NLR performs structural testing of aircraft structures for certification, this is done using structural test setups. Structural testing consists out of static testing (ultimate load) and fatigue testing (lifetime). The NLR is developing a new structural testing methodology whereby the testing behaviour is predicted using computational models before the certification test is actually performed, called virtual testing. This has the advantage of performance prediction as well as a reduction in costs and risks. This thesis covers the development of a virtual testing methodology for structural test setups, to simulate its static and dynamic behaviour. Structural test setups consist out of three main systems, the hydraulic system, mechanical system and control system. Currently design of the mechanical system and hydraulic system takes place in separate processes. Controller parameters are tuned when the test setup is built and in operation. As a result the total system performance is currently only known if the test setup is actually built. To improve design and performance of structural test setups a virtual testing methodology has been developed. The virtual testing methodology combines mechanical, hydraulic and control system in a simulation model to simulate the system performance of the test setup before it is built, called virtual testing. To develop and to verify the proposed virtual testing methodology a demonstration test setup is developed. This demonstration test setup is derived form the general architecture of structural test setups. Assumptions regarding the modelling where made to obtain a demonstration test setup which represents the essence of a general structural test setup. Reference signals used in fatigue tests are interpolated sinusoidal signals, therefore dynamic modelling of the demonstration test setup is applied. To obtain a measure of the bandwidth of fatigue reference signals, the frequency content of fatigue profiles where analyzed. This analysis obtained a maximum bandwidth of 5 [Hz]. Dynamic models of the three main systems, the hydraulic system, mechanical system and control system were developed and coupled, describing the system behaviour of a demonstration test setup. The control architecture as presently used is implemented in the model. Using the simulation models it is possible to obtain controller parameter and provide also the possibility to investigate non-linear effects, such as play and friction. The simulation models obtain physical knowledge of the system behaviour, which can be analyzed in the time domain or frequency domain. Measurements on the demonstration test setup where performed to verify the simulation models. Each component of the demonstration test setup was measured and verified individually. Coupled system measurements where performed for verification of the coupled mechanical, hydraulic and control system. The coupled system response is verified up to 40 [Hz], compared with the linear frequency response of the model. The simulation model proved to predict the frequency response of the demonstration test setup. This thesis proved the ability of virtual testing of structural test setups before they are actually build. Using these simulation models it is possible to investigate system performance and non-linear effects. Further research is needed on extending these models to full scale structural test setups.","virtual testing; structural fatigue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-07-28","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); De Blok, G.L.J. (mentor); Jansen, J.D. (mentor)","2010","For the calculation of drilling loads knowledge of the Coulomb friction coefficients for friction between drilling tubulars and casing or drilling tubulars and open hole is essential. To reduce drilling costs for geothermal wells the casing while drilling, CwD technique is considered. CwD reduces drilling time by eliminating round trips, because the well is drilled and cased simultaneously, thus improving efficiency. Drilling loads are the result of friction in the borehole, the weight of the string, and the borehole and drillstring geometries. Drilling costs will be reduced even more if the drilling loads can be reduced. In the Coulomb friction model the ratio between the friction force and the normal force is constant. Thus, if the normal force is reduced, the friction reduces. This can be achieved by replacing the regular heavy steel casing by lighter composite tubulars. Dynamic drilling loads like torsional vibrations can be triggered by the difference in static and dynamic Coulomb friction coefficients. A large difference increases the chance on the occurrence of such friction-induced vibrations. The objective of this study was to compare the Coulomb friction coefficients for steel and composite tubulars, under both static and dynamic conditions, through experiments with the different samples in sand and steel 'boreholes'. If the friction factors for composite casing are known, the dynamic drilling loads for CwD with composite casing can be predicted more accurately. Unfortunately, with the set-up used to measure the dynamic friction coefficients no conclusive results have been obtained. The Coulomb friction coefficients for steel on steel and for steel on ‘rock’ were constant for all applied loads, but the coefficients for composite on steel and for composite on ‘rock’ behaved unexpectedly. In particular, decreasing the normal force seemed to increase the friction coefficients to unrealistically high values. Also the static friction coefficient measurements of the composite casing showed some inconsistencies, which can be contributed to the irregular surface caused by the production process.","coulomb friction model; composite; casing while drilling; DAP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Petroleum Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Sodoyer, B.R. (mentor); Pronk, C. (mentor)","2010","Augmented reality is the concept of taking a representation of the real world, adding something to it and displaying it to the user. Applications for smartphones—so called augmented reality browsers—typically take the image of the integrated camera as a representation of the real world, and project textual or graphical objects on top of this image to create the augmented reality. The user can now look 'through' their phone as if taking a picture to look at the augmented world. This report describes iBetelgeuse; a novel augmented reality browser for iPhone, designed to be compatible with the Gamaray browser for Android. iBetelgeuse was developed for Finalist IT Group to improve the availability of their current and future augmented reality applications, and is the result of our Bachelor's project. iBetelgeuse supports most features other browsers also support, but focuses on interaction and responsiveness. Like Gamaray, it supports interaction with objects in the virtual world by tapping them, and allows dynamic worlds to be displayed by means of a web service. Unlike Gamaray and most other browsers it is highly responsive to changes in device orientation, which leads to a better user experience. The project was performed using Scrum; a framework for agile software development. Scrum successfully guided us through the development process, which resulted in an ever working product as we progressed. The first few weeks were dedicated to orientation and research, which proved to be very useful. iBetelgeuse has a clean architecture and thoroughly tested implementation, fit for maintenance and extension. It employs various algorithms that are quite complex and that require some mathematical background and thorough reading of this document to be understood, but apart from those algorithms the implementation is generally easy to understand and well documented. Although iBetelgeuse is a fully functional product—currently being reviewed by Apple for publishing in the iPhone App Store—there are still enough areas that can be improved. Our most important recommendations revolve around changes affecting the user experience, although some aspects of the implementation can also be improved, and new features can be added. Our recommendations for the application of iBetelgeuse, Gamaray, and their web services are, in short, that the interface between the web service and browser should be extended to give the web service more control over what is displayed on the client. We suggest to use a KML based format to replace the currently used GDDF format.","augmented reality; iphone; browser; ar; iBetelgeuse","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2010-07-09","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Peck, D. (mentor)","2010","Many sources mention that over 1 billion people lack adequate access to drinking water. A majority of these people live in countries of emerging economies. In many cases this problem involves poor and remote areas with little infrastructure of sewage and safe water supply. For these people, often referred to as the Base of the Pyramid (BoP), obtaining drinking water is a cumbersome and sometimes impossible task. There is a range of initiatives and solutions to this problem, but evidently these are not sufficient or widely applicable. A well-known technique is the solar still, which uses the sun as the only energy source. Although the existing devices using this technique do work, it has not resulted in many commercially interesting consumer products. An employee of the company Pilgrims Consult came up with an innovative idea after visiting one of the problem areas described above, the state of Gujarat in India. He turned to the faculty of industrial design engineering to help him develop his innovation, as a result this graduation project was initiated. In an early stage of the project a patent search was carried out to assess the uniqueness of the proposed idea. Similar but no identical patents were found. The project revolved around the following research question: “Does the improved solar still concept work, theoretically and practically, both in laboratory as in-field conditions?” To answer this question several aspects were analysed and calculations on the thermodynamic process were carried out. From those results a lab set-up was designed and tested. It was proven that the principle worked and it was decided that further development was justified. With the practical test results improvements were made and a field trip to India was arranged to test the design on location. A prototype was build in Ahmedabad and tested in Kothara, a city in the Kachchh district. During the in-field research period also 8 families were visited and interviewed on their water consumption habits, living space and income. Notes on the local context were made to generate a good description this water stressed area. On return water quality tests and concluding activities were carried out to be able to evaluate the results. The main conclusion with regard to the research question is that the principle is working but the output of drinking water is still not high enough to be competitive in market. There are indications that show that an improved performance can be achieved by redesigning several aspects of the current design proposal. On the user side, it has been confirmed that the need and interest in such a solution is indeed present. There is a clear awareness for drinking water quality. Users have access to water but are not satisfied with the quality and sometimes face drought periods. The context found in the Kachchh district offers good opportunities to implement such a product. There is a high pace of development and economic activity but there still is a serious water problem. The solar radiation is certainly present and strong enough to be able power the distillation process. Furhtermore, the water quality test carried out by the UNESCO-IHE convincingly confirm that the proposed distillation system is capable of delivering safe drinking water according to the WHO and EU standards. A rough cost estimation shows that the design is not yet economically interesting to the potential users in emerging markets. It also shows that the competing products are not fully unreachable. Finally a suggestion of redesign opportunities and a plan for further research has been proposed.","water purification; water stressed areas; emerging markets","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-07-12","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Two important building blocks for such an infrastructure are a secure and reliable messaging interface and a directory protocol.

Using this information, we have calculated the expected parameters of our multipass cell and the VIPA spectrometer. Employing a simulation, we got a clear idea of the intensity distribution we anticipate to detect. In the experimental part, we have implemented two different multipass cells, one with spherical mirrors and one with cylindrical mirrors. And we have constructed the VIPA spectrometer using two different gratings. We have obtained the desire intensity distribution. This distribution is in agreement with our simulation. It confirms that the grating separates the FSR of the VIPA etalon, and therefore, we can detect a broadband in a single image. However, we have not been able to detect an absorption spectrum yet and for instance we could not determine the area cover by the FSR. In the near future, we are going to build the resonant cavity in order to observe the absorption spectrum. We aim to build a successful trace gas detection setup using a VIPA spectrometer.

Such a runtime system needs to know the current configuration and load of the system to properly allocate the reconfigurable hardware. A runtime profiler is an important tool in this regard, as it can assist the runtime system by providing vital statistics about programs running on the system. Since the runtime profiler has to run in parallel with the actual code, it must be very lightweight and therefore very efficient data structures must be used to store the collected statistics. In this thesis, we present the design and implementation of such a runtime profiler. Empirical evaluation has shown that for most applications, our profiler has an overhead of less than 1.5\% of the total execution time. Moreover, the information generated by the profiler is almost as accurate as that of popular design time profiler GProf.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

A client can also introduce a new determinant (‘Jester’) in order to encounter client specific desires and whishes in the advice that a Bikker consultant is about to develop based on the analysis of the organization. In a playful interaction, both the consultants ánd clients can do a ‘trust-diagnosis’ of the client’s organizations, and ‘set starting points for the advice’, which forms a fruitful base for a mutually rewarding consultant-client relationship. The research conclusion is a list of conditions for theory-based trust determinants with potential usefulness for advice development practice at Euro RSCG Bikker in general, based on the toolbox design results. The trust determinants require further elaboration in the future, but for the current consultancy practice at Euro RSCG Bikker they form a start. Also, the toolbox requires maintenance and an update in the near future, especially if Euro RSCG Bikker wants to develop a trust-measurement instrument eventually. The report ends with various recommendations for future research into trust, design-based researchers, and future exploration opportunities for Euro RSCG Bikker to extend the proposition ‘committed to trust’.","trust; toolbox; determinants; corporate communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2010","For the geothermal wells of the Delft Aardwarmte Project it has been chosen to drill with glass-reinforced epoxy (GRE) composite casing in a drilling-with-casing setup. This MSc thesis report describes the results of experimental work to assess the stress-strain behaviour of GRE casing, in particular under axial, torsional and combined axial-torsional loading. These properties have subsequently been used to assess the effects of using GRE casing on standard drilling properties such as the stretch and twist of the drilling tubulars, and the effect on torsional vibrations. The following conclusions can be drawn: 1. For axial loads (in tension) up to 33% of the expected maximum drilling loads: a. No evidence was found of non-linear behavior. b. The measured elasticity modulus is 1.91*1010 N/m², which corresponds closely to the manufacturer’s data. c. The maximum expected elongation of a GRE casing string of 3300 m used for drilling-with-casing is 1.66 m, which is 0.06 m more than that of a steel drill pipe under similar drilling conditions.. 2. For torsional loads up to 98 % of the expected maximum drilling loads: a. The stress-strain behaviour in the tangential direction remains linear. b. The shear modulus measured is deemed incorrect due to the mechanical properties of the test bench. The shear modulus as reported by the manufacturer is 6.78*109N/m2. c. The maximum expected twist in a GRE casing string of 3300 m used for drilling-with-casing is 9.25 turns which is 6.3 turns more than that of a steel drill pipe under similar drilling conditions. d. The natural frequency in torsional vibration of a GRE casing is much lower than that of a steel casing in a comparable drilling setup due to its much lower torsional stiffness. However the large diameter of casing, as compared to conventional drill pipe, results in an increase in torsional stiffness. The combined effect is an increased natural frequency of GRE casing compared to steel drill pipe. e. As a result, the critical rotary speed, i.e the rotary speed below which one can expect the occurrence of stick-slip torsional vibrations, is lower for GRE casing than for steel drilling pipe under similar drilling conditions, i.e. the effect is beneficial. 3. Under increasing axial tension the torsional stress-strain behaviour displays an increasing hysteresis. a. The torsional dampening, expressed as energy loss per loading/unloading cycle ranges from xx% to xx%. This is much higher than the typical internal torsional damping in steel drill pipe. b. The typical external torsional dampening caused by fluid drag and borehole friction while drilling is in the order of 50%. The effect of internal damping caused by hysteresis during torsional loading of GRE casing is therefore noticeable, and results in a further beneficial decrease in the critical rotary speed for stick-slip torsional vibrations.","Composite Drilling Torsional Vibrations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-09-17","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Petroleum Engineering","","","",""

The effects on products in people's love relationships","Halilic, S.","Russo, B. (mentor); Van Dijk, M. (mentor)","2010","Aiming to advance the knowledge regarding the experience of love for products, and following Russo’s person-product love research, we investigate the experience of love for cars. The goal in this research is to investigate the effects of products’ behaviors in people’s love relationships. The investigation of people-cars love relationships is particularly interesting: first, people often tend to express their love for cars, seem to show no resistance in sharing or exposing their true feelings and thoughts about their beloved cars, and tend to be very open and comfortable about these relationships. Second, although every product has the potential to be a loved object (Brown, 1987), products people interact with on a daily basis have higher chances of becoming a loved object (Russo, 2009). Third, unlike mobile phones or shoes, we use our whole bodies to interact with cars. The variety of interactions that can be carried out with a car should help us gather rich insights and design-relevant knowledge. Fourth, there are limitations in the focus of car designers. They do not have the knowledge and tools to design cars that have the potential to be loved in a long-term span. We aim to provide car designers data and knowledge on how cars affect people’s experience of love. In order to understand the impact of product’s behavior in person-product love relationships, car’s kind and unkind behaviours are investigated. People couldn’t recount the car’s behavior without support, therefore a product behavior tool is developed with a set of 14 personality traits (relax, dominant, untidy, lively, provocative, honest, serious, boring, gentle, elegant, pleasant, reliable, pretty and cute). Results pointed out that the product behavior is one of the important influencing factors in the people’s experience of love and as such it should be included in the person-product love framework. The positive car behaviors tend to keep the overall experience of love high or heightened it more and the negatively car behaviors lower the overall experience of love. The conclusion is that when people treat their beloved products kind and with love, the product will probably react in the same way because the product reflects people’s feelings. It seems to indicate that people often invest efforts to overcome threats and maintain (or prolong) the relationship with their beloved products. To help people overcome product’s threats and hostilities, designers should avoid these interactions when forging relationships and designing for love. The ultimate intention of this research was to provide car designers with a framework. The idea about the framework is to create a character for each car behavior, based on the car characteristics represented in the car behaviors from the tool. Since a continue study is required for this, we will recommend a development of a framework for a future study.","experience of love in people-product relationships; product behavior","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

Furthermore, the constraints and properties of the inter-layer interconnect (Through Silicon Via (TSV)) are investigated, and the architectural potentials of 3D silicon integration are explored for memory-on-memory, logic-on-logic, memoryon-logic, and a 3D Network-On-Chip (NOC). Compared to a planar chip, 3D integration provides five key advantages: (1) wider and denser on-chip interconnects / busses, (2) wire length reduction (latency reduction), (3) lower power consumption, (4) the potential to use heterogeneous technologies, and (5) footprint reduction. Moreover, practical work is performed for this thesis, which evaluates a novel 3D scheme. The scheme stacks two (or more) 2D processors on top of each other, where all the Functional Units (FUs) are shared between all the processors. Thus, a processor can execute instructions on all the unutilized FUs of all the (remaining) processors. The free FUs on other processors can be utilized for fault detection or for performance improvement. Experimental results show that on average 52% of the executed instructions can be protected, or a speedup of on average 7% can be achieved. Both schemes are beneficial because no extra dedicated FUs are needed and fault detection and higher performance are achieved at low cost (only additional control logic and TSVs). This is because all the FUs from the processors are shared between them.","3D; three-dimensional; silicon stacking; TSV; 3D architecture; memory-on-memory; logic-on-logic; memory-on-logic; sharing functional units between CPUs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer engineering","","Computer engineering","",""

Therefore, it is imperative to understand the sector network architecture, the major dilemmas, the drivers causing change and the interdependency with outer aggregation levels. In the Sector Network, households historically had a predominantly consumptive role. But they are increasingly becoming producers, or prosumers. Therefore, the introduction of the Smart Living concept into households will fuel the Sector Network evolution pro-foundly.

(mentor); Blom, A. (mentor); Sloff, C.J. (mentor); Smale, A.J. (mentor); Wang, Z.B. (mentor)","2010","The area of the Merwedes is a transition zone between a tide-dominated area and a river-dominated area. With increasing river discharge, the influence of river flow dominates in this part of the Rhine-Meuse Delta. The composition of the river bed of the Merwedes is also a transitional area, because of the presence of both sand and mud. It is unknown how sediment transport and morphology in this area are influenced by the complex interaction of tidal flow and river flow. To be able to explain the morphological changes in the area of the Merwedes and to be able to anticipate on these changes, there is a need for better understanding of the hydraulic and mor-phological processes. This study contributes to a refinement of the system description of the Rhine-Meuse Delta by determining the influence of the tide on sediment transport and bed level in the river Merwedes. The aim of this graduation research is to gain insight into the contributions of tidal flow and river flow to sediment transport and bed level changes in the Merwedes, with a view to application of the obtained knowledge to Room for the River projects in this reach. The Room for the River project ‘floodplain excavation Avelingen’ has been chosen as case study. Three methods have been used to gain insight in the contribution of the tide to sediment transport and bed level changes in the Merwedes: (1) analysis of simulated flow, (2) analysis of simulated sediment transport, (3) analysis of simulated bed level changes. The following ranking has been determined with respect to the relevance for one-dimensional morphological modelling of the Merwedes: (1) including variations in river discharges, (2) the choice of a accurate sediment transport model, (3) including the tidal influence in the Waal and Merwedes, (4) including salt intrusion in the Rhine-Meuse Delta, (5) using a spring-neap cycle instead of a less detailed tidal cycle as sea boundary condition. These adjustments improve the simulation of the autonomous development of the bed level of the Merwedes. This ranking ap-plies to the yearly sediment transport. However, the ranking of modelling aspects varies between the Merwedes at specific river discharges. Both variations in river discharge and the tidal influence should be included in morphological studies of the Merwedes, because of interaction between river flow and tidal flow. The influence of the tide on sediment transport in the Merwedes can best be represented by a spring-neap cycle. However, a less detailed tidal cycle is a reasonable approximation of the tidal influence on sediment transport in the Merwedes.","river-tide interaction; sediment transport; bed level changes; morphology; Merwede; room for the River; ruimte voor de Rivier; Avelingen; SOBEK; fourier analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

This research focuses on how to increase the flexibility of training programs offered by simulation games. This is done by abstracting the scenario of simulation games, so it can be re-arranged by the training instructor using a standalone editing application.

For this reason, efforts are made to obtain higher levels of integration that can reduce costs and allow the presence of more and more instruments on board of small spacecrafts. With the advent of radiation hardened FPGAs, the use of reprogrammable hardware in space is no longer an issue. This opens new perspectives to space electronics. System-on-Chip (SoC) design methodologies for future highly-integrated devices are actively promoted by space agencies. In this thesis we focus on FPGA based SoC architectures for space electronics instrumentation, targeting time related issues. In this line of reasoning we proposed and developed a highly customizable trigger logic block able to reject background events with the highest possible efficiency and to accurately time-stamp the accepted ones. Its features include programmable coincidence window, input ordering, and for every input in particular the possibility to choose different states and to program the delay. The trigger logic block is designed as an AMBA IP core and it can be interfaced with many SoC libraries. For testing purposes we have programmed an AMBA based SoC architecture including a LEON3 on-chip processor and a minimal selection of IP cores from the GRLIB library on a Xilinx XC3S1500 FPGA. The trigger logic IP together with another IP developed for testing reasons were clocked at 100 MHz, while the rest of the system was running at 40 MHz. An average dead time of 1.5 µs was obtained, corresponding to an events frequency of 0.65 MHz. Based on our experimental results we can conclude that the proposed trigger logic approach can potentially successfully function in space applications. In extent to the trigger logic IP design, we have further performed research on the current SpaceWire time-codes, in an attempt to improve the inter-module time distribution accuracy. Several methods were proposed to reach synchronization in the order of nanoseconds, as opposed to the current microseconds synchronization, with little changes over the current SpaceWire standard.","Trigger; SpaceWire; SoC; AMBA; LEON3; FPGA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-07-07","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Stive, M.J.F. (mentor)","2010","Landslide generated Tsunamis are classified as a type of impulse waves. Several parameters including the geometry of the reservoir affect the behavior of impulse waves. The effects of geometry on impulse wave parameters are not yet fully understood. In order to investigate the effects of geometry on landslide generated impulse waves a total of 168 experiments were conducted in a wave basin of 2.00 m wide and 2.10 m long with a smooth bottom. The water level was kept constant at 0.10 m throughout the experiments. A block model has been used to simulate the landslides. Experiments were performed in a wave channel, a wave basin (at two different locations) and five diverging reservoir geometries with side angles of 15°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 75°. Plexiglass sheets at different angles were laterally placed inside the basin in order to achieve the desired geometries. The results of this study indicate that geometry of the reservoir affects wave parameters such as relative wave height, relative wave amplitude, relative wave period, relative wave height decay, and relative wave amplitude decay. It was found that relative wave height at the wave generation zone corresponding to the wave channel and the wave basin are identical. Wave parameters corresponding to the wave channel are larger than in the wave basin. Results of this project show a good agreement with Huber (1980) which implies that relative wave height in the slide impact zone for 2D and 3D deviates a little. It was observed that wave parameters corresponding to geometries with reservoir side angles larger than 45° follow a similar trend in the wave basin.","landslide generated tsunamis; impulse waves; reservoir; wave generation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor); Wang, Z.B. (mentor); Geleynse, N. (mentor); Eelkema, M. (mentor)","2010","The Lai Giang inlet located in Binh Dinh province incorporates various features of the estuaries in the Central part of Vietnam. Belonging to the micro-tidal and wave-dominant coast and influenced by the monsoon regime, the inlet has a seasonal character. During the dry season, as the river flow diminishes, the wave action causes high level of sedimentation and closes up the inlet eventually. In flood season, as the river discharge is high, the channel is scoured and the inlet begins to migrate. The high sedimentation level and migration of the Lai Giang inlet has been a serious problem of Binh Dinh province for a long time, because it is the only exit for the floodway. It is an anchorage and also the connection between the sea and the aquaculture area of Hoai Nhon district. The high level of sedimentation at the entrance of the inlet prevents river flood from flowing smoothly, thus leading to overflow in lowlands and navigation issues. In recent decades, the exploitation and protection of Lai Giang area have been studied in various forms of scientific researches and projects by different scientists and local professional agencies. However, the studies have only focused on hydraulics, hydrology and on adjusting the flow of Lai Giang river. There are only general and basic studies on the entrance of the inlet. The main objective of this research is to understand the morphological behaviour of Lai Giang inlet. The specific interest is focused on the main factors which are the tidal characteristic, the wave climate and the river flow during the flood season, and the interaction between all these factors that influence the morphological changes. The study starts with the collecting and analysing all the documentations to come up with a conceptual model of the Lai Giang inlet to explain how the sedimentation and the migration processes happen. Then, the Delft3D modelling software, which can model (tidal) flow, waves and sediment transport, has been applied to confirm the hypothesis and gain further knowledge. According to the data analysis, the conceptual model as well as the descriptive and quantitative result of the model, we can make the following main conclusions: 1. The wave climate in this area has seasonal characteristic and is dominated by two main directions; Northeast and Southeast in winter and summer monsoon, respectively. 2. During the summer monsoon, the longshore sediment transport moves towards the north, bypasses the entrance of the inlet and gradually builds up on the down-drift spit due to the Southeast Wave. 3. During winter monsoon, the Northeast wave intensifies the southward longshore sediment transport leading to the large amount of sedimentation in front of the inlet. At the same time, the significant river flow flushes away the sediment deposits at the main ebb channel located nearer to the up-drift spit. Thus the sedimentation could not take place at the up-drift spit. The sediment displacement at the up-drift and down-drift spit made the inlet migrate to the north gradually. Finally, the possibility to stabilize the inlet is discussed to give the optimum solution for this area.","Morphological modelling; Tidal inlet; Monsoon influence; sedimentation; inlet migration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

The PPC is a financial-economic assessment tool that can be used before a tender to determine whether there is a surplus value for a specific project (real estate or infrastructure) in the form of a Public Private Partnership based on a DBFM(O)-contract compared to a traditional form of contract. At state level, this assessment tool has been successfully implemented for a few years now whereas at the decentralized level there is still little experience with this tool and there are mainly pitfalls. Recently the Ministry of Finance launched a pilot for local authorities to examine the need for knowledge and experience regarding DBFM(O)-contracts, after an advice of the Commission on Private Financing of Infrastructure, also known as the Ruding Committee. The main question that will be answered by means of this research is: Under which conditions, with regard to content and process, is it possible to use the PPC within the municipality? This study shows which conditions are needed at State level and how these can be translated to a municipal situation and organization. The result of these findings is converted in a report and a step-by-step plan with regard to content and process for the implementation of the PPC at municipal level. This research has been conducted within, and focuses specifically on the municipality of Rotterdam.

(mentor); Den Heijer, A.C. (mentor)","2010","Problem Budget exceeding is a topical subject in semi-public and public projects such as the ‘Noord-Zuidlijn’, the ‘Rijksmuseum’ and 3ME & Industrial Design. The cause(s) of this problem is not clear yet, however the indication is that the project approach could have a contribution to this. The phrasing of the question of this research is therefore: Research method To be able to answer the research question, project approach has to be defined. Initially aspects as: decision-making, rganizational structure, hierarchy, number of layers (Executive Board, steering committee, project group, design group), the way to draw up the programme of requirements and budget determination, are subject to project approach in this research. After the literary study and case studies the content of project approach became even more clear. The following three cases were selected: case renovation 3ME & new housing Industrial Design, case expansion Civil Engineering & Geosciences and case new estate Applied Science. The cases were selected at the campus of Delft University of Technology and were based on the literary study and orientation interviews. Each case has been subjected to three in?depth interviews with actors who were involved in the process. The findings of the analysis of the three cases are compared with the results of an extra case: BK City. This case is included with the assumption that this project is completed within budget. In contradiction with the other cases, this case was not studied in-depth, but a comparison was made about the similarities and / or differences of the project approach. Based on the outcome of this comparison a final conclusion about project approach and budget compliance is drawn. Findings The cross case analysis and comparison shows the following causes for budget exceeding:  drawing up the programme of requirements, which consisted of - trouble while drawing up the programme of requirements and accuracy of drawing up this document - change of the scope of the ambition level - desiring a certain appearance / investing more in the design for an international appearance - adding a department  unforeseen circumstances (risks)  politics and time pressure (risks)  project organization, which consisted of - two-hat-problem - decision-making - communication lines Conclusion After studying the cases, it can be concluded that within an organization as such, project approach cannot be defined in one clear notion, but has to be divided into three categories: strategic, tactical and operational. On strategic level the following questions arises, for example: what are the agreements concerning the project organization and hierarchy, how are the responsibilities divided and based on what criteria are budget requests being approved or denied? On tactical level it concerns the consistency of filling-in the project organization and the implementation. It also concerns, in what way are the programme of requirements drawn up and which aspects are taken into account (like risks and future expectations)? At an operational level it concerns the accuracy in which this document is drawn up? In addition, how is the communication when it comes to alterations in the programme or requirements? After analyzing the cases it can be established, there is no clear line in the project approach regarding the project organization. The hierarchy, decision-making and communication lines differs significant per project. So a conclusion about this subject is, that there is neither consistency nor structure in the project organization. Based on the results of this research it can be concluded that (a great deal of) the budget exceeds also due to the current project approach. Recommendation Regarding drawing up the programme of requirements in the definition phase, a few items have to be added to the current method. The most likely ambitions have to be elaborated more extensively and in addition: new education concepts, workplace concepts, IT development, etc. must be adopted. This document has to contain the basic requirements that are most likely needed and in a business case the investments will be justified. In the business case the cost will be weighed against the benefits. The same counts for the pro’s and the cons. Based on this document an estimate of the basic investment cost will be made. In addition two other elements have to be added: an ambition analysis and a risk analysis. The ambition analysis contains: ambition levels that are not specified yet, future expectations of the university or / and faculty, future developments, etc. Moreover, it also contains a business case with a research, explanation and foundation why the (indirect) benefits will compensates for the cost. The risk analysis consists of an enumeration of all probable risks and unforeseen circumstances the project could face. On a strategic level (policy) changes have to be made regarding the decision-making, agreements and arrangements. For example: the denial or approval for the budget in the definition phase has to be based on the situation of the project. Regarding the project organization, the filling-in of the layers in the temporary organization chart must be done consequently and one of the most important aspects is to observe of the agreements made on a higher level.","Project Approach; University Building Projects; Budget Compliance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Design & Construction Management","",""

Tomografie is een methode om eigenschappen van een onbereikbaar gebied te bepalen met behulp van stralen of drukgolven. De aardkorst bestaat uit allerlei verschillende steenlagen. Als op grote diepte een aardbeving plaatsvindt, dan hebben verschillende drukgolven die vertrekken vanaf het epicentrum verschillende reistijden naar het aardoppervlak. Deze meetbare reistijden hangen onder andere af van de voortplantingssnelheid die iedere steensoort heeft. Bij dit onderzoek is een model gebruikt om golfvoortplantingssnelheden te bepalen aan de hand van reistijdmetingen. Met behulp van dit model is het mogelijk de aardkorst op grote diepte (tientallen kilometers) te reconstrueren. Tomografie is dus een krachtig hulpmiddel om aardbevingen te kunnen voorspellen.

(mentor)","2010","The objective of this study is to determine large scale of fine sediment transport near coral reefs islands in the Singapore Strait. Coral reefs in the Singapore Strait face great pressure due to high sedimentation and turbidity, which cause decreasing of light penetration and of environment quality for the coral growth. Sedimentation and high level of turbidity are caused by large scale of dredging and land reclamations in the Singapore. The location of Singapore Strait between two major water systems, leads to complex tidal system of the strait. Tidal elevation is predominantly semidiurnal while current velocity is diurnal. Field data from several tidal stations and offshore observation points are utilized in order to analysis large scale of fine sediment transport. The representative of time series from each observation point during the southwest and northeast monsoon were selected based on the data availability and quality. Seasonal variation of current velocity shows eastward dominant flow during the SW monsoon and westward dominant flow during the NE monsoon. Residual flow plays more roles in the fine sediment transport than tidal asymmetry. Average residual flow ranges from 0.1 to 0.3 m/s with the peak 0.8 m/s in January. Wave action does not show significant impact to resuspension of fine sediment in deep water, but considerably cause fine sediment to resuspend at near surface. A turbidity level near coral reef islands corresponds to the fine sediment concentrations variation. High turbidity event occurs at all observation points and far from optimal level for coral growth. High turbidity event occurs more than weeks which is likely caused by resuspension of large sediment supply by strong currents.","fine sediment; residual transport; tidal asymmetry; residual flow; turbidity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

The document is intended to provide an insight in the development process used to produce the final prototype delivered by the project. The project entailed the design and implementation of a graphical, statistical analysis applica- tion for aCGH data. The applications main functionality is the displaying of the corresponding aCGH profile, as well as the analysis of this profile in order to determine any significant copy number variations in the analysed genome. The application also identifies genes located in these significant regions and provides annotation data about these genes, which are retrieved from a variety of external databases. Other functionality included by the product are the export of the displayed data as well as the displaying of relations between the identified gene in a circular plot using the Circos application. The above listed functionality was derived from the extensive list of requirements created during the requirements phase of the development. The creation of this list was supported well by the basic knowledge acquired during the orientation phase, which proved invaluable in the interviews with the clients. The design of the system divides the system into a set of six subsystems, in which the database component is divided into a client-server component. The Ibidas system forms the server-side element of this component. The subsystem division is designed to keep the different compo- nents of the application compartmentalised and well-defined. The application also incorporates a multi-threaded design in order to keep the application responsive when performing lengthy tasks. The main problems encountered during the implementation of the application was the size of the data, which required a number of optimisations even though the data structures were de- signed accordingly. The main performance problems were encountered in the visualisation of data, which were solved by the implementation of a customised and optimised view to draw the data efficiently. The product has been subjected to a number of automated and manual tests to verify it meets the set requirements of functionality and the expectance of the clients. The product produced in this project meets the set requirements and has therefore been suc- cessful. The developed prototype is still a prototype demonstrating its possibilities however and leaves much room for improvement before it should be applied in actual use cases.","bioinformatics; aCGH; copy number; copy number variation; VUMC; NKI; CGH","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2010-07-11","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Bioinformatics","","","",""

The advance in technology in recent years has provided new possibilities for more accurate and better applications of FES. One of the goals of this technology is to develop a device which can stimulate the muscles of a patient to achieve natural and dynamic movements. However in order to achieve this goal there still is more investigation to be done. In this thesis the combination of FES and surface electromyography (sEMG) is used to evaluate a method that could be used to stimulate the muscles to achieve a dynamic movement. In order to achieve this dynamic and natural motion two characteristics are looked for: the position of the limb that has is being stimulated and the best position on the skin where to apply the surface electrical stimulation. FES is used to stimulate synchronously a group of motor fibres. The resulting signal from this stimulation is then recorded by the sEMG and analyzed. This thesis investigates whether this signal contains enough information to obtain the position of the limb that is being stimulated and the best position on the skin where to apply the electrical stimulation. The worked realized in this thesis consists in creating the experimental set-up and developing the adequate analysis to show the feasibility of this concept. Different set-ups are tested on the biceps of 4 healthy subjects while the analysis of the signal is done offline. Experiments using this technique in static conditions are presented to demonstrate accuracies as high as 97% for certain configurations and for subjects with certain physiological characteristics. Also positive results in the detection of the best location where to apply the electrical stimulation are presented. Now that there is a proof-of-concept, a series of next steps are defined with the purpose to develop this technology: test other muscles, increase the population under test, test this technology in real time and dynamic conditions and increase the accuracy of the algorithms.","FES; motor point; EMG","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-02","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor)","2010","The immersed tunnel technique is a common used technique for river crossings in the Netherlands, but also in the United States and Japan. 80% of the immersed tunnels are built in these 3 countries. The design of the immersed tunnels differs for the different countries, because of the possibility of seismic loading on the tunnel structure. This seismic loading can occur at the west coast of the United States and in Japan, because of their position close to tectonic earth plates. The immersed tunnels in the Netherlands are built with elements of 100-150 meter consisting of segments of 20-25 meters. For transportation these segments are pre-stressed forming one element, after immersion on the river bottom they are released again. In this way the tunnel is flexible and can follow the settlement differences of the river bed. The water tightness in the joints is secured with rubber sealing profiles in the segment joints (W9U) and compressible rubber profiles in the immersion joint (Gina). In areas where risk of seismic activity is severe, the immersed tunnels are built different. The pre-stressed tunnel elements are kept as one element, the same as they are for transportation, to prevent joint opening and leakage. This results in large deformations in the immersion joints and Gina gaskets and stresses in the tunnel structure. For this reason a research is performed on the behaviour of the segmental immersed tunnel subjected to seismic loading and especially on the sensitive segment joint. Most earthquakes are created by the movement of tectonic plates. The release of energy involved with this movement creates seismic waves which will propagate through the soil. When these waves reach an immersed tunnel, it will respond to the soil movements with a certain behaviour. The design seismic wave that causes the tunnel to deform is the shear wave (S-wave). When this wave propagates parallel to the tunnel axis, the tunnel will bend in lateral direction causing the snaking effect. This can occur in horizontal and vertical direction, but the horizontal direction is determining. When the wave reaches the tunnel under an angle of 45 °, the tunnel can be deformed in axial direction. This is called the worming effect. Both the worming and snaking effect are modeled to determine the influence of the different seismic design parameters like the wave length of the seismic wave, the construction depth and the tunnel element length. Other important model properties are the stiffness of the rubber gaskets in the segment joints and the immersion joints. All the properties and loads due to the seismic soil movement are included in two different beam models to determine the worming and snaking effect for a representative immersed tunnel. The modeling of the worming and snaking effect shows that the gasket properties and the seismic wave length are the most important parameters. The compressibility of the Gina gasket and the elongation capacity of the W9U determines the total axial deformation of the immersed tunnel. For the snaking effect the rotation capacity and the number of Gina gaskets are of importance. The segment joints act relatively stiff and are of less importance until their moment capacity is reached. Then joint opening and leakage could occur. It can be concluded that the propagation speed and wave length of the seismic wave are important factors when modeling the worming and snaking effect of immersed tunnels. It is not clear from literature what the seismic design wave is for tunnels in soft soil. This needs to be investigated further to make a final judgment on the behaviour of the segment joints. For the used design parameters the tunnel can withstand the worming effect, but snaking could cause joint opening and leakage based on the free-field approach. For the snaking effect a soil-tunnel- interaction approach should be performed to determine the real tunnel response and make a final judgment of the behaviour of the segment joint.","immersed tunnel; earthquakes; seismic; joints; W9U; Gina","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","",""

Vessels equipped with this system, send out a message every few seconds, containing their position, speed, course, identification number, etc. This makes it possible to perform a statistical analysis of vessel behaviour, based on these AIS messages. If in this way more insight in the vessel behaviour is obtained, maritime models might benefit. In this thesis such an analysis is done, by a case study in the Port of Rotterdam area. The average vessel path and accompanying vessel speed are investigated. The influence of vessel size, wind, current and visibility on the path and speed are taken into account as well. In the end, these results are generalised, so they can be used for other port areas as well.","AIS data; vessel behaviour; maritime models; statistical analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-07-06","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Ports and waterways","",""

First, the optimization of trans-arctic navigation was addressed in light of the global warming impact on Arctic sea ice. In this regard, a central consideration was given to the Northern Sea Route (NSR), such that its history, characteristics and future interests were addressed. Following, an environmental management scheme was developed in line with today’s sustainable development principles. Advanced mitigation measures were proposed for the proposed development, in consistence with the most recent recommendations of international regulations. Finally, the thesis quantitatively scrutinized the comparative environmental profiles of NSR passage and Suez Canal transit. Environmental mapping was used for this purpose such that carbon foortprint estimates formed the basis for comparing generated emissions as a result of shipping activities of the case study in question. The synergy between fuel consumption, energy consumption and generated emissions was reflected in the model. Further, the role of slow steaming was highlighted in terms of reducing emissions for all considered cases. The study also recommended several areas of research in respect to the investigated impacts. In conclusion, the thesis notes that the NSR, despite its ice-infested waters, presents the most environmentally feasible routing out of the presented alternatives. A question worth investigating then: how will trans-arctic navigation in an ice-free Arctic interact with the existing impacts of climate change?","arctic transformation; arctic sea ice; sustainable development; carbon footprint","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor); Stive, M.J.F. (mentor)","2010","Found on the NW Mediterranean, the Catalan coast is not only subjected to morphological changes driven by physical natural processes but also by significant changes in local dynamics that result from the numerous coastal structures that are found on its realm. The armoring of coastal stretches is a common selected option for protecting valuable infrastructure and the hinterland. Nonetheless, the induced effects of these kinds of structures are still an open question that can be only answered by local means and remain unrevised for the area. In the present study an inventory of all the armored structures found along the Catalan coast was carried out. An approximate estimation of 110km of total armoured coast that accounts for 19% of the total Catalan coast was found and synthesized into eight associative structure-beach pattern groups by considering: morphological classification of beach and seawall characteristics. Los Vascos at the northern Ebro hemi delta and Sant Pol de Mar in the Maresme region were selected as representative sites of for in depth analysis. A review of the reported effects accrued to structures on the adjacent beach found on literature was updated and tested at each representative site in the longshore and crosshore dimension through numerical simulations. For the longshore plan shape dimension, GENESIS (Generalized Model for Shoreline Change) was used. Seasonal, yearly and long term analyses were performed, exhibiting differences in magnitudes of sediment transport rates and dominant mechanisms. At Los Vascos the average net sediment transport was estimated in 37095.16m3/year where finer sediments are distributed by an almost unidirectional longshore current towards the northern part of the hemi delta. While for the case of Sant Pol de Mar, the sediments are redistributed in both north and south directions along the year, producing a relatively lower net average transport rate obtained in 14785.47m3. Through simulations with and without the presence of structures, the effects accrued to the structures only were found. Maximum beach erosion and areas of influence were obtained. Expected effects in the long term were found through 10 years simulations. Furthermore, variations in 0.25m and 0.5m water level increments, 5% and 10% Hs and Tp increments, and 5% and 10% storm frequency increments were tested individually and in combination for the year 2057 as possible future conditions. As for the cross-shore dimension, the SBEACH model (Storm Induced Beach Change Numerical Model) was used to analyze the response in the beach in front of the structures at each site. Additional 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 years return period characteristic storms were tested. Qualitatively information was gained when comparing theoretical non walled final profiles and walled profiles obtained through simulation. Moreover, higher insight was achieved regarding the obtained GENESIS responses by the setup of the available solutions of the one line analytical model developed by Hanson and Krauss (1987) for Los Vascos site. The solution for a semi infinite wall with no flanking effect resembled in higher accurate manner the obtained GENESIS responses proving that this was the solution offered by the model. Finally, it was proven that if the erosion behind the structure and downdrift erosion are subjects to be quantitatively analyzed the solution for a semi infinite wall with flaking effect can be very useful aid in addition with GENESIS simulations.","Coastal; Armouring; Morphodynamics; Mediterranean Coasts","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor); Goossens, R.H.M. (mentor)","2010","Executive Summary Current walking aids are very limited in functionality. Although the recovery of temporary injuries is a dynamic process, the present walking aids stay static. It is up to the gut feeling of patients and verbal feedback of therapists to determine what partial weight bearing should be applied on the injured leg. This graduation report describes the development of the Smart Tip, a monitoring device that expands the functionality of the standard crutch. The focus in the analysis phase of this project was on the rehabilitation process. Beside a literature study, interviews with four therapists and an internet survey amongst another 80 therapists were conducted. Also a focus group session with three experienced crutch users and several observations were carried out, in order to understand the context and use of walking aids. Every therapist treats injuries in his own way and many factors can influence the recovery process. This is why the design of a new aid must be a tool for the therapist rather than a source of medical advice. The research in the first phase has lead to a potential design direction: a walking aid that informs the users and adapts to different phases of the recovery process. The Smart Tip can monitor weight bearing activity on the leg and is adjustable in compliancy. It can be programmed to the patient and his injury. The device gives direct feedback to the patient and the therapist can read out data about everyday physical activities afterwards. It gives the therapist the opportunity to adapt the settings in case of changes in the treatment. A prototype of the concept was tested on 10 healthy participants. The prototype was connected to a laptop, so data from the sensors could be stored and feedback could be activated. From the results in usage and experience some improvements were made on feedback and compliancy. The feedback in the final concept can be changed from practice-configuration into everyday-configuration. The feedback is summarizing and simple. The spring is adjustable from 0 to a maximum of 2 cm travel. In this way full support or shock absorption can be establish. The Smart Tip gives therapists the opportunity to measure progress of patients in an objective way. The Smart Tip is now developed into a technical concept, but further investigation is needed before it is ready for production. The effect on the patient’s body and the rehabilitation period are still questioned.","smart tip; crutch; rehabilitation; weight bearing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-07-02","Industrial Design Engineering","Applied Ergonomics & Design","","","",""

(mentor); Wang, Z.B. (mentor); Eelkema, M. (mentor); Geleynse, N. (mentor)","2010","The Eastern Scheldt tidal basin and its ebb tidal delta have changed drastically in the recent centuries under the influence of natural processes and human interventions. A Storm Surge Barrier, one of constructions within framework of Delta Project in the Eastern Scheldt, is considered as the largest impact to changes in hydrodynamics and morphology of the ebb tidal delta. The barrier was built in 1987 to maintain the tide and to protect the area from flooding. The barrier closes under severe storm surge conditions and remains open during normal conditions to preserve the tide-dominated character of the ecosystem. However, this storm surge barrier caused a reduction of tidal volume and tidal current in the Eastern Scheldt. Since 1987, there has been a remarkable reduction of the tidal prism by 30%, of the average tidal range by 12% and of the average tidal current velocities by 33%. As a result, sediment export from the basin towards its ebb tidal delta has ceased. This led and still to changes in morphology of the ebb tidal delta. In order to adapt to changes in tidal volume, the tidal channels become sinks of sediment and this sediment has been and still is taken from the tidal shoals nearby. Sediment volume of these shoals therefore has decreased drastically. The deposition in channels and erosion on the shoals caused a number of negative effects to ecology, safety, navigation, recreations and fishery in the Eastern Scheldt. To analyse the morphological developments of the ebb tidal delta before, during and after the implementation of the Storm Surge Barrier in the Eastern Scheldt, bathymetry maps which present the changes in deposition and erosion parts in the ebb tidal delta in every four years (from 1960 to 2004) were used. In summary, the morphology of the Eastern Scheldt ebb tidal delta experienced enormous changes due to the Delta Project. These changes comprise shoaling and reorientation of channels- from updrift to downdrift (northward) migration of channels, landward migration of shoals, development and diminishing of ebb and flood chutes and development of scour holes near the entrance of the storm surge barrier. As a result, it would take a long time (centuries) to establish a new dynamic equilibrium between hydraulic conditions and geomorphology in the Eastern Scheldt inlet.","Eastern Scheldt; ebb tidal delta; morphology; storm surge barrier","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

The positive side is that it increases the mobility of the inhabitants because they are close to the infrastructure. However till now the highway is often not really implemented in the urban plan, but is more a separated element, which cuts through the landscape. This is caused by different reasons, but one of them is that the highway brings noise and pollution problems. Because of these problems there are nowadays even some functions restricted to be built in a band of 300 meters from the highway, like schools, health centers etc. When it’s possible to reduce the pollution and noise significantly by the design, it could be possible to build closer to the highway and create there a pleasant zone where people would like to stay. The building that will be investigated, is also close to the highway, because it creates a link between two different areas which are separated by the highway. The location is close to the Prins Claus Plein (The Hague, Netherlands), which forms the junction of the highways A4 and A12 . The goal in this research is to find ways to make it possible to build close to the highway by handling with the problems of noise and air pollution. The relationship between the highway and the building is greatest at the edges of the building, so that is an interesting territory to explore.","noise; particulate matter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-08-26","Architecture","Building Technology","","Architectural Engineering","",""

(mentor); Zijlema, M. (mentor); Burgmeijer, M.A. (mentor); Vatvani, D.K. (mentor)","2010","Due to the diminishing Coriolis force towards the equator, the equatorial zone is known to be cyclone-free. However, on 27th December 2001, a tropical cyclone Vamei was formed near Singapore; 1.4 degrees latitude North from the equator, and made a landfall about 60 km northeast of Singapore. Although this event did not cause any major destruction to Singapore, the neighbouring areas such as states of Johor and Pahang of Malaysia had suffered inland flooding and landslide caused by the heavy precipitation of the storm. Chang et al. (2003) has suggested that the return frequency of a typhoon similar to Vamei is approximately 1 in 400 years, thus the possibility of a tropical storm occurring in Singapore could not be ignored. With the population density of over 7000 per square kilometer, the consequences of flooding due to storm surge can be devastating for Singapore. This study aims to provide a quantitative assessment to estimate the possible storm surge induced by typhoon near Singapore using numerical hydrodynamic modeling tool Delft3D. In order to simulate the hydrodynamic condition of both the tide and the storm surge in the Singapore Strait, the so-called Singapore Regional Model (SRM) will coupled offline with the cyclone model; Wind Enhanced Scheme (WES), both developed by Deltares|Delft Hydraulics (2004 and 2009b). The hindcast of the typhoon Vamei event has been attempted in this report to examine the applicability of the model in Singapore waters. Then the sensitivity of different typhoon’s tracks, forward speeds and radii of maximum winds on the storm surge will be examined closely to estimate the worst case scenario in terms of surge that could cause by a typhoon in this region. This report also acts as a preliminary study of the possible extreme high water levels which includes storm surge, tide and sea level anomaly that could occur along the coast of Singapore. According to the result of this study, the extreme event with an estimated return frequency of 1 in 400 years can cause the water level to reach as high as 2.0 to 2.8 depending on location.","typhoon; storm surge; Singapore","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor); Ledoux, H. (mentor)","2010","The knowledge of the transportation mode used in a movement trajectory (derived in form of timestamped positions) is critical for applications such as travel behaviour studies. This thesis presents a method for segmenting movement data into single-mode segments and their classification with respect to the used transportation mode. The method relies on concepts found in expert systems, most notably membership functions, fuzzy logic, and certainty factors. A prototype, which may serve as a framework for managing travel behaviour surveys has been built in order to validate the presented theories and to classify the available test dataset. The transportation modes that this system classifies are walking, bicycle, tram, car, bus, train, underground, sailing boat, ferry, and aircraft. This research also investigates the performance of OpenStreetMap data in solving this problem. This free source of geodata proved to be crucial for the classification, where the ten transportation modes are discerned with various indicators mostly derived from the geodata, for instance, the proximity of the trajectory to the tram network and the information whether the movement has been made on a water surface or not. The classification relies on eliminating unlikely transportation modes by values set with a number of empirically derived fuzzy membership functions, and by using the selected combination of indicators it is possible to distinguish in between transportation modes which exhibit a similar behaviour (e.g. a car and bus in urban areas). Finally, the classification results are attached with a certainty value. The results are supplemented with additional mode-related information, e.g. the name of the departure train station. The segmentation has been done by detecting potential transition points between two transportation modes as brief stops. After each segment between consecutive potential transition points is classified, adjacent segments with the same classification outcome are merged (and removing the transition point in between), and keeping only the actual transition points where the transportation modes had been changed. The method solves the problem with noisy data, and traffic congestions which bias the indicators by using additional statistic values. The classification of gaps in the data (e.g. caused by a signal shortage during the logging of a trajectory) derived satisfying results, and segments with only their starting and ending point have been successfully classified. Thanks to the coverage of the OpenStreetMap data, in this research trajectories located outside the Netherlands (e.g. Norway and Denmark) have been segmented and classified as well. The accuracy of the classification with the developed prototype, determined with the comparison of the classified results with the reference data derived from manual classification, is 91.6 percent.","movement trajectory; segmentation; classification; GPS track; openstreetmap","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","GIS technology","","Geomatics","",""

With the launch of the Spatial Plan Region Rotterdam 2020, efforts towards a comprehensive development of this part of the city are made. The area-oriented programme North Axis embodies these efforts and consists of both spatial developments and infrastructural developments. Rotterdam Noordrand is positioned on the interconnection of these infrastructural developments and has adopted the characteristics of a multimodal location: a location that is connected to both a road network and a public transport network. However, the spatial developments in Rotterdam Noordrand are being realised on an individual basis, avoiding the comprehensive character of the Spatial Plan Region Rotterdam 2020. A central place within the area is necessary to establish a connection between the segmented sub developments. The research that is outlined in this thesis concerns three possible central places. It identifies how these locations are influenced by the scheduled infrastructural developments. Linear Programming is used as a modelling technique to structure the complex process of urban area development and conducts a strategy for these central locations. The model is optimised for market quality, spatial quality, means and organisation, referring to the four key elements of an optimal strategy. Subsequently, the strategy is translated into programmatic elements. Due to the infrastructural influences, the optimal strategy provides the area with two central places: one in the subarea Rotterdam Airport Business Park and one in the subarea Hoog-Zestienhoven. The comprehensive development of Rotterdam Noordrand is scheduled from 2005 – 2044 and ensures synergy regarding the spatial developments and infrastructural projects.","urban area development; design and decision systems; infrastructural influences; linear programming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-07-27","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Real Estate Management","",""

A facade wall is also supposed to be self-supporting. The self-supporting property can be divided in two main categories; the weight of facade construction (dead load) and the wind that is pushing against the wall (wind load). These loads combined will have to be carried by the facade construction. If looked at history there is a trend of adding a product or system to the facade wall when they needed a extra function. For example the cavity of a facade wall is added mainly for protection against penetrating water through the wall. That resulted in a extra layer in the facade wall meaning; extra weight, building time and materials. This mono material facade will have a base material which is mineral Wool. This insulating material is already used in between cavity’s, roof cladding and sandwich-panels, but used only for the low thermal conductivity.

(mentor); De Ridder, H. (mentor); Dadlani, P. (mentor)","2010","Executive summery Phase 1: Design research - starting on page 11 This project deals with two very different stakeholders within Philips Research, namely the ambiPhone project team and the Human Interactions & Experience group. The ambiPhone team consists mainly of people from the Digital Signal Processing group and is responsible for the technological development of the system. The Human Interactions & Experience group focuses on doing research on User System Interactions, amongst which social interaction. For this project the setting of modern communication behavior and development is very important. Mobile phones and the internet are already in the main stream of communication. In the near future the development of the Machine 2 Machine (M2M) communication and therefore the economical exploitation of sensors will play a very important role in the ICT industry. With this in mind, the focus is on the possibility and opportunity for contact. This is an aspect of social connectedness that can very well be combined with the ambient telephone system. Phase 2: Context mapping - starting on page 25 11 people were asked to participate in a context mapping study. In this study participants were asked to draw their houses in order to simulate in home communication behavior. This confirmed that; communication consist of the factors share effort and control. People are very sensitive to these factors, finding the right balance between these factors is the main hurdle that any communication media has to master. Phase 3: Ideation - starting on page 33 The insights found suggest that using people’s mobile phone as a user interface seems the logical answer to the initial questions. It enables user’s remote control of the system, different types of connections are possible, people can always go back to a more private handheld conversation and it matches the current communication behavior perfectly. The mobile phone and M2M communication is going to play an even more important role over the coming years. Using the collective signals available due to the increase in sensorial implementations and mobile internet people’s social context can be assessed. This can be used to better understand the possibilities and opportunities to contact people. These ideas are conceptualized in the form of a request function and an intimate light connection. The request function assists people in making contact with other people by monitoring location, movement and the surroundings of people. The intimate light connection uses this information in order to create light representations in the other person’s living room. Phase 4: Validation - starting on page 43 The ideas developed in the previous page needed to be validated with users. Therefore a prototype was build for the ambient telephony idea, and a video and story boards were made to represent the social features. A study was conducted in the Experience Lab with 12 participants. These were observed while using the product and asked to reflect on the ideas presented. The outcome concerning the ambient telephony confirms the ideas on using people’s mobile phone as an UI. It also suggests that a clear origin of sound results in a participants focusing on the device. This disturbs the feeling of freedom to move and talk naturally as people talk towards the device. People tend to talk louder than normally. Regarding the social features, users stated that they needed to experience the system in order to give more complete feedback. The request function was considered a context aware reminder. This is appreciated but not related to the product anymore. The Light representations are seen as both an indication of availability and as an intimate light connection.(50:50) Not all the representations are appreciated. The system should give an indication of the others situation but not expose details, as not to violate people’s privacy. The surroundings are considered reasonable anonymous, it is a way of telling something about something but not using someone’s information. Phase 5: Product behavior - starting on page 59 In consultation with the ambiPhone team it was decided that the system would be a singular device and not a configuration with satellites. This is contradictory to the user feedback but a consumer insight from business perspective states that people do not want wires running through their house, which is consistent with the ambient lifestyle philosophy. The system uses the mobile phone signals surrounding the person you want to connect to in order to assess that personas surrounding. This is used to create color representations in the form of light within people’s living room. These colors are based on the light spectrum running from IR-UV or hot- cold. The basic color emotion association contrast is non culture dependant and creates a framework from which the user can easily understand the meaning of the representations of the product. Phase 6: Validation 2 - starting on page 71 Another prototype was build for the light features in order to conduct experiments with 6 people in their houses. The prototype was experienced in combination with a movie and storyboard in order to bring the context of the product to life. The feature was seen as applicable in two very different ways; an emotional and a practical implementation. This matches the possibility and opportunity for contact aspects of social connectedness. Concerning the practical, people think that it can help them to more smoothly create a connection with their relations. It can be used to create a more aware way of managing communication as it creates awareness of what is already known about the other person. However there is doubt about the accuracy of the representation. For the emotional implementation is more difficult to understand what the effect is of the emotional implementation. In order to fully reflect on this a fully functioning prototype should be tested over a longer period of time. The feature is appreciated by some users because it reminds you of the other and lowers the distance there is between people. However the continuous incoming data stream is also considered very obtrusive and stressful by a part of the participants, as it raises more questions. Phase 7: Product development - starting on page 81 The behavior as described and tested earlier is the outline of the product. This outline determines most of the components but the main component is still unclear, the housing. The appearance of the product should fit several form considerations namely; fitting the Philips Lifestyle product portfolio, ambient technology principles, acoustic properties, light dynamics and the user feedback received during the second user study. This insight was used to create several clay models. One of these models was selected to be further detailed into a product design. Phase 8: Epilogue – starting on page 97 Although more testing and development is needed, both the ambiPhone and the Social Colors show potential to be implemented into the market. For the ambiPhone user feedback is needed on the experience of different sound configurations for ambient phone conversations while doing mindless chores. For the Social Colors a completely working model will have to be tested over a longer period of time. Only this way can the effects of this type of product on people’s state of mind really be researched.","Ambient telephony; social connectedness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction / Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Van Mourik, F. (mentor)","2010","This report presents a reinterpreted Human Machine Interface (HMI)design aimed at the DAVIE diagnostic tool and facilitating an efficient workflow for DAF and Paccar mechanics. It describes the process thereof as part of a graduation project for Master degree in Industrial Design Engineering at the faculty of Industrial Design at the University of Technology in Delft. The DAF Vehicle Investigation Equipment (DAVIE) diagnostics tool, specially developed for DAF Trucks, is used by mechanics in the workshops of its dealers or for road side assistance to diagnose malfunctions, change vehicle systems setup and perform repair and maintenance. Due to new legislation and as the truck’s configurations become more complex DAVIE needs to adapt accordingly. The current DAVIE is focused on the truck’s internal components and rather disregarding the user’s workflow. This perspective needed to be altered to a more User Centred Design approach and so the interaction needs to be reinterpreted to facilitate an efficient workflow. The new tool and design will be developed and implemented within DAF and Paccar and will find its way to all its dealers. Within the design process, the navigation of the HMI design is defined according to use cases from the field and the user research by carefully dissecting, merging and rearranging DAVIE functions with the mechanic’s workflow in mind. A quite complex tool became ‘simple’ in structure. The design is consistent throughout all functions to reduce acclimatization for the mechanic. The entire GUI is designed for use with touch screen and therefore has widely spaced, large enough buttons. A system is developed to provide feedback about where the user is in the navigation, what steps were taken, and provides accessibility to return to these steps. The user can go ‘Home’ in one touch. The way items in the content are presented to the mechanic forms an important part as such system appears in every DAVIE function. The hierarchical categorization is made transparent to the mechanic and consistent throughout all functions in order to facilitate understanding about interrelations. This aspect manifested in two ways: a categorised list in which loose items and their hierarchical relation can be identified and a schematic of the vehicle’s ECU’s (Electronic Control Units) representing the vehicle’s ECU structure. An easy accessible system to acquire background or detailed information is developed to supplement the mechanics knowledge. To provide transparency towards DAVIE’s connection to the network and truck, a status display is developed representing the actual parts, configuration and connection status. Pop-ups were developed to present procedures which the mechanic can perform on the vehicle. These along with the rest of the tool’s content are written by the DAF authoring environment and so providing content (knowledge) to the tool for the mechanics. Dialog boxes (pop-ups) present warnings, questions or progress of processes to the user. The mechanic always knows where he is through half opacity when presented with such a pop-up or dialog box. To validate the design in advance of developing and launching it in the field a usability study is conducted in the Netherlands and North America with mechanics. This research aimed to validate the usability of the developed workflow and navigation concept, terminology (readability, icons) and the various HMI design aspects. Cases from the field were used and a prototype is developed with the content to support these cases. Generally several mechanics remarked the new tool to be user friendly. During the tests the participant succeeded in solving the various cases; sometimes not at first try, but at second or third. Therefore the HMI design can be argued to be quite successful as the tool is entirely new and unfamiliar for the participants. They had never seen the interface and some functions were new for them. Results, conclusions and recommendations from the research were subsequently implemented in a HMI redesign.","Human Machine Interaction (HMI); Graphical User Interface (GUI); Usability Test; Diagnosis; Mechanic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-07-01","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

However, road disaster can be caused by different natural conditions of slope failures such as rainfall, steep topography, brittle geology, etc. Road disaster occurrences do not only cause the primary disaster from the infrastructure point of view; but also the secondary disaster, hindrance to the society and the economic activity by traffic stops. In order to prevent or mitigate such road disasters caused by diverse reasons; measures should be taken in every phases of road engineering practices, usually mainly thorough investigation about the surface geology, the subsurface conditions of the foundation and the careful testing of the construction materials principally. Hence detailed investigation about the site is compulsory before commencing the design and construction phases. In addition, post construction phases mainly regular monitoring and maintenance must be undertaken to give the intended service of the highway. Limit equilibrium method is one of the most widely used stability analysis in practice due to its reliability for most practical cases. Its simplified approach can be used in the preliminary assessment only while more complex analysis that gives more accurate results can be carried out with computer programs. This research presents results of stability analysis of A-8 motorway Wroclaw bypass on selected embankments under construction founded on heterogeneous soft soil layers. Different methods of limit equilibrium analysis adopted in computer analysis program SLIDE 2D was used to calculate the Factor of Safety of each embankment. The discussion was based on the results of the computation carried out for cross-sections of A-8 motorway characterized by variability of height and reinforcement conditions. The limit equilibrium method which satisfies both force and moment equilibrium give better prediction on the stability of the slope. In addition to that the method whose assumption mimics the slope condition is preferred. The assessment was executed by referring to the slope stability requirement by Polish regulations.","stability; embankment; Wroclaw; motorway","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Applied Earth Sciences","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Om de juiste keuze te kunnen maken, moet er onderzoek gedaan worden naar de verschillende mogelijke implementaties. Dit onderzoek is gedaan op basis van een literatuurstudie. Op basis van dit onderzoek is er een afweging gemaakt aan de hand van criteria. Hieruit is gekomen dat de beste implementatie een embedded systeem is waarop embedded Linux draait. Op dit besturingsysteem worden Apache, MySQL en PHP geïnstalleerd om te zorgen voor de benadering op afstand. Vervolgens dient een in C# geschreven programma voor de communicatie met de hardware, dit programma communiceert ook met PHP. In de toekomst kan dit onderzoek gebruikt worden om een afweging te maken voor een andere grafische gebruikersinterfaces. Eisen De interface dient voor het volgende:  schakelen van eindpunten en groepen  instellen van tijdschema’s die, eventueel op basis van sensor informatie, eindpunten of groepen in of uitschakelen  het engergieverbruik per eindpunt of groep weer geven  meerdere eindpunten in een groep plaatsen Implementaties Bij het onderzoek is er gekeken naar een hardwarematige oplossing, hieruit bleek dat hardware onvoldoende scoort op de mogelijkheid om te updaten, ook is een hardware oplossing niet goed online te benaderen. Een hardwarematige oplossing scoort wel erg goed op veiligheid. Ook is gekeken naar een oplossing met C#, deze scoort onvoldoende op de mogelijkheid om het via het internet te benaderen, wel wordt er goed gescoord op de ondersteuning. Daarnaast is er gekeken naar Java. Java scoort onvoldoende op de mogelijkheid om het te embedden, wel scoort Java net als C# erg goed op de ondersteuning. Als laatste is er gekeken naar webbased oplossingen en dan expliciet naar .NET, Java Web Start en PHP. Deze scoorden allemaal erg goed op de mogelijkheid tot updaten. Echter scoorden ze slecht op de mogelijkheid om het te embedden. Combineren van implementaties Uiteindelijk is er gekeken naar de mogelijkheid om meerdere implementaties te combineren. Zodat de zwakke punten van de ene implementatie worden opgevangen door de andere. Er is gekozen om C#, die het beste scoorde, te combineren met een webbased taal. Omdat het relatief moeilijk was op .NET op een andere besturingssysteem dan windows te draaien is er gekozen voor PHP. Ook is er gekozen om het totale systeem op embedded Linux te draaien omdat dit betrouwbaar is en niet meer kost als de alternatieven. Nadat deze implementatie gekozen was, is deze implemenatie ook daadwerkelijk gebruikt om een interface te ontwerpen voor het iNow systeem. Er zijn een aantal functies geschreven die de communicatie tussen de webinterface en de in C# geschreven controller verzorgen.

Although little is currently known about acoustic surveillance, Thales Nederland is interested in the potential offered by an ASN in urban environments and specifically for classification. This is because the operational problem is not merely to detect targets, but also to localize and classify them in a robust way. Current radar implementations do not provide enough performance to classify targets in complex urban environments while now acoustic sensors are seen as an extra source of information. Therefore, a challenging project was initiated to investigate the potential and feasibility of a passive ASN to localize and classify targets. Three different kind of targets were investigated for acoustic surveillance: guns (muzzle blast), vehicles (running piston engine) and humans (walking pedestrian). Can a passive ASN be deployed in urban environments to localize and classify them only by their emitted sound? It is a great challenge to cope with the received signals using a passive ASN in urban environment, because signals can - even within the same classes - differ significantly. This leads to a technical challenge when it comes to achieving robust localization and correct classification. Two project objectives were defined. Firstly, extract target information and use propagation models to localize the targets. Secondly, extract features which allow a classification method to discriminate between the different target classes. Experimental data processing had to be designed, implemented and evaluated with measured data for a performance indication. To find target features and to investigate localization possibilities, extensive acoustic analysis is done on the three targets. The emitted energy of the gun was the dominant feature of the muzzle blast. The dominant features of the running piston engine were the harmonics. The walking pedestrian had characteristic time interval features between the footsteps. An experimental framework was designed with a signal processor, localizer and classifier. The signal processor has to process the recorded signal in such a way that the localizer and classifier can use the result. The localizer is designed which can localize targets time-based and power-based. The feature extraction of the classifier provided discriminative features which allowed a classification method to discriminate between the classes. The designed components are combined and experimentally implemented (proof of concept) with four microphones and tested for a system performance indication. The time-based localization performed well, but the power-based localization requires extensive calibration to perform proper. The dominant target features were extracted and allowed an experimental classification tree to discriminate between the classes. Passive acoustic surveillance is possible, but the system performance depends very much on the operational situation (e.g. background noise). The performance mainly depends on the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and the SNR depends on the target class. The potential for localizing and classifying walking pedestrians is very low. Vehicle power-based localization and detection has potential, but good microphone hardware is required. Gun localization and classification has the highest potential and feasibility. Although there are some difficulties, throughout this project it became clear that acoustic sensors are able to provide extra information and features. This can be used to further increase the robustness and integrity of urban surveillance systems.","Acoustic; Sensor Network; Localization; Classification; urban; surveillance; data processing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","MTS-Radar","","","",""

(mentor); Mhamdi, L. (mentor)","2010","High-performance routers have the task of transmitting traffic in between the nodes of the Internet, the network of networks that carries the vast amount of information among billions of users. The switch fabric is the key building block of every router, and various switch fabric architectures are used in the market products. The crossbar-based switch fabric architectures (both buffered and unbuffered) offer very high performances and are widely used for high-performance routers. However their cost grows quadratically with the input/output port count, since they require internal crosspoints (and buffers) for every input/output port pair. Recently, a functional-level design of two novel Network-on-Chip based switch fabric architectures was proposed, Unidirectional NoC (UDN) and Multidirectional NoC (MDN), as a replacement of the buffered crossbar switch fabric architecture. In this thesis, we propose the hardware design and implementation of the aforementioned architectures for the FPGA platform. We further improve the routing and scheduling algorithms of these architectures for feasible hardware design. The synthesis and simulations are carried out over a wide range of switch sizes and traffic scenarios. The simulation results are also validated on the FPGA platform, by generating pseudo-random destination addresses for the packets on LFSR based test modules. The results show that UDN outperforms MDN in terms of throughput, whereas MDN offers greater performance-cost ratio. Both architectures offer scalability, flexibility and high performance, confirming the ideas in the original proposal.","Crossbar Switch NoC UDN MDN Network-on-Chip","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); De Ruiter, H. (mentor)","2010","The mechanical behavior of rock salt has been studied for many decades. Early engineering studies were driven largely by the need to design safe salt mines. In recent times more of the study is concerned to understand the long term behavior of the rock salt to develop and assess the safety of rock salt deposits for the storage of radio active waste. The physical and mechanical characteristics of salt are evidenced in its compact texture, low porosity, low permeability and strong rheological properties (creep behavior). These properties are however necessary for stability analysis and the design of engineering structures in salt mines. Long term effect of the temperature on rock salt mechanical behavior has been documented by various researchers. Temperature also has pronounced effect on short term behavior like instant strength of the rock salt. Generally the trend is that as the temperature increases the instant strength decreases. For the stability of structures like solution-mined caverns, dry salt mines, storage and disposal caverns and boreholes used in the exploration and production of oil and gas comprehensive study of the instant strength of the rock salt is also vital. The objective of this research was to study the temperature effect on the instant strength of the rock salt obtained from Polkowice - Sieroszowice mine in the Lower Selicia. After laboratory tests using uniaxial compressive strength test method, it was observed that the at the given range of temperature applied in the test (10 degree C to 80 degree C) the rock salt instant strength does not show any correlation with the temperature. In other words the instant strength of the rock does not decrease as temperature increase. This kind of unanticipated behavior towards the temperature in terms of strength which is rare for the rock salt could be due to the reason that the range of temperature used in the test was not sufficient for the rock salt to show any alteration in its strength value. Since there was no significant effect of given temperature range on the strength values of the rock salt, classical failure criterion like Mohr-Coulomb criterion was considered as the suitable criterion to justify the strength changes on the rock salt samples. On the other hand density emerges out as a crucial factor that influences the instant strength of the rock salt. Higher uniaxial compressive strength values can be observed for the samples having higher density. This research work is useful to understand the mechanical behavior of the rock salt which behaves in a complex manner when there are lots of factors involved like geology, temperature, density, loading history, maturity of the crystals etc. are involved. It is therefore deemed necessary that more through studying and testing is required.","rock salt; instant strength","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Applied Earth Sciences","","Geo-engineering","",""

(mentor)","2010","Angiogenese is de vorming van nieuwe bloedvaten uit bestaande bloedvaten. Als er een tumor is ontstaan, kan alleen de rand van de tumor gevoed worden met zuurstof uit omringend weefsel. De kern van de tumor wordt niet gevoed en daarom scheidt de tumor een stof uit waarna angiogenese plaatsvindt. Hierdoor komen de haarvaten bij de tumor en kan deze geheel voorzien worden van zuurstof en andere voedingsstoffen. Het proces van de angiogenese kan in een model beschreven worden. Hierbij moet er gekeken worden naar vergelijkingen voor de concentratie van het hormoon, de dichtheid van de haarvaten en de dichtheid voor de haarvaten topjes. Een model hiervoor is opgesteld door Byrne en Chaplain. Het blijkt dat hun model niet compleet is, de nodige problemen met zich meebrengt, en dus moet het een en ander veranderd worden. Zo zal er onder andere gekeken moeten worden naar de diffusieterm, foutieve randvoorwaarden en de ontbrekende vergelijking voor de concentratie zuurstof.","angiogenese","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","Numerical Analysis","",""

First, a set of specifications is defined that describe the required functionality. These are derived from earlier work on related systems and confirmed through discussions within the project team. Secondly, a design strategy is developed that allows a structured and logical way of transforming the specifications to a working circuit. It is shown that power efficiency and distortion performance can be optimized separately and independently. Several novel solutions are found to optimize efficiency and reduce distortion. The entire schematic is simulated and found to agree with calculations. Variations in supply voltage and temperature are taken into account, along with manufacturing spread in all components. Finally, a complete IC layout is produced that is ready for manufacturing.","class D; class E; power amplifier; Analog IC; IC design; design for manufacturability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Electronics","",""

(mentor)","2010","Why is it hard to build high-speed routers? Because high-speed routers are like marriages; they are unpredictable, provide no guar- antees, and become vulnerable in adversity. High-speed networks including the Internet backbone suffer from a well-known problem; packets arrive on high-speed routers much faster than commodity memory can support. On a 10 Gb/s link, packets can arrive ev- ery 32 ns, while memory can only be accessed once every 50 ns. If we are unable to bridge this performance gap, then (1) We can- not create Internet routers that reliably support links >10 Gb/s. (2) Routers cannot support the needs of real-time applications such as voice, video conferencing, multimedia, gaming, etc., that require guaranteed performance. Network operators expect certain perfor- mance characteristics; for example, if the arrival rate is less than the router’s advertised capacity, they can reasonably assume the router can handle the traffic. Somewhat surprisingly, no commercial router can do this today! The emphasis is put on the switching architecture of a router. This thesis lays down a theoretical foundation for the Partially Buffered Crossbar switches and is about managing and resolving the prefer- ences and contention for memory between packets from participating inputs and outputs in a switch. By combining the theory of fluid models, Lyapunov functions and the pigeonhole principle, the requirements for devising practical algorithms which can provide guarantees and emulate the performance of the ideal Output Queued switch and approximate the optimal Maximum Weight Matching scheduler are drawn up. The solutions described in this thesis, relax the memory access and band- width constraint, in fact, there is no better switching architecture described till now in terms of memory requirements and practicality regarding its achieved performance. Moreover, this thesis derives the first study of scheduling unicast and multicast traffic simultaneously in a Partially Buffered Crossbar switch.","switch; router; scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""
