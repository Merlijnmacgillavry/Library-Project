The largest percentage of total mission energy saved using the variable pitch propeller with respect to the constant pitch propeller is about 4.1% for a cruise distance of 5 km when using two blades and about 3.0% for three blades. This percentage reduces to approximately 0.7%, both for two and three blades, when the cruise distance is 200 km. A two-bladed propeller therefore turns out to be the best option. Regarding the effect of the propeller airfoil camber and thickness with respect to the NACA 4415 airfoil, the NACA 0015 airfoil performs best on a short range mission and the NACA 2415 performs best on a long range mission.","Energy Harvesting; Electric aircraft; variable pitch propeller; constant pitch propeller; aerodynamic optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

This kind of monitoring is done to examine various physical and chemical parameters, while considering any post-surgery complications. Therefore, the patient’s care is continued even after the surgical treatment and any sudden complications can be prevented from this intensive monitoring. For this purpose, electronic implantable sensors are preferred to monitor the various required physiological factors such as blood pressure, body temperature, heart rate, etc. This kind of in-vivo measurements can be done by directly implanting the sensors at the afflicted site inside the patient’s body. Therefore, the implantable biosensors are commonly used to monitor and measure various parameters such as pressure, stress and strain, pH, and many others in a less invasive way.<br/>As the implantable biosensors are directly placed on the tissue or organ for monitoring, the efficiency of sensing and mapping the required information can be achieved by maximal surface contact. This can be fulfilled with the help of the wide range of available flexible and stretchable materials such as polyimide, PDMS, and many more. Instead of the conventional IC fabrication process, printing technology is a better alternative to fabricate these flexible and stretchable biosensors at low cost with a great amount of substrate choices. Among the available semiconducting inks, liquid silicon proved to be a better choice in making devices with good performance. The term ‘liquid silicon’ refers to silicon-based polymers such as Polysilanes. Thus, the combination of liquid silicon based implantable biosensors on flexible and stretchable substrates has lot of potential to be explored.<br/>In this thesis, the focus is to print a conductive polysilicon layer on a flexible and stretchable substrate. Initially, the substrate materials- Polyimide and PDMS are chosen as per the requirements of flexibility, stretchability, biocompatibility and mechanical stability. After the preparing the substrate, the liquid silicon is coated on top of the substrate and the wettability is adjusted during the coating with the help of UV light. This polysilane layer is crystallised using KrF excimer laser to form a polysilicon layer. Thus, the polysilicon layer of thickness of about 200 nm is formed on top of a flexible and stretchable substrate.<br/>This work forms the basis for future work in which the polysilicon resistors can be fabricated to be used as piezoresistive strain sensors. It can be further explored to include other functionalities such as real-time monitoring and self-sufficient in terms of power, etc. The choice of materials can be further expanded to include bio-resorbable materials such as silk, gelatin, and many more.","Liquid Silicon; Stretchable Substrate; Poly-Silicon Resistors; Strain Sensor Applications","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-11-30","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

However, these devices have to be able to survive harsh body conditions to ensure their reliability and functionality. Bodily fluids initiate chemical degradation and corrosion in the devices especially in the metal interconnects. Therefore, the devices are encapsulated by various forms of hermetic and non-hermetic packaging. The current standard hermetic packaging is not suitable for miniature microelectronics. As a result, conformal encapsulation is currently being developed. Multiple inorganic and organic layers of materials or a combination of different layers are used to achieve corrosion protection. Polyimide (PI) is a type of polymer that is used as encapsulation material in bioelectronic devices. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using thin inorganic layers such as SiC and SiO₂ between the polyimide layers in order to improve the PI to PI adhesion. In this thesis, first, the corrosion phenomenon in bioelectronics and the available packaging methods are explained. Next, test structures that contain polyimide encapsulation with and without the SiC and SiO₂ ceramic layers are microfabricated. In order to provide accelerated aging conditions to the samples, a lifetime measurement set-up is modeled and built. Finally, the test structures are tested in the lifetime set-up to evaluate their reliability performances in accelerated aging conditions. The leakage currents of the test structures are measured as a function of the soaking time. Samples with SiC and SiO₂ thin layers exhibit a high leakage current value and fail relatively fast. In addition, samples are analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements and the samples without the ceramic layers demonstrate a capacitive behavior in lower frequencies.","Encapsulation; Polyimide; Corrosion; SiC thin layer; SiO2 thin layer; ALTA; Reliability; Lifetime; EIS; Leakage Current","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-30","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Werker, C. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","As of today, many people are aware of the negative impacts of eating farmed meat. The current farming system is a burden on the environment and animal welfare, as well as an potential threat to human health. Moreover, to secure food for our growing society, a change in the current food system is inevitable. Since people are still hesitant to cut meat out of their diets, this asks for a more sustainable production of meat. We can think of improving our current farming system. However, new technologies can offer more efficient and sustainable alternatives to the (improved) existing farming system. One of these alternatives is cultured meat (CM). The advantage of CM compared to other (plant-based) meat substitutes, is that it is exactly the same product as farmed meat. Many academic research has already been performed and published on CM over the past few years. These papers mainly describe either the technical aspects, consumer acceptance, ethics, and/or environmental impact. The focus has rarely been on describing the entire socio-technical context of CM, and the formation and subsequent functioning of a future CM industry. This, while deep changes of the socio-technical system are required to succeed in developing CM. Therefore, this research aims at mapping out the Dutch socio-technical system of cultured meat, in order to evaluate the development of the socio-technical system and investigate its potential to grow. Eventually aiming at answering: ‘How has the Dutch socio-technical system of cultured meat been developing and under which circumstances will it grow?’. In finding an answer to this question, a framework combining the functions of innovation system (FIS) approach and the multi-level perspective (MLP), is adopted. To complement for the lack of focus on actor values and strategies of an integrated FIS-MLP framework, analysis of actor strategies and actor values are separately integrated in this model. Information has been retrieved from a combination of desk research and expert interviews. In the first part of the research, the Dutch cultured meat innovation system has been analysed in terms of its structural and functional components. The Dutch CM scene is still in its infancy. The technology is still strongly evolving – mostly at the two Dutch CM start-ups Mosa Meat &amp; Meatable – , the networks are still small, little amount of suppliers are in sphere, and no product is on the market yet. Looking into the functioning of the system, no central guidance is present in the Dutch CM system, while this is important to align the visions of key stakeholders. Moreover, lobby activities are limited, while these can be crucial in increasing the legitimacy of the technology. In the second research part, the external context of the innovation system has been explored. First, the recent developments on landscape and regime levels have been determined, followed by the identification of actor strategies and actor values. Partly following from the lack of central guidance, we can observe diverging actor values and expectations. While all actors value sustainability and environmental benefits, their view on how to achieve this differs. Ranging from improving current farming system to meat alternatives and CM. The CM sector is no longer government funded, but fully dependent on private investors. This caused the research to shift from universities to the two start-ups, who keep their research highly confidential. This also causes the CM research and values within this research of actors to diverge. By collecting and coupling the outcomes of the first two research parts, the elements blocking or facilitating the development of the Dutch cultured meat innovation system have been identified. Based on these analysed system problems, recommendations for strategic actions for specific actor groups with influencing power, have been established. Altogether, the development of the Dutch CM scene and subsequent industry, requires more time and more money to do research. Implementing the suggested recommendations could help in facilitating this.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Ammonia can become an attractive alternative fuel source on-board of ships, since it does not produce SOx and carbon related emissions (including CO2, CO and soot). However, pure ammonia combustion is too slow to drive an internal combustion engine (ICE), a promoter fuel such as hydrogen is needed to speed up the combustion process. Since the SOFC can be used as a power generator and ammonia cracker, an interesting proposal is to have a hybrid ICE-SOFC power generation system on-board ships. A vast amount of papers concerning directly fueled ammonia SOFCs have been published throughout the years. This concept has already been extensively modeled and successfully tested on large-scale. On the other hand, not much is known about hydrogen-ammonia combustion inside an ICE. Although the flammability behaviour and chemical kinetics during combustion have been widely investigated. Publications concerning the in-cylinder combustion characteristics are scarce. Since there are already a number of working ammonia fueled SOFC models in the literature, the thesis will be mostly emphasised on the investigation of hydrogen-ammonia fueled internal combustion engines. Conducted experiments on automotive sized engines have shown that hydrogen-ammonia combustion during SI mode is possible, but not optimal because of the high auto-ignition resistance and low flame propagation speed of ammonia. Hence, poor engine efficiencies, low power densities and large amounts of unburned fuel are more likely to occur during spark ignition. Compression ignition on the other hand is largely affected by great amounts of NOx production inside the flame zone. The NOx is primarily produced from fuel-bound nitrogen, which can unlike the nitrogen (N2) in air easily re-bond with free oxygen during the combustion process. HCCI combustion is a promising candidate to overcome these disadvantages (i.e. low power density and high NOx emissions).","Ammonia; ICE; in-cylinder model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Marine Engineering","",""

The most standard type of refining products, transportation fuels, are undergoing a massive transition from fossil fuel-based to greener means while the emergence of electric vehicles threatens combustion engine vehicles completely. Not only the products of oil refineries but the refining processes and operations are also subject to change for energy efficiency and emission reasons. Meanwhile, the expected expansion of the middle-class in areas like China, India, Indonesia and the Middle East corresponds to an increase in consumption of refining products and petrochemicals, which are seen as the next driver of demand in the future. This paper aligns the technological and environmental challenges and developments that the industry is preparing with Qualitative Content Analysis to generate meaningful criteria to evaluate the integration of oil refineries in decarbonized and digitalized energy systems. Then, the meaningful criteria are analyzed through scenario building in the context of relevant scenarios and forecasts to generate a roadmap for relevancy and integration of oil refineries in future energy systems. This roadmap consists of three steps of recommendations and actions: increased CO2 efficiency of refining operations, relentless progression of emission mitigation and finally, integration of oil refineries into industrial clusters.","oil refining; energy transition; decarbonization; digitalization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Space debris is becoming one of the major risks to be suffered by operating and future space missions. Recent studies show that the number of potentially hazardous uncontrolled orbital bodies is growing with time, increasing the probability of impact with operational satellites. To counteract this problem, several studies are being suggested to remove these dangerous objects from space. Among these, ESA proposed the e.Deorbit mission, whose objective would be the capture, detumbling and deorbit of the large inoperative satellite Envisat. However, the final deorbit phase encompasses a set of challenges and issues that are still to be tackled. The present thesis provides an approach for the guidance, navigation and control system design that solves those challenges and that can safely and robustly remove the spacecraft from orbit. For this purpose, the latest configuration of a rigid stack composed by Envisat and the chaser spacecraft is considered, in which it is deorbited using a series of perigee lowering maneuvers using a single main engine. The work proposes a guidance algorithm that can autonomously deorbit the stack using a pseudo-mean anomaly as control variable and the Linear Tangent Guidance concept for the final targeting. This algorithm is shown to robustly deorbit the stack regardless of its initial position in its orbit or of the initial mass of the target spacecraft within the specified uncertainty. Secondly, the work proposes a MEKF navigation filter based on the navigation sensors which are proposed for the chaser as of the latest configuration. Finally, a control law utilizing the INDI controller principles is suggested as a robust solution to the uncertainty in the inertia of the target spacecraft. It is shown that this controller behaves robustly against mismatches on the dynamic model. The complete integrated solution is then analyzed, exhibiting a promising behavior towards the correct active debris removal, and future investigation is encouraged. The work presented lays the foundations for the GNC design on a challenging yet necessary line of technological development towards the deorbit of large space debris for a more sustainable space environment.","Space Debris; INDI; Envisat; Autonomous; Deorbit; SPOUA; Chaser; Guidance; Navigation; Control; Extended Kalman Filter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Reinbrecht, Cezar (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The Internet of Things (IoT) has grown dramatically over the past years. Largely autonomous, lightweight devices with an internet connection have been integrated into many aspects of daily life; from consumer products to industrial processes and from medical applications to critical infrastructures. Cisco predicts that by 2023, more than half of the internet connections will belong to IoT devices. With the impact of cybercrime ever growing, currently leading to a loss of 600 billion US dollar per year according to McAfee, the Internet of Things has become an attractive target. Successful attacks have already been demonstrated on smart cars, home security cameras, heart defibrillators, the Ukrainian power grid and military drones, just to name a few. Attacks of this nature are expected to intensify as more ’things’ are connected to the internet, either by criminals looking for quick money, companies sabotaging com­ petitors or countries waging cyber warfare. This demonstrates the need for strong security for IoT devices. Attacks on IoT devices can come from three distinct direction: The network, the software or the hardware level. Where network protocols and software applications can be updated when issues are found, this is not the case for hardware, which must be designed to be secure from the start. Further­ more, the way IoT devices are installed in the field makes hardware based attacks particularly relevant. Examples include the probing of traces and pins, fault injections to cause unintended behaviour, mod­ ifications of the firmware, side­channel analysis, stealing of data etcetera. Countering many of these attacks requires integrity verification of the attached memory chips of a device, to make sure that the ap­ plications have not been tampered with. Existing security measures implemented in high performance processors, such as Intel SGX and more recently AMD SEV, can encrypt and secure the memory of a system. These implementations however are not available for the lightweight microcontrollers and processors generally found in IoT devices. ARM TrustZone is a common security solution found in embedded devices to provide protection against untrusted software, but does not defend against hard­ ware tampering. As such, a lightweight solution is required aimed at the constrained environments presented by IoT devices, to ensure the integrity of external memory modules. This thesis presents the Embedded Memory Security (EMS) module as a way to ensure the integrity and authenticity of data and applications, as well as its confidentiality if required. It is targeted at lightweight systems with a small hardware budget. The module sits on­die with the central processor of the device and secures all data being transferred between it and external memory. Integrity is verified through Message Authentication Codes (MAC) generated with SipHash for each memory transfer. The lightweight block cipher Prince is used to provide confidentiality through encryption. Five variants of this module with different levels of security and optimizations are developed and integrated into a processor development platform. Benchmark runs showed that under realistic cache conditions, their impact was limited to a 25% increase in execution time at worst. Three attacks were performed on the platform with the modules, indicating that they protect against several types of hardware attacks on memory. Finally, the hardware cost in area requirements was determined and found to be less than half of the microcontroller­class RI5CY core, excluding its caches, and only 3% of the Linux­capable Ariane core. In addition to the EMS modules, two security extensions are proposed that utilize the modules to provide a secure method of updating devices.","IoT; Internet of Things; Memory; External; Cryptography; Hardware attacks; Embedded Memory Security; Prince; Siphash; MAC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","","","","","",""

Now a days, with technological advancements in anaerobic digestion (AD) process it is possible to recover some of the resources. AD can be coupled with the membrane to provide the complete biomass retention ensuring the growth of slow growing bacteria. Considering these aspects an innovative configuration of Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor (AnMBR) with limited aeration is developed aiming to improve the reactor performance. This AnMBR is tested, comparing its performance before and after aeration to assess the impact of subjected aeration especially on the activity of methanogens monitoring the biogas production and its composition. Results show that limited aeration helped in achieving significantly lower overall COD removal without adversely affecting the biogas production as well as composition. It also improved the biodegradability of less biodegradable ovalbumin (protein).Furthermore, limited aeration might improve the biotransformation of some of the recalcitrant micropollutants (MPs) possibly by activating mono-oxygenase enzymes of micro-organisms. They might convert the aromatic hydrocarbons into less recalcitrant phenolic intermediates, whose degradation process could occur anaerobically. From the group of available MPs, diclofenac (DCF), metoprolol (MPT), sulphamethoxazole (SMX), trimethorprim (TMP) are selected based on different characteristics. All the selected MPs are analysed for their removal through biodegradation and adsorption under anaerobic conditions. MPs are tested from liquid phase in dissolved form through liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) technique while MPs sorbed onto the sludge surface are not analysed because of complex extraction process.Results shows that SMX and TMP are removed more than 99% through AD while DCF is removed with removal efficiency of more than 90%. Adsorption is found to be a major contributor for the removal of DCF, MPT and TMP while SMX is mainly removed through biodegradation. DCF and TMP are adsorbed well (&gt;90%) compared to SMX and MPT (around 30%) onto the sludge contributing to overall removal. Octanol water coefficient (Kow) which defines the hydrophobicity of compound, is the key parameter deciding the extent of adsorption. Additionally, sludge retention time (SRT) and compound structure play major role in deciding the fate of MPs through biodegradation. Different aerations had not shown any significant impact on the removal of DCF, SMX and TMP. While in case of metoprolol effect of aeration was not completely understood. Considering the overall removal, DCF was found to be bio-degraded more with increased concentration. Granular activated carbon (GAC) used for adsorption removed all the four MPs with more than 90% efficiency. Further studies can be conducted on possibilities of adding GAC to the reactor so that they get adsorbed and later on degraded.","Micropollutants; AnMBR; Adsorption; Limited Aeation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

These trends are predominant in the corn and soybean crop production of the United States' Midwest region. The increase of production and irrigation in the past 20 years is spatially diverse, with some regions in the Midwest intensifying agriculture at faster rates. Measurement of vegetation through the use of satellite remote sensing methods has gained popularity in recent years, with the refinement of existing retrieval algorithms and the development of new ones. Many different indices can be used to study the vegetation, including optical products such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Leaf Area Index (LAI). However, the use of microwave remote sensing has some advantages over near optical methods as it is unaffected by weather conditions and can therefore collect data more regularly. Microwave remote sensing methods can retrieve the vegetation optical depth (VOD), a parameter which is related to the intensity of microwave signal extinction by vegetation and can be derived through the use of both passive and active microwave observations. In this study, these microwave remote sensing methods are used to look for evidence of agricultural intensification trends in the Midwest. The spatial distribution and intensity of trends is compared with trends in yield data and LAI. Trend analysis of soybean and corn yield in the Midwest show statistically significant increasing trends in the Western states of South Dakota, Nebraska, and parts of North Dakota.

The ability of SHCC in exhibiting a ductile response under tensile load due to strain­-hardening after crack initiation makes it a viable material to be used in, both, construction and retrofitting of concrete structures. The main objective of this research is to study the shear behaviour of SHCC-strengthened RC beams using NLFEA. The shear behaviour of benchmark RC beams is analysed first. The analysis of the selected RC beams analysed using Damage-based shear retention function results in accurate predictions of peak load if a fine mesh size resulting in 30 or more elements in the height of the beam is used. However, the failure type is predicted inaccurately for both coarse and fine mesh sizes due to lack of consideration for aggregate interlock in Damage-based shear retention function. The analysis of the selected RC beams using Al-Mahaidi shear retention function results in accurate predictions of peak load if a coarse mesh size resulting in 20 elements in the height of the beam is used. The failure type is also predicted accurately using Al-Mahaidi shear retention function with the stated mesh size. The consideration for aggregate interlock implicitly in Al-Mahaidi shear retention function in the form of shear retention factor allows for accurate prediction of both peak load and failure type. After analysing the shear behaviour of RC beams, the shear behaviour of a reinforced SHCC beam is analysed using Al-Mahaidi shear retention function since it can predict both failure load and failure type accurately for RC beams. In comparison with experiment, the peak load for the reinforced SHCC beam is underestimated and the failure type is also incorrectly modelled. Use of embedded reinforcement results in excessive cracking along the reinforcement, causing convergence issues at a load lower than the experimental peak load. Such excessive cracking is not observed in RC beams since cracks more localized in concrete as compared to SHCC, which exhibits multi-cracking behaviour. Therefore, the shear behaviour of selected reinforced SHCC beam using Al-Mahaidi shear retention function is not accurately modelled. After the analysis of shear behaviour of concrete and SHCC separately, their behaviour is studied in the form of SHCC-RC hybrid beams. The solution strategy consisting of Al-Mahaidi shear retention function is used, and different types of hybrid interface are modelled. The results show that peak load and failure type are accurately predicted when a numerically perfect bond is modelled at hybrid interface for hybrid beams exhibiting no debonding during experimentation. This is in case of a mesh size resulting in 20 elements in the height of beam used. The peak load and failure type, however, are inaccurately predicted when delamination is modelled at the hybrid interface for hybrid beams failing due to delamination during experimentation, irrespective of the mesh size considered. This is due to the inability of the Coulomb friction interface model in recognising significant delamination at the hybrid interface as a reason for the failure of the hybrid beam.","Finite Element modelling; Shear Behaviour; SHCC; Concrete","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This external code is developed, bundled into packages and shared using package repositories like crates.io or npm. Reusing shared code bundles greatly improves development speed but without proper care and knowledge of included external code it can cause issues as well. Over-reliance on simple trivial packages that can be easily implemented locally can cause severe consequences like not being able to build if the package is no longer available. Furthermore, including large packages when only a small amount of it is being used can cause software projects become bloated with unnecessary code. This thesis proposes several metrics: leanness index, software composition index and utilization index that quantify how software projects reuse their dependencies or how much of the dependencies are utilized by their dependents. All three of the metrics are based on full function callgraph of the applications. Computation of these metrics was implemented for Rust and applied on every package in Rust package repository crates.io. General findings showed that dependency leanness was rather low: 21.7% of all packages in crates.io used less than 5% of their included dependencies while 95% of all crates used less than 62.4%. Another discovery revealed that packages in crates.io tend to consist mostly of code from external dependencies as opposed to local code: on average 91% of lines of code come from external dependencies. Lastly, using utilization index functions that were never used by any other crate in crates.io were identified: in 95% of packages, 71% of their callgraphs are never used.","Rust; Crates.io; Dependencies; Maintanability; Code reuse; callgraphs","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/Algirdyz/crate-analyzer Github project","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

In the traditional sense, sanitation planning in urban cities focuses on keeping people away from human-waste related pathogens. As cities in India and several developing countries are growing at exponential rates, government agencies are struggling to provide adequate safe sanitation in their cities. In recent years, due to a range of factors such as increasing water stress, recreational needs and biodiversity protection in an urban fabric, urban waterbodies are deemed worthy of conservation. The objective of this research was to systematically understand urban sanitation and how it relates to urban waterbody health. Having understood the system adequately, the aim of the thesis was to answer the research question, can “Citywide Inclusive Sanitation as a planning approach aid in the betterment of urban waterbodies?”. The study adopted a mixed method which comprises of quantitative water quality testing in Kommaghatta lake in Bengaluru city, India and a qualitative analysis at the Bengaluru city level. It included elements of qualitative social research methods such as field observations, informal conversations and semi-structured interviews to answer the research questions. Water quality results and qualitative analysis suggests that there are three significant pollution pathways into Bengaluru lakes, each carrying different wastewater characteristics and pollution load. The predominant pathway for the pollution of waterbodies in the city is through the stormwater drainage. Additionally, sewer pipes and desludging trucks which dispose faecal waste from on-site sanitation systems also contribute to pollutant load entering into the lakes in the city. From the semi-structured interviews, a conceptual model of urban sanitation in Bengaluru city and how it relates to waterbodies was developed. From conducting a qualitative analysis, six major system levers were identified. They levers influence the dynamics of urban sanitation in Bengaluru and forms the basis for the pollution pathways that enter into the lake. They six major system levers for Bengaluru urban sanitation are: <br/>1.Rapid urbanization <br/>2.Fragmentation of government entities <br/>3.Sewer infrastructure <br/>4.Feacal sludge management <br/>5.Treated water reuse <br/>6.Citizen group involvement The study shows that CWIS principles have a significant relevance for solving urban sanitation issues which were identified through the system levers. In addition to solving urban sanitation issues which centres on public health matters, the study also shows that there is also an environmental case for CWIS by arresting waterbody pollution through the identified pollution pathways. Findings from this research can help to improve decision making in terms of urban sanitation by paying close attention to the cause-effect relationships between variables in the urban sanitation sphere and improve waterbody health in their cities.","Urban Sanitation; Urban Waterbodies; Water health and sanitation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Pavlovic, M. (graduation committee); Wadadar, D. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","This era of science and technology has seen widespread use of composite materials for a variety of applications ranging from the defense sector to the transport and construction sectors. Composites are mainly comprised of fibres impregnated with a polymeric matrix and have a superior strength to weight ratio as compared to traditional construction materials like concrete and steel. The strength of the fibres is much larger than that of the matrix. Also, the fibres exhibits elastic brittle behaviour while the matrix shows a nonlinear plastic behavior before damage occurs. Thus the overall response of the material is subjective to which direction it is loaded. In reality a multitude of stresses act simultaneously on any structure and it is quite challenging to develop a constitutive formulation for the composite material that can predict the stresses in these mixed modes accurately. This thesis aims at providing an improved constitutive formulation for the prediction of the material behavior of unidirectional composites. The constitutive formulation builds up on the existing knowledge of an isotropic invariant based yield function. The motive is to improve the performance of this constitutive law for better predicting the behavior under combined stress states, particularly in the presence of fibre stresses. Even thought the fibres behave completely elastic, the matrix surrounding the fibres is much weaker and tends to deform inelastically. The moment at which the yield stresses are developed in the matrix is also dependant on the level of stress in the fibres. To capture this behavious, two different yield criterion are formulated and testing in this project. First an additive split of the stress tensor helps to separate the fibre and matrix stress components along the fibre(`1') direction. The fibre stress is always elastic whilst the matrix stress component can behave inelastic. This matrix stress component is taken into account in the new constitutive laws. The first constitutive law is a modified version of the transversely isotropic invariant formulations as proposed by Vogler et al. and the second constitutive law is an anisotropic yield function proposed by Tsai Wu. The invarants are reformulated with the matrix stress tensor while keeping the same functional form as that of the transversely isotropic invariant formulation . Again, the split in stress tensor is performed and used in association with the anisotropic yield function. The derivations of all the constitutive relations is presented extensively in the third chapter. Followed by the formulations is the calibration of both the constitutive laws using the hardening curves derived from the micromodel simulations. The micromodel serves as the equivalent experimental test setup for the mesomodels presented in this project. Calibration of the mesomodels is a complex task in itself and the various trials were performed to determine the yield stress parameters that calibrate the models. Having calibrated the models, both the mesomodels are subjected to basic load cases and combined load cases. The MTIF model gives more consistent results than the TW model, however TW model performs better in the combined stress state of longitudinal axial tension and longitudinal in-plane shear. Finally, the effect of the fibre stresses on the plastic behavior of the matrix is being captured but to different extents in both the models. Neither of the models is able to match the micromodel results for all simulations. The sensitivity of the yield stress parameters is brought to light and are the main cause for the overestimating behavior of the TW model. Lastly, all the observations were concluded followed by some recommendations for the future work.","Composites; Constitutive Model; Plasticity; uni-directional; Finite Element modelling; Yield Function","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-30","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","",""

Two control strategies for the propagation of delays are discussed. The first is by letting certain trains run faster when a delay is detected, the second is by breaking connections between trains that have to wait for each other in order to enable passengers to changeover from one train to the other. The goal is to understand how to model the propagation of delays when different control strategies are applied, in order to provide train operators tools for making quick decisions on how to intervene when a delay is detected.<br/>The models provided in the report are in the form of max-plus-linear systems and switching max-plus linear systems. These can be programmed in Python to automate the decision making. The report starts with providing a basic understanding of max-plus algebra, where also max-plus linear systems and switching max-plus linear systems are explained. Subsequently, a railway network is designed that serves as an example during this thesis. This railway network is modelled into a max-plus linear system and, additionally, a desirable train timetable for passengers is designed for this network by means of the power algorithm. The main results are two switching max-plus linear systems that model the propagation of delays when the two control strategies are applied. The report ends with a larger railway network at which all acquired knowledge is applied. It can be concluded that the models in this thesis provide methods to calculate exactly how the delay propagates through the network when certain control strategies are applied and, based on that, decisions can be made quicker. Moreover, it is possible to calculate the consecutive departure times. As a result the passengers can be informed quickly about the new departure times as a consequence of the delay and how long it will take for the trains to run according to timetable again. This thesis adds the modelling of faster running trains to existing literature. We have seen that speeding up trains is also a control strategy to solve delays and can be modelled systematically.","max-plus algebra; Modelling; Railway network; Train; Delay; Control Analysis; System Theory","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

This work on engineering education explores how educational organisations can support engineering student’s leadership development using experiential learning. A constructivist grounded theory methodology was used to explore the topic through 25 interviews with engineering student leaders, professionals, and educators in TU Delft and Engineers Without Borders USA. The experiential methods explored included Project Based Learning, Project Based Service Learning, and Internships. Perceptions of students, educators, and engineering professionals alike confirmed that engineering leadership is a complex notion. While viewed by some as being an individual responsibility, it is viewed by others as being a more abstract group process. Leadership development is part of a dynamic process, one that is rarely explicitly strived for by students or course designers. While students indicated that they believed experiential learning helped support their leadership development, they rarely joined those contexts with that goal in mind. Additionally, the experiential contexts explored weren’t usually designed with leadership development as an explicit outcome. This may be because leadership is a difficult outcome to measure. It is also possible that a focus by universities on technical qualification has led to a trade off in the subjectification and socialisation of students as socially responsible leaders. All of this considered, engineering leadership development will likely continue to remain an elusive to measure goal. However, this research contributes to the larger field by presenting a set of factors of experiential methods that organisations can use to support leadership development. They can do this by structuring experiential learning methods in ways that promote a feeling of psychological safety within student engineering teams.","experiential learning; leadership development; service learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Having always garnered attention due to its non-polluting nature, the costs associated with its production have stood in the way of it being more widely used in society. Since the cost of clean energy to produce hydrogen is one of the main reasons the current price is so high, locations with a high renewable potential are being looked at as a means to drive production prices down, benefiting from higher capacity factors at these locations. With near ideal offshore wind resources, the North Sea is one such location. This thesis aims to explore the potential of this resource to deliver future hydrogen and to a larger extent, EU TFEC demand in 2050. The main research question therefore asks: “What is the future potential of P2H in the North Sea , from a spatially explicit, techno-economic perspective” The analysis first explored the cost of different production configurations, mainly comparing the production of hydrogen onshore (via electricity transmitted over HVDC- high voltage direct current cables), offshore (after transmitting to shore via a pipeline) and in offshore wind turbines (again, after transmission to shore in a network of pipelines). The analysis then used GIS data to analyze the production potential in the North Sea by taking exclusion zones into account. A mapping model was therefore developed to estimate theoretical and practical yield potentials in steps of 5 years, until 2050. Supply curves and maps were then generated to paint a picture of P2H supply pathways in the North Sea. One of the designated research goals in the thesis was to offer a comparative analysis between the three P2H configuration types, mentioned above. The results show a clear preference in favor of the In Turbine configuration which is followed by the offshore configuration and finally the onshore type. The hierarchy was mainly influenced by the conversion chain losses in the three configurations, with the In Turbine configuration having the lowest losses, followed by the offshore and then the onshore types. Model results show a higher sensitivity to sea depth than transmission distance to shore for all three configuration types up till the fixed to floating transition point, after which the sensitivity to depth is reduced. The In Turbine and offshore configurations were however, predictably less sensitive to transmission distance than the onshore configuration since H2 pipeline investment costs for large delivery capacities are almost negligible in comparison to HVDC electricity transportation. Fishing zones, shipping zones, nature conservation zones and current wind farms were considered as exclusionary constraints in the model. This was done to test the influence of maritime spatial planning on both yield and costs in the North Sea. The total restricted and unrestricted yield potentials from the in-turbine configuration with the least losses were 15.8 and 24.18 EJ respectively. This represents 47% and 72% of EU total final energy consumption (TFEC) in 2050. The (Power to Hydrogen) P2H supply pathways were finally compared to a conventional HVDC (Power to Electricity) P2E supply routes for the North Sea and interestingly, a few offshore and all in-turbine P2H locations become cheaper than P2E in the North Sea area between 2040-2050. This begs the question: ‘What is the best/most cost effective supply pathway that leads us to a decarbonized energy system by 2050’. The results in this study indicate that careful consideration needs to be given to the best possible production pathways, particularly, in the North Sea.  ","North Sea; GIS; P2H","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Over the years, IMDs have significantly improved in function, increased in lifetime, and decreased in size. However, further miniaturisation is limited by the batteries used to power these devices, and therefore methods to power them wirelessly are gaining in popularity. The technique most used to wirelessly power IMDs is electromagnetic energy transfer. However, at low frequencies, this method is limited to shallow implants due to its low directivity, while at high frequencies it is limited by attenuation in the human body. Therefore, ultrasound energy may be the future of wirelessly powering implants. Its high directivity and low attenuation in the human body opens up the possibility to wirelessly power deep implants without any harmful side effects. An ultrasound energy transfer set-up was established in this work to demonstrate that Philips’ capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers (CMUTs) can be used as ultrasound energy harvesters. Normally, CMUTs need a bias voltage to function as an energy harvester. However, the CMUTs in this work are chargeable and therefore eliminate the need for this bias voltage. The results show that charged CMUTs can indeed be used as efficient energy harvesters of ultrasound and that information can be sent back to the ultrasound probe using echo modulation. The charged CMUTs showed to be able to harvest sufficient energy to stimulate a nerve and power a Bluetooth module, even when ultrasound sent through 90mm of biological (pork) tissue. The maximum power harvested during the ultrasound energy transfer experiments was 250mW over a transferring distance of 75mm.","Ultrasound Energy Transfer; Ultrasound Power Transfer; CMUT; Ultrasound Transducer; Wireless Energy Transfer; Wireless Power Transfer; Medical Devices; Ultrasound Imaging; Ultrasound Probe; Ultrasound; Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasound Transducers; Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-30","","","","","",""

Porcupines provide hydraulic resistance, generating energy loss and reducing velocities that may further encourage sediment deposition. Porcupine systems have seen increasing implementation, especially for bed or bank protection, but were also recently implemented in a channel-control pilot project on the Ayeyarwady River in Myanmar. Many porcupine systems to date are designed by trial and error due to lack of quantitative design criteria. The 2019 pilot project used large-scale numerical modelling of resistance areas to evaluate the potential impacts of porcupine structures; however, how to best incorporate the impacts of porcupine structures on flow and sediment transport in numerical models has not been systematically evaluated. Improved models or better estimates of uncertainties could facilitate future porcupine system design. Therefore, this study examines methods for incorporating porcupine fields into numerical models and interpreting those models to make informed design choices. Data and observations from the 2019 pilot project implementation, a 2018 porcupine flume experiment, and extensive literature review have been used to examine the expected hydrodynamic and morphodynamic impacts of porcupine systems that need to be accurately captured in large-scale numerical models. A 2DV model using two resistance formulations representing porcupines was elaborated and tested against experimental porcupine performance. The Uittenbogaard (2003) rigid cylinder model was found to replicate well porcupine behavior for less dense systems under limited flow conditions; however further verification is needed for more dense systems, variable flow regimes, wider boundary conditions and mobile beds. The 2DV model was collapsed to 1DH, using two different resistance formulations, to examine the strengths and weaknesses of large-scale models in predicting porcupine performance. The Baptist (2005) resistance model was found to best represent porcupines; however, parameterization was not straightforward from porcupine geometry, indicating that further studies will be needed to confidently translate porcupines into `rigid cylinders' for input into the model. In addition, neither the 2DV nor 1DH models were able to capture the hydrodynamics at the leading and trailing edges of porcupine fields, which were found to be critical for design considerations from the pilot study data. Therefore, these important limitations need to be taken into account when interpreting model results and examining how to improve them in the future.","Porcupines; Ayeyarwady River; Delft3D; Morphology; Hydrodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Unsignalised cyclist T-Intersection gives rise to more safety-critical instances, which include unsafe braking and evasive maneuvers. It is also found that uncontrolled T-intersection can create an issue when priority is assigned to the intersecting (right) arm because drivers on the straight road have a high perception of priority and fail-to-yield. Even though many studies have analysed the positive influence of the lane markings for cars, the influence of it on cyclists have not been explored. The safety criticality in this research is investigated using critical deceleration and jerk as Surrogate Safety Measures, because they are found to perform better at identifying potential conflicts compared to other time proximity measures, such as Time to Collision. Based on the results, the nudge did not show any strong evidence for reducing the speeds or safety criticality at the T-Intersection. So, it cannot be implemented as a traffic calming measure at the T-intersection without further research or modifications. So, this research also suggests key improvements with the lane marking nudge, and some crucial changes have to be implemented to avoid these kinds of unexpected outcomes in future. So, an elaborate discussion is made on what could be the possible changes with the implementation of the nudge for further investigations. Few intervention functions from the MINDSPACE framework and improvements from the behavioural change wheel have to be considered in the future researches with nudges.","Lane Marking Nudge; behaviour; cyclist; mopeds; deceleration ranges; jerk; surrogate safety measures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

In this paper a distinction is made between two types of infragravity waves: bound infragravity waves and free infragravity waves. Bound infragravity waves are generated by short-wave group forcings and are bound to the propagation of the wave groups. Conversely, free waves are infragravity waves that are released from the wave-group in the surfzone, reflect at the shoreline, and propagate back out of the surf zone. In a semi-enclosed basin with mild bathymetric changes such as the North Sea, free long waves that reflect off one coast can propagate large distances and impact other coastlines. <br/><br/>Modelling the response of a coastline during a storm event requires an offshore boundary condition that represents the incident short and long waves. The boundary condition for the incident infragravity waves is often derived by assuming a local equilibrium between the directionally spread sea-swell waves and bound infragravity waves following the K. Hasselmann (1962) method. This approach has proven to be problematic for two main reasons. First, the method tends to overestimate the incident infragravity wave height by assuming a local equilibrium is achieved at the model boundary; however, observations have shown that the transfer of energy from the short-wave groups to the underlying bound wave is gradual on a sloping bed. Second, by applying the equilibrium K. Hasselmann (1962) method it is implied that only bound infragravity waves are present at the boundary underestimating the total incident infragravity wave energy.<br/><br/>An analysis of XBeach in surfbeat mode revealed that the model can confidently predict infragravity wave behaviour on a natural beach slope with two well-developed bars during a storm event by calibrating the roller breaker slope coefficient and wave breaker coefficient. Infragravity wave heights were reasonably accurately predicted in the surfzone, but the model generally overpredicted the most energetic infragravity waves. <br/><br/>Further, the study investigated the impact of free infragravity waves on dune erosion predictions by simulating the behaviour of two 1D planar beach slopes to the inclusion of free long waves at the boundary. The study revealed that on a beach with a 1:35 slope the relative increase in dune erosion volume was 44.1% when the bound infragravity energy is equal to the free infragravity energy relative to the case excluding free waves. For the same conditions, a 20.6% increase was observed in the maximum runup. For a milder 1:70 slope a 36.4% and 6.1% increase in dune erosion and maximum runup was observed. <br/><br/>The results demonstrate that the dune response of a coastline is sensitive to the inclusion of incident free infragravity waves at the boundary. Moreover, neglecting the presence of free infragravity waves at the boundary may underpredict the dune response during a storm event. <br","infragravity waves; long waves; dune erosion; XBeach Surfbeat; Numerical modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its potential advantages include better image quality, higher operational frequency, and ease of fabrication and<br/>integration with CMOS read-out circuitry. However, CMUTs usually need high-voltage DC bias in order to transmit and receive acoustic waves. This work presents the design of a DC-DC converter to bias a CMUT for ultrasound imaging systems. Two different cases have been investigated: biasing at 63 V from an input of 5 V using a fully-integrated converter realized in a 180nm BCD technology that can handle up to 65V; and biasing at 120 V by employing minimal off-chip components. The proposed work explores the transient properties of a conventional on-chip switched capacitor DC-DC converter: the Dickson charge pump. A MATLAB model of the Dickson charge pump is developed to understand the relation between dynamic efficiency and the charge pump capacitor. Prior research works suggest that the dynamic efficiency of the Dickson charge pump is limited for a particular number of stages. However, the results obtained from the MATLAB model suggests that the dynamic efficiency can be improved by making the charge pump capacitor smaller. Various circuit simulations have been done to understand the results obtained from the MATLAB model. When the charge pump capacitor becomes very small, the parasitics start dominating and affect the overall efficiency of the Dickson charge pump. An optimization strategy is discussed to find the optimum number of stages and charge pump capacitor value to maximize the dynamic efficiency and minimize the circuit area. Based on the results obtained from this study, a DC-DC converter is designed to bias the CMUT at 63V, which consumes an estimated circuit area of 0.6586mm2 and has a simulated efficiency of 0.752. <br/>In addition, a new design idea that incorporates two DC-DC converters to bias the CMUT beyond the process voltage limitations is also discussed in this thesis. This hybrid converter involves the optimized DC DC converter designed earlier to generate 63V from an input of 5V, a control unit circuit, and some off-chip<br/>components. The hybrid converter designed consumes an estimated circuit area of 0.842mm2 and has a simulated efficiency of 0.577","DC-DC converters; switched-capacitor; Ultrasound ASIC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Recent research identified a novel scour-enhancing flow mechanism related to 3-D flow behaviour. Under specific conditions, vertical flow separation at the upstream crest of a scour hole can be suppressed as a result of lateral nonuniformities in the main flow. This so-called vertically attached flow state is associated with increased scour potential. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of lateral nonuniformities on scour-driving flow behaviour in setups with realistic width-to-depth ratios. Laboratory experiments form the backbone of this study. A measurement technique was developed that enables efficient and reliable determination of near-bed flow directions. The technique is based on tufts: small threads fixed to the bed that follow the local flow direction. An algorithm was created to convert video footage of tuft movement to numerical data on flow directions. Next, flow behaviour was studied through a set of experiments conducted in a simple laboratory setup that simulates a common scour situation in the field. Lateral nonuniformities were generated in a mixing layer downstream a lateral expansion of the inflow channel. Two distinct horizontal flow states were observed across the tested configurations: horizontal divergence and horizontal contraction. Horizontal contracting flow was more likely to occur in geometries with a short bed protection, a large horizontal expansion and a narrow inflow channel. The transition point between both flow states was narrow. Only a slight change in geometry could entirely turn around the flow state. The horizontally diverging flow state is accompanied with constant vertical flow separation at the slope's crest. The corresponding return current entails a near-bed flow in upward direction. The horizontally contracting flow state is related to an alternating vertical flow pattern in which vertical flow separation and vertical flow attachment take turns. An alternating vertical flow regime was never identified before in this context. The alternating flow state is not present in the jet's centre. Instead, vertical separation takes place here. Additionally, a consistent lateral near-bed flow from the mixing layer to the centre of the jet is present. The frequencies in which vertical attachment and separation alternate match the frequencies of two-dimensional coherent turbulence structures (2DCS) in the mixing layer. This similarity indicates a relation between mixing layer instabilities and suppression of vertical flow separation, which is a valuable new insight into the process of understanding nonuniformity-induced flow attachment. The presence of the horizontally contracting and vertically alternating flow state likely increases scour dimensions. As a scour hole develops, unidirectional lateral near-bed flow velocities stay relatively high, maintaining scour potential. Scour potential is largest in and around the mixing layer. This most likely results in a strongly 3-D scour hole with maximum scour depths in the areas directly affected by the mixing layer. Scour hole development in previous experiments on scour in similar setups confirms this scouring behaviour. The premise that excessive scour is caused by an alternative flow state provides the opportunity to further improve and extend the abilities of empirical scour prediction.","Nonuniform flow; Near-bed flow behaviour; Flow attachment; Scour; Tufts; Laboratory experiments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Hermsen, R.J.G. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The Dutch/New Zealand based aerospace company Dawn aerospace has developed a 0.5N green bi-propellant propulsion system for use in CubeSat applications called the PM200. This thruster uses gaseous nitrous oxide and propylene as propellants. Currently, the burn time of this thruster is limited to 10 seconds after which cool down of the thruster is required. This burn time limit was set quite arbitrarily as no thermal analysis nor any thermal experimentation was performed on the thruster. In this study the thermal limits of the PM200 and similar thrusters was explored. In doing so designs with two particular cooling methods were analysed in detail: designs with Regenerative cooling and designs with Radiation cooling. The overall goal of the project was to assess the thermal performance of the thruster and to see which of the two cooling methods would be most beneficial to implement. In order to perform the thermal analysis a transient numerical model was created based on the finite volume method in combination with ideal rocket theory and several semi-empirical relationships. The model is able to calculate the temperature distribution and heating rate for several different thruster- and cooling system designs. The model results were verified by comparing the results of the model with the results from commercially available software. A good agreement was found with all results matching within 5-8% or less. Because the model relied on several semi-empirical relationships, test firings were performed using the PM200 and a heat-sink/radiation cooled version of the PM200 specifically designed for this study to determine two empirical constants required to calibrate the model. In total, 325 tests were performed. During these tests, temperature measurements were taken on various locations on the thruster. After the model was calibrated, the model was validated by checking the model results for different starting conditions with temperature measurements from test firings with corresponding starting conditions. It was found that the model was able to reproduce the temperature distribution measured in the tests within 15% for all cases (with the exception of one particular 2s burn case).<br/>With the validated model, a number of regenerative cooling channel designs and radiation cooled designs was simulated for a reference thruster similar to the PM200. It was determined that with regenerative cooling the maximum wall temperature could be lowered by up to 23% for the reference thruster. This reduction in temperature was sufficient to lower the maximum wall temperature (to ∼1090 K) below the maximum operating temperature (1150K) of the stainless steel alloy used. A simulation of the PM200 design was also performed and a similar result was found; with regenerative cooling a maximum wall temperature of ∼1020 K is predicted for the PM200. For the radiation cooled designs, the wall temperatures exceeded the allowable temperature of 1150 K for both cases. The reference thruster design reached a maximum temperature of ∼1420 K and the PM200 reached a maximum temperature of ∼1320 K. For radiation cooling to be feasible a different more temperature resistant wall material is thus required. As this would come at an increase in cost, it was concluded that it is more beneficial to use regenerative cooling for the PM200.<br/>While regenerative cooling was found to be effective, it was found that for a given type of cooling channel the design parameters have relatively little effect on the cooling performance due to the small size of the thruster. For all designs (with ribs) the variation in temperature was less than 82 K. The main drivers for determining the feasibility of a cooling method are thus not the cooling channel design parameters, but rather the heat input from the combustion. The heat input is mainly determined by the chamber pressure. As a result, the chamber pressure thus determines whether or not regenerative cooling is feasible. It was found that for the PM200 regenerative cooling is feasible as long as the chamber pressure stays below 7.1 bar.","Regenerative cooling; Radiation cooling; CubeSat propulsion; finite volume method; Propulsion; experimental; Numerical Analysis; rocket engine; Rocket propulsion; Thermal modelling; CubeSat; bi-propellant rocket engine; Thruster; Space; Space Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

One method of additive manufacturing is selective laser melting (SLM), a powder bed fusion technique which utilizes a laser to melt a metal alloy powder layer by layer to form the final geometry. Inconel 718 is a nickel-based superalloy commonly used in high temperature applications due to its superior mechanical and corrosion resistance properties. Owing to a difficult in machining, additive manufacturing has become particularly advantageous method for the production of Inconel 718. The SLM process is associated with a greater degree of process defects as compared to a traditional production method, in particular a poor surface condition, porosity and an anisotropic microstructure. These surface defects pose an issue in response to cyclic loading, as they serve as stress concentrators and can become crack initiation sites. As a result, post-processing treatments are typically required to improve the quality and mechanical properties. This master work focused on two primary aims. First, the characterization of SLM Inconel 718 processed with different layer thicknesses, build directions and post-processing surface treatments and second, the development of a prediction model for fatigue life based on process defects. Smaller layer thickness was found to result in lower surface roughness, which in turn resulting in fatigue performance as compared to larger thicknesses. Differences in surface quality and properties were identified on samples built at an incline. The plane opposite the build direction (the ‘downskin’ side) exhibited higher surface roughness and increased near surface hardness. Mechanical polishing of the surface led to a significant improvement in fatigue performance associated with dramatic reduction in surface roughness and near-surface voiding. Electropolishing as a post-processing treatment did not have a significant impact on surface quality or on fatigue performance. Surface defects were identified as the location of fatigue crack initiation. Removal of these defects by post-processing would therefore provide the greatest improvement in the fatigue performance of SLM Inconel 718. The Murakami-Endo method of fatigue life prediction showed promising results in predicting fatigue life of a sample population based on defects, with good agreement to experimental data.","SLM; Inconel 718; Fatigue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

This foundation type is widely used in the oil&amp;gas industry and wind energy. Experimental investigation and numerical investigation are the main two methods to understand the performance of the suction bucket foundation. The experimental studies are important and basal for design, but it is time-consuming and costly compared to numerical studies. However, the accuracy of the finite element method(FEM) in geotechnical problems highly depends on whether the soil constitutive models can correctly predict soil behaviour. In our study, we investigate four constitutive models: the Mohr-Coulomb model, the hardening soil model, the NGI-ADP model, and the hypoplastic model. To some extent, advanced soil models can better present soil behaviour than traditional ones. However, it needs more laboratory test data to calibrate the advanced model parameters. The Mohr-Coulomb(MC) model is the most common soil model, which is an isotropic model include few parameters. The hardening soil model exceeds MC model by introducing the stress-dependent stiffness and distinguishing between loading and reload- ing. The NGI-ADP model is mainly used for undrained analysis, and it is an anisotropic model which can exact match with undrained shear strength and stiffness for various failure surfaces. The hypoplastic model has no distinguishing between elastic and plastic strain. It is an inelastic(dissipative) and incrementally nonlinear soil model without the requirement of a yield surface. A soil investigation report of Block 17 offshore Angola is used to calibrate the aforementioned constitutive models. The cone penetration test(CPT), ball penetration test(BPT) and a series of laboratory tests(i.e. direct simple shear, triaxial, and oedometric tests) are exacted from the soil report and interpreted for calibration. Parameter determination procedures for constitutive models are explained. Subsequently, the consistency of the parameter set is validated by numerical simulation of direct shear and triaxial tests. The numerical experiments for a suction pile foundation whose out diameter equals four and aspect ratio equals three are carried out. Four loading cases(i.e. horizontal, vertical tension, vertical compression and vertical-horizontal-moment (VHM) combining loadings) are included in the finite element analysis. The suction pile performance(i.e. deformation and capacity) are compared among the using of different constitutive models. Additionally, the compliance matrices of the suction pile for different soil models are obtained for the structural engineer. The analyses indicated that NGI-ADP model could be the best choice for undrained analysis of suction pile foundation. This model has a robust calibration process, and well simulate the anisotropic strain-stress relationship. Additionally, the finite element results are conservative when modelling by NGI-ADP model. However, this model can not predict the right pore pressure build-up and stress-path, which may be improved by using a well-calibrated hypoplastic model.","Constitutive Model; NGI-ADP; Finite Element Method; PLAXIS 3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

This research is the start of a human centred design for a digital twin and provides the opportunity for further investigation of applications and discussion of their usefulness. To map out the functional needs of facility managers within the Dutch tunnel sector, ten interviews were compiled. These interviews are based on digital twin literature in other sectors. The discovered needs within the interviews are analysed for patterns and compared to the characteristics of digital twins. This comparison is validated through a focus group with two digital twin experts and is done to consider if digital twins may offer opportunities for the needs mentioned. It is found that for a large majority of the identified functional needs of facility managers requires the mirror like characteristic of a digital twin, when focusing on the needs related to tunnel behaviour. A digital twin that is designed for the identified needs, should focus primarily on decision supporting services for these facility managers, in other words, providing them with relevant data about the tunnel, at the right time and in a comprehensive manner. An indication is given towards seven digital twin implementations that could benefit a tunnel facility manager. The first two are the monitoring of energy use, and monitoring the health of the tunnel system. It is concluded that energy use should be accounted for in a digital twin, and that the monitoring of system health is required for the quick understanding of problems in the tunnel and stakeholder management. The next three are predictive applications: predicting dependent relations between technical tunnel systems, maintenance scheduling, and operational simulations. These applications help anticipate risks during tunnel processes and provide opportunities for reaching better informed decisions regarding maintenance tasks, problem management and configuration management practices. One application, namely energy optimisation, can be considered fully autonomous, as such is not for decision support, but rather for tunnel optimisation, towards the control of energy use of tunnel technical installations.","Digital Twin; Tunnel; infrastructure; BIM; Realtime; Maintenance and operation; Netherlands; Digital Tunnel Twin; Tunnel Twin; Digital Shadow; Digital Model; Interviews; Facility Manager; Facility Management; DT; DTT; CAD; CME; Construction; Predictive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

This could create congestion, penalties or delays to both aircraft and passengers. The problem escalates when expansion to current airport facilities does not happen. A major challenge for airport operators is to match capacity to the growing demand focusing on maximizing the utilization of existing facilities and resources. A source of congestion in airport capacity planning is the aircraft stand. Stand capacity refers to the amount of aircraft operations an airport can accommodate in a given time, influencing both the airside and the landside performance. It should be carefully planned in order not to become a constraint for the runway capacity. Several factors influencing stand capacity are the number and type of available stands, the aircraft fleet, the passenger boarding style (using bridges for contact stands or buses for remote stands) and operating restrictions such as flight sector [21]. This MSc. graduation project is an airport demand forecasting model for stand capacity. The main content revolves around developing traffic forecasts from historic flight schedules which will be used to optimize stand capacity, minimizing cost. The objective is to analyze the number and mix of aircraft stands required for future scenarios.

Whereas failures in digital components used to have a limited effect, nowadays an attack on a critical digital infrastructure impacts our daily lives on a huge scale. Due to these impacts it is estimated that the financial burden of cybercrime is going to increase to 6 trillion dollars by 2021. These costs are estimated to increase even more with the ever increasing amount of connected devices to the internet. To limit this problem, new ways of protecting digital systems must be developed. However, to be able to protect something, it is first necessary to identify the possible threats. In order to do so, vulnerabilities in digital systems have to be found. Preferably before a potential attacker finds them. This thesis looks for such vulnerabilities with respect to Thermal Side Channel Attacks. Whilst power side channel analysis has been around since the mid 90s, the amount of research on thermal side channel analysis has been very limited. However, when it comes to non-invasive side channel analysis, thermals can be of great use. Compared to power side channel analysis, it is much easier to do a non invasive thermal measurement. In some cases, the sensors for thermals are already included and available in the chip itself. This makes them a very suitable target. To perform Thermal Side Channel Attacks, three passive side channel attacks were developed based on existing power attacks. These attacks, Simple Thermal Analysis, Correlation Thermal Analysis and Convolutional Neural Network Thermal Analysis aimed at retrieving a private key from a RSA decryption. Because the thermal traces show a very different behaviour compared to the power traces, some extensive pre-processing techniques had to be developed. This pre-processing consists of removing a drifting offset and filtering unwanted frequencies in the collected trace. To further improve the attack success, a novel attack was created to retrieve the private key from a Montgommery Ladder based RSA implementation. This protected RSA algorithm is used as a counter measure against many side channel attacks. Using Progressive Correlation Thermal Analysis (PCTA), it was possible to attack this algorithm. As this attack does not exist in the power domain, it was also converted to work with power traces referred to as Progressive Correlation Power Analysis (PCPA). Using this technique, the existence of a Thermal Side Channel Attack was proven by successfully attacking multiple temperature traces and retrieving the private key.","Side Channel Analysis; RSA; PCTA; CTA; Encryption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","","","","","",""

Any flow is said to rarefied when the length or time scales of the flow become comparable to the molecular length and time scales. The continuum assumption breaks down and a particle level modelling of fluid flows is necessary. The operating pressure of these rarefied flow processes spans a wide range of rarefaction ranging from mild to strong rarefaction. For gas mixtures in rarefied flow regimes, the mass separation effect occurs because each species exhibits a flow behaviour independent of the other species which depends on the molecular mass of the gas species. This leads to a difference in composition of rarefied gas mixtures when transported through channels, orifices, or valves. In gas transport applications, the mass separation effect needs to be accounted for in the flow calculations and design process. While this effect has been studied in detail for the continuum and free-molecular regimes, its characterisation for the transition regime lacks in-depth investigation. This research characterises the mass separation effect in transition flow regime by investigating its variation with Knudsen number for short micro channels. The numerical model employed is based on the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method with suitable physical interaction models chosen for accuracy in transition regime. It is accompanied by the design of validation experiments to test the accuracy of the numerical solver. The results of this research are used to make new recommendations for industrial practices to approximate the mass separation effect in rarefied gas mixture flows.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

As new quantum applications that run in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices are developed, there is an increasing need for tools that can help to find bugs and verify that these applications work as expected. In this thesis we design and develop such a tool. We introduce QuTAF, a test automation framework for quantum applications that is based in the robot framework.

We prove that our QuTAF is capable of detecting minor deficiencies in current state-of-the-art quantum hardware, by running tests for small quantum applications<br/>executed in a networked quantum node.

(mentor); Stikkelman, R.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In order to achieve the goal of sustainability, industries will have to make a transition to renewable energy and a more circular production. This requires substantial investments as well as constructive cooperation between the various companies in industrial clusters. The problem addressed in this thesis is to find ways of determining optimal investment paths for industrial clusters under specific constraints: the investments should contribute to sustainability (e.g., reduce emissions), provide a positive return for a cluster as a whole, and allow for a distribution of costs and benefits (e.g., through contracts) such that the companies that make the investment have strong incentives for cooperation.<br/>The idea that underlies this thesis is to represent industrial clusters as networks of processes that are owned and operated by different companies, and interdependent via their input-output flows. Such representation should then facilitate analysis from an industrial ecosystem perspective, and identification of potential investment options that would improve the cluster’s sustainability. From a game theory perspective, these investment options can then be seen as potential moves, and the companies as players. Assuming a time horizon (e.g., somewhere between 10 and 40 years), any combination of investments in that period constitutes a strategy, while for each company the difference in cumulative cash flow for that company with/without these investments constitutes the players’ payoffs. Analysis of such a multi-company investment game will reveal rational strategies. We have elaborated and tested this idea by using the Linny-R modelling language and its associated MILP optimisation tool that is being developed at TU Delft first to represent and analyse a variety of simple process configurations with only one or two investment options. Conducting this first series of small-scale simulation experiments, and verifying their outcomes has demonstrated the feasibility of our approach. Subsequently, we have applied the same approach to a realistic, albeit simplified and stylised, industrial cluster that comprises three companies. After identifying a set of potential investment options, we have used the resulting Linny R model to conduct a second series of experiments to simulate and analyse solitary investment strategies per company, a cluster-wide cooperative strategy, as well as competitive strategies with various contractual arrangements. The results of this study show that we can indeed use Linny-R as a modelling language and simulation tool to represent and analyse investment decisions as multi-actor games, which then allow us to infer and evaluate cooperative as well as competitive investment strategies. This study has several limitations. We did not investigate the scalability of the method. We experimented with a relatively small and simplified cluster; upscaling to a cluster with 10 or 100 times more processes could become computationally infeasible. Another limitation is that we did not test in practice whether models in the Linny-R notation will indeed effectively support communication and negotiation between companies. Thirdly, the set of categories of investment options that we have identified is not exhaustive. Our recommendations for future research hence are to explore the computational limits using a state-of-the-art commercial solver, and to conduct real-world case studies, meanwhile extending and refining the categories of investment options that can be instrumental in furthering the transition towards more sustainable industrial clusters.","Energy Transition; Industrial Ecosystems; Sustainabilty; Mixed Integer Linear Programming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

In doing so, DARE has entered flight supersonic regimes during atmospheric entry. With the development of cryogenic engines in the pipeline, future DARE missions look at reaching the hypersonic velocity regimes resulting in the current cork and carbon fibre composite heat shield design becoming redundant. Thus, hypersonic flight brings with it the challenge of designing new a heat shield; capable of withstanding the elevated temperatures. <br/><br/>Alginate and montmorillonite nanoclay based biopolymer nanocomposites have become a well-researched topic in recent years. This stems from the ability of the nanoclay fillers to align themselves within the suspension to mimic natural materials such as nacre (mother of pearl). The alignment of the nanoclay not only reinforces the biopolymer to provide a high storage modulus but also provides a tortuous path for transport phenomenon such as diffusion to take place; thereby making them flame retardant. <br/><br/>In their native state, the nanocomposites are film-like and offer limited viability. But, simple production practices may be borrowed from culinary disciplines to transform the nanocomposites into foams with different relative densities. The introduction of the gaseous voids should further heighten the thermal characteristics; allowing them to function as heat shields. However, in transforming the nanocomposite to a foam, little is understood about the impact it will have on the mechanics of the native nanocomposite. As multiple analytical and numerical models have been provided over the years to estimate the mechanical properties of foams, a careful assessment of the various literature sources becomes necessary. Once a suitable model is identified, a detailed experimental campaign can be carried out to characterise the biopolymer nanocomposite foams mechanically.","Biopolymer Nanocomposites; Foams; Heat Shields; Relative Density; Mechanical Characterisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","","51.990167, 4.379619"

(mentor); Doubrovski, E.L. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","This project contains the graduation project of Fokke Jongerden as part of his curriculum of the master Integrated Product Design at the TU Delft. The project consists of a reflection and redesign of the Air-Wave.org Protector (AWP), a respiratory protection device designed by the non profit Air-Wave.org. The AWP is developed to protect hospital staff that cares for Covid-19 patients from contamination. The trajectory from idea concept to product implementation into hospitals, a process which normally takes several years, only took 8 weeks for the AWP. Many design and management decisions contributed to this success, which this project aims to analyse. This project has two goals: Crisis Design analysis In this part, the process that resulted in the Air-Wave Protector is analysed, and the strengths and weaknesses of this process are determined. Firstly, the entire timeline of the project was mapped to create an understanding of all activities of the development process. The relation and codependency between management related activities and design development were analyzed and critical moments to the project’s outcome were established. Secondly, the management method of the AW.org was studied, to identify the key elements of their management approach. These elements were compared to integral aspects of crisis design according to literature. This resulted in the distinction between methodized crisis management with the focus on threat control, and a newly formulated model for crisis opportunity management. Thirdly, the desing method of the design development team of Air-Wave.org was analysed. Their applied model was deducted, and insights were generated on the benefits and weaknesses of their approach. Lastly, the analysis was supplemented with a research on user appreciation of the end product of the management and design methods; the Air-Wave.org Protector. By pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in the design, a reflection was made on missing elements in the approach of the organization. It was concluded that the use of repurposed elements in the design was one of the key factors in achieving fast market implementation. However, future projects could benefit from a context analysis, an explorative study to search for existing products to repurpose, in combination with a predefined List of Requirements to evaluate both developed and repurposed product components. AWP Redesign The second part of this project proposes a redesign of the Air-wave.org Protector. This redesign is based on literature studies, user research, method analysis, empirical insights gained during the development of the previous design and extensive prototyping. The result is a respiratory protection mask which can be interchanged with the current mask used in the AWP. The remaining product components remain unchanged. The new mask improves the field of sight, the comfort and the ability to communicate, both verbally and non verbally. Furthermore, this design allows the user to wear glasses. A functioning prototype was developed and user evaluation was performed. The report concludes with recommendations on future concept development.","Personal Protection equipment; Covid-19; Crisis design; Crisis management; Respiratory protection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

These requirements necessitate the use of compliant mechanisms/flexures instead of traditional rigid body counterparts. However, as these flexures are pushed to operate at ever higher speeds, high frequency modes affect precision and hence require better damping. Currently active damping relies on a single or small amount of actuators which makes their placement for multimode damping inefficient. To this end, the MetaMech project was created which aims to combine the disciplines of mechatronics and metamaterials to create flexures with integrated cells housing sensors, active and passive dampers in optimal positions and orientations. This will enable more efficient placement and orientation of dampers, reducing the force and thus the size and weight needed to damp the system. This thesis takes the first step in this direction and is concerned with developing the first prototype demonstrator of a metamaterial flexure with integrated damping using currently available technology. The presentation will cover the design, Finite Element Analysis and practical tests of a hexagonal patterned metamaterial flexure with integrated piezo patches. It also presents the design and finite element analysis of a more advanced hexagonal cell able to exert force in three different directions.

(mentor); Harlaar, J. (mentor); Wisse, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The ankle plantar flexion muscles are the main contributors to the propulsion of the body during gait. Deficits in these muscles, such as reduced muscle strength, often lead to impaired walking. A characteristic widely observed in gaits arising from various pathologies is an increase in medio-lateral trunk movements. However, this is not yet identified as a compensation strategy for ankle plantar flexor weakness. A previous analysis showed a decrease in positive work generated at the ankle joint in healthy individuals walking with excessive trunk sway compared to normal walking at the same speed. This suggests that excessive trunk sway could be used to compensate for a reduction in propulsive power generated at the ankle joint. This study investigates the relationship between excessive trunk movements in the frontal plane and propulsive power generated at the ankle joint by examining the contributions of individuals muscles to the total power generation during gait. The first aim of this study is to evaluate the validity of the previous results. The second aim is to uncover the underlying biomechanical compensatory mechanisms of walking with excessive medio-lateral trunk movements. A data set consisting of marker data and ground reaction force data of healthy individuals walking with and without excessive medio-lateral trunk movements is analysed in this study. Three-dimensional muscle-actuated simulations of the recorded gaits were generated in OpenSim. A residual reduction algorithm was applied to make the kinematic outcomes more dynamically consistent with the experimentally measured ground reaction forces and moments. This is in contrast to the previous analysis, in which the residuals were not reduced. The power and work generated by the total system and the individual segments, joints and muscles were derived from the simulations. An increase in positive work at the lumbar joint was found, but no differences in positive work at the hip, knee and/ or ankle joints were found over the gait cycle. The lumbar bending muscles turned out to be responsible for the increase in positive work at the lumbar joint. In conclusion, we did not find medio-lateral trunk sway to be a compensatory mechanism for ankle plantar flexor weakness. Therefore, more research is needed to understand why trunk sway is commonly observed in patients with reduced plantar flexion muscle strength. The results of our study contrast those of the previous analysis. Our findings suggest that the discrepancy between the outcomes is caused by high residual forces and moments in the previous analysis. Hence, by revealing the discrepancy between the results of this study and the results of the previous analysis, this study highlights the importance of the validation of results before drawing conclusions.","Gait; Ankle work; Trunk; Push-off; Muscle work","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Yang, Y. (graduation committee); Rout, Bapin (graduation committee); Schrama, Frank (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The main goal of this research is to get a better understanding of the manganese refining path in the steelmaking converter process. This study focuses primarly on manganese refining due to manganese mass transfer, between metal containing droplets and oxidized slag in the metal-slag emulsion zone, in the top part of the steelmaking converter. Manganese and iron content in the slag heavily influences the slag formation path. Controlling the slag viscosity is essential for controlling the efficiency of the steelmaking process and to preserve the quality of the final steel product. Manganese refining in the steelmaking process occurs in three phases, the primary oxidation phase, the reversion phase and the secondary oxidation phase. This manganese reversion phase is hard to predict and influences the final amount of manganese in the end steel product. In order to raise understanding of the reversion behaviour of manganese in the converter, unique data gathered from in situ measurements done in the EU funded IMPHOS project is utilised. The following research questions were formulated and answered in this study: 1. Are thermodynamic models for manganese distribution calculation applicable for the prediction of the three different behavioral phases of manganese in IMPHOS? 2. What is the influence of the slag-metal emulsion droplets size on the manganese refining behaviour? 3. What is the influence of metal-slag data input obtained from 2 different heights in IMPHOS, on the final resulting manganese behaviour in the kinetic model made in python? 4. Were there any chemical deviations in different zones of the hot metal bath during IMPHOS project sampling? IMPHOS heat S1836, S1841, S1844, S1845 were selected and analyzed on their theoretical thermodynamic equilibrium behaviour for manganese. This analysis was done with Suito No. 3 and Morales and Fruehan equilibrium partition model. Furthermore, the heats slag composition data, hot metal data and converter process variables were used as input in a kinetic model. The model is simulating the micro and macro kinetic behaviour of manganese in the converter emulsion zone with a fixed time step of 1s. The mass transfer in the model is based on Fick's first law of diffusion and uses penetration theory by Higbie, to describe mass transfer along metal droplet boundaries. Parameters such as the manganese mass transfer and the predicted manganese content in the hot metal bath were evaluated to validate the model with the measured concentration reported in the IMPHOS study. Bulk chemical analysis is done on physical samples from heat S1836 cup height 2. This is done to check the inhomogeneity in the hot metal bath and the possibility of different reaction zones in the converter process. The thermodynamic evaluation performed on IMPHOS data showed the difficulty of thermodynamic models derived from laboratory tests, to describe the manganese equilibrium behaviour within the converter. Suito no 3 model gave a better prediction of the manganese distribution than the Morales and Fruehan model. The results from the kinetic model showed a slower primary oxidation and reversion behaviour of manganese compared to the original data. This is mainly due to the manganese equilibrium behaviour of the thermodynamic model and the negligence of the manganese refining in the jet impact zone and metal-slag interface. The model gave a better prediction when a small size droplet range was considered, which implies that the smaller size droplets less than 100 micron are significantly contributing to the manganese transfer from metal to slag and vice versa. The present study reveals that droplet size play an important role and thus need further investigation to accurately describe the size fraction for the accuracy of the kinetic model. The difference between metal-slag data input from the different IMPHOS cup height 4 and 5 on the outcome of the thermodynamic evaluation and kinetic model results, proved to be small enough to be considered negligible. The results from the sample analysis showed deviations for carbon and phosphorus in the new examined cup height 2. These measurements were taken at a high position in the hot metal bath and were different from the measured concentration in the bottom of the hot metal bath. This can indicate deviations in chemical content in the hot metal bath during the original IMPHOS research. More heat data of height 2 , close to the bath surface, is required to confirm this finding.","Manganese; Steelmaking; Converter; Kinetics; IMPHOS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences | European Mining Course","",""

Industrial concentrate is a waste stream that is actively researched to explore and expand the prospects of resource recovery. Strontium (Sr), an alkaline earth metal, while found regularly in concentrate streams has not been a focus for recovery. Through this study, the recovery of Sr as strontium carbonate (SrCO<sub>3</sub>) via precipitation from concentrate streams has been investigated. The objective of this study is to characterize SrCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation in terms of factors that influence it. Specifically, the effect of multiple factors has been investigated on the amount of Sr precipitated (as % relative to the initial amount of Sr) as well as the purity of the corresponding SrCO<sub>3</sub> precipitate (%). Factors that could affect either the amount of Sr precipitated or the purity of the precipitated SrCO<sub>3</sub> were identified based on theoretical knowledge. Equilibrium-based simulations were performed using OLI studio to confirm their impact. The conditions associated with the identified influencing factors were investigated in concentrate from a reverse osmosis unit during drinking water production. A Box-Behnken Design was implemented to quantify the relationship between the identified factors and two responses (i) Amount of Sr precipitated and, (ii) Purity of SrCO<sub>3</sub> precipitated. The range of the factors in the design was established based on their ranges as observed in the concentrate. The value of pH and concentrations of strontium, inorganic carbon (C), calcium (Ca), barium (Ba) and inorganic sulfur (S) were hypothesized to have quantitative and qualitative effects on the SrCO<sub>3</sub> precipitated. Magnesium (Mg) was hypothesized to have a qualitative effect on the SrCO<sub>3</sub> precipitated. Direct SrCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation from concentrate was not practical due to considerably higher concentration of other ions. To facilitate SrCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation from concentrate, the concentration of the other ions was reduced by recovering them as precipitates. The recovery of these precipitates was investigated through variation of process conditions via OLI simulations. Theoretically, it is possible to recover 0.0014g of SrCO<sub>3</sub> (100% purity) per liter of concentrate along with 0.684g CaCO<sub>3</sub> (99.95% purity), 0.161g Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> (96% purity), 0.0083g Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (99.99% purity) and  NaCl solution (4.65 M). Using Box-Behnken Design, the mathematical relationship between the amount of Sr precipitated (% relative to initial concentration) and purity of SrCO<sub>3</sub> precipitated (%) subject to the identified factors was established. The equations had a R<sup>2</sup> of 98.75% and 97.38% respectively. S was found to not have any significant impact on SrCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation while a positive interaction effect between Sr and Ca was also identified. %Sr precipitated=0.82098+0.01319(pH)-0.04004(Sr)+0.11581(C)-0.07343(Ca)-0.01314(pH*pH)-0.04299(Sr*Sr)-0.04073(C*C)-0.02041(Mg*Mg)+0.01818(pH*Ca)+0.05369(Sr*C)+0.07436(Sr*Ca)-0.05763(C*Ca)  SrCO<sub>3</sub> purity(%)=0.5155-0.20923(pH)+0.12593(Sr)-0.03178(C)-0.06115(Ca)-0.07187(Mg)+0.0617(pH*pH)-0.0388(Sr*Sr)-0.0295(C*C)+0.0456(Mg*Mg)-0.0485(pH*Sr)+0.0595(pH*C)+0.0405(pH*Ca)-0.0903(pH*Mg)+0.0481(Sr*C)+0.0614(Sr*Ca)-0.0453(C*Ca) The predictive R<sup>2</sup> of these equations are 93.45% and 86.32% respectively. This is representative of their prediction accuracy and hence their applicability to replace experiments and simulations. These equations, however, are built on outputs from OLI simulations. Therefore, their accuracy is subject to the predictive capability of OLI software. Experimental results based on the chosen Box-Behnken Design are needed to either replace the OLI simulations results entirely or account for the inaccuracy of OLI simulations.<br","Precipitation; Strontium Carbonate; Reverse Osmosis Concentrate; Box Behnken Design; Recovery; OLI Studio","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-01","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The preliminary design of wind turbine support structures within an offshore wind farm plays a significant role in decreasing the costs involved and is pivotal in establishing the wind sector as a leading contributor towards a sustainable future. During the early design stages, the optimization of structural dimensions, which involves a large number of iterations, is an essential step in determining the optimal offshore wind farm layout. Aiming to assist in the time and cost efficiency of such procedures, this thesis project develops a fatigue analysis model of offshore wind turbine monopile structures in the frequency domain. The structure is modeled using the finite element method and consists of Euler-Bernoulli beam elements. The soil-structure interaction is approximated by the effective fixity length and the rotor-nacelle assembly is incorporated as a point mass, contributing its inertial properties to the tower’s top node. Transfer functions are developed to relate the input environmental force spectra to the total stress response of the structure. Time series of wind thrust on rotor are converted to aerodynamic power spectral densities (PSDs). The hydrodynamic spectra are calculated based on nodal wave forces obtained by the Morison equation, with the wave environment being defined by mathematical models for wave particle kinematics and wave elevation spectra. The mode superposition method is used to enable the addition of aerodynamic and hydrodynamic modal responses. In order to retrieve the stress range variations from the total stress response spectra, the Dirlik method is applied. Finally, the fatigue damage accumulation is calculated by the Palmgren-Miner’s rule. The proposed model (PM) is capable of calculating the fatigue at any location along the structure and for any environmental state. It produces very accurate results for the 1st fore-aft (F-A) mode shape deflection. It also demonstrates accuracy in calculating the natural frequencies of the 1st and 2nd F-A, as well as of the 1st side-to-side. The considerable deviation of the 2nd side-to-side natural frequency is attributed to the simplified RNA modelling. The inclusion of a 6% aerodynamic damping to couple the wind and wave responses has a significant effect on the dynamic response, decreasing its peak by almost an order of magnitude. The dynamic response and the environmental load spectra are also shown to be mesh independent, demonstrating the model’s reliability. The mesh sensitivity analysis shows that the maximum stresses and, as a consequence, the stress response spectra produce erroneous results for low mesh sizes, which is anticipated. The fatigue damage quickly converges to an asymptotic value for increasing mesh sizes. The fast convergence rates allow the model to produce adequate results for low mesh sizes, achieving very low simulation times. Special attention is given to the effect that the hydrodynamic cross-power spectral densities (CSDs) have on the fatigue. The wave CSDs increase the fatigue due to wind and wave PSDs by about 9%, suggesting that their incorporation could prove significant.","Fatigue Analysis; Offshore Wind Turbines; Frequency Domain; Support structure; Monopile foundation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The increase of anthropogenic CO2 emissions accelerates global warming and sea-level rising, which could lead to irreversible environmental damages. Electrochemically converting CO2 to value-added fuels is a promising approach to reduce carbon footprint and store over-generating renewable electricity as chemical energy. Studies have shown the excellent catalytic performance of bulk MoS2 concerning the low overpotential and high product selectivity towards CO for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in ionic liquid-based solutions. However, its performance in different configurations and electrolytes remains unexplored. In this study, two types of MoS2, namely bulk MoS2 and MoS2 film coated on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE), were used. Their CO2RR performance in the KHCO3 aqueous and ionic liquid-based solutions was investigated using electrochemical methods, gas chromatography (GC), and attenuated total reflectance - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Additionally, the photochemical activity of MoS2 was explored using scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET).<br/><br/>The selected catalysts were characterized before and after the CO2 reduction process using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). GC measurement results showed that MoS2 film coated on GCE exclusively catalyzed H2 evolution in aqueous solutions. It was also observed that higher activity was achieved on the MoS2 film mixed with glassy carbon powder. Furthermore, the MoS2 film with the changed bandgap structure also performed better in ionic liquid-based aqueous electrolyte. These findings suggest that the catalytic performance of MoS2 film for CO2RR could be enhanced by interspersing materials with high conductivity or modifying the bandgap structure.","CO2 reduction; Electrocatalysis; Transition-metal dichalcogenides; MoS2; Ionic liquid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

Within the EU, there are policies to make the housing stock energy neutral by 2050. However, this sentiment is not shared internationally. Within the EU, there are several options made available for making renovation of existing stock more financially feasible, with models provided by initiatives such as STUNNING, REVALUE, or ABRACADABRA to name a few. Though the EU has options made available, this is not the case for the rest of the world.

The research also combines the<br/>financial with other technical frameworks such as finding optimum insulation thicknesses and its influence on the pay back periods. The research works in 4 parts, creating a model building through aggregate modeling and frameworks, running the financial dashboard based on the characteristics of the model building and doing a sensitivity and Monte Carlo analysis, then finally an interview is conducted with experts, showing them the data of the model building and then asking about the limitations of said financial models. The applications are reviewed in a foreign context, in this case Kuwait, and<br/>in addition, the effects of the large scale application of these models are examined in the literature review. The results show that financially speaking, it is completely feasible to apply these models within Kuwait, and in fact they work better than they do in western contexts because of the avoidance of the landlord-tenant conflict since landlords are responsible for paying utility fees. On average, given Kuwait’s current inflation rates, electricity prices, water prices and average rental rate per m2, we are seeing an average of a 4 year payback period on a major rehabilitation, without even the need for a real estate reevaluation. The micro economic results are also compared with studies made on macro-economic knock on effects of mass renovation within the country, and it was found that it was feasible. Through the interviews, however, it was found that though there are few barriers in the financial sense, there is a lack of understanding and need for a larger investigation into the sociological and behavioral barriers found within this context.","Economic Feasibility; Sustainable transition; financial model; Sustainable renovation; income producing properties","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

This provides an advantage over the currently used sensors in Intelligent Vehicles that can sense obstacles within their line-of-sight only. Recently, a localization based approach has been implemented to take advantage of this sensing modality to predict approaching vehicles behind the blind corner in an urban scenario. While this approach shows a lot of promise, there is a difficulty in integrating the multi-microphone system. Additionally, the system would be unable to differentiate between the nature of two sound sources. This motivates the exploration of a classification based approach which uses audio data from only a single microphone to identify the sound sources present in them. This thesis investigates the possibility of having such a system on the Intelligent Vehicle to predict approaching vehicles from behind the blind corners. A review of the literature revealed that techniques categorized under Sound Event Detection (SED) are suitable to implement a classification based approach. The prediction of the vehicle is treated as a binary classification problem and a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) is used as the acoustic model to detect the presence of an approaching car in the audio sample represented by Log Mel Spectrogram features. Additionally, domain adaptation techniques were implemented to explore the possibility<br/>of improving the system performance with limited data collected while the ego-vehicle is driving. Experiments carried out indicate that when the ego-vehicle is static, the system performs well with the approaching vehicle predicted 1.4s before it is in line-of-sight and a balanced accuracy of 86.9% achieved for the classification task. However, the system achieved an accuracy of 68% on the samples recorded while the ego-vehicle was driving. Further experiments indicate that the acoustic model cannot generalize well to unseen situations in most cases and experiment with domain adaptation did not show<br/>any improvement in performance.","Acoustic Perception; Intelligent Vehicles; Sound Event Detection; Deep Learning; Domain Adaptation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

To do this, the alternatives should be as efficient and durable as possible. The alternative that has been growing the fastest in recent years is solar energy. Apart from it’s growth in the market share, the efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) cells has also steadily grown. Recently, this trend has started to stagnate, since most avenues of efficiency improvement have been exhausted. However, the possibilities of thermal management (i.e. cooling) of PV cells are relatively unexplored. An increase in cell temperature causes a decrease in efficiency, in other words, less sunlight is converted into electrical energy. Moreover, high operating temperatures cause damage in solar cells, reducing their lifetime by months (or even years). One promising technology that can keep cell temperatures low is the Phase Change Material (PCM) based heat sink. A PCM takes a lot of energy to melt and during phase change it remains at a stable temperature. PV + PCM systems have shown to be able to increase cell efficiency by up to 8%. In order to get a better grip on the workings and the potential of PCMs as a heat sink for PV cells, this work presents an implicit, transient, spectrally resolved, MATLABbased model that can simulate module temperature and phase change within the PCM. The model uses SMARTS in combination with irradiance data to create spectral irradiance data. Using this spectral data together with GenPro4 provides the amount of energy absorbed by each layer of the PV cell. The PV part of the model is validated for a summer week in the Netherlands, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.83 and a Mean Bias Error (MBE) of 0.56. For a winter week in January the MAE was 1.76 and the MBE 1.44. When simulating only a PV module (so no PV + PCM system), the model can simulate 45 hours of data per hour, with one minute time step. When validating the PV + PCM model for the same weeks, the MAE was 2.96 and the MBE 1.91 for the summer week and a MAE of 1.37 and MBE of 1.15 for the winter week. When simulating a PV + PCM system the simulation time drops to 18 hours of simulated data per hour, due to a larger mesh and the requirement of several iterations in the PCM model. With this model a wide range of PV + PCM systems (e.g. with different thicknesses and melting temperatures) can be simulated for any location, provided that there is access to the following weather data: temperature, wind speed and irradiance.","PV-PCM; Thermal modelling; Thermal management; PV System; MATLAB; GenPro4; SMARTS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, the performances of taxonomy classification and ARGs profiling with Oxford Nanopore gDNA sequencing with different thresholds were assessed using an artificial microbial community.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Within the context of utilizing alternative materials to promote sustainable construction in the building industry, Living Architecture is a concept that uses living organisms as the building materials. As a rather unconventional approach, it possesses benefits such as low cost, not requiring considerable workforce or industrial material, carbon-free, and its ability to return to nature when no longer in use. As an essential part of Living Architectures, scientists and engineers have recognized the importance of fusion between trees. For instance, in projects such as the Baubotanik Tower and the Living Tree Pavilion, a design premise is that the structure becomes ready when the fusion between trees could provide sufficient strength to support the structure. However, little research has been conducted in terms of the fusion processes and the mechanical behaviours of tree connections, which is an essential step prior to designing Living Architecture. With crosswise tree connection as the main focus of this thesis, the following research question is formulated: What are the mechanical behaviours of a self-growing crosswise tree connection when utilized as load-bearing elements in a building structure, and how can such connections be modelled during the preliminary design phase of a building structure? To help answering the research question, literature studies are conducted. In chapter 1, from a botanical perspective, it is concluded that, in the event of two stems contacting with one another, the two stems would gradually fuse together. Such an event is triggered by the abrasion on the bark due to the rubbing between the stems; later, due to the secondary growth, fibers from both stems deviate and join together to form common growth rings, such event can also be verified by the micro-CT scans that have been conducted on the crosswise tree connections. Additionally, due to the nature of the connection, a certain eccentricity from the stems' piths exists, and it is important to acknowledge that the length of such eccentricity stays constant from the start of the fusion process. To investigate the influence of tree growth on the mechanical properties of trees and tree connections, which is needed for design purposes, chapter 2 investigates the growth model and the tapering geometry of living trees. With the help of the Urban tree growth model published by the United States Department of Agriculture and a series of simple tapering equations, the growth parameters of a growing tree can be computed. Part-II of the thesis explores deeper in terms of the mechanical behaviours of such crosswise connections. A simple analysis of two trees connected in a crosswise manner is first conducted in chapter 4. It is concluded that, under loading, the connection can be subjected to tensile stress perpendicular to the grain and rolling shear stress. As two of the weakest strength properties of wood, the crosswise connections should be treated with care by future designers. As a part of an entire building structure, it is essential to determine the rotational stiffness and strength of a structural connection; therefore, in chapter 5, an experimental design is proposed for such purpose. Due to the irregular geometry of the crosswise connection, the experiment makes use of digital image correlation so that the rotational stiffness of the connection under loading can be obtained. Since conducting the actual experiment falls out of this thesis scope, a finite element modelling analysis with similar boundary conditions is conducted in chapter 6. With the results obtained from FEM, it is found that, due to the nature of the connection, complex torsional behaviours occur to the connection. Additionally, with the connection under loading, it is found that non-uniform stress distribution and stress concentration occurs along the interface between two stems. Comparing with the strength properties of wood, it is discovered that the first incident that causes failure is tension perpendicular to the grain, which is the weakest strength property of wood. To conduct preliminary structural design and verification, wireframe modelling approach is often utilized. In chapter 7, it is concluded that it is most suitable to model the crosswise connection with a separate beam element that connects the two stems, for its ability to capture the complex torsional behaviours described in chapter 6.<br/>Lastly, after investigating the local behaviours of crosswise connection, Part-III<br/>investigates the feasibility of conducting a preliminary structural design and verification with such connections. With the case study analysis conducted in chapter 8, it is concluded that, by appropriately capturing the load effects on growing trees and tree connections, designers are able to predict when the structure would reach sufficient strength to be in service. This thesis positions itself as a part of a broader spectrum that examines the feasibility of utilizing tree connections as the load-bearing elements in structures, which can be seen as a step towards sustainable construction.","Sustainabilty; Wood; parameteric design; finite element method; Tree models; Tree connection; Biomechanics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

After the second world war in the 1960s and 1970s, substantial development occurred in transportation infrastructure with the construction of new assets like highways, railways, roadways and airports. As a result of this, the forthcoming decades are about maintaining and replacing these assets.In a dynamic environment like an airport, it becomes necessary to have a prioritisation(ranking) within these maintenance and replacement projects. A prioritisation helps the decision-makers plan project activities in a better way, curtail risks related to disruption of operations, use their financial resources wisely and have a preference on what 'maintenance and replacement' activities should be undertaken. Thus to obtain this prioritisation in 'maintenance and replacement' project initiatives, the need for forming a decision-making process is triggered. The framework is thus developed comprised of a data-driven rational model and intuitive models that take conflicts within decision-makers into consideration. The framework is developed in three levels of - 1. Project identification and development, 2. Project comparison and review and 3. Project selection and approval in this research. The framework can be adopted to obtain a prioritisation in project initiatives, having flexibility to rely just on the data driven results or to adopt some intuitive decision making models.","Decision Making; airport infrastructure; rational decision-making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

For more than 95 years since its establishment in 1925, the scheme has been a significant asset to Sudan’s economy. It is considered one of the oldest and largest schemes in the world being served by one management body using surface gravity irrigation from a single source. For many years, the system has performed with high efficiency and was considered a good model example, both locally and internationally. In the last few decades the scheme has deteriorated. The water productivity records show declining trends, while more water is being withdrawn from Sennar dam. Farmers are complaining about water shortages and some fields are not reached at all. Authorities state severe damages in the system’s infrastructure, with about 85% of the system’s hydraulic works being damaged. The performance of operation is well below the required efficiency. The sedimentation issue has always been present in the system, especially in the minor canals, but has been severe in recent years. As a result, farmers tend to interfere in the operation of the system, as they are not satisfied with the management authorities. Therefore, the scheme’s operation situations changed accordingly, shifting from the original design approach into new – often undesired – situations. There have been many studies carried in the Gezira Irrigation scheme, in order to understand the reasons behind this deterioration and find sustainable solutions. Starting from the causes of the sedimentation issue and maintenance works, generating new methods of calculating the crop water requirements using remote sensing, influence of farmers’ practices on field level, change of management and institutions throughout the history, and many others. Yet, there is no sensible change seen on the ground. The main objective of this thesis is contribute to the researches done in the Gezira scheme by providing an understanding of how the canalization system’s respond to various water demands strategies. In recent years, there has been a noticeable improvement in methods used to determine crop water requirements using remote sensing. Coping with these improvements, a main question rises, to what extent these remote sensing approaches could be implemented in large irrigation schemes, taking the Gezira scheme as a case study. Determining water requirements is one thing, delivering the water through the canal system could be something else. In order to answer the above question, we first need to analyze the system we are studying. This step was carried through analyzing the current, general, performance of the Gezira scheme and comparing it to the initial design characteristics of the scheme using the MASSCOTE framework (FAO). Using the outcomes of the MASSCOTE evaluation, the thesis proceeded by generating a computer model of the canalization system, taking a major and minor canal as a representation for the water distribution system, and testing different water demands scenarios. This step provided insights into the operation of the canalization system on the level of major and minor canals. It was found that, within the boundaries of our model, implementing new remote sensing methods is practicable, assuming water is readily available at the offtake of the major canal. This conclusion takes into consideration the lengths of the canals and their locations regarding the overall scheme and the carrying capacity of each canals.","Irrigation; Modelling; MASSCOTE; Gezira","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Already for over 220 years, PostNL is the one that is delivering mail and parcels in the Netherlands and abroad. Like other post organizations, PostNL has been facing serious challenges in transforming their traditional services. Next to regular parcel delivery and mail delivery, PostNL provides several additional services to their consumers. One of them is their relocation service, which forwards mail to a consumer’s new address after moving house and can inform organizations about their new address as well. Until now, the relocation service has been a valuable part of PostNL’s business, serving thousands of customers per year, each paying a fixed price for a certain amount of weeks. But with declining numbers in sent mail and with consumers having an increasing amount of digital contact with companies and organizations, PostNL stated that the service is losing relevance and needs a revision. In line with this observation, the purpose of this thesis was to research how PostNL can develop a (new) value proposition for the relocation service that at the same time can contribute to their ambition of becoming digitally relevant. In other words, it was aimed to investigate what should be the next step of the relocation service. However, after initial explorative research, it was found that current development processes within PostNL, in general, are still more technology-driven rather than consumer-driven. In order to define the next step of the relocation service, a more holistic approach is deemed necessary. Therefore, this thesis proposes the following problem statement: How can PostNL get an in-depth understanding of their consumers to develop value propositions that at the same time contribute to PostNL’s ambition in becoming digitally relevant? The end result is a service framework for PostNL employees (service designers and business developers), that stimulates to empathize with the needs and emotions of consumers during life events and includes a step-by- step approach to develop personalized value propositions that respond to these needs and emotions. To show PostNL how these insights and the approach can be embodied in a service to emotionally engage their consumers, the revision of the relocation service is used as a case study. The outcome of the case study is communicated through the use of a persona, a service blueprint and a digital prototype. The latter has been presented to consumers and validated the enhanced digital experience of the relocation service. Furthermore, the service framework comes with future milestones that aim to show PostNL how to further develop this service in the future, making use of data and B2B partnerships.","Digital transformation; Consumer life events; Empathy principles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

By allowing data to stay on client devices and do training locally, we work towards a more privacy-friendly future. Furthermore, utilizing federated machine learning enables machine learning in data-constrained environments where bandwidth is not sufficient to upload the entire dataset.

We investigate how these simpler models hold up within a federated setting. We also look into the developments of AI frameworks and their capabilities for mobile platforms. Based on these findings, we propose that model-hyper-parameter optimization is possible to maximize accuracy for smaller networks during federated learning. We show that it is possible to reduce the accuracy loss from 15% to only 0.04%. We then demonstrate what a mobile implementation looks like and the performance we see from an iPhone X.

This research determines the effect of certain market mechanisms, which have been proposed to either incentivize the distributed generation or to reduce their undesirable effects, on power flow of a prosumer household. The prosumer household was assumed to consist of PV generation system, an Electric Vehicle which was capable of V2G and a household battery. The market mechanisms used were Feed-in tariffs, Capacity Mechanism and Frequency Containment Reserve. An Energy Management System which determines both, the optimal system size and the optimal power flow by minimizing the operational costs was used to achieve this. It was observed that different level of feed in tariff affected the optimal system size and the power flow. At high feed-in tariff, the system size was the largest and high grid peak power was observed. Furthermore, the introduction of the capacity mechanism in the form of capacity tariffs per kW led to reduction in grid power consumption and feeding in. Finally, it was observed that the energy management system was able to reserve power for the frequency regulation market. Compared to an uncontrolled case, a reduction of 70.26% in total costs was achieved when the EMS control was introduced. A cost reduction of 52.02% compared to the uncontrolled case was achieved when an additional capacity tariff was also introduced to the control. Finally, introduction of the frequency regulation mechanism in the EMS control led to even further reduction in costs with a drop of 1205.07% compared to the uncontrolled case.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Ammonia has been recognized as an effective leaching agent in hydro-metallurgical processes for the recovery of metals\cite{AmmLeach2013}. These processes result in ammonia-metal crystals, whereby in the last step, water and ammonia are removed from the crystals by a calcination process. In the past, the vaporized ammonia is considered a waste stream. However, regulations in the last few decades make it impossible for companies to dispose large amounts of ammonia into the air\cite{LRTAP2005}\cite{SOER2020}. Therefore, expensive installations, like catalytic oxidizers (CATOX) or membrane separators, need to be installed for ammonia reduction in the effluent gas stream. Climax Molybdenum b.v. installation in the Botlek Rotterdam produces pure molybdenum oxide according to the process described above. With the production, molybdenum oxide is leached in an ammonia solution to remove all contaminants, then crystallized and calcined. For the calcination process, the crystals are heated by a gas burner to vaporize the ammonia and water. The off-gas contains air, \ce{NH3}, \ce{CO2}, dust particles, and water vapor. The objective is to recycle the ammonia from the off-gasses of the calciner. Reclaiming the ammonia from the off-gas stream could reduce the costs up to \euro2000 per day. In this thesis, insights are gathered related to the chemical and physical reactions that occur when off-gasses of the calciner enter the process. Additionally, both the beneficial effects and potential complications of reclaiming ammonia from the off-gas are explained. This research is conducted by making mass balances on three different options for off-gas handling. These options include absorption into the leaching fluid (ARS:Ammonia Reduction System), absorption by water through a scrubbing system (AER:Ammonia Emission Reduction), and absorption by water through a scrubbing system with additional carbon dioxide removal with sodium hydroxide (AER+NaOH). In order to understand what happens when inorganic carbon (IC) comes into the system, experiments are conducted on both the leaching procedure of molybdenum and the stripping and condensing process of ammonia. Results show that inorganic carbon reaches its solubility in the leaching fluid at 2.12 mol/kg. Also, no effect on the solubility of ammonium molybdate was found, and no additional precipitation occurs on metals like zinc, calcium, magnesium, and iron. In the leaching fluid, the solubility of ammonium bicarbonate is reached at 183 grams per liter. Additionally, the influence of inorganic carbon on the stripping process showed that the strip rate of ammonia was reduced by 1.4. Also, could be concluded that stripping of ammonia was done efficiently at 80 degrees until the total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) mole concentration equals the total inorganic carbon (TIC) mole concentration. As a result, additional water treatment is needed for the discharge water to ensure the amount of ammonia does not exceed 25kg per day. Furthermore, another complication found was scaling. Scaling happens in both ARS and AER-system in the form of ammonium bicarbonate. In contrast, AER+NaOH system does not have the complication of scaling or ammonia in the discharge water, but the pH of the solution needs to be neutralized before discharge. Moreover, higher pH in the recycling water of the scrubber causes lower absorption efficiency of ammonia. ARS, AER, and AER+NaOH-system have an ammonia reduction of 41\%w, 33\%w, and 73\%w per day, respectively. For the ARS and AER-system, this means a cost-saving of \euro{1.160,-} and \euro{920,-} per day, respectively. The AER+NaOH-system has a direct cost of \euro{10.130,-} per day, due to the expensive sodium hydroxide. The cost of sodium hydroxide as a water treatment agent is higher than the cost savings of ammonia recovery from the off-gasses of the calciner. Therefore can be concluded that, ammonia recovery from off-gasses has large potential, but other methods are needed to treat ammonia in the discharge water to make it economically feasible. Further research can elaborate on alternatives for ammonia treatment in discharge water. Examples include the use of lime (CaO)\cite{AdPhysicochem2006}, increasing the stripping temperature\cite{Kim2013}, and leaching in sulfuric acid (\ce{H2SO4})\cite{EICforEngin2017}. However, this does not solve the scaling problem in the process. Therefore, further research should shine a light on the reduction of carbon dioxide that enters the chemical plant system. Examples proposed in this research, include condensing ammonia from the calciner off-gas stream. Multiple studies \cite{Xu1999}\cite{Mirl2020} show that, the condensing recovery is more effective for ammonia than carbon dioxide. Furthermore, this research also gives an economically feasible example of using an alternative calcination process without natural gas.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-11-27","","","","","European Mining, Minerals and Environmental Programme",""

One approach of visual prostheses is intracortical stimulation, where electrodes penetrating the visual cortex are used to create small light dots in the patients visual field. Said therapy requires an implantable neurostimulator that is able to stimulate more than 1000 micro-electrodes for sufficient resolution. Conventional stimulation methods are not suitable for this purpose as they are inefficient in multi-channel stimulation or lack control of injected charge. In this thesis a novel stimulation method is presented based on dynamic duty cycle control of ultrahigh frequency (UHF) pulses. The duty cycle is charge-controlled using a monostable multivibrator control loop. With this novel topology, the injected charge of a stimulation pulse is controlled even when electrode impedance changes. The presented system uses spatio-temporal stimulation to share the stimulator circuit among multiple output channels. Another contribution of this work is the implementation of an active charge balancing method. This method monitors the residual voltage at the electrode-tissue interface in between UHF pulses and stops stimulation when this voltage is brought back close to zero. The charge balancing circuit consists of a single comparator connected to the stimulation path. Overall, the proposed stimulator circuit consists of two comparators, one capacitor, three logic gates, and switches. The circuit is easily scalable depending on the stimulation parameters, requiring only two switches per output electrode. For validation purposes, the circuit has been implemented on a printed circuit board (PCB). The PCB has 8 output pins and operates up to 15V. Using a linear model of the electrode tissue interface, charge injection accuracy of the circuit was measured. The charge injected during a single UHF pulse is scalable with C*V. The implemented PCB uses a capacitor value of C=400pF, while the voltage V is scaled from 62.5mV to 1.25V such that the stimulation intensity ranges from 25pC to 500pC perUHF pulse. Furthermore, the charge balancing method was verified with the linear tissue model. The proposed method successfully reduced the residual voltage to 3.1mV, well within the safety limit of50mV. Measurements on a micro-electrode array confirmed functionality of the circuit for non-linear loads. Finally, the work presents an important insight regarding the development of power efficient neurostimulators. It has been shown that it is important to consider not only power efficiency of the circuit but also the energy efficiency of the stimulation waveform to decrease the power consumption of the system.","bioelectronics; neurostimulator; visual prosthesis; safety; electrical stimulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-27","","","","","",""

However, it is less energy efficient compared to Nyquist Rate ADCs. The growing demand for portable and wearable devices poses a more stringent power-efficient requirement on the audio system, and the traditional ADCs architecture is hard to achieve both high linearity and high energy efficiency. Zoom ADC is a proven energy-efficient hybrid structure for high-resolution and high-linearity applications. It consists of a front-end successive approximation register (SAR) ADC as a coarse stage and ΔΣ modulator backend to take advantage of the energy efficiency of a SAR ADC and the high resolution of a ΔΣ. However, the conventional zoom ADC suffers from distortion due to the input-correlated quantization error from the coarse stage. The tonal behavior (also known as “fuzz”) degrades overall linearity. This thesis describes a low cost, calibration-free method to suppress the fuzz in the zoom ADC. It improves the SNDR by introducing a 1st order fully passive noise shaper with a dithering to the coarse SAR ADC, which reduces the correlation of its quantization error with the input. A prototype ADC has been implemented in standard 160 nm CMOS process. It achieves 104.4dB peak SNR, 103.8 dB SNDR and 106.5 dB dynamic range (DR) in the audio band (20Hz~20kHz) at an oversampling ratio (OSR) of 62.5.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2020","The circular economy is an economic system that aims to replace the linear economy and the accompanying take-make-dispose mindset. It is an economic system that decouples economic growth from finite resource consumption. The Sustainable Finance Lab (SFL) identified two requirements for a high state of circularity. 1) Products are serviced instead of sold and 2) the entire life-cycle of products must be considered. As a solution, the SFL came up with the idea of collective servitization (CS). It meets the previous requirements by aligning the incentives of all the value chain participants involved in a product-service system by compensating each of them as long as the product is in working condition. However, the SFL predicted four implementation barriers related to CS. The SFL expects 1) a need to share innovation costs, 2) high administration costs, 3) increasingly complex devision of ownership, and 4) a need to directly handle micro-transactions. To help overcome CS challenges, the SFL conceptualized the Circular Service (CiSe) platform. It is an administration tool for collectively serviced pay-per-access and pay-per-use products. It aims to use the novel technologies blockchain, cryptocurrency, and smart contracts to overcome these challenges. 1) The CiSe platform reduces transaction costs by automatically handling product use and access payments without an intermediary. 2) The CiSe platform stores the transactions of use and access in a distributed database that is publicly accessible. By viewing all the payments and costs, the SFL expects that companies can better decide on responsibilities. At last, 3) micro-transactions are made possible with the Micro-Euro cryptocurrency. <br/><br/>From an Industrial Ecology (IE) perspective, the use of blockchain technology is fascinating. IE is a scientific discipline that takes a systemic approach to sustainability problems. Engineering, environmental, and social perspectives are crucial for the successful and sustainable implementation of new technologies. Blockchain technology has a wide range of technical applications. The question is if these technologies are effective in overcoming CS. In order to get initial insights into the effectiveness of blockchain technology in implementing collective servitization, this master thesis focuses on the company Bundles and their combined pay-per-access and pay-per-use washing machines. The following research question will be answered: “How effective could the Circular Service platform implement collectively serviced Bundles washing machines?” To address this question this thesis used a threefold structure. It consisted of a literature study that identified 51 blockchain designs in the literature and multiple papers oriented on both blockchain and the circular economy and blockchain and product-service systems. These provided insights into the problems and need for CS, insights into the solutions of the CiSe platform and their technical viability, as well as insights into additional challenges for the CiSe platform. Moreover, a business analysis identified 33 blockchain companies. These provided more insights into the technical viability of the CiSe platform. Finally, a case study explored collectively serviced Bundles washing machines on the CiSe platform. The primary stakeholder Miele and Vonk en Co were included in the CS business model. The case study helped identify additional opportunties and challenges of CS and the CiSe platform. The results of this study are not straightforward and mainly raise questions for additional research. This is largely because of the conceptual nature of CS and the CiSe platform, the majority of researched papers being conceptual, the majority of researched companies being in the experimental phase, and the explorative nature of the case study. There are some promising results and some challenges related to the effectiveness of the CiSe paltform. There is some economic potential by including Bundles, Miele, and Vonk en Co in a collectively serviced business model. This is for three reasons. Firstly, the transactional relationship and the cost for added value dissapear between each of the members in the collective servitization business model. Secondly, the CiSe platform further reduces the administration cost related to distributing revenue. Finally, by spreading the initial investments amongst multiple stakeholders the barrier for entry for Miele and Vonk en Co can become lower. However, It is improbable that a collectively serviced Bundles washing machine with Miele and Vonk en Co will happen. It is for four reasons. Firstly, Bundles will lose their role as risk-taker. Moreover, Bundles does not provide any additional value. Furthermore, Miele has the resources available to do the washing machine service themselves. Finally, Miele and Vonk en Co currently have a profitable collaboration with Bundles without long-term risks. Additional challenges are related to the use of blockchain technology. First of all, there is a problem with the flexibility of blockchain systems. Once live, blockchain systems and their smart contracts can not be altered. It can become problematic with a collectively serviced washing machine that is intended to be long-term. Moreover, the vulnerability of the system moves to the sensors. Due to the autonomous and automatic nature of the CiSe platform, a faulty or hacked sensor can wrongfully activate transactions. Furthermore, blockchain systems can generally only handle low transaction volumes. The CiSe platform’s scale is dependent on the number of products and the types of products that are going to be serviced. The main limitation of this study is in its conceptual and explorative nature. It is due to four reasons. Firstly, there is no support of the definition of CS in literature. Secondly, no direct comparison could be found of the CiSe platform concept either. Moreover, the results from the two systemic literature reviews were mainly conceptual papers. Finally, the case study is explorative. All in all, this means that these results are not final. They are indicative and more research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of the CiSe platform in overcoming CS barriers. To move the development of the CiSe platform forward, it is essential that the need for and problems of CS are researched more thoroughly. The case study revealed that CS is not for every value chain. If there is no need for CS, then the CiSe platform is irrelevant. If the CiSe platform does not address the right barriers of CS, the same fate awaits. It is advised to prioritize research into CS before developing the CiSe platform further.","Circular economy; Blockchain; Servitization; Product-service-system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

The practice has since changed to include a much wider number of forest types and aims. In recent years, forestation efforts are increasingly focused on forest ecosystem generation. These forest ecosystems can have a wide variety of goals, including Climate Adaptation and Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction. Forest ecosystems can help in Disaster Risk Reduction in two ways; they can decrease exposure to disasters (for example through increasing soil stability and decreasing landslides) as well as increase community resilience (for example through diversifying the income of local communities). These forest ecosystems require a different project approach than forest plantations as they need to be sustained on a much longer time-scale and their success often depends on interaction with the surrounding communities. One part of the planning- and decision-making process of forestation projects is spatial analysis. Large scale spatial analysis used in the initial phases of forestation projects to identify suitable areas for forestation. Most current analyses focus on bio-physical factors for single tree species. However, forest ecosystems projects include a wider variety of species and social factors are crucial in their success. Therefore, this research aims to understand the possibility of using socio-economic factors as spatial indicators in the planning of forest ecosystem projects. In order to understand the possibility of using different indicators for forest ecosystem suitability analysis, a number of bio-physical and socio-economic indicators are compared to forestation success for existing forestation projects in Ethiopia. Forestation projects are assessed from 5 different organizations with a total of 12 projects and 67 forestation sites. A literature review is conducted to understand factors influencing forestation success. From all identified factors influencing forestation success, 11 indicators are chosen based on data availability and limiting overlap in effects. Despite its lack of representation of social and economic success, vegetation growth, using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index or NDVI is identified as the most reliable way to determine forestation success because of the availability of consistent data for all projects. The suitability indicators selected are: soil texture, drainage, pH of soil, minimum monthly rain, solar radiation, elevation, distance to closest road, population, GDP, land cover and district. The forestation sites show a minimal average increase in NDVI. However, it is also found that areas without forestation projects with similar environmental and social factors show an increase in NDVI as well. When the success indicators of the reference sites are compared to the increase in NDVI, we see that the suitability indicators do not show a significant relationship with the NDVI increase over active project years. The study shows the importance of standardized monitoring of forestation projects in order to gather not only bio-physical improvement but also social success, especially for projects with a social purpose. The use of satellite imagery to make forestation success assessments do not only give an incomplete understanding of the forestation project, the data availability in temporal and spatial scale and resolution limit the assessment. Additionally, the study shows the difficulty in comparing varying project types with different aims, timespans and sizes. More research is needed that includes a larger number of forestation projects that have similar goals, methods, timespan and sizes, as well as a standardized reporting of social and environmental success. This could be achieved by combining data from several similar countries and by working closely together with forestation organizations that have standardized monitoring of their projects on both social and environmental success.","Forest Ecosystem; Spatial analysis; Forestation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","","10.581110, 37.634267"

These novel services are known as mission-critical services which generally have tight latency and jitter restrictions. Some examples of this type of service are could gaming, cloud-connected virtual reality, or remote surgery. To avoid exceeding the tight tolerances set by these services, Network Functions (NFs) that are necessary for the network connection (e.g. firewalls), should benefit from both hardware acceleration for increased performance and scaling to reduce the hardware footprint and introduce more network flexibility. In this thesis, a novel, horizontal scaling solution for Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) was designed and implemented in P4. In particular, we propose a novel elastic scaling solution for hardware-accelerated switches. Our solution consists of three parts: flow migration, monitoring, and decision-making. Flow migration, the part where flows are migrated to another switch, is performed in three phases. First, the migration source migrates the state to the migration destination. Then, the migration source updates the NF states as they change on the migration source. When the controller completes its tasks, flow packets are forwarded to the migration destination and the controller can divert the traffic to the migration destination directly. Our decision-making algorithm uses VNF, switch, and individual flow usage statistics to decide where to scale to and if applicable where to place a new NF instance. To reduce the monitoring overhead, only usage statistics for high-rate flows are gathered and overloads are detected within the switch. Our decision-making algorithm is able to spawn new NF instances when an overload occurs or redistribute load among already existing NF instances to optimize NF resource usage. Results show that our algorithm reduces migration times by 0.52s on average while the average latency observed by the flow is reduced by approximately 5ms on average when compared to current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our solution does not overflow the controller as NF states are communicated directly between switches which are equipped with links that are optimized for high data volumes.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","With the growth of the aviation industry, aircraft designers are pressured for the development of sustainable solutions able to deal with the increase in traffic as well as congested airports. Turnaround time becomes an increasingly important factor contributing to the overall success of an aircraft design. A shorter turnaround time may allow airlines greater utilization of their fleet, particularly those that operate primarily short/medium haul flights. This would allow for a decrease in operational costs and, by accommodating more traffic, an increase in revenues. Furthermore, airlines able to operate with shorter turnaround times are more attractive for airports, allowing them to increase throughput and combat airport congestion. This, in turn, may allow airlines to negotiate better airport fees, decreasing their direct operation costs. With the powerful impact that the uncontrollable fuel price has on airlines' costs, maximizing revenues and minimizing other operational costs is crucial for airline's survival. Researchers and manufacturers are looking into novel aircraft designs for integrated solutions: aircraft capable of providing a more efficient form of flying, while also tackling the aforementioned problems related traffic growth, airport congestion and airline costs. Appropriate tools and methods are necessary to be able to quantify the effects of design choices over the complete aircraft performance; which must also include on ground operations, measured with turnaround time. Furthermore, these tools and methods must be applicable to unconventional designs and suitable to early design phases, such that novel configurations can also be analysed. This paper presents procedures and tools to assess the turnaround performance of an aircraft at a conceptual design level. Literature shows that boarding is always on the critical path of aircraft turnaround; therefore, for simplicity reasons, on ground operational performance is condensed to boarding performance. Based on previous work performed by the Flight Performance research group at TU Delft, an automatic fuselage and cabin model generator is developed. Furthermore, using NetLogo, an agent-based boarding simulation tool is developed to estimate the boarding time associated to a given cabin design. Both tools are validated, then coupled to facilitate and automate fuselage design studies focused on boarding performance. Parametric studies are run to determine the effect of fuselage design choices on boarding performance. Focus is placed on features that are considered strong determinants of boarding performance, such as doors (number, location and width), aisles (number and width) and overhead stowage compartments (capacity and occupancy). Aisle width results show that overtaking is only possible in aisles wider than 65cm and that, due to the non-linear distribution of aisle blockage dimensions, there are cases in which increasing aisle width does not provide any boarding benefits (between 85cm and 90cm for instance). A strong sensitivity of boarding performance to hand luggage stowage compartments capacity and occupancy is observed. Multidisciplinary effects, such as structural weight penalties and aerodynamic drag penalties, induced by the fuselage design choices are assessed qualitatively. With the exception of structural effects of doors (number, size and location), that are estimated using an empirical method developed by Torenbeek. The tools are applied to two use cases: a Prandtl plane configuration from the project PARSIFAL and a flying wing configuration called Flying V. The Prandtl plane is designed with a non-circular fuselage cross section, implements a 70cm-wide twin aisle cabin configuration, with up to three doors used for boarding. This allows it to carry 308 passengers (comparable to a standard twin aisle aircraft such as the A330-200) within a 44m fuselage (comparable to a standard single aisle aircraft such as the B737-800). From the point of view of boarding, it is shown to perform better than both a conventional twin aisle with equal capacity and a conventional single aisle aircraft of equal length. To avoid structural weight penalties caused by the non-circular fuselage, an alternative circular fuselage design is examined. Door features (i.e. 1.6m wide doors that allow two simultaneous entry queues) are used to compensate for the narrower (48cm) twin aisle configuration. Boarding performance is comparable to the original Prandtl plane. Moreover, a circular fuselage allows for larger overhead stowage compartments, which further improves the boarding performance of the circular Prandtl plane. Also the Flying V, thanks to its double twin-aisle configuration, performs 27-30% better than its conventional counterpart (the Airbus A350). The tools developed are shown to be sufficiently flexible and thus enable boarding studies on novel aircraft configurations at a conceptual level, where early evaluation of their performance is necessary to derisk their development process. Further development of the tools is recommended for future research projects, to increase their applicability to unconventional configurations (such as a blended wing-body, or a multi deck fuselage) and to extend to other activities in the turnaround process besides boarding (such as de-boarding). Finally, it is suggested that some of the features of the boarding tool, such as the determination of stowing time, be studied in more detail, because they have a strong effect on boarding time, yet their validation is sub-optimal due to the shortage of empirical data describing the phenomena.","KBE; ABM; Fuselage design; Boarding; Unconventional configurations; Novel configurations; PrandtlPlane; Flying V; Modelling; ParaPy; TAT; PARSIFAL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","PARSIFAL",""

It plays a major role in the transition towards green energy. It is estimated that the installed capacity of wind energy will cover more than 6 % of total global electricity demand by the end of 2019. As the demand grows the requirement for bigger wind turbine also grows. Each year larger wind turbine blades are being manufactured to satisfy the growing demand, resulting in high manufacturing cost and operation and maintenance cost. The main reasons for wind turbine blade failures are poor design, material failure, power regulator failure, extreme load buckling, lightning strikes, foreign object damage and human errors. The failure rate of the wind turbine blade is around 7 % compared to other components of wind turbine. So, an effective and proactive monitoring system for the wind turbine blades becomes necessary due to the large downtime associated with failure and high replacement cost. The main objective of this thesis is to use smeared crack modelling and integrating it with FEM tools (ANSYS 18.2) to identify the damage in the wind turbine blade. The concept that the modal parameters such as natural frequency, mode shape and damping will be affected when a structure is damaged, is used to identify and localize the damaged elements. First, spar cap - shear web assembly is modelled as simple ""I"" beam in ANSYS. The dimension of the blade is measured from the ""NedWind 40 turbine"" provided by LM Wind Power. The structure has been modelled using composite materials. The spar cap fibres are laid at 0 ̊ and the fibres of face sheet are laid at ± 45 ̊. One end of the structure is fixed to simulate the actual working conditions. Similarly, the material property of all parts was chosen to represent the actual wind turbine blade. Second, damage is introduced into the structure in the form of microscopic damping into the material property. To incorporate damping into the structure, the loss factor obtained from experiment is used. The damage modelling is done for different severity at different locations of the modelled structure. Third, the eigen value and eigen vector for different microscopic damping coefficient is extracted. Modal damping of the structure is calculated using the extracted eigen value. And eigen vector is used to calculate the phase angle of each elements. The phase angle of each element is plotted to localize the damaged elements. The results show that this method is suitable for identifying defects near the fixed end and in the midsection of a wind turbine blade. Also,1st flap wise and edge wise bending frequencies are suitable for identifying the defects near the fixed end and 2nd flap wise bending frequency is suitable for identifying the defect near the mid area.","damage detection; Composite Material; Finite Element Analysis; Spar Cap - Shear Web assembly","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

However, this does not often lead to a homogeneously mixed fluid, but rather leads to regions of higher concentrations next to regions with significantly lower concentrations. This can be characterized by dividing the concentration field in a turbulent flow into a few regions that have almost the same concentration: Uniform Concentration Zones. How these Uniform Concentration Zones are organized is yet unclear, but a possible candidate in the velocity field is the use of Lagrangian Coherent Structures. These structures are, in principle, transfer barriers in the flow and defined as local maxima of the Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), which is a measure of exponential fluid-separation over time. In order to successfully apply the concept of Lagrangian Coherent Structures in an experiment, turbulent structures should remain in focus long enough to measure the exponential separation of fluid parcels. As almost all fully developed turbulence comes with a mean flow, the observation time in an Eulerian field-of-view is too short. Therefore an experiment was designed to move the observation equipment with the mean flow. With this experimental setup, the concentration field and the velocity field are measured simultaneously via respectively LIF and PIV. Comparing the Uniform Concentration Zones with both the forward and backward time FTLE-field, shows that there is not much correlation between the concentration field and the forward time FTLE. However, local maxima of the backward time FTLE seem to overlap often with boundaries between Uniform Concentration Zones.","mixing; Lagrangian Coherent Structures; Lyapunov exponents; turbulence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The failures originate from the phases of design, manufacturing, installation and operations. Joint industry collaborations such as the Cable Lifetime Monitoring project that form the background for this thesis, are aimed at developing knowledge of these failures. The origination of failures from the installation phase of power cables is of particular interest. In order to do so, a model has to be developed first to understand the processes involved in an installation plan, as well as their time and resource costs. Logistics and planning tools such as ECN Install are utilized for this purpose and provide the medium for capturing the installation processes for submarine power cables. This thesis aims to describe the installation of power cables using a discrete event simulation based logistics model such as ECN Install. The first part of the thesis focuses on a literature review to categorize all aspects of power cable installation. Here the stages of a project, the installation processes, assets, methods and influencing weather parameters are identified. From this literature review it is found that the most important stage of a power cable installation project is the Marine Installation Program. The decisions leading to the development of a Marine Installation plan are mapped for modelling. The second part of the thesis deals with applying the knowledge acquired into the logistics model. Here, the model assumptions are set in order to create an accurate depiction of the installation processes. The third part of the thesis investigates the influence of input uncertainties on the model as a means to understand the relationship between the different aspects of a power cable installation project to its Marine Installation Program.

This paper aims to show how to take into account some of these uncertainties into fender design using a reliability-based approach. The influence of multiple fenders contact and multivariate dependence between vessel size, berthing velocity, and berthing angle on the failure probability of a fender system was analysed. These correlations were modelled using a Vine-Copula, while the contribution of multiple fenders contact was investigated by performing simulation. Furthermore, the failure probability of the fender system was determined using the First Order Reliability Method and Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that uncertainty in berthing velocity, the effect of multiple fenders contact, and dependence between design variables largely influence the reliability of a fender system. It is highly recommended to incorporate all these aspects into the design approach to accomplish a cost-effective design solution. The key findings of this study can be used to update the existing design approach of fender systems and help to interpret the berthing records collected by Port Authorities.","Fender systems; reliability analysis; Probabilistic design; Partial safety factor; Vine-Copula; First order reliability method; Berthing Velocity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","51.9595317, 3.985464"

(mentor); Zitman, T.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Estuaries have always been important for mankind and therefore it is essential to have a good understanding of the flow and sediment dynamics there. The goal of this thesis is twofold. One objective is to use an existing model to gain a more thorough understanding of the flow dynamics in an estuary. The second objective is to extend the model such that it can also compute the suspended sediment concentration in a cross-section. The equations governing the flow dynamics are the shallow water equations. The advection-diffusion equation governs the sediment dynamics. To compute the flow and suspended sediment concentration in a cross-section, conditions are assumed to be uniform in the along-channel direction. To solve the equations a coordinate transformation is applied first. After the transformation, the cross-section of the channel is represented in the computational domain by a rectangle. In the vertical direction, an eigenfunction expansion is used with eigenfunctions derived from a special case of the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem. In the horizontal direction, derivatives are approximated with a central finite difference scheme. In the frequency domain, variables are expressed as the sum of tidal components. The Galerkin method is applied in both the vertical direction and the frequency domain to optimise the weight functions for every location along the transect. The system obtained with the Galerkin method is solved using Newton-Raphson iterations and an LU-decomposition. To find the distribution of the erosion coefficient corresponding to a morphodynamic equilibrium, a time integration method is used. The effect of several parameters on the advective contribution to the cross-channel flow is systematically investigated. The results show that the steepness of the bottom slope affects the magnitude of the advective contribution to the residual lateral flow. For a steep bottom slope the contribution is large and for a gradual bottom slope the contribution is small. The curvature of the channel strongly affects the total cross-channel flow, depending on the magnitude of the radius of curvature, but hardly affects the flow caused by advection. The lateral density gradient can largely affect the \mbox{cross-channel} flow. Especially, the amplitude of the M$_2$ tidal component of the density gradient affects the advective contribution to the flow. Both the magnitude and characteristics of the advective contribution change when the amplitude of the M$_2$ tidal component of the density gradient is varied. The phase of the M$_2$ tidal component of the density gradient hardly affects the cross-channel flow and advective contribution of the flow. Measurement data of a cross-section of the Ems is compared with a simulation of this situation. The magnitude of the lateral flow is similar for the measurements and model results but there is a difference in the direction of the flow in the upper part of the water column. This deviation could be caused by the description of the free surface. In the measurements there is a time-varying thickness of the water column whereas the rigid lid assumption is applied in the model. However, other differences between the simulation and the actual situation could have contributed to a deviation between the measurements and model results as well. The results for the sediment module show that the model works as expected for a prescribed erosion coefficient and for computing the erosion coefficient in morphodynamic equilibrium for situations with only diffusive transport. For simple situations the analytical solution is approximated and for more complicated situations the results agree with the physical intuition. The main recommendation for further research is to investigate how the model can be extended such that it is also possible to compute the erosion coefficient in morphodynamic equilibrium for situations with both advective and diffusive sediment transport.","Mathematical modelling; Estuaries; Water motion; Sediment dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Computational Science and Engineering","",""

However, due to a lack of knowledge on the design of HSR specific line configurations and the prioritisation of national and railway company interests, no real European HSR network has been realised yet. Together, these lead to a sub-optimal performance from a user, operator and societal perspective. This research is the first attempt to apply the more frequently used ‘Transit Network Design and Frequency Setting Problem’ (TNDFSP) in an HSR setting, which searches the ideal set of lines and associated frequencies in a given network. To do so, this study developed a novel HSR generic model and solution algorithm, which were then parameterised for the European case. By benchmarking the current situation; analysing the relative importance of vehicle, passenger path and line design variables; evaluating pricing and governance strategies; and finally proposing improved settings; it was possible to assess the impacts of improved design. The experiments showed that benefits for all stakeholders could be simultaneously enhanced when implementing a centralised governance and internalisation of external costs. This allowed the HSR market share to evolve from 14.7% to 29.9%, whilst also improving the societal cost-benefit ratio by 20.0%. The governmental investment which is required to fill the gap from the most economical to the most extensive solution equals AC 2.2 billion per year, but also provides a positive rate of return of 1.8 for the combined user and societal benefits. Additionally, the model demonstrated the necessity of spilling unprofitable passengers and the importance of improved cooperation. These followed from the strong network integration with overlapping and border crossing lines of substantial lengths, the contradiction between national and international interests and the high number of critical infrastructural elements. All in all, this study demonstrated the possibility of using the TNDFSP in an HSR setting, which opens ways for further understanding of HSR network design. For this specific research, it allowed the identification of substantial opportunities for mobility and sustainability. These can be reached by improved design choices, internalisation of external costs and by relaxation of the desires for a competitive railway market and national sovereignty; all newly underpinned arguments for the discussion on how to design a successful (European) HSR system. Future research could greatly contribute by incorporating the construction of infrastructure, including timetabling or operational aspects, assessing different case studies in size and geography or introducing new technologies.","High-Speed Rail; Europe; Network Design; Line Configurations; TNDFSP; Pricing; Governance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

A better understanding on the mechanism and transformation kinetics of bainite are necessary in order to improve the performance of the bainitic steel further. This research mainly studies the kinetics of bainitic transformation during isothermal treatments. The chemical composition, in particular silicon (Si), affects the transformation kinetics of bainite, and therefore the fractions of retained austenite and bainitic ferrite. The current research focuses on the bainite transformation kinetics during isothermal heat treatment. Steel specimens are austempered at 250°C, 300°C and 350°C and held for 30, 60 and120 minutes, respectively. The steel in the current research has the alloy composition of Fe-0.61C-1.62Si-0.85Mn-0.32Cr (wt.%). Microstructures observed using optical micrographs consist of bainite and retained austenite after the austempering process. Quantitative measurements of the retained austenite (RA) fraction are performed by magnetization technique. The results show that, at austempering temperatures of 250°C and 300°C, the fraction of retained austenite decreases gradually with increasing holding times and increases with increasing austempering temperatures. However, a different affect is observed in the steel austempered at 350°C for 30minutes. The fraction of retained austenite increases from 30 to 60 minutes and subsequently decreases from 60 to 120 minutes. In order to study the effect of retained austenite on hardness resulting in decrease in overall hardness with increasing austempering temperatures and increases with increasing hold duration. The JMAK model has been fitted to the observed fraction of austenite as function of time and temperature, which results in the parameters such as the rate constant and Avrami exponent. The fitted results suggest a one-dimensional grain growth of the bainite in this steel. The predictions from a thermodynamic analysis using the para-equilibrium model and the T0-temperature are compared to the experimentally observed fractions of RA, which results in obtaining higher fractions than obtained experimentally. This thermodynamic analysis predicts an increase in the fraction of remaining austenite with increasing austempering temperature as observed experimentally in most cases. The thermodynamic study on the effect of Si concentration (1.62 wt.%)results shows that there is insufficient Si present in the steel to hinder the formation of cementite.","Austempering; Bainitic ferrite; Retained austenite; Magnetization technique; Mechanical properties; Kinetics of bainitic transformation; JMAK model; Para-equilibrium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","Materials in Engineering Applications",""

In highly populated areas, such as the Netherlands, such a development will lead to a dense grid of neighbouring licenses. In such a situation a new project requires careful design and planning as the available subsurface space can become scarce, leading to the potential thermal interference with the neighbouring licenses and competing usage of the resources. Interference can cause the reduction of lifetime, produced energy, and the profitability of neighbouring projects. Therefore, it becomes important to consider the thermal interference while designing these systems in such dense areas to be able to obtain maximum energy and profit without hindering neighbours. This research project assesses the question of thermal interferences in neighbouring geothermal systems using a numerical simulation approach regarding what parameters are ideal for optimisation in neighbouring systems and what parameters should be monitored. To generate a numerical model capable of describing and predicting the effect of thermal interference the software package COMSOL Multiphysics 5.4 was used. The physics of fluid flow and heat transfer in porous media is applied to the reservoir model, and the finite element method is used to approximate the solution of these equations. Sensitivity analyses are performed on all input parameters as a post-processed simulation to control their influence on the output performance. The input parameters are divided into two categories; first, operational-controlled parameters: start time, injection temperature, injection/production flow rate, well spacing, well distance to the license border, and second, natural-controlled parameters including permeability and its anisotropy as kx/ky ratio. At the end of the parametric sensitivity analysis, an economic model is used as an instrument to evaluate how these input parameters can affect the long-term project feasibility. In this study, we present the results of global comparisons between each parameter while incorporating all measurement control (lifetime, cumulative energy and NPV). The results from the 3D qualification, the correlation between measurement controls and the reference base case study are used as background for this comparison. Our results show that the injection temperature and well spacing are ideal designed parameters to optimise profitability because the negative effect on the neighbour is only 1% for every 10°C reduction injection temperature and increasing 300 m of well spacing. On the other hand, injection / production flow rate is the most influential parameter that must be monitored in neighbouring production areas.","Thermal interference; geothermal doublet; Geothermal neighbouring license; production control; heat interference","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

To account for the attenuating nature of ultrasound echo signals, a so-called time gain compensation (TGC) circuit is required. By increasing the gain over time, the output dynamic range is decreased, while the switching artifacts are suppressed by the continuous gain control.<br/>The proposed work combines the LNA structure with TGC functionality. This is done, such that the first component in the ultrasound receive chain does not need to be able to handle the full dynamic range of the input signal. The goal is to reduce die area and power consumption costs compared to systems that utilize separate LNAs and TGCs. The combined TGC-LNA consists of a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) with an exponentially-varying feedback resistance. As the feedback network and feed-forward path are separately designed, the design of the TGC functionality and low noise functionality can for a large part be independently designed. The TGC functionality is implemented by an exponentially-varying feedback resistance. This is achieved by means of implementing triode transistors as voltage-controlled resistors. Three branches with differently sized triode devices are required to obtain the full gain range of 40 dB. A two-stage telescopic amplifier realizes the loop amplifier. The bias current of the first stage is a linear function of the total feedback resistance to create a constant unity-gain bandwidth in a power efficient method. Realized in 0.180 μm BCDMOS technology, the combined TGC-LNA amplifies the signals from a Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasound Transducer (CMUT) with a center frequency of 7.5 MHz. The total achieved gain range is 40 dB where the gain varies during a receive period of 100 μs. During the receive period the total harmonic distortion remains below -44 dB and the noise floor is 1.12 pA/√(Hz) at the highest gain setting. Drawing 5.5 mW from a 1.8 V supply and requiring approximately 0.01 mm<sup>2</sup> die area, the proposed TGC-LNA provides a new method for reducing power consumption and area costs for miniature ultrasound applications.","Ultrasound imaging; transimpedance amplifier; time-gain compensation; triode transistors; continuous gain control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

The coupling between the upper ocean and the atmosphere is very complicated with defied theoretical understanding, while it is essential for climate studies, weather prediction, and marine ecosystems. With the advent of spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems, surface signatures of ocean and atmospheric processes have been revealed. As winds blowing over the ocean excite the wind waves, all undulations of the ocean surface are assumed as waves in this study. The primary sources for ocean surface signatures in SAR images are waves that are created by the exertion of the local wind stress. Wind waves cause changes in the backscattered power due to three mechanisms: specular reflections, Bragg scattering, and a contribution from wave breaking. A statistical multi-static normalized radar cross-section (NRCS) background model in terms of the directional wave spectrum is developed, considering both Bragg and non-Bragg mechanisms for various polarization states. As the qualitative comparison between optical and SAR data reveals a significant correlation in sea surface signatures, a synthetic attempt is made to estimate the SAR signals from optical signatures. This is realized with the transformation of the wave spectrum in a nonuniform medium, as a consequence of surface currents, and varying near-surface wind fields. A comparison between modeled NRCS and observations is presented. This modulated NRCS model advances the quantitative interpretation of the upper ocean dynamics from satellite measurements.","Ocean; SAR; Remote Sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) power systems use organic fluids and low-grade heat sources to accomplish this. Lack of preliminary loss models for turbomachines system components, such as turbine and compressor blades, operating in organic fluids prevents the estimation of losses at the preliminary design phase. The design procedure of ORC power system components relies on correlations developed for gas turbines operating with air or steam. The physics-based loss model of Denton is based on assumptions and empirical data to estimate losses. One drawback of this model is the constant dissipation coefficient (C_{d, blade}) value of 0.002. The estimation of C_{d, blade} requires parameters of the boundary layer that are not available at the preliminary design phase. There is thus a requirement for a model to estimate C_{d, blade} as a function of preliminary design parameters such as duty coefficients, volumetric expansion ratio, fluid, operating thermodynamic conditions and blade geometrical parameters. The objective of the present work is to develop a loss model capable of predicting C$_{d, blade}$ based on a database of results from numerical Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equation simulations for 2D axial stator blades. The developed model is a machine learnt model that is then implemented in an in-house meanline design loss estimation tool, TurboSim, to estimate changes from the current implementation in profile losses and stage efficiency losses. Results from a parametric analysis show that the duty coefficients and working fluid influence on C_{d, blade} the most. The implementation of the machine-learnt model in TurboSim shows that using a constant C_{d, blade} = 0.002 leads to a slight underestimation of the profile loss for all cases except complex molecules operating close to the critical conditions. Although the lack of validation data prevents the estimation of the accuracy of the findings, the results highlight two aspects. First, the need to change the existing assumption of C_{d,blade} = 0.002 for ORC applications. Second, the potential application of data-driven models for loss estimation.","Turbomachinery; Machine Learning; Axial stator; SU2; CFD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

They are mainly sourced by the Silurian -- Lower Devonian Fegaguira formation and its Hot Shale member. Late Paleozoic exhumation has eroded part of the Palaeozoic package, removing the Early Devonian -- Carboniferous and most of the Permian deposits in the Southern Chotts Basin. This resulted in a diachronous unconformity in the present-day stratigraphy and represents significant uncertainties. This study presents a reconstruction of the tectonic and thermal history of the Southern Chotts Basin and the subsequent impact on source rock thermal maturation, with an emphasis on the Hercynian exhumation. Implications on the petroleum systems in the basin are evaluated by means of a migration study. Investigation of adjacent analogue basins allows estimation of the amount of initially deposited sediment in the Early Devonian -- Permian. Calibration with vitrinite reflectance data minimizes exhumation uncertainties in the basin history and indicates ca. $2300$ m sediment eroded during the Hercynian phase. Subsidence analysis shows similar subsidence patterns throughout the area of interest since the Mesozoic. This argued to use a single set of high and low case initial deposition estimates, calibrated with vitrinite reflectance, in source rock maturation modelling. Source rock maturation modelling in the kitchen area indicates hydrocarbon generation occurs in two phases separated by a phase of stable maturity during Hercynian exhumation. Maturation in the kitchen area is found to currently be in the condensate -- wet gas zone. Migration modelling shows that Paleozoic generation in the northern and northeastern portion of the basin primarily sourced the present-day hydrocarbon discoveries. High capillary entry pressures in overlying Fegaguira shales forced hydrocarbons generated in the Hot Shale member to migrate downward into porous Ordovician units. Subsequently, hydrocarbons laterally migrate up-dip into local traps, where they remain trapped wherever the overlying source rock is preserved during Hercynian exhumation. The Ordovician units acts as a reservoir, and as a carrier bed to source present-day accumulation in the Triassic TAGI unit. A newly identified petroleum system primarily hosts accumulations in lower shoreface Ordovician El Atchane deposits, overlain by the Fegaguira and Hot Shales. Simulated hydrocarbon accumulations and projection of shoreface deposits throughout the area of interest mark a sweet spot area with significant reservoir potential in structural traps. Recommendations are given to further investigate the potential of this system.","Southern Chotts Basin; Source rock maturation; Tectonic history; Fegaguira; Migration modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

This creates a need for new and dedicated equipment, such as endoscopes (for vision), morcellators (for tissue excision), catheters (for tissue biopsy or drug delivery), and many others. Moreover, due to the complex nature and organization of the tissues in the human body, the development of these devices faces challenges, such as sub-optimal behaviours, miniaturization and flexibility. This study aims at developing a steerable instrument for tissue extraction in laparoscopic surgery, inspired by a previously developed prototype from van de Steeg at the TU Delft. This device differs from currently commercialized tissue extraction equipment, which make use of grasping or aspiration technologies, and was inspired by the egg-laying technique of the parasitic wasp. To develop our novel instrument, after an analysis of how steerability may impact the device, we define the design requirements, propose three scaled-up solutions, and mechanically test two of them. Finally, the best-performing design is further developed into a real-scale prototype, and tested by means of two experiments (with gelatine and meat tissue phantoms) to successfully demonstrate the new device. In conclusion, the prototype is able to transport tissue phantoms by means of friction, with a maximum steering angle of 60° and over a total length of 350 mm.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oCb5N_dHL8 Demo of the device","","2022-11-26","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

These photovoltaic systems are affected by a large fraction of reflected irradiance as well as partial shading. In a similar way these issues also have an important effect on bifacial photovoltaic power plants. Irradiance models that are able to take these issues into account are therefore gaining interest. For an accurate economic assessment of a PV system and the calculation of delivered power it is becoming very important to be able to accurately determine the irradiance on a PV system. Therefore there is a rising demand for accurate irradiance models that are able to take into account the effects that arise in complex geometric scenarios. The research in this thesis report aims to develop such a model which is able calculate the irradiance incident on bifacial modules and PV arrays in complex landscapes by combining the concepts of ray tracing and 3D view factors. The implementation of the proposed model decouples the irradiance simulation into independent blocks that allow to efficiently calculate the spectrally-resolved irradiance incident on a PV module. This decoupling makes the proposed model suitable for simulation of tandem devices in the near future. The developed simulation has been experimentally validated using measurements from the PVMD monitoring station and also in comparison with other sophisticated irradiance simulation models. Experiments with a large fraction of specular reflected irradiance showed a good match between the measured and the simulated irradiance. Validation over a longer time period was also performed for 3 different sensors on the PVMD monitoring station roof. The results show an overall low mean bias error between the measured and simulated irradiance for the time period between mid-August 2020 to mid-October 2020. The proposed model is able to model the irradiance impinging on a PV system in a complex urban environment using a decoupled structure and its performance is comparable to sophisticated existing ray tracing models. The performed simulations show a good match with the measurements for different situations. Further improvements are the implementation of higher order reflections, computational optimization and more extensive validation.","backward ray tracing; view factors; cityscape reflections","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This thesis sought to determine the influence of increasing VFA concentrations on performance of aerobic granular sludge plants and key considerations for implementation of pre-fermentation. Two approaches were applied during this thesis: a modelling approach and an experimental approach. A mathematical model was built to show the influence of increasing VFA concentrations and to describe principles observed in practice at aerobic granular sludge plants. The experimental approach consisted of two measuring campaigns. First, experiments were performed to test the necessary operational conditions to ferment influent in a sequencing batch reactor fermenter. Second, a sampling campaign was conducted to determine the conditions which led to fermentation of organic matter in a sand trap on site in Utrecht. The model demonstrated the benefit of combining existing models to describe settling of aerobic granular sludge with size fractionations, plug flow feeding in a settled sludge bed, reactions in the bulk and in granules, and diffusion across granules and into bulk liquid. It was found that increasing acetate concentrations led to longer stability of phosphorus uptake capacity and that SRT control is necessary to maintain long term capacity. Increasing acetate concentrations also led to increases in phosphate release and simultaneous nitrification denitrification. These changes were attributable to differences observed across granules of different sizes: phosphate accumulating organisms dominated larger granules and nitrifiers were more dominant in smaller granules. Model calculations indicate that a maximum granule size exists because the most poly-phosphate storage was not performed by the largest granules. From the experimental work, fermentation was found to be occurring (at rates of 21 mg VFA-COD/L/h ± 15) in a hydraulically underloaded sand trap which led to significant VFA production and subsequent difficulties in fermenting in the controlled SBR reactor (which produced an average of 28 mg VFA-COD/l). More research is needed to determine the optimal operational conditions to ferment influent and to demonstrate the effect on aerobic granular sludge in practice.","volatile fatty acids; aerobic granular sludge; fermentation; modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

This thesis investigates the impact of the leading platform, functionally a breakwater, on the RAOs and response of the platforms behind it in frequency domain. The structures are only hydrodynamically coupled. All models were analysed for head waves only. Variables in model design are investigated using a combination of diffraction software and solving equations of motion in six degrees of freedom for each body. The variables are the gap between the breakwater and the first platform, the width, i.e. side perpendicular to wave direction, of the breakwater and the gap between platforms. Base case dimensions for the platforms and breakwater are chosen based on the natural frequencies and wave transmission coefficients respectively. These choices are made to function well for the wave spectrum at the chosen site. Each case analysed included a breakwater and 10 platforms downstream of it. It was found that he imperfect efficiency of a breakwater means that the first few platforms behind it act as breakwaters too; albeit for much lower wave energies. Increasing the gap between the breakwater and the first platform behind it results in a decrease in RAO of the platforms due to increasing hydrodynamic coupling. The impact on pitch RAOs is greater than the impact on the heave RAOs. Increasing the width of the breakwater results in minimal reduction in RAOs of the platforms behind it at large gap sizes. At small gap sizes, there is an adverse relationship. Hydrodynamic coupling between the platforms can lead to shared natural frequencies within the design frequency range, leading to a large motion response. This can be prevented by changing the gap size and thereby the hydrodynamic coupling and moving the natural frequency outside of the design range. A breakwater and multiple platforms downstream of dimension L=100 m, B=100 m, T=5 m, with a gap of 80 m between the breakwater and platforms and 100 m between the platforms themselves was shown to effectively reduce the motions of the downstream platforms. The first few platforms exhibit higher heave than the other platforms, but similar pitch to the other platforms. Therefore, their use cases in a floating city must be chosen accordingly. The potential negative impacts of hydrodynamic coupling between the platforms means that the platforms must be further apart from each other, resulting in floating cities with a much larger footprint than previously expected. Further research into the motion response for 2D structure layout and different wave directions would be interesting follow-ups to this thesis.","floating; breakwater; Hydrodynamic interaction; floating city; floating breakwater; Coupling; motion; response; Blue21; Frequency domain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

These wearables are able to track the user's vital signs, making them valuable for use in the healthcare industry. Sharing this information with the user's healthcare provider has the potential to improve medical care by reducing medical misinformation. Currently, patients in the Netherlands are able to inspect their medical file at each healthcare provider they are attending, but they are unable to inspect all their medical files at one place. Moreover, they are not able to contribute to their own medical files. In this thesis, we propose the use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as an extension to the Polymorphic Encryption and Pseudonymisation (PEP) framework. PEP facilitates the exchange of medical data between multiple parties in a privacy-preserving manner. However, PEP suffers from collusion and scalability issues. The Distributed Polymorphic Encryption and Pseudonymisation (Dist-PEP) protocol is an improvement to PEP, and mitigates these issues. To make further improvements, the Distributed Polymorphic Access Management (Dist-PACMAN) protocol has been introduced to handle the access management more securely. By introducing TEEs, we make further improvements to the efficiency en scalability of the protocol. The result is a privacy-preserving framework that can be used to share the information gathered by the wearables with the user's healthcare provider securely and more efficiently. Additionally, the user can keep and inspect their own medical file at a cloud provider.","cryptography; security and privacy; e-healthcare","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Breaking water waves still represent a very active research area, as they are involved in a broad spectrum of situations ranging from safety at sea to climate change. The detailed knowledge of the location of the free surface in case of breaking waves or wave impacts could prevent structural damages, increase the efficiency of ship hulls and improve the understanding of gas exchanges between the ocean and the atmosphere. Several state-of-the-art numerical and experimental studies rely on qualitative or intrusive, punctual evaluation of the free surface location. Agreement is found in the relevant literature regarding the need for alternative, quantitative methods in free surface measurements. With the intention of filling this gap, the goal of this thesis consists in the dense, two- and three-dimensional, experimental measurement and reconstruction of the free surface during a large-scale breaking dam flow impact with a vertical wall. The breaking wave event is recreated in a purposely designed acrylic 821 x 130 x 280 mm tank with a sliding gate system and recorded in multiple locations by a pair of identical and synchronized sensors in stereo configuration, and an additional side camera. The experimental campaign of this project consists of 71 runs in which different aspects of the breaking dam event are recorded and different initial conditions and fluid properties are tested. A repeatability analysis of the main flow structures is carried out successfully. A preliminary numerical study supports the comparison between the results obtained with the present setup and data taken from the literature. All the cameras are calibrated with standard procedures and sub-pixel accuracy in the root-mean-square directional reprojection error is achieved. Computer vision techniques are adopted for the quantitative measurements. The two-dimensional free surface profile is obtained applying a combination of motion saliency and contour detection on the frames extracted from the side camera's recordings. The dense point clouds representing the three-dimensional free surface in the impact region are reconstructed from the stereo pairs in the common metric reference system using WASS, an open-source stereo processing pipeline. Dense and quantitative data regarding the location of the free surface in space and time is successfully obtained. Agreement is found comparing the 2D and 3D experimental measurements. Furthermore, the numerical method ComFLOW is used for the numerical simulation of the same breaking dam flow and is validated with the experimental results obtained in this project. The numerical and experimental results agree overall, though differences can be observed in the shape of the free surface during the breaking of the impact wave and the consequent formation of the secondary wave. Additionally, good agreement is found comparing the present results with punctual (numerical and experimental) free surface measurements taken from the relevant literature. The results obtained are unique as similar continuous, quantitative, large-scale, dense and three-dimensional laboratory measurements of breaking waves and wave impacts have not yet been presented in the scientific literature, to the knowledge of the author at the time of writing this thesis. This work is considered to give an important contribution to the future validation of numerical methods for the study of large-scale wave impacts.","Free Surface; Measurement; Experimental; Numerical; 2D; 3D; Breaking Dam; Breaking waves; Computer Vision","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

It was assumed that the supply indicators, reflecting convenience and efficiency of the network, would be needed variably for different socioeconomic groups of Amsterdam.

Besides, the optimum process parameters for improving the quality of the multi-pass multi-layer structure are also the research topic in the thesis. With a decreased heat input, achieved by a higher travel speed or a lower wire feed rate, the cooling rate became higher in the single bead. A larger amount of martensite formed in the bead due to the higher cooling rate, which led to a higher hardness. When the heat input became smaller, less metal was deposited per unit length, which decreased both the width and the height of the bead. Two-layers structures were deposited with the different process parameters, and their qualities were evaluated based on defects, surface roughness, and geometry. Step over increments were set to two-thirds of the width of each bead to improve the surface quality. Wire feed rate 4.5 m/min and travel speed 8 mm/s are the optimized parameters to fabricate the sample with the highest quality. Functional grading was achieved in a component by depositing with different process conditions. In the functionally graded component, the high heat input zone, having a lower hardness, included a large fraction of ferrite and bainite because it was fabricated with higher heat input, resulting in the lower cooling rate. The low heat input zone, having a higher hardness, included a large fraction of martensite due to higher cooling rate, caused by the lower heat input. The microstructure in the low heat input zone was not homogeneous due to the occurrence of the softer white line region, including a large amount of ferrite. The crossing structures fabricated with the interlayer temperature of 100 °C and the interlayer time of 90 sec showed the similar microstructures and hardness result. Due to the impact of a cold substrate and thermal accumulation, the varying microstructure existed from the bottom region to the top region, leading to the hardness level along the building direction became: Bottom region &gt; Middle region ≈ Top region. The higher cooling rate at the centre was observed because there was more area for heat produced at the centre to diffuse.","Wire arc additive manufacturing; Low carbon steel; Microstructure; Mechanical properties","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

Additionally, it will also evaluate whether the delivery of materials through interactive content could exhibit potential benefits for the students, directly reflected on the performance, by encouraging their involvement in the course and promoting active engagement. METHODS: A single blinded pilot study was created on edX Edge, in collaboration with local experts (NSI). It covered topics related to the Patient Monitor in four modules. To validate the hypothesis, the participants were allocated in two groups, related to the delivery method they were exposed to, after a stratified randomisation. Following a Pre-test/Post test design, the performance was measured as the mean of difference between the grades on each test. The corresponding statistical analyses on the independent variables and covariates were performed. The content was validated by experts on the field; and the methodology behind the pilot was approved by the HREC of the Delft University of Technology. RESULTS: The differences in the delivery method, lead to a significant improvement in the performance of 11.9%, compared to regular content. The female students were more prone to this enhancement, as well as the African participants. Besides, these findings suggest that this new delivery method not only boosted the involvement in the course, and was able to take up part of the responsibility placed on the students in online education courses; but it also prevented the reduction in engagement. <br/>The structure, and materials provided were sufficient and successful to teach the key concepts of this module. Moreover, there was no evidence found that suggested the need to segregate the future MOOC in difficulty levels based on the participants previous experience or location. However, since the main challenge faced by the students to finalise a MOOC, is to allocate sufficient time to work on it; it was recommended if the amount of work load per week could be reduced to 6 hours maximum. CONCLUSIONS: The overall analysis presented in this project concluded with a series of key factors, issues, and barriers related to the course’s design, structure, logistics, content and delivery method. The study was not only fairly successful in reaching its targeted audience, but it also built a network of BMETs from diverse backgrounds, locations, and experience, interested in the pilot, and willing to collaborate in the versions to come. <br/>On that account, the BMET MOOC presents itself as a great alternative to prevent the great amount of out-of-service medical equipment in LMICs, and these outcomes can be of great value in eventually transferring and implementing the complete curriculum to an online platform to train these professionals on how to properly use, maintain, and repair medical devices; and therefore, have a direct impact on the maintenance of medical equipment in these countries, to ensure a proper quality of the health care delivery.","Biomedical Equipment Technician; MOOC; Interactive Content; LMIC; edX","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

These marine biofuel demand scenarios were based on the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction targets of the Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO). A multi-objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model was developed which is used to optimize the Well-to-Tank (WtT) phases of each studied scenario. This resulted in an overview of the most feasible use of feedstocks, deployment of new conversion technologies, and trade flows between regions. Additionally, the results provided insight into the costs and emission reduction potential of marine biofuels. By analyzing the results from this study, improved insight into the potential of drop-in biofuels to reaching the proposed emission reduction targets for the maritime sector was developed. A tradeoff between costs and emissions was found to result in potential GHG reductions between 68%-95% compared to Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) for 800-2300 EU/ton. More specifically, 80% GHG reduction compared to HFO can be achieved at fuel costs of between 900-1050 EU/ton over the studied time period. The potential of drop-in biofuels to serve the shipping industry is currently limited due to the availability of oils and fats. Depending on the supply scenario, this entails maximum blending ratios of only 0.6-6%. However, when new conversion technologies are introduced, enough biomass becomes available to serve the shipping industry, even with the increasing use of competing sectors. Hence, the potential of drop-in biofuels to reduce emissions from shipping is significant. Nevertheless, to achieve the proposed GHG emission reduction targets enormous investments in new bio-refineries are required. Therefore, the focus should be on policy mechanisms that, on the one hand, achieve rapid development of new conversion technologies, and on the other hand bridges the price gap with fossil fuels to stimulate the large-scale uptake of these new biofuels.","Drop-in biofuels; Biomass availability; Maritime industry; MILP optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Marine Engineering","MIIP Biofuels",""

These girders potentially have insufficient shear capacity because of the combination of thin webs and insufficient shear reinforcement. Shear failure of these girders should be prevented because they do not warn before the element fails in shear. Shear strengthening using externally bonded CFRP reinforcement seems promising because of low installation costs, negligible increase in weight, no decrease of clear height underneath the bridge and minimising the hinderance. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the feasibility of shear strengthening prestressed concrete I-girders using externally bonded CFRP reinforcement. The shear behaviour of prestressed concrete I-girders strengthened using externally bonded CFRP reinforcement has been investigated with the nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) software DIANA. A three-dimensional finite element model of a 1.0 m high prestressed concrete I-girder with a kinked tendon profile and no shear reinforcement has been made to investigate several parameters and aspects of the CFRP reinforcement. Shear strengthening of prestressed concrete I-girders with vertical CFRP sheets and CFRP anchors is a feasible strengthening method because of the demonstrated potential increase in shear capacity. The externally bonded CFRP reinforcement was especially effective to increase the flexural shear capacity of prestressed concrete I-girders. The numerical analysis showed a promising increase in flexural shear capacity between 40-55% and an increase in ductility of more than 80% compared to the I-girder without CFRP reinforcement","CFRP; DIANA; NLFEA; Prestressed I-girders; Shear strengthening","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The aggressive downscaling of the transistor has led to gigantic improvements in the performance and func- tionality of electronics. As a result, electronics have become a significant part in our daily lives whose absence would be difficult to imagine. Our cars, for example, now consist of many sensors and small computers each controlling certain parts of the car. A downside of the aggressive downscaling of transistor sizes is that it nega- tively impacts the reliability and accelerated ageing, and thus a reduced lifetime, of electronics. Nevertheless, to ensure the reliable operation of electronics, it has therefore become essential to assess the reliability of any of its embedded components accurately. Conventionally, to combat ageing, designers use guardbanded design; adding design margins. These margins, however, lead to a penalty in area, power, and speed. Al- ternatively, one may investigate mitigation schemes that aim at reducing the impact of ageing to extend the reliability and lifetime. These mitigation schemes may lead to a higher performance compared with the con- ventional guardbanded design. This work focuses on an ageing mitigation scheme for SRAMs. SRAMs typi- cally have the highest contribution to the total area of integrated circuits. Therefore, they are highly optimised (i.e. their integration density is the lowest). This also makes them one of the most susceptible components to ageing. Hence, providing appropriate ageing mitigation schemes for SRAMs is essential for the overall reliability of ICs. Whereas prior work has mainly investigated hardware-based ageing mitigation schemes for SRAMs, this thesis investigates the possibility of mitigating the ageing through software. The advantages of this approach include that it does not require circuit changes (and, thus applicable to existing circuits) and it comes at zero area overhead. This study’s proposed software-based scheme is based on periodically running a mitigation routine. This mitigation scheme flips the contents of the memory cells to put the transistors into relaxation from BTI stress, the most crucial ageing mechanism in deeply scaled CMOS process. The results show that the software-based scheme can significantly reduce the ageing of the memory at a low overhead. For example, the degradation of the hold SNM metric of the memory cell is reduced with up to 40% at a runtime overhead of only 1.4%. Moreover, the scheme also mitigates the ageing of other components of the memory. For example, the degradation of the offset voltage of the sense amplifier is reduced by nearly 50%. This thesis shows that it is possible to use software to mitigate the ageing effects in the memory components and it is worthwhile to consider implementing it.","bti; sram; hardware mitigation; Software mitigation; ageing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In previous research a prototype was developed to help users to identify their own stressful places and encourage them to conduct self-training exercises in those locations. This prototype is called ‘Grippy’. The goal of this project is to explore what qualities Grippy’s vibration signal should have, to appropriately warn the user of upcoming stress. Three knowledge gaps are identified. First, how the vibration strength of the signal influences the noticeability, audibility and disruption of the vibration signal. Second, what environmental factors influence the noticeability of wrist-mounted vibration signals. And third, how we could design respectful vibration signals that grab the users attention. Three experiments have been performed. Experiments one and two used 14 and 7 participants respectively to measure at which vibration strength Grippy’s vibration signals are noticeable to the user and bystanders respectively. With the insights from these two experiments, a new stress alert signal is proposed. This signal is tested in a third auto-introspective experiment. In this experiment we also explore ‘how Grippy fulfils the qualities of wearable partners in daily life’. The proposed stress alert signal is found to be discreet and respectful in most situations. These include social situations like presenting, listening and talking, but also shopping, walking, studying and playing piano. During cycling the proposed stress alert signal was not consistently noticeable. In addition, short disruptions in the environment such as arm movement and gusts of wind could temporarily distract from or mask the vibration signal. This report concludes that a continuous vibration signal at a fixed vibration strength is likely an appropriate way of alerting users in most situations, but that adaptation of the vibration strength to detect cycling like situations will be necessary.","Grippy; Discreet; Just-noticeable; Partner; Vibration; Signal; Intervention; Haptic; Stress","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","Things that help out",""

Families with school-aged children face difficulties in helping the children transition from traditional school to online education while bearing various stress due to the epidemic quarantine measures. The situation leads to an intense parent-child relationship during the quarantine period because of the increased conflicts about the children’s learning status, especially for Chinese families, which attach great importance to studying. Through a literature review on parents’ involvement in children’s study, the cultural influence on parenting style, and how the epidemic context could impact the children, I have a basic understanding of the context. The design goal was defined by combining the insights obtained from the in-depth interviews with nine families and relevant design theories on designing for children and parent-child communication. The project aims to improve parent-child communication by creating a relaxed conversation atmosphere during the COVID-19 quarantine period for Chinese families with children aged from 9-12 who are about entering their puberty and could have more communication problems with their parents. With the inspirations of ideas from brainstorming sessions and the Doraemon character, the time travel concept was created and developed to create a relaxed communication atmosphere and provide more communication topics for parents and children at home. A prototype was developed and tested with four families to evaluate the extent to which it can improve parent-child communication at home. The test results showed that parents believe the design makes sense in helping create a positive communication atmosphere at home and, therefore, could facilitate a better parent-child relationship. From the children’s feedback, the long-term attraction to the children in using the product can be a direction for further development and improvement.","parent-child communicatoin; COVID-19; gamification; parent-child attachment; Design for children","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

A large number of suerers experience a severe level of tinnitus and they are not ableto conduct a normal life because they develop insomnia, depression, and distress.Extensive research has been made to study its pathophysiology and to nd a therapy. However, currently thereare no treatments that have demonstrated to be eective in modulating tinnitus or suppressing its related annoyancefrom a long-term perspective. What is known is that the patients exhibit abnormal electrical activityin multiple areas of the auditory and the central nervous systems. This is the reason why the focus of thescientists has shifted to multi-modal stimulation: multiple stimulations of equal or dierent nature (e.g. doubleelectrical stimulation or acoustic-electrical stimulation) are applied at the same time in the attempt to induceneuroplasticity and restore the normal electrical activity in the targeted areas. Multi-modal stimulation hasbrought signicant improvements both in terms of tinnitus intensity and distress, but the studies conductedare too little to derive conclusions. Stimulation sites, parameters, and patterns are some of the many issues thathave to be properly investigated.The challenge of this work is to design a portable multi-modal stimulator that is able to provide bilateral acousticand electrical stimulation simultaneously. The device works at the same time as an audio player and atranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulator, with the purpose of contemporaneously stimulating the auditorycortex and the autonomic nervous system or the dorsal cochlear nucleus through the vagal nerve or the C2nerve, respectively.Bi-modal stimulation is based on the random presentation of pure tones matched to the tinnitus frequency pitchcombined with two possible electrical stimulation waveforms: a novel one characterized by the superposition ofa low-frequency noise on a DC component (""noise + DC"" stimulation) and the second one is burst stimulation.Both the electrical stimulations are current-driven and largely customizable due to the wide programmabilityof the stimulation parameters. The analog design is realized in such a way that two identical output currentsare delivered to the tissue, allowing for bilateral stimulation.The low power consumption and the small dimensions and weight of the device will permit the tinnitus patientto use it for several hours per day while performing his daily life without impairments.","bioelectronics; tinnitus; biomedical device; neurostimulator; electrical stimulator; multi-modal stimulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","","","","","",""

This class of composites is termed variable stiffness and they are able to enhance the structural performance over traditional laminates by redistributing the internal load of the structure. Therefore, it is of interest to pinpoint the structural properties that may benefit most from this concept and the extent thereof. To that end, a multi-objective optimisation of a variable stiffness cylinder was performed which identifies the Pareto front for objectives such as buckling, natural frequency, stiffness and strength. Manufacturing considerations were also incorporated by accounting for the allowable tow curvature and the resulting overlaps during the process. The stiffness variability was formed by means of a Lagrange polynomial, the non-linearity of which is determined by a specified amount of control points. An investigation on the suitable degree of non-linearity of the functional representation of the cylinder was thus carried out. In order to complete the optimisation in a practical time frame, machine learning algorithms were utilised to act as surrogate models and perform predictions on the optimisation objectives. Different algorithms were implemented for that task, namely Radial Basis Function, Kriging and Artificial Neural Network models. The Artificial Neural Network surrogate model outperformed the others when the dimensionality of the problem was high, although the opposite was observed for low dimensional problems. Cylinders with and without cut-outs were optimised separately and compared with their optimised constant stiffness counterparts. It is found that the performance gains for the cylinder without cut-outs are not significant when the additional mass due to the overlaps is accounted for. On the other hand, the cut-out cylinder greatly benefits from the stiffness variation for multiple objectives. Additional structural improvements were witnessed for higher degrees of non-linearity of the utilised Lagrange polynomial.","Variable stiffness; Multi-objective optimisation; Machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However, conventional HMI detection techniques, such as atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), are often too expensive and not practical for on-site real-time monitoring. Electrochemical methods, including anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), appear as alternatives for detecting HMI. Among these techniques, EIS possesses great potential in providing more information about water composition with modelling and data analysis. However, past research on the physical interpretation of the impedance response and the differentiation of different types of HMI in a mixed aqueous solution is inadequate. In the first part of the research, the electrochemical cell for HMI detection was constructed with pure platinum electrodes and the impedance response was collected for two types of HMI solutions, ZnSO4 (aq) and Pb(NO3)2(aq), and their mixed solution. The data was collected repetitively in a wide range of settings to understand the influence of varying parameters, including concentration, types of HMI, temperature, mixing ratio, and designs of the electrochemical cells. The reproducibility of results was quantified by the calculation of standard deviation. It was found that each HMI solution has its own characteristic impedance value. In addition, the change of impedance response follows a linear trend line in the Bode and Nyquist impedance plot when varying parameters such as concentration, temperature, and mixing ratio. In addition to controlled experiments, the electrochemical cell was tested in tap water and industrial water samples provided by the project’s collaborators. In the second part of the research, various techniques of surface analysis were<br/>conducted on the surface of the platinum working electrode, including scanning<br/>electron microscope (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Since the HMI-related adsorbates were presented in the results, a hypothesis was proposed, which suggests that the adsorption/desorption process of HMIs has taken place during the EIS measurement, and this phenomenon attributes to the inductive behavior in the impedance response. Finally, equivalent circuit models were proposed based on the result of EIS measurements, surface analysis, and literature studies. Data fitting for the impedance data was carried out with Zview software version 3.5h. Charge transfer resistance and other equivalent circuit elements’ impedance values were compared to specify the differences between the two HMI.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

The process of carburizing lower to medium carbon steel can generally provide this combination of properties and has been practised for several decades. Such steel is very essential in vehicle power-trains. The carburized 18CrNiMo7-6 pinions are ground to obtain high dimensional precision after the carburization, quenching and tempering heat-treatment process. During the grinding process, thermal damage is developed due to the high localised heat energy at the contact zone of the grinding wheel and pinion. The developed thermal damage is known as grinding-induced burn. The burns are observed when the temperature reaches above the tempering range (i.e. 210 ̊ C) and the intensity of the grinding-induced burn is in relation to the thermo-mechanical effects of the grinding process. The nital etch process is used to identify the burns using ISO 14104:2017 standard and the process detects using the discolouration developed on the burn site caused by the chemical attack. The information about the intensity of detected burns are not known in the nital etch method. However, the intensity of the grinding-induced burns can be measured using magnetoelastic parameter of Barkhausen Noise (BN) technique which functions in relation to the microstructure and stress state of the material. The present study aims to investigate microstructural features of grinding-induced burns of varying BN intensities, to evaluate the service life testing of the thermally damaged pinions and the effect of varying grinding parameters on the generation of grinding-induced burns. The microstructure characterization is done by optical microscope, Vickers hardness, scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction and correlate the obtained results with the BN signals. The increased pinion speed and reduced grinding cycles are observed in the favouring of increasing localized heat input at the contact zone of grinding wheel and pinion causing the BN signals to increase. 3 samples of varying intensities of grinding induced burns are detected using BN and are characterized. The obtained results gave a good correlation with the Barkhausen noise signals. As the heating rate at the grinding contact zone increased above the tempering range, the BN signals also increased due to the enhanced domain wall movement with the softer microstructure which is observed due to the retained austenite decomposition and carbon diffusion from the tempered martensitic phase. The further increase in temperature above the austenitization range led to the re-hardening burn. The freshly formed structure is brittle and hard untempered martensite at the surface surrounded by the softer tempering burn which might be detrimental during the pinion functioning. The axle test results of the tempered burn pinion observed the transformation of retained austenite to martensitic structure during the cyclic loading which eventually enhanced the surface properties by increase in hardness from 621 HV1 to 676 HV1 at 0.1 mm depth and generating -600 ± 6.6 MPa compressive residual stress due to the volume expansion. This transformation resulted in the grinding induced burn pinion to survive the axle test without failure.","Grinding burns; Barkhausen Noise; Carburized steel; x-ray diffraction; Material characterization; Tempered Martensite; Pinion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","Materials in Engineering Applications",""

Privacy-preserving Attribute-Based Credential Systems (PABCSs) allow users to authenticate by presenting their credential attributes, while multiple presentations remain unlinkable and untraceable. A revocation mechanism allows the credential issuer to revoke a credential, for example when the attributes of a user change. Verifiers can in turn determine the revocation status of the presented credential. This thesis considers situations in which a verifier needs to determine the revocation status of a credential after the presentation. This stronger revocation level, also described as forward-looking consistency, has not been researched before in PABCSs. To address this gap, we present the PABC-FLC design, a PABCS with forward-looking consistency. Our design allows users to remain offline after presentation, without compromising on the privacy properties. To avoid an impossibility result, we introduce a new participant called the Non-Revocation Prover (NRP). The NRP facilitates a verifier in determining the revocation status of a credential, even though neither the verifier nor the issuer have to trust the NRP. We show that our PABC-FLC design has a comparable experimental runtime to a credential system without revocation mechanism. This experiment shows our design has a runtime overhead of +20 ms (+32%) during presentation and +20 ms (+34%) during verification. Concluding that our PABC-FLC design is a feasible PABCS with forward-looking consistency, while remaining unlinkable and untraceable.","attribute-based credentials; revocation; forward-looking consistency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, incomplete protein degradation during the acidification of organic matter is frequently observed when carbohydrates are present. Literature reports little information to explain the mechanisms behind this phenomenon. This MSc study investigated the relationship between microbial composition and the negative effect of carbohydrates on anaerobic protein degradation in the acid-phase by restricting the carbon source to a mixed culture in a continuously stirred tank anaerobic reactor. Two continuously stirred anaerobic reactors fed with restrictive protein and/or carbohydrate substrates were operated and compared in the aspects of acidification, deamination, protease activity, and microbial composition. Results showed that the deamination degree in the protein-feeding reactor decreased from 77% to 15% and the acidification degree decreased from 75% to 34% when the restrictive carbon source shifted from proteins to mixtures of proteins and carbohydrates. A decrease in protease activity was also observed. Anaerobic protein degradation was significantly retarded by the presence of carbohydrates. Results of the microbial composition analysis showed that generalists (i.e. microorganisms that can ferment both proteins and carbohydrates) that preferentially consumed carbohydrates were the predominant populations in the microbial community when carbohydrates were present as additional substrates. Therefore, the observed negative effect of carbohydrates on protein degradation in acid-phase could be mainly attributed to the preferential substrate utilization feature of generalists. Further research on the metabolism functional analysis of the microbial community should be employed to confirm this hypothesis. Overall, this study offers a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the negative effect of carbohydrates on protein degradation, which can provide some hints of the design of the anaerobic digestion process of protein-rich wastewater.","Anaerobic digestion; Protein-rich wastewater; Acid-phase; Microbial community","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","A future rise in electrical energy demand is expected due to the electrification of the thermal energy supply and the rise in popularity of the Electric Vehicle (EV). This rise in the electrical energy demand results in needed investments in the electrical energy infrastructure to prevent congestion at the transformer due to the higher peak of energy transfer between the microgrid and utility grid. Smart control strategies as EV management and Demand Response (DR) programs are used to lower the peak of electrical energy transfer. In this thesis, the focus is on how the introduction of hydrogen will influence the peak of electrical energy transfer between the microgrid and utility grid to reduce future electrical grid investments. The stochastic processes in the microgrid are forecasted with the best-obtained forecasting models. Using a mixed logic dynamical formulation of the hybrid model of the microgrid, different Model Predictive Control (MPC) control strategies are implemented to solve the multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming problem. Microgrids with different levels of hydrogen penetration are compared. It is concluded that the introduction of hydrogen to a future microgrid will reduce the peak of electrical energy transfer, i.e., reduce future investments in the electrical grid. However, it does result in higher overall economic costs due to the high increase in energy import costs. Furthermore, an increase in the degradation of the EVs due to their more intensive use is concluded when introducing hydrogen to the microgrid. Two stochastic MPC methods, scenario- and tree-based MPC are compared to the nominal controller to see if better performance can be obtained for a hydrogen-based microgrid. Better overall performance of the stochastic MPC strategies is obtained in the winter but could not be realized in the summer. Only tree-based MPC shows a reduction in the peak of electrical energy transfer.","hydrogen; microgrid; model predictive control; electric vehicles; demand response","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); University of Melbourne (degree granting institution)","2020","Australia has a high potential for production of renewable energy, such as wind and solar. Due to the stochastic operating conditions, excessively produced energy can be used to produce hydrogen by electrolysis to store the energy, known as power-to-gas. This hydrogen can be injected into the existing natural gas pipeline network, providing both storage and transport of hydrogen. There are many applications for hydrogen, however, this thesis focuses on the use of hydrogen for fuel cell cars. In order to use the hydrogen blended with the natural gas, a gas separation is required. Pressure swing adsorption is a commonly used technology to produce pure hydrogen, which exploits the adsorption of gases at high partial pressures. In this thesis, a PSA system is designed to separate a feed of 5 vol% and 10 vol% hydrogen mixed with natural gas at a pressure of 20 bar, and the economic feasibility of hydrogen supplied by a PSA system at a refuelling station is assessed and compared with other alternatives. The PSA separation is achieved with a 6 bed system, which consists of 4 pressure equalisation steps, to increase the product recovery, and repressurises the bed with the pure hydrogen product, to increase the purity. The adsorbent material is key in the design of a PSA system, which determines the operation performance and cost. Due to the large amount of gas components present in natural gas, a three-layered bed is designed. Activated carbon is selected as the main adsorbent layer, adsorbing methane, which is the main component in the gas mixture. Heavy hydrocarbons and CO2 adsorb very strongly on activated carbon; therefore, a pre-layer of silica gel is used to prevent accumulations of these gases. Silica gel has a linear isotherm for heavy hydrocarbons and CO2, which means the gas components will desorb at the desorption pressure. Lastly, a zeolite LiLSX layer is used for the adsorption of nitrogen. Process simulations are performed, focusing on the thickness of the pre-layer. No pre-layer results in accumulations of the heavy hydrocarbons on the activated carbon main layer, and thus reduces the available sites for methane to adsorb. This results in a low purity hydrogen product. When the pre-layer is too long, the total amount of activated carbon is reduced, and thus not enough adsorbent is available for the methane to adsorb. A thickness of 0.2 meter in a bed of 1.2 meter height is concluded to be ideal. It is concluded that an economically feasible design for a refuelling station with hydrogen supplied by a PSA system is proposed. Hydrogen can be dispensed to a fuel cell vehicle in the best case scenario for $14.79 with hydrogen originally produced by electrolysis, and for $12.14 for hydrogen originally produced by SMR without CCS. The final hydrogen price (including hydrogen supply, compression, storage, and dispensing) is compared to two other hydrogen supply methods: on-site electrolysis and tube-trailer transported hydrogen. Currently, PSA supplied hydrogen is a more economical option, especially if the hydrogen is produced from fossil fuel based resources. On-site electrolysis can become a more economical option in the future with improved cell efficiencies and reduced electricity prices. Tube-trailer transported hydrogen is highly influenced by the distance travelled. If the hydrogen originates from electrolysis, tube-trailer transported hydrogen will always be more expensive. For different fossil fuel based hydrogen technologies, a break-even distance is calculated.","Hydrogen; Pressure swing adsorption; Hydrogen refuelling station","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

However, the lack of consumables and spare parts and infrastructural limitations lead to 70% of that equipment not working, or working improperly shortly after being received. The surgical suction pump at Masanga Hospital is such an example. The use of the suction pump is hindered by: • Lack of consumables and appropriate tubing, leading to a mismatch between the different components • Frequent power shortages Therefore, the goals defined for the project together with the client were to • Solve the dimensional mismatch between the medical consumables and • power the device independently from the Hospital’s solar grid by leveraging locally available resources and manufacturing opportunities. Discover, Define, Freeze The project was started with a profound analysis of the principles of suction at a HIC hospital, followed by the use and function of suction at Masanga, to better understand the current challenge and Masanga and the envisioned use of the suction pump that the design solutions should achieve. The research on suction was followed by an extensive contextual analysis. where the gathered insights helped understand the factors that influence the current situation, as well as limitations and opportunities were The findings were transformed into a List of Requirements and principal design solutions. Executive Summary Develop Various iterations, more than 50 prototypes and an extensive testing protocol were made to achieve the following goals: • To locally 3D print reusable medical tubing connectors, independently from Masanga’s current supply chain and • To make a conceptual plan for building a portable power-pack based on a 12V car battery as the power source to power the suction pump during power shortages Final Deliverables • A tested method of 3D printing reusable medical tubing connectors using PETG filament The connectors were developed through 1.

Key challenges include the demand for high-resolution computational grids, the non-linear behavior of the system due to strong mass-heat coupling and the presence of fractures with large heterogeneity contrasts. In this work, a comparison is made between natural and molar variable formulation used to describe the coupled fluid-heat transport under non-isothermal conditions in low-enthalpy fractured porous media. The solutions and performance of the newly implemented molar formulation are compared to those of the existing natural variable formulation in the DARSim2 reservoir simulation framework. A fully implicit scheme (FIM) is applied to solve the coupled discrete system including mass and energy balance equations. Application of the Algebraic Dynamic Multilevel (ADM) method with projection-based Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (pEDFM) provides a scalable and efficient simulation framework for field-scale fractured reservoirs. The ADM method maps the fine-scale system onto a dynamically defined multilevel grid resolution system (Cusini et al., 2016, HosseiniMehr et al., 2020) based on the solution gradient and a series of restriction and prolongation operators, which ensure accurate capturing of fine-scale heterogeneities. Fractures are defined explicitly as either (highly) conductive passageways or flow barriers using the pEDFM formulation (Tene et al., 2017). Simulation results using the molar formulation are compared with an analytical solution as verification of the implementation. Results of various (un-)fractured test cases with homogeneous and heterogeneous permeability fields show that there is no clear difference between the solutions and performance of the different primary variable formulations, and the performance itself is largely dependent on the level of complexity embedded in the numerical model independent of the simulation strategy applied.","Geothermal energy; Algebraic Dynamic Multilevel; Porous media; projection-based Embedded Discrete Fracture Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

This study looked into the human level of the boundary-spanning activities within a living lab group via a case study on a university living lab of medical devices. This research aimed to provide insights on the interpersonal interaction to optimise the mutual learning between participants of a university living lab. The results of this research were translated into a communication tool to realise the optimal mutual learning within a living lab context. This research found out that the identification process played an important role in facilitating users to obtain benefits of the boundary-spanning activities while mitigating the possibility of conflicts. In the process of dynamic formation of professional identity in a living lab context, various identities of competence come closer and intersect with each other. The supervenient overlapping area of different competence can be regarded as the identity of knowledgeability. Knowledgeability manifests the ability to see the relevance of other competence to a professional’s own competence. Translated into practice in the design process of medical devices, the identity of competence provides a feasibility scope of expertise, which makes sure the design decision would be viable in the future commercialisation according to a certain aspect. Actors with knowledgeability to all the expertise in a group can better tweak the decision into the overlapping area of all the feasibility scopes of expertise, for example, of clinical, engineering and commercial expertise in this case. This research suggests that knowledgeability could be an indicator of so-called boundary-spanning competence. Knowledgeability is the result of identification in the interdisciplinary interaction within a living lab context. When designing a tool to facilitate the acquisition of knowledgeability, this study utilised the three modes of identification, namely imagination, engagement and alignment as the foundation of the tool. The tool stimulates reflection of the users through a series of inspiring questions and guides the users to reap the benefits of daily interdisciplinary conversations through communicative solutions. The main recommendations for future research entail taking this preliminary tool as a starting point to explore the cognitive activities further when people engage in boundary-spanning activities and the psychological aspect of the identification process. Furthermore, defining the quantitative criteria of knowledgeability would greatly improve the reliability and usefulness of the tool.","Living Lab; Boundary-spanning; Identity; Knowledgeability; Professionalization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Science Communication","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Mexico is currently transitioning to a low-carbon electricity production that has a specific goal of producing at least 50\% of its electricity from clean energy sources by 2050. Following the liberalization of its electricity sector in late 2013, private actors joined the Mexican government's efforts to increase the share of renewable energy; however, the mechanisms placed to attract investment continue to favor the incumbents and the model of large-scale, privately owned, and internationally financed projects. These projects produced new forms of spatial and social inequalities, which led to criticism and conflicts from civil society and indigenous groups at the local level. Theories on socio-technical transitions study the shifts within large socio-technical systems and recognize technological innovation's role for the required transition. However, technological innovation alone is not sufficient to achieve the required changes. It depends on other elements within the socio-technological system, such as business models. The role of business models remains underexplored; therefore, this research intends to contribute to the emerging literature linking socio-technical transitions and business model theory. Using the framework proposed by Wainstein and Bumpus (2016), this research aims to understand the role of business models as part of the socio-technical regime and as a device to commercialize technological innovation. Over the last decade, new business models, like the ones implemented by renewable energy cooperatives (REScoops), are proving to be a driving force to transition to low-carbon energy generation. A REScoop is a business model where citizens jointly own and participate in renewable energy or energy efficiency projects. Despite the observed benefits, countries with apparent proper conditions, like Mexico, have not succeeded in implementing this business model. Therefore this research aims to understand the limiting factors by conducting a case study to answer the following main research question: What are the challenges and opportunities for the potential use and adoption of the renewable energy cooperative business model in the context of the Mexican energy transition?. Implementing the conceptual framework combining business models with socio-technical transition theory from a multilevel perspective proved to be useful in understanding specific dynamics and business models' roles within the Mexican energy transition. While the Electric Industry Law of 2014 liberalized the Mexican electricity sector and created the required conditions for REScoops to participate, the secondary laws and the regime's pressures impose a series of entry barriers for REScoops to compete in the electricity market at a large-scale. However, the REScoop business model can be implemented at the distributed generation level. This research introduced four potential business models that could be developed under the current circumstances and regulatory conditions. These business models shall be carefully examined and adapted to the host communities' specific needs and resources. The collective generation business model, in particular, can play an important role in promoting RES. This report closes with a series of recommendations for different actors and recommendations for further research.","Business Model; Energy transition; Renewable energy cooperative; Multi-level perspective; Mexico","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Pourquie, M.J.B.M. (mentor); Delfos, R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The drainage time of liquid-filled PET bottles can be greatly reduced by pre-rotating the bottle with a certain angular velocity. Depending on the magnitude of the angular velocity, up to four different flow regimes can be distinguished during the emptying of a bottle: bubble regime, transition regime, vortex<br/>regime and the swirl regime. At zero or low pre-rotation, the flow is in the so-called bubble regime in which the intermittent downward liquid flow is accompanied by an upward motion of irregularly shaped air bubbles into the bottle. At sufficiently high pre-rotation, the picture is completely different. After<br/>initial transient behaviour in which the flow is first in the bubble regime, the flow undergoes transition towards a so-called vortex regime. This is characterized by regular downward motion of liquid along the bottle wall in a free-surface vortex and accompanying upward motion of air through the nozzle core. Finally, close to the end of the drainage process another transition towards a so-called swirl regime takes place, in which the last bit of liquid swirls around in the bottle before being slowed down sufficiently to exit the bottle through the nozzle opening. Dimensional analysis indicates that for a specific bottle geometry the non-dimensional total drainage time td/td,0, where td,0 is a characteristic drainage time scale for stationary low-viscosity fluids in the bubble regime, depends primarily on 3 non-dimensional numbers: (1) the rotation number, Π (2) the Morton number, Mo, and (3) the E¨otvos number, Eo. The former represents the characteristic ratio of centrifugal to hydrostatic forces inside the liquid phase. The objective of this study is to determine the relationship between the non-dimensional drainage time and Π and gain insight in the influence of E¨otvos and Morton onto this. To this purpose, a parametric CFD study of a model PET bottle has been conducted and the results have been compared with previous preliminary experiments performed in our group. The numerical study is divided into three categories, each discussing the influence of one of the dimensionless parameters. The influence of the Π-number was studied by altering the initial rotational velocity of the bottle. It was found that at some critical Π-number, the drainage time was minimal. A further increase beyond the critical Π-number resulted in a longer drainage time, due to the stronger centrifugal force acting on the liquid layer. It was found through an analytical solution and verified with the numerical results that the rate at which the Π-number grows in relation to the dimensionless drainage time is to the power 3 for the laminar case and to the power 3/2 for the turbulent case. Below the critical value, the flow is expected to remain in the so-called bubble regime, also increasing the drainage time. Furthermore, the onset of the vortex regime was expected to occur at a constant value of Π. This was also verified with the numerical results and a strong correlation was found between the onset and the corresponding local Π-number. The influence of the Morton number is also discussed, where an increase in the Morton number was realized with an increase in viscosity. It was found that the drainage time got substantially reduced with an increase in viscosity. The effects of viscous dissipation resulted in a bigger effective area and higher axial downward flow velocity. However, increasing the Morton number excessively would result in the flow regime remaining in the bubble regime. Therefore, the critical Πnumber shifts depending on the different fluid compositions. When varying the E¨otvos number, by both changing the viscosity and the surface tension, it was found that the latter had negligible effect on the generation of the air-core or the drainage time.","Air-core vortex; Bubble regime; Mutli-phase numerical study; PET bottle; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Siwrling flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Dijkstra, R.J. (graduation committee); Leijten, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Worldwide, more and more actors have started to speak out their belief in a future with three-dimensional mobility as one of the solutions for congesting and polluted cities. Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing vehicles – more popularly referred to as drones – are supposed to relieve the current infrastructure network, mainly roads, and quickly transport cargo and people through the sky to their desired location. This new mode of transportation is also called Urban Air Mobility (UAM). To make UAM a reality, three main components are required: the aircraft and aircrew, the management of the airspace and the integration in the community. Over the last years, the industry has made major steps in the first two aspects. However, the community integration of UAM – which is about infrastructure, social acceptance and regulations, among others – has fallen behind, as cities are barely preparing themselves for this new transportation mode. Still, UAM may become a reality much earlier than those cities may expect. When that happens, cities will have to be prepared for this. It is therefore important to explore what it means and takes when UAM is integrated into a community. It is the latter which forms the fundament for this research. Where the literature extensively discusses the aircraft and airspace integration, a knowledge gap can be identified on the community integration of UAM. For this reason, the main goal for the research was to analyze the required changes in the urban mobility regime, which challenges this will cause and what actions communities can take in preparation for UAM. To contribute to the understanding of the subject and analyze the practical elaboration of UAM Community Integration, the research tried to answer the question how the transition of Urban Air Mobility can be realised in communities, which formed the main research question. To answer the research question, a qualitative approach was chosen, recommended to be used when the investigated phenomenon is new and when the investigator seeks to answer “why” and “how” questions. A combination of different qualitative data gathering methods was adopted: literature reviews and semi-structured interviews. This thesis shows that there is a lot involved in the transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional urban transport, or Urban Air Mobility. The transition is driven by large-scale developments such as urbanization, mobility growth and climate change, putting pressure on the mobility regime. Besides, there are technological innovations in development, such as battery and communication technologies and automation, which the development of UAM as a new mode of transportation will depend on. In addition, there are internal frictions in the existing mobility system, such as congestion, which require new, sustainable mobility solutions. The comparison between the existing and future mobility regime – the latter including UAM – makes clear that the community integration of UAM requires changes in every single dimension in the mobility regime. This is accompanied by various challenges and requires actions from cities. Major challenges are mainly found within the dimensions of sectoral policy, infrastructure and culture or symbolic meaning. The most important actions that cities can take therefore also address these challenges. For example, there are currently a patchwork of rules that restrict or prohibit the use of drones and thus make UAM virtually impossible. This requires standardization of rules, which above all allow the use of drones, while respecting the social impact that drones can have. Furthermore, there is usually a lack of existing infrastructure, which means that new infrastructure must be developed. However, the limited space, suitability of existing buildings, financial feasibility and social value of UAM are some important factors that make infrastructure development within urban centers a challenging task. Cities will have to identify suitable locations for vertiports, taking these types of factors into account. Existing energy capacity can also be an obstacle. Whereas typical passenger vehicle DC fast charging typically ranges from 50kW-350kW, UAM requires charging capacities of up to 600 kW. To provide this, cities may have to make adjustments to their existing energy network. Finally, UAM will likely have a significant social impact in terms of noise, horizon pollution, privacy, safety and price,. The risk of social resistance is therefore high. It is important that cities anticipate this by, among other things, informing and educating the community about UAM, carrying out pilot projects and drawing up social guidelines. Other actions that cities can take to prepare for UAM include the exploration of potential user practices and the definition and division of stakeholder roles, among others. To conclude, the realization of UAM in communities is only in its infancy and involves an extensive process of (interdependent) developments and actions. Once the variety of niche-innovations have developed into a more mature state – which can still take several years –, UAM will be able to start its breakthrough into the urban mobility regime. This transition requires changes in all regime dimensions. The integration in the community will have impact in different ways, of which it is assumed that the spatial, energy and social domains will be impacted most. Challenges rise, mainly with regard to the sectoral policy, infrastructure and culture or symbolic meaning within the mobility regime. In order to realise the transition of UAM in communities, these must be addressed. This thesis proposed some of the more important actions that communities can take for the community integration of UAM. These are outlined in the final roadmap, which should give the final answer on how the transition of UAM can be realized in communities. The research recommends cities to take up the identified actions for UAM community integration. They provide an insight into what needs to be done to enable the community integration of UAM. This research has taken a first, exploratory step in the right direction, but the identified actions - logically - have no outcome yet. Further research into these actions is therefore required. Cities are therefore recommended to continue with this, so that they can find an answer to the implicit research questions that lie hidden in these actions.","Urban Air Mobility; community integration; Mobility; transitions theory; integral design management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

These complex flexures are expensive and difficult to manufacture. This paper presents a method of designing short, polymer wire flexures with high support stiffness and modelling their axis drift using a novel method, the arc method. The arc method is validated against finite element methods (FEM) and physical tests, showing at least a factor 10 lower error than existing pseudo-rigid-body models (PRBM) at 70 degrees deflection while maintaining a simple modelling approach. The use of polymers increases support stiffness of wire flexures by a factor 7800 with respect steel at 70 degrees deflection, even though the material stiffness is substantially lower. This is due to the large allowed strain of polymers increasing the possible diameter by a factor 110.","Compliant Mechanisms; Polymers; Arc Method; Support Stiffness; Axis Drift; Flexures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

Understanding the complexity of fouling has led to better decision making for design and operation of MBRs. However, studies have shown contradictory results of the impact of sludge characteristics on membrane filtration performance and fouling propensity. The purpose of this study was to characterize the sludge under different operating conditions of an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) treating dairy wastewater, to assess the impact on the filtration. The real flux method was used to determine the flux, while the characteristics of the sludge varied in time. The real flux method is when the feed, retentate and transmembrane pressures are controlled to induce similar hydrostatic conditions applied in full-scale anMBR in crossflow configuration. Total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), total suspended solids (TSS), volatile suspended solids (VSS), viscosity, and different fractions of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) were performed for sludge characterization. The specific resistance to filtration (SRF), capillary suction time (CST), and supernatant filterability were used as parameters for filterability of the sludge and supernatant. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine the correlation between the sludge characterization and the filterability methods. Five principal components (PC) attributing to 91% of the variance were extracted, based on an eigenvalue greater than 1. The principal components showed the correlation between the different variables studied. PC1 consisted of fraction of solids (total dissolved solids, VSS/TSS, and fixed suspended solids), the CST, and the normalized versions of the CST (CST/TSS, CST/Viscosity, CST/TSS/Viscosity). Five of the variables in PC1 are derived from the TSS concentration most likely indicating why they were grouped under this principal component. PC2 consisted of the particle size distribution of particles ranging from 0 to 10 micrometer. PC3 consisted mainly of a different fraction of solids (VSS, VS, TS, and TSS) and SRF. SRF is a function of TSS, this can explain why these variables were grouped together in PC3. PC4 consisted of the soluble and colloid particles. PC5 consisted of the hydrostatic conditions of the membrane. A multiple linear regression of the PC revealed statistically significance (ANOVA, p-value &lt;0.05) to estimate the flux. A stepwise multiple linear regression was done to determine what variables can be used to estimate the flux based on the data obtained. The selection of the best model from the multilinear regression was based on the highest R squared value, statistical significance from ANOVA, and the variance inflation factor to take into consideration collinearity. Based on the criteria from the PCA and the multiple linear regression, the independent variables for predicting the flux were the CST/TSS, crossflow velocity, the SRF, and the VS/TS.","Anaerobic membrane bioreactor; wastewater treatment; membrane fouling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

(mentor); Pesch, U. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","This thesis represents the culmination of six months of research into the investment behavior of Dutch DSO’s in the context of the energy transition. Through a combination of interviews, analyses of annual reports and a qualitative analyses based on principal-agent theory, I tried to find the effect of the actor network, regulatory regime and investment uncertainty on the investment behavior of the DSO’s. This research is important due to the fact that the Dutch grid is currently experiencing increasing levels of congestion due to grid over-taxation, a problem that is actively discussed within the Dutch political arena. I found that there exists a misalignment of goals within the DSO actor-network, with government principals pushing towards realization of the energy transition, whilst the regulator is still mainly advocating efficiency incentives. Because the regulator is in a rather dominant position with respect to the DSO’s, these efficiency incentives are causing mainly risk-averse, or tentative, investment behavior. Solving the investment problem requires a change that can be found in two directions, regulation or by tackling the investment risk through a reduction of uncertainty. In my research, I found that the notion of changing the regulation substantially is not viewed as a particularly realistic solution, with parties strongly preferring to keep the current system in place and tweak it as necessary. Therefore, the current solutions target the reduction of uncertainty through the creation of programs such as the regional energy strategies. Less investment uncertainty leads to higher, and easier DSO investments and can serve as a key solution to the congestion problems. By creating a more centrally coordinated approach to the development of renewable energy infrastructure, through programs such as the regional energy strategies, a more open forum of information can be created that could allow the DSO’s to make the required additional investments within the bounds of the current system. In the end, this thesis shows how the combination of the uncertain investment climate and the regulatory influences has created a system with very little room to manoeuvre for the Dutch DSO, but that they are actively trying to work on solutions within the bounds of the system.","Energy; Distribution grid; regulation; DSO; Distribution system; energy transition; Renewable Energy; Principal-agent theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This makes it important to understand why a specific prediction is made. Explanations can provide human decision support by allowing human experts to assess the reasoning of the model as well as the correctness. Specifically, in this thesis, we consider the problem of predicting violations on inland ships in the Netherlands to help inspectors in the Dutch government<br/>deciding which ship to inspect. The main contribution is determining confidence in a prediction separately from probability and using this confidence estimation for deciding which prediction of violation to select as well as to explain.<br/>With the limited number of inspectors and a large number of inland ships in the Netherlands, the global performance on all ships is less relevant. Instead, deciding the most qualitative predictions is more useful. Therefore, a measure of model confidence is determined to improve upon the traditional ranking based on probability. In the evaluation of this approach, no significant difference is found between the ranking based on probability for complex ensemble models. However,<br/>for simpler, more interpretable models, there is a significant improvement in using model confidence to re-rank. The determination of confidence is further used to create explanations from the context of confidence. The goal of these explanations is to help an inspector in deciding whether to inspect an inland ship. This novel explanation approach justifies the confidence in a prediction by expressing features contributing towards the confidence. We perform a human-grounded user study evaluation to identify the task effectiveness, perceived usefulness and user trust compared to the explanations from the traditional context of probability. The results of the user study suggest the explanations of the confidence to be particularly useful for problems with a lower accuracy.","XAI; Explanations; Ranking; Conformal prediction; human-grounded evaluation; explainable artificial intelligence; Interpretability; confidence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

Data is getting ubiquitous and cheap. Some new fields, like business intelligence, are recognized and emerging. As a trustworthy and precise material, data is also a valuable source for designers. It provides accurate and detailed data on users’ behaviors and brings some new perspectives on users’ needs in the design process. Meanwhile, big data is a new field for most designers. Most designers, especially novice designers, often lack big data related knowledge and skills. When they face big data, they usually feel clueless and anxious. It is difficult for them to deal with big data well. This thesis's foundational objective is to support designers in applying big data in the design process effectively and confidently. It is about keeping exploring the possibilities of design and making sure that design stays at the cutting edge of the big data era. This project focused explicitly on novice designers who are inexperienced with projects involving big data.<br/><br/>To provide this appropriate support, the key pain point was targeted from designers’ big data related project experiences, which is the feeling of being overwhelmed by big data when designers face it. In the end, I designed the data management platform to help designers relieve this feeling and have a better performance at big data involved projects.<br/><br/>This thesis will introduce the project process. First, I did the literature review to learn about big data, how the relationship between big data and design is, and how the relationship between big data and design process is. Afterward, Context Mapping was conducted to learn about the designers’ experiences in applying big data in the design process. With the literature review and Context Mapping, I understood the project from both a theoretical and design practice perspectives. Then, I held a session to explore the problem space. The session was organized with designers to learn about their difficulties when dealing with big data. <br/><br/>After the session, I realized that the biggest challenge for designers is being overwhelmed by data when translating big data into insights. It results from the massive big data content and cluelessness when designers face big data. It affects designers’ efficiency and confidence in the design process. To explore the solution space of the challenge, I held a co-creation session with novice designers.<br/><br/>In the end, Data Management Platform was proposed. The concept's goals are to relieve designers from data overwhelmingness and assist designers in dealing with big data. The Data Management Platform can provide designers an overview of the project and prevent designers from feeling lost in the big data content. By guiding designers to apply big data in an appropriate process and assisting designers with some tools to collaborate with different people, designers can confidently and effectively make full use of big data.

Fast forward to 2020, the Internet has become a technology that is being used by billions of users. It allows users to communicate with each other across the world and even allows users to access data without geographic restrictions. The Internet has made the lives of many people easier but it also comes with a price; many malicious users also want to have access to data. Therefore, it is needed to secure our networks to make sure that no attackers can exfiltrate data from a network. One way to do so is to use smart methods to detect anomalies in the network. Recently, a new method has been proposed to learn state machines in real-time from network traffic data. The state machines are then used for anomaly detection. This method was designed to be used on a larger system such as a desktop computer. In this work, we investigated how we can use the newly proposed method to learn state machine in realtime on a smaller device. Smaller devices are cheaper and more mobile than larger systems but these have limited resource compared to the larger systems. Therefore, modifications would need to be made to the method for it to run efficiently on a smaller device. In this work, we propose to use the concepts of Locality Sensitive Hashing to improve the run-time of different parts of the method. We also attempted to reduce its memory footprint. In this work, we show the modifications that we have made and evaluated our modifications with different experiments that used both artificial and real-world data. From our results, it shows that we can use a smaller device to learn state machines in real-time and use these state machines for anomaly detection.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Multiphase flows are found in abundant natural phenomena and industrial processes. In particular, pipe flows are widely popular in industries involving chemical processing, dredging, and oil transport to name a few. Particle laden flows are often observed in applications like dredging, sediment, and slurry transport through pipes, etc. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the flow phenomenon in detail. The most important parameter in pipe flow is the pressure drop across a given length. This relates directly to the pumping power which is a significant parameter for industries when viewed from an economic standpoint. This emphasizes understanding the different regimes for particle-laden flows and the impact of particles on transition in particular. Research on transition behavior for particle-laden pipe flows is scarce and the behavior is far from being completely understood. <br/>The literature is replete with the study of transition for single-phase pipe flows. Different perturbation mechanisms were analyzed and the lifetime studies indicated that the puffs are memoryless in nature. The literature provided different formulations to accommodate for the presence of particles with regards to modifying the viscosity of the suspension. The research in multiphase flows has provided inconclusive results in determining the critical Reynolds number for transition as different criteria were provided in different works. <br/>The goal of the current thesis is to perform experiments to understand the transition behavior of particle-laden pipe flows for different particle concentrations. The novelty of this work is the use of an active perturbation mechanism that enabled the study of transition in perturbed and unperturbed flows. The experiments involve varying the particle concentration and keeping the ratio of pipe to particle diameter constant. The study concentrates on understanding the transition behavior using Moody diagrams. The experiments rely on pressure drop measurements to record the average pressure drop across the pipe and study the intermittent structures that drive the transition behavior. The study uses glycerol to make the solution neutrally buoyant when using particles. Single-phase measurements are performed to validate the setup including the pressure sensors and the perturbation mechanism. The Moody chart indicates that the transition is sub-critical with Spatio-temporal intermittency for particle concentrations less than 1.5 %. Interestingly, the particle-induced disturbances are significant and the transition behavior is identical for perturbed and unperturbed flow. This suggests that the disturbance created by the particles is qualitatively similar to that of the perturbation mechanism. However, the transition becomes super-critical for higher particle concentrations as the transition is driven by the fluctuations generated by the particles and the additional friction created by them. The friction factor decreases monotonically for very high particle concentrations (≥ 15 %). The transition behavior is investigated further by analyzing the time series data of pressure drop for different particle concentrations at intermittency of 10 - 20 %. The transition criteria are analyzed based on deviation from the Poiseuille line in the Moody chart and spike in pressure fluctuations in the flow. The latter provides inconclusive evidence for higher particle concentrations. The former holds good for the current study, however, it needs to be revisited for other particle sizes. <br","Multiphase Flow; Turbulence; Experimental research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","A new radical design approach arose from the need to develop a bipolar electrosurgical instrument that is modular and cleanable, thus reusable and therefore suitable for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Advanced Bipolar Vessel Sealer (BVS) instruments that are currently on the market cannot be cleaned or maintained well and are therefore most often sold as disposables. Especially in LMICs it is a significant financial burden for hospitals. This possibly leads to the re-use of single-use intended instruments which in turn jeopardizes patient safety. Simultaneously, designing a reusable instrument fits well in the transition to a more circular and sustainable society. To perform advanced laparoscopic surgery with cleanable and affordable electrosurgical instruments, a new design approach is needed. A first phase was initiated by the creation of a cable less steering principle called Shaft Actuated Tip Articulation (SATA) mechanism [6]. Unfortunately, by adding electrically conductive wires to a SATA instrument it loses its modularity and thus cleanability, precisely for which the SATA technology offered a solution in the first place. In addition, there are no non-robotically controlled and reusable BVS instruments with two DOFs available on the market. By being steerable, the user of the instrument is able to deliver a higher quality seal as well as to seal more difficult-to-reach blood vessels and tissue. In this thesis project the goal is to redesign a SATA instrument which sustains bipolar vessel sealing and thus designing a BVS that is easy to clean, easily disinfected and sterilized and which is reusable for a vast amount of surgical procedures. Ideas have been gained by analysing the SATA mechanism and studying commonly used BVS devices. A systematic selection procedure based on the design requirements has resulted in a winning concept for the conduction of electricity through the SATA instrument. For the design of the tip, determining factors were elaborated on, including the construction of the open and close mechanism and the force transmission ratio between the required seal force on the blood vessel or tissue and the necessary tensile force in the core of the instrument. The most critical components of the final model have been identified and evaluated by means of FEM simulations and an experiment. The FEM simulations of the tip components show that the design is satisfactory and that a safety factor of ~1.5 has been achieved. This means that these components do not fail due to normal use and they have a long lifespan as well. In the experiment a flexible nitinol guidewire with Teflon coating was tested for wear by pulling the guidewire through an angled SATA hinge. After some necessary adjustments and additions to the design of the BVS, the results were improved but not optimal. The outcome of this project is a good basis for the BVS design where the steerability has been maintained as well as the modularity and cleanability. The reusability depending on the flexible coating around the core needs to be further investigated and improved.","Minimally invasive surgery; Laparoscopy; bipolar vessel sealer; steerable instrument; reusable instrument","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Instruments and Medical Safety (MIMS)","",""

(mentor); van de Poel, I.R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Nowadays, it is not enough for companies to only focus on their business operations and financial performance. ‘Doing good’ needs to be part of the business strategy as they must do their part in addressing the grand societal challenges. Cause related marketing (CRM) is one such strategy set to address this. CRM is a powerful tool used to advance both the business and the charity (the cause) to therefore achieve mutual benefit. However, there is a dark side associated to the implementation of this theory. The impact this has on consumers can be explained by the ethical aspect associated with CRM campaigns, which positively influences the consumer’s perception of the company image. Consumers undergo an attitude change because of the link to the good cause. Customers feel that buying CRM products leads them to encounter feelings of satisfaction and altruism which leaves room for companies to take advantage of this. People are often very eager to help without ever having seen proof that donations are used effectively. The latter can be achieved through vivid advertisement and a lack of transparency. There is a problem since people choose to support a cause based on the emotional connection they feel towards the cause and the company. It was proven that if the public is skeptical about the link between company and cause, or if they perceive the company as selfish and corrupt, huge outrage will follow. However, there are several challenges since only the perception of goodwill is needed to get the public on board. It can be argued that business must balance corporate and humanitarian interest. The way to effectively employ CRM is to address the challenges associated with CRM. Balance is needed to meet the business and societal interests. During this thesis project the potential dark side was explored by identifying the ethical challenges. This is done through a case study at a company in the services industry. The data was tested in two stages via interviews and a workshop with brainstorming element, respectively. Taken together, the case study identified a set of four pillars: skepticism, altruism, shared values and transparency. These findings are of importance, because they indicate that the need for shared values is, indeed, essential to cope with ethical challenges in corporate marketing activities. However, the societal aspect of business cannot be neglected. Financial and societal goals have historically been perceived as two entirely different objectives that may even clash with each other. In reality, this dichotomy may not really hold, since a business cannot survive without society, and vice versa. Shared values represent the way in which business and society can both prosper. This finding is in line with the theory of ‘Marketing 3.0’, which argues that consumers have more power than ever before to express what the requirements of a corporate CRM campaign must be in order to satisfy the needs and wants of the public. The case company was very aware of the necessity to preventing skepticism; the company carefully avoided being perceived as self-centered in their marketing activities.","cause related marketing; Corporate social responsibility; CRM; CSR; Ethics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); de Reuver, G.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The dynamic nature of the market with constant technological developments continuously changes expectations from users over time. This drives businesses to alter their product and service offerings to maintain a competitive advantage, stable growth and, high customer satisfaction. Since economic goals drive businesses, it is often assumed that abundance of choice options is better, and will eventually result in increased profitability for the business. However, this is not necessarily the case. Consumers may experience a subjective state of mind termed as “choice overload” when presented with a plenitude of choice options. Consequently, consumers may fall victim to indecision, reduced customer satisfaction, and increased regret, to name a few. Previous research has formulated a cohesive understanding of choice overload in consumer decision making. Extant research in the field of consumer behaviour has identified several antecedents and concomitants of choice overload experienced by consumers. A vast bulk of research has also discovered repugnant effects of choice overload, due to context-dependency and other intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing the choice overload effect. As a result, the questions of when and whether large assortments are detrimental to consumers remains open. This, offers an opportunity to extend the literature in this field by considering different contextual factors and variables that were thus far overlooked. The present study specifically aims to reduce the research gap that exists between Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) by understanding the choice overload effect, within the domain of e-tourism. Apprehension of the choice environment and consumer purchase behaviour is essential to close this existing gap and increase customer satisfaction. In this study, choice complexity is considered as an antecedent of choice overload. Choice complexity encapsulates two structural factors of the choice set – number of alternatives and number of attributes/levels. These factors allow for the construction of a measurement variable for choice complexity (entropy) where high entropy translates to high choice complexity. Moreover, individual differences in maximizing behavioural tendency (in terms of strategy and goal) are investigated. When consumers score high on maximizing tendency strategy, they optimize choice through employing a strategy of extensive information search. Similarly, when consumers score high on maximizing tendency goals, they strive to obtain the best possible choice from the available alternatives. Post-choice satisfaction is defined as the post-decision evaluation of the choice selected by the consumer. Specifically measured on two constructs - general satisfaction and outcome satisfaction. General satisfaction measures satisfaction of the consumer related to the process of arriving at a decision. Whereas, outcome satisfaction measures satisfaction related to the certainty in the choice decision. A choice experiment practically assessed the relationship between choice complexity and post-choice satisfaction, moderated by consumer purchase behaviour. The experimental design consisted of a Low Complex (LC) choice set and a High Complex (HC) choice set (distinguished based on entropy measurements) that allowed for the measurement and comparison of perceived complexity in a complicated choice environment. Respondents conducted a post-choice questionnaire designed to assess post-choice satisfaction and perceived choice complexity. Consumer purchase behaviour was assessed in a different section of the survey based on two different scales - maximizing tendency strategy and maximizing tendency goal. Statistical analysis was conducted on the obtained data to find the relationship between the variables under study. The experiment established the existence of choice complexity in e-tourism. Results showed an inverse relationship between choice complexity and post-choice satisfaction indicating that respondents were less satisfied with their choice when presented with a choice set of high choice complexity. Moreover, maximizing tendency strategy negatively influenced this relationship. Maximizers (i.e., respondents who scored high on the scale assessing maximizing behavioural tendency for strategy), extensively search through alternatives, eventually to formulate trade-offs and comparisons between the alternatives presented. Such maximizers were less satisfied with their choice having gone through a choice set of high complexity as compared to a choice set of low complexity. No such effects were found for the scale, maximizing tendency goals. The detriments of offering too much choice are real. Businesses within service industries such as e-tourism are therefore recommended to improve the quality/quantity of content due to intrinsic (i.e., intangibility, high monetary value, less purchase frequency) and extrinsic (i.e., a high number of alternatives and number of attributes/levels) factors. Each of these factors may make the service offering more complex for consumers to choose from. Managerial implications of the present study include the perspective (technology-centered view and human-centered view) that businesses can adopt. This perspective acknowledges the existence of choice complexity and maximizing tendencies, thereby optimizing the digitized environment towards better personalization. Doing this correctly would result in increased customer satisfaction due to better adaptation of digital environments by businesses to the needs and behaviours of consumers. The inclusion of entropy accurately provides the amount of information in bits; this measurement variable could be used by businesses to improve their algorithms. Finally, some companies in e-tourism have already begun to implement similar strategies, and reported in a significant increase in customer satisfaction, reservations, and overall sales. This gives evidence towards the practical importance of this study, and further emphasizes that businesses can indeed optimize their approach specifically towards the quality/quantity of content provided to consumers.

Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries have become a standard for energy storage in mobile devices and electric vehicles for their mass-energy density. While industry standard lithium-ion cells are currently based on liquid electrolytes, solid electrolytes promise to bring the next step towards safety, energy density and sustainability. However, there are critical challenges, notably improving the lithium conduction of solid electrolytes. Furthermore, as a relatively new research field it is important to target high recyclability and sustainability for materials early on. Battery modelling facilitates performance comparisons of for example battery materials and geometric properties, and subsequent optimisation. The report treats battery modelling with a specific focus on solid electrolytes. Two solid electrolyte models, based on weak electrolyte theory and a lattice gas model by Landstorfer et al., were implemented in the Multiphase Porous Electrode Theory software (Smith,2017). The former is relevant for glass type electrolytes, while the latter models crystalline materials. The models showed comparable performance, with a constant voltage offset but good mutual agreement in term of behaviour. It is important to verify the results experimentally. The numerical methods used in porous electrode theory were treated with the creation of a standalone porous electrode model, with separate domains for the electrolyte and active cathode particles. This model is stable and functional with the two domains in isolation, while a fault remains in the coupling between the domains. Lastly, a proposal is made for the addition of interface regions in the MPET software. With these domains situated between the bulk electrolyte and active cathode particles, porous electrode models could include a variety of phenomena that are currently impossible to implement. For solid electrolytes in particular, modelling dynamic stress effects and lithium conduction across particle boundaries would be valuable additions.","batteries; modelling; electrolyte; porous electrode theory; solid-state batteries","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

The usage of Industry 4.0 technologieswithin the chlor-alkali supply chain was analysed. Literature reviews ofIndustry 4.0 and supply chain resilience were conducted to gain a betterunderstanding. The usage of the following Industry 4.0 technologies was considered- Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical Systems, Cloud computing, EnterpriseResource Planning, and Big data analytics.

The study finds that Industry 4.0 has a limitedpositive influence on supply chain resilience when the disruption arises withinthe supply chain. But, when there is disruption arises outside the supplychain, it has no impact or sometimes a negative impact on supply chainresilience. Additionally, this study proposes three strategies that can be usedto implement Industry 4.0 to have a positive impact on resilience. They are themapping of critical processes, design and programming of the system, andvisibility enhancement within the supply chain.

(mentor); Schoups, G.H.W. (graduation committee); Bloemendal, J.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Hydraulic properties of aquifer systems are usually estimated by conducting field experiments, which are called aquifer tests. Different approaches have been applied to simulate the drawdown data, such as graphical type curves, analytical solutions, and grid-based models. Since the type of groundwater system varies greatly from location to location, only a few general solutions have been developed. Computation of hydraulic properties are limited by the size and time step of grid-based model. Determining the boundary conditions is also difficult in actual groundwater system. Thus, in order to better simulate various aquifer systems, semi-analytic approaches have been promoted and used in aquifer test analysis. In this report, three different softwares aiming at aquifer tests simulation are presented. Both MLU and TTim are based on semi-analytical solutions and need users to build their own aquifer models, while AQTESOLV provides a base model for adding a variety of data and a stack of choices containing both analytical and semi-analytic solutions. Some benchmark analyses have been performed to assess the performance of TTim with limited types of aquifer systems. This research focuses on the application of TTim to different aquifer systems and the investigation of TTim's performance compared to the other two softwares. In this study, fifteen aquifer tests have been simulated with TTim. Test 0 uses hypothetical data to verify TTim's capabilities of retrieving specified parameters and reporting accurate confidence interval. Test 1 through Test 10 are pumping tests which are taken from reported field experiments and are grouped as confined systems, leaky systems, and unconfined systems. Test 11 through Test 14 present four slug tests with different top boundaries and well construction. The values and confidence intervals of the calibrated parameters are compared to the results of AQTESOLV and MLU. Improvement of conceptual models is carried out by model structure adjustments and parameters set adjustments. Different models' performance are assessed by root-mean-squared-error and AKAIKE Information Criterion (AIC). Most of the pumping tests and slug tests can be conceptualized using either ModelMaq and Model3D within TTim. Model3D is recommended when conceptualizing unconfined systems. The top boundary needs to be specified as `confined', and an additional thin aquifer needs to be added to simulate the specific yield, which is calibrated separately. The performance of TTim is similar, in general, to AQTESOLV and MLU. Well construction parameters cannot be calibrated with AQTESOLV, and only one aquifer system is available. TTim is more flexible and accurate than AQTESOLV when the groundwater system has information of multi aquifers and well construction. Modifications of parameters to be calibrated and model structure have been carried out to improve TTim's performance. It is concluded that aquifers with multi subdivided layers perform better when the well is partially penetrating or the observation wells have different depths. Calibration of well construction parameters may also contributes to a better simulation, but they are usually sensitive to the initial values. It is important to note that adding parameters may give better results, but whether this is significant needs to be tested by the AIC criterion.","aquifer tests; semi-analytical model; conceptual model; parameters calibration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Shanghai sea dikes are built to protect shorelines, factories, inland buildings and other vulnerable coastal areas against wave action and storm surge. For this reason, there is an urgent need to check whether sea dike in Shanghai can function well. The intuitive influences are sea level rise, severe storm surge, and land subsidence, which affect sea dike functions. Sea dikes should withstand many failure mechanisms, and the objective of this research is to investigate failure probability for the 3 most important failure mechanisms of a specific sea dike in Shanghai Pudong under present and future climate conditions, which are overtopping, revetment failure and macro instability. The applied rates for absolute sea level rise in this research are 2.5 mm/yr from 2011 to 2030 and 5.0 mm/yr from 2031 to 2100 respectively. Therefore, sea level rise in 2100 is 375mm from 2019. Land subsidence rate in Shanghai is estimated at 6 mm/year after 2010, so the subsidence value is 486 mm till 2100 from 2019. Based on previous research, 38 severe typhoon events from 1990s are chosen as reference events to study severe wave conditions in Shanghai. For Shanghai, a severe typhoon event means the maximum average wind speed near the center of bottom layer is larger than 41.5 m/s, and it lasts more than 24 hours in the area near Shanghai (25° N-35° N and 115° E-125° E). These events are simulated with the software package Delft3D, which is an important tool for modeling of severe wave conditions under current and future circumstances. Characteristics of wind and pressure fields for typhoons are important inputs for Delft3D to model wave characteristics. As a result, from a Delft3D a simulated record of water level, peak period and significant wave height during a typhoon event is obtained, and the maximum overtopping discharge and maximum significant wave height during a storm event can then be analysed. For future Shanghai boundary condition study, sea level rise and land subsidence value are considered directly in Delft3D. Boundary conditions around a sea dike are an important role when investigating the dike failure probability. Both in current and future conditions, uncertainty in maximum overtopping discharge can be described with Weibull distribution, maximum significant wave height can be described with a lognormal distribution. The predicted distributions are tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. Based on fitted maximum overtopping discharge and maximum significant wave height, their probability density function is applied to calculate failure probability of overtopping and revetment failure. Failure is considered to be the probability that the overtopping discharge exceeds the critical value, which is defined mathematically by the limit state function. For overtopping and revetment failure mechanism, a probabilistic analysis called Monte Carlo simulation is used. Random samples of parameters are generated and are used with the limit state function to determine whether failure would occur. Fragility curves are constructed for each mechanism. A simplified method, called FOSM (first order second moment), is used to study the relative changes of macro instability between now and in the future.   Although not all failure mechanisms for the Pudong sea dike are taken into account, this study proves that the lower bound of Shanghai sea dike failure probability is 0.31 per year in the condition of severe storm events in the year 2100. However, under current conditions, the lower bound of failure probability of Pudong sea dike is 0.23 per year. In terms of these three main failure mechanisms, revetment and overtopping mechanisms contribute more to Pudong sea dike failure.","Shanghai; Sea dike; Reliability analysis; Delft3D; Sea level rise; Land subsidence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Correia, Gonçalo (graduation committee); Bijl, Peter (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","E-grocers are grocery markets which offer their assortment online and deliver a customer's groceries at home. For an e-grocer the quality of their delivery service is a crucial asset to create and maintain a loyal customer-base. Because the online share of the grocery market has grown rapidly over the last decade, there is an urgent need for e-grocer specific routing models. In parallel, the research community has made rapid developments in the fields of stochastic and dynamic routing models during the past decade. Those studies suggest that the use of stochastic and dynamic elements improves the performance of routing models for a large variety of applications. However, it is yet unresearched how these stochastic and dynamic routing models can be used to improve the last-mile delivery for e-grocers specifically. The intended outcome of this research is the formulation of a promising modelling approach to use stochastic and dynamic routing model elements to improve the performance of an e-grocer's routing model. In this thesis, first the objectives and requirements for an e-grocer's routing model are determined in more detail by means of a case-study at Dutch e-grocer Picnic. The strict requirements for an e-grocer's routing model are: \begin{enumerate*}[label=(\arabic*)] \item Offer customers a free one-hour delivery time window when they place an order. \item Offer free communication of a 20-minute delivery time window at the morning of the delivery. \item Calculation of the combinations of customers in a trip has to be completed within 45 minutes. \item The trip planning has to be calculated within 5 hours. \end{enumerate*} When these requirements are met, the objectives for the routing model are to maximize the on-time delivery performance and to minimize the operational costs. The on-time delivery performance is quantified by means of the on-time delivery rate and the rate of extreme lates (\geq 15 minutes late). The operational costs are quantified by means of the average time spent per delivery. Next, scientific literature on the topic of dynamic and stochastic routing models is studied. Based on the findings in this literature study, it is suggested to make a distinction between ``regular” deliveries and ``flexible” deliveries. Regular deliveries have to be delivered within a 20-minute delivery time window. Flexible deliveries allow for larger delivery time windows. Once the trip has departed, the presence of these flexible deliveries allows for dynamic re-optimization of the customer sequence in that trip. This strategy has the potential to improve the on-time delivery performance. Moreover, this approach does not incur large additional operational costs because the number of vehicles used for delivery remains the same. At e-grocers, limited computation time is available for the calculation of the combinations of customers in a trip. However, plenty of time is available to determine the exact trip planning. Therefore, the traditional vehicle routing problem is split into two separate problems which are solved one after the other: The customer-trip assignment problem and the sequencing problem. Then, different approaches for implementing the concept of flexible deliveries in an e-grocer's routing model are designed. Three different sequencing models are formulated to get insights in the benefits of a stochastic routing model: A deterministic sequencing model which resembles the current operations at Picnic (benchmark model), a stochastic sequencing model which uses a-priori simulation to choose the best solution out of a set of good solutions (simulation-based model), and a deterministic sequencing model which positions the flexible deliveries in the customer sequence of a trip in such a way that the effectiveness of re-optimization is maximized (heuristics-based model). In order to study the added value of a dynamic routing model, a deterministic re-optimization model is designed. In order to quantify the performance of a routing model which makes use of flexible deliveries and compare the different model variants, four different routing model configurations are investigated by means of a computational experiment. A configuration consists of a sequencing model and, in some cases, a re-optimization model. The computational experiment uses real historic test instances from e-grocer Picnic to evaluate the performance of the configurations. In addition, historic data from Picnic is used to simulate realisations of planned trip times. Two different types of customer-trip assignments are investigated: customer-trip assignments for a small vehicle and for a large vehicle. Moreover, two different sizes of the flexible delivery windows are studied: 60 minutes and 75 minutes. From the experimental results it can be concluded that the configurations including a re-optimization model outperform the static and deterministic benchmark configuration in terms of on-time delivery performance. However, re-optimization comes at the price of an increased average time spent per delivery. This can be explained by the fact that the re-optimization model optimizes the on-time delivery performance instead of the trip duration, resulting in larger average travel times. The effects of re-optimization become significant when 10\% or more of all deliveries is flexible. For this percentage of flexible deliveries, the number of late deliveries can be reduced by up to 18\% and the number of extreme lates can be reduced by up to 27\%, depending on the type of vehicle and the size of the flexible delivery windows. The simulation-based sequencing model proves to be effective without re-optimization for the large vehicle type. For the small vehicle type it needs the re-optimization model to significantly outperform the static and deterministic benchmark configuration. When the re-optimization model is included in the configuration, the simulation-based and heuristics-based sequencing models show similar performance in terms of on-time delivery rate. The configuration with the simulation-based approach results in a lower average time spent per delivery. However, the heuristics-based approach results in fewer extreme lates. In order to decide on the optimal routing model configuration for a specific e-grocer, the relative importance of the on-time delivery performance and the operational costs have to be specified. If an e-grocer is very cost-sensitive, the configuration consisting of the simulation-based sequencing model and the real-time re-optimization model would be optimal. However, if an e-grocer has more financial possibilities for an increase in operational costs the configuration including the heuristics-based sequencing model would be a better fit. Extending the flexible delivery windows results in a significant improvement of the on-time delivery performance of the configurations. However, the increased number of successful re-optimizations comes at the expense of an increased average time spent per delivery. The added value of extended flexible delivery windows is largest for the small vehicle type. When comparing the two types of vehicles studied, it becomes evident that the use of stochastic and dynamic routing model elements is more effective for the large vehicle type than for the small vehicle type.","e-grocer; routing problem; on-time delivery performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

Many applications, from a small to large scale, embrace this paradigm to deal with the difficulties of responding to events that happen asynchronously: programmers define ""operators"" that perform small, independent tasks on individual events. These operators are then connected to form a (usually asyclic) network of tasks performed on one or multiple streams. While very useful as can be witnessed by the vast amount of stream processing tools available to the industry, one problem remains difficult to tackle in this model: state. When comparing support for stateful operations in matured stream-processing systems, one will find that none of the systems agree on how state should be modeled. Some systems outright ignore state, while others provide ever different APIs to manage it. In this thesis, we present a small but versatile model that combines traditional stream processing with stateful operations from relational algebra, providing one uni- fied way of thinking about streams and state. To substantiate the models practicality, we present an end-to-end implementation of a real-world case study for Europe’s largest shipping container port, along with a performance analysis. Moreover, we assert that this model is not just tied to one specific stream-processing solution, but can be implemented with ease on any actor-based platform.","stream processing; Domain Specific Languages; Maritime Industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Software Technology","",""

Although a lot is still uncertain, we can say with confidence that the home workplace will preserve a prominent role. Young professionals, who are limited by space, require extra attention on the long haul. The assignment is to design a viable product/service system that enhances the young professional’s homeworking experience. An iterative design approach, enriched by other methods in design and entrepreneurship, helped me in solving this project. Working from home accelerated in almost every sector. The near future of office work is hybrid; we will work from home several days a week and several days from the office. Mostly young professionals encounter challenges. Their limited space makes maintaining a healthy work-life balance a vital challenge. Working at home, and working in the same room in particular, makes work-life boundaries dissolve and transitions disappear. If we ignore this growing problem, the Dutch workforce will go down on mental illness. “The home office facilitates a healthy work-life balance by creating smooth transitions between daily activities.” The physical office is an example of clear boundaries; the office is for work and home is not (or at least less). The time people spent in between these physical places helps them to transition mentally from work to private life. Based on principles and my own experiences, a combination of good time management (principle) and the change of scenery can recreate these boundaries and transitions when working from home. Therefore, I developed Sceny. Sceny can assist young professionals in time management and create new transitions while limited by space. A combination of smart LED bulbs, an app and a controller helps users in improving time management by notifying on transitions, giving quantified insights, timeboxing activities and establishing goals for different life quadrants,. Users feed the system with data by arranging scenes that support them in what they are doing. Different light settings prove to enhance user experiences, such as for focus work, creativity and relaxation. After work, the scene changes and indicates a transition to private life. A Proof of Concept aimed at validating the desirability and viability of the riskiest minimum concept features. This first iteration of Sceny was a service that offered pre-programmed smart lighting for “switching between work and private life with the push of a button”. Interviews verified the desirability but denied its viability. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) required better-argued features. The new version emphasises the work-life balance more using time management. Users set their boundaries (in time and scene), plan transitions, timebox activities and reflect with quantified insights. Continued validation of Sceny’s MVP on its problem-solution fit is a next step into building a viable business. This validation, together with the product-market fit, will take at least one year to complete. We aim at launching Sceny halfway of next year with young professionals in the IT service sector. This market shows the most viable opportunities for entry. Partnerships with business psychologists and coaches should increase these opportunities. Year two will be about growing and validating the business model fit. After that, we will expand and replicate markets.","Homeworking; Entrepreneurship; Young professionals; Lean Startup; Smart Homes; Strategic Design; Work-life balance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Previous research has not covered the Reynolds and Keulegan-Carpenter numbers in which energy generating devices are situated. The current research is focused on filling the gap and investigating the drag forces on these cylinders via means of experiments. Additional simulations focussing on the free surface and end effects were also conducted. The forces at play and the Morison equation to model these forces have been evaluated. It was discovered that in the investigated range, the drag and inertia coefficients depend on both Reynolds and Keulegan-Carpenter numbers. By analyzing the results of the experiments in the time and frequency domain, indications of vortex shedding and second-order harmonic wave forces, as well as forces from wave-wave interaction were found. The Morison equation itself is analyzed to find that it either underestimates or neglects these forces. By means of simulations, the effects of the free surface and the aspect ratio of the cylinder on the drag and inertia coefficients are found. Lastly, it is proposed to use a rewritten Morison equation to find the drag on a cylinder in a flow with irregular waves. This equation is found to describe the drag forces more accurately.","surface piercing cylinder; Morison; drag and inertia coefficients; high Reynolds; low Keulegan-Carpenter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

In order to gain insightinto the safety of such structures, assessment of the foundations is required.As part of an experimental framework assessing the safety of bridges and quaywalls in the city of Amsterdam, a number of piles are instrumented with fiberoptic sensors and load tested in compression. These tests aim to providedetailed information on the behavior of timber piles subjected to loading. Thisinformation can be used to determine the geotechnical bearing capacity of suchpiles. An in-depth analysis is conducted on 8 timber piles tested within thisframework.  The conducted analysis has resulted in a variation ofoutcomes. Without including the effects of residual loads, an average baseresistance of 130 kN is observed. Upon inclusion of residual loads the averagetrue base resistance increases to a value of 188 kN. The average shaftcapacities in the bearing sand layer for scenarios excluding and includingresidual effects are 48 and 60 kN respectively.  The correlation factor α<sub>p</sub> is derived usingthree cone resistance averaging techniques. The Koppejan method hasconsistently resulted in the highest derived α<sub>p</sub> factors withvalues of 1.09 and 1.61 for scenarios excluding and including residual loadsrespectively.  The scenario excluding residual effects has resulted in anaverage α<sub>s</sub>of 0.009 for the bearing sand layer. Upon inclusion of residual loads, thederived α<sub>s</sub>factor for the first sand layer amounts to 0.012. This increase in shear forcesis also observed in the Pleistocene peat layer. Therefore, residual loadsredistribute the capacity of the piles by increasing the shaft resistance inthe bearing sand and Pleistocene peat, while simultaneously decreasing theshear stresses in the Holocene layers above.  Conclusively, timber pile characteristics such as variationin geometry and mechanical properties have significant effects on the capacityof the piles. Additionally, these variations result in fluctuations in thecalculated load distribution along the pile. Local smoothing of thesefluctuations results in higher apparent loads, most specifically at the pilebase. Therefore, smoothing algorithms are not implemented in this analysis. Thevariation in diameter along the entire length of each pile directly affects theload distribution. Despite this influence, no trend is observed for thevariation of α<sub>p</sub> factors with respect to pile tip diameter. Anapparent relationship between the tapering of the pile in the bearing sandlayer and the derived α<sub>s</sub> factors suggests that tapering effectivelyincreases the shear forces along the shaft in that layer.  Furthermore, the usage of fiber optic sensors on woodenpiles has proven to be effective. The variation in local behavior of wood isclearly illustrated through the conducted analysis. As a consequence of thebiological nature of wood, the local behavior of wooden piles is best capturedby sensing technologies measuring strains at high spatial frequencies.  ","Bearing capacity; Geotechnical Bearing Capacity; Timber piles; wooden structure; Amsterdam; Foundations; Soil-structure interaction; geo-engineering; Fiber optic sensors; Pile load test","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Due to the ageing population and the availability of treatments, healthcare costs keep rising. Surgery is one of the big cost items in a hospital. Improvement of workflow, planning and process efficiency can aid in lowering the costs. Inefficiencies or the effect of improvements can only be detected through measurements. Therefore data is needed for analysis and for systems that improve process efficiency by being aware of surgical context. The workflow includes the entire procedure at the OR, not only the surgical part of the procedure. The presently used method for planning does not take profit from automatic data collection and analysis methods. Multiple techniques have been investigated in prior research, but no solution has been widely adopted in the operating room. A new approach is demonstrated that uses a Computer Vision technique called Human Pose Estimation. This technique detects human poses in image data. The generated data will be used to determine the location of medical personnel within the OR. Inspired by prior research, multiple areas are defined within the OR. The distribution of personnel over these areas is used to analyse the progress of a surgical procedure. This method can be seen as a replacement of dedicated sensors used in prior research. This approach makes the system non-intrusive, it does not disturb the surgical progress, and it is a versatile system that can be exploited further in future research. Next to the technical approach, the non-technical aspects are considered. This includes the laws involved, dealing with privacy and the approvals that are needed to start this type of medical research. For the video data, publicly available datasets are used. The datasets are investigated for their applicability to surgical progress recognition. For surgical progress recognition the performance of two different methods are tested, a handcrafted Decision Tree and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network. The Decision Tree produced a recognition rate for five different phases of 93%. This score is promising, but due to limitation by the data, the number of phases limited. A broader set of phases, will include phases that are harder to detect. The 1D CNN scored a recognition rate of 70% for the same phases. The amount of available data for the 1D CNN seemed to negatively affect the network in learning the relation between input features and the output. Further research should be targeted at creating a dataset specifically for the goal of surgical progress recognition. This new dataset should have a higher framerate and contain a larger number of procedures, recorded in a regular OR. Considering the minimalist approach, the results are promising for future research and might be able to drive a dynamic planning system in future applications.","surgical progress recognition; Human Pose Estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Wastewater discharged from the domestic household has proven to be a potential source for resource recovery. Apart from wastewater, kitchen organic waste contains an enormous amount of energy in terms of organic content and nutrients such as TKN and TPH. Now that the disposal of waste into landfills is prohibited in most parts of Europe, one of the options is to divert the organic waste to wastewater treatment plants using kitchen waste grinders (KWG). Since KWG is a water-consuming appliance, the installation of KWG with water conservation technologies may be a viable option in the future. This can aid efficient recovery of resources and reduce the drinking water demand. The evolution towards sustainable urban sanitation will lead to several positive and negative effects. Some of the positive effects, apart from resource recovery, are the possibility to postpone the enlargement of existing sewer systems, to construct new sewers of smaller pipe diameter and to lower energy consumption for sewage pumping. While the negative effects are blockage of sewer due to reduced flow rates, increased sedimentation and release of malodour in the contemporary sewerage system and increased treatment costs due to increase in COD oxidation and nitrogen or phosphorus removal. Eventually the low flow-high load wastewater needs to be transported through sewers and treated locally (decentralised treatment). In this study, an attempt was made to investigate the effect of coupling the effluent from KWG at various penetration rates such as 100%, 75%, 50% and 25% with water conservation scenarios on hydraulic and quality parameters in the sewerage system. Water conservation scenarios were onsite greywater and rainwater reuse and application of ultra-low water demand appliances. SIMDEUM was upgraded with the addition of an extra appliance in the form of KWG to generate stochastic discharge patterns with appliance specific wastewater flows and quality. The data generated was incorporated into the sewer network model, InfoWorks ICM to analyze the impact of the addition of KWG with water conservation strategies on the contemporary sewer network. The results obtained showed that there is an increase in the mass load of COD, TKN and TPH of 118%, 84% and 90% respectively and reduction in flow, velocity and shear stress of up to 54%, 49% and 74% respectively for the application of water conservation strategies with KWG. This substantiated the fact that the contemporary sewer system is not efficient in transporting the wastewater generated due to the addition of KWG along with water conservation strategies at the household level. A new sewer design with smaller diameters and steep slopes was used to study if the low flow-high load wastewater can be safely transported, in terms of adequate self-cleansing velocity and shear stress. The results from the investigation of new sewer design showed that 100% and 75% implementation of KWG with water conservation technologies will achieve self-cleansing capacity which will help prevent clogging and sedimentation for a piping network of 110mm diameter at a slope of 1:160. KWG market penetration rates of lower than 50% along with water conservation strategies might face issues of sedimentation and clogging. In conclusion, the up-gradation of SIMDUEM with KWG was successful to generate stochastic discharge patterns. This research has demonstrated that the application of KWG along with water conservation strategies may aid in resource recovery and reducing freshwater demand in the urban water cycle. The accomplishment of implementation of KWG with water conservation strategies is not realistic in the contemporary sanitary system however, this transition can be adopted in new urban developments with efficient design of wastewater transport and decentralized treatment system. Further research is required into the feasibility of a decentralised resource recovery system for the implementation of KWG with water conservation strategies.","Kitchen waste grinders; Urban sewerage system; Water conservation technology; Hydraulic modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Knowledge of seafloor topography (bathymetry) is increasingly important as coastal environments are unprecedentedly stressed by climate change and anthropogenic pressure. The bathymetry of shallow nearshore waters is yet marginally monitored due to costly and time-intensive survey techniques. Methods to obtain satellite derived bathymetry (SDB) have become increasingly valuable. Mapping temporal change is however challenging, because the majority of these methods remain heavily dependent on situ observations. This thesis introduces an SDB approach to estimate temporal bathymetric changes, which omits the need for synchronous in situ data. The approach is based on a reference image correction method that enables direct comparison of multitemporal imagery and temporal extrapolation of a conventionally-trained bathymetry estimation model (BEM). Research focused on pre-processing multispectral imagery, developing a bathymetry estimation model and estimating bathymetry for times of absent in situ data. The proposed method is demonstrated with a case study in the Dutch Wadden Sea; a site characterised by dynamic morphology, high turbidity and homogeneous bottom type. A log-linear estimation model is obtained by linear regression on in situ observations and the three visible bands of Sentinel-2 imagery. Scarcity of high-quality Sentinel-2 imagery is managed by combing multiple images into a six-month composite. The availability of two sets of vaklodingen in situ observations allowed for training and testing two bathymetry estimation models (BEM 2016 and BEM 2019) and for cross-validating the depth estimates after a three-year extrapolation of these models. Bathymetry is estimated for times of absent in situ data by temporal extrapolation of the two estimation models. The extrapolation showed estimation of shallow bathymetric structures in up to four metre water depth with an RMSE of approximately one metre. Additionally, the migration direction of these bathymetric structures is successfully estimated. Within the tested three-year time frame, predictive power did not decrease. These results imply that estimation performance is governed by composite quality and predictive power of the bathymetry estimation model. The limited influence of temporal extrapolation on estimation performance suggests that the availability of high-quality satellite imagery and one set of non-synchronous in situ observations is sufficient to estimate bathymetry for times of absent in situ data. The proposed method potentially provides a tool for mapping temporal bathymetric changes of nearshore zones across the globe.","Satellite Derived Bathymetry; Multispectral Imagery; Bathymetric Changes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","53.584421, 6.621371"

It is characterized by uniform heat flux and can be achieved when fuel and preheated oxidant jets are mixed into a strong recirculating flow. It is a complex process which combines multiple physical phenomena such as, heat transfer and reactions in a turbulent flow and is difficult to capture numerically via simple Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Therefore, appropriate turbulence, chemistry, radiation and turbulence-chemistry interaction models are required to address this combustion regime via computational modeling. The present work tries to tackle this issue by conducting a comparative study of different radiation, turbulence and chemistry models for the simulation of a labscale MILD combustion furnace using RANS CFD simulations. This assessment was conducted in two steps. Firstly, the importance of radiative heat transfer in furnaces was investigated, by simulating an axisymmetric oxycombustion furnace using advanced radiation models. The SLW, Domain-based WSGG and Cell-based WSGG models were evaluated using simple chemistry and turbulence models. The results were validated based on the work of Webb et al and experimental results. It was concluded that detailed simulation of the radiative gas properties is important and directly influences the resulting temperature field, especially in the bulk flow region. Secondly, a detailed evaluation of a Dutch natural gas fired Delft lab-scale furnace that is operating in MILD combustion was conducted. For the turbulence modeling, the Standard, the Modified Standard, the Realizable k − ε and the k − ω SST Models were compared firstly qualitatively, based on velocity and reaction field contours, and secondly, quantitatively, based on available LDA velocity measurements. The influence of the chemistry modeling was evaluated in two parts. Firstly, the qualitative effect of changing the Cξ constant of the EDC model on temperature and reaction zones of the GRI-Mech 3.0, the DRM-19, the KEE58 and Chen mechanisms, was investigated. And secondly, the quantitative effect on the use of the GRI-Mech 3.0, the KEE58, Chen and Lu-30, based on CARS temperature measurements was researched. Lastly, the influence of the radiation model was investigated qualitatively and quantitatively using the standard 1-RTE domain based WSGG, a 4-RTE WSGG, a cell-based WSGG and the SLW model. <br/>Out of the mechanisms coupled with the EDC, the GRI-Mech 3.0 performs well. Of the radiative properties models the domain based WSGG performs worse compared to the other models. The cell based WSGG performs similarly to the more advanced spectral and non-grey (4-RTE) models and has lower computational cost. For these reasons, the best overall combination for the studied flameless furnace is found to be the combination of Standard k−ε model, standard EDC with GRI-Mech 3.0 and cell based WSGG.","MILD; Flameless Combustion; CFD; Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Currently it is mandatory to have an on-board steward in the SAV. The technology has been maturing to have completely autonomous vehicles without the need of steward on-board. However, there are many obstacles, some of which are addressed in the study; namely perceived safety, emergency control, accessibility for elderly population, infrastructural modifications, added vehicle features required, additional training required for stewards and technological awareness. The effect of these factors on different scenarios formulated are done using a multi-actor multi criteria analysis (MAMCA). The actors chosen for the analysis are the road authority and the public transport operator. The analysis show that the scenarios with stewards obtain a better score than the scenarios without, which is expected. As for the scenarios without stewards, the one with the highest score is when the SAV runs on dedicated infrastructure with a fixed schedule for both the actors. In addition, a questionnaire study is done to gather the opinion of stewards as well. The questionnaire results show that extra training is indeed required for the stewards to manage any emergency situations. Moreover, the stewards report that the frequency of such emergency situations is high and that the technology has a long way to go for SAVs to function without stewards on-board.

The variant, titled Online Adaptive Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (OA-ADMM) aims to unify the application of ADMM to online systems, i.e. systems where fast and adaptive real-time optimization is crucial, into one framework. OA-ADMM introduces two user-designed functions: the similarity function (a forgetting factor between two time steps of the online system) and the adaptation function (adjusting the penalty parameters between updates). The similarity function is what allows OA-ADMM to be applied to online systems where conventional optimization is too slow; the adaptation function allows the user to adjust the online feasibility of the system. We prove convergence in the static case and give requirements for online convergence. Combining OA-ADMM and MPC allows for robust decentralized motion planning and control that seamlessly integrates decentralized conflict resolution, instead of using separate subsystems or hierarchical optimization. The additional robustness is achieved by using the adaptation function of OA-ADMM as an additional safety measure, allowing the prioritization of certain constraints for (nearly) unsafe states, whilst the similarity function allows optimization at the desired control frequency. This method is compared with convention ADMM in Matlab, resulting in significant improvements in robustness and conflict resolution speed. Finally, we compare our OA-ADMM and MPC based decentralized conflict resolution method against conventional decentralized conflict resolution methods in the CARLA vehicle simulator. The results show that the OA-ADMM based method has improved performance, safety, robustness, and generality compared with traditional methods. The method also has fewer requirements in terms of prior knowledge (e.g., the geometry of the intersection), making it usable in almost any situation.","Cooperative autonomous systems; Optimization algorithms; Transportation systems; decentralized collision avoidance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, when integrated in a combined heat and power system, can yield high efficiencies in the conversion from biomass to thermal and electrical energy. One of the challenges that this process faces is the damaging effects of the contaminants that are formed in the gasification of biomass fuels. These damage effects include the clogging up of lines, de-activation of the catalysts and a decreased carbon conversion. Among these contaminants, tars, particulate matter, HCl and H2S are the most prominent and can cause severe damage on downstream equipment, interfere with electrochemical reactions and pressure drops, which all negatively affect the SOFC performance. This study focuses on the effectiveness of a re-designed high-temperature gas cleaning unit on removing these contaminants. Under the FlexiFuel-SOFC project, which aims to develop a highly efficient fuel flexible biomass CHP system, an integrated system consisting of a gasifier, gas cleaning unit and a SOFC has been built in the laboratories of BIOS Bioenergiesysteme. HCl, H2S and tar contents in the syngas were analyzed at different points in the process. The operating temperatures are monitored to see if the design parameters are achieved. It is critical for each reactor/component to reach the design temperature, as this can greatly influence the gasification process, the effectiveness of catalysts and fuel cell bio- syngas to electrical energy conversion. The temperature evaluation shows a normal heating up of the gasifier and reactors during the test runs. The design temperature parameters were achieved. The tar content analysis shows the most abundant tar compounds were naphthalene, toluene and phenol. The total tar content in the syngas was measured on two test days and was found to be 3.64 and 3.37 g/nM3 before gas cleaning and 0.11 and 0.41 g/Nm3 after gas cleaning, which comes down to a 97% and 88% resp. reduction in total tar content.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-12-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Where green and blue infrastructure are expected to mitigate some of the impacts of heat waves or storm events for the urban environment, current assessment methodologies to prove so are lacking. To illustrate the viability of urban Nature-based solutions as alternatives to existing grey infrastructure, this research first looked into assessing the benefits of 4 urban ecosystem services (ES), namely Urban Cooling, Stormwater Runoff Catchment, Carbon Storage and Coastal Protection services. With The Hague as the area of interest, the research was successful in demonstrating positive impacts towards climate resilience for each of the 4 studied ES. First, the presence of urban natural infrastructure was shown to reduce the urban heat island effect by up to 1.5 °C. Green urban areas were further revealed to catch over 50 % of stormwater runoff for major storm events as well as being responsible for the majority of urban carbon storage. Lastly, coastal forests and dunes were proven to be a contributing reason in keeping the overall coastal exposure risk towards inundation and erosion at low to moderate levels. While the initial results of the ES analysis speak for themselves, further evaluation of the employed methodologies revealed major concerns in terms of output consistency and transparency between different tools, such as InVEST and Natural Capital. As the outputs of seemingly analogous models varied greatly and a certain obscurity towards methodological background processes persisted, the results of urban specific assessment models of current ES mapping and evaluating tools require further validation in order to be universally acceptable. The conclusion of this study can help advance the inclusion of urban nature-based solutions into urban policy and planning exercises, while simultaneously raising awareness towards the need for further development of common urban specific ES assessment methodologies.","Spatial analysis; Nature Based Solutions; urban ecosystems; Ecosystem Service Assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","","52.0705,4.3007"

Purpose: Improve the life cycle management of AI from a theoretical and practical perspective through conducting a comprehensive study of the life cycle management of artificial intelligence models; a solution to a specific topic/research gap (i,e., the democratisation of AI). Method: We carried out systematic mapping research on the life cycle management of AI models. Regarding AI democratisation, we researched literature pertaining to the democratisation of existing AI, compared with existing solutions, and improved AI from the perspective of generating model documents. Results and Conclusion: The systemic map was obtained by categorising and counting related publications, improving the existing model document framework, and proposing a solution to automatically generate model documents, thereby improving AI democratisation.","machine learning; artificial intelligence; lifecycle management; systematic mapping study; AI documentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

Even more so, for light and agile platforms such as multi-copters. Due to their unpredictable flight path, their motion must be accurately measured during data acquisition, and compensated for during processing. To obtain a focused SAR image, each pulse location must be accurately known to ensure that each pulse is added coherently to the imaging grid. Traditionally, this is achieved with an Inertial Navigation System (INS). While an INS can provide reasonable performance, its weight and size are often a constraint for agile platforms, limiting the available options and attainable accuracy.<br/><br/>In this study, we perform an analysis on the applicability of an omnidirectional radar array for explicitly estimating the motion of a multi-copter platform, and improving on the positioning accuracy achieved by the on board INS. Building on existing 1D SAR motion compensation techniques, we develop new methods for estimating the 3D motion of the radar platform by estimating its height and velocity. In addition, we also present a novel 3D autofocus technique termed multi-beam autofocus. This technique allows for the correction of 3D trajectory errors from pulse to pulse by exploiting the beamforming capabilities of the array, and focusing multiple regions as the image is created.<br/><br/>Using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), we obtain position estimates from the radar velocity measurements based on the last known INS position. We experimentally verify that using our velocity estimation method alone, the positioning performance is already improved compared to that of a state-of-the-art INS, allowing for INS-free imaging using arbitrary flight paths. This enables imaging in GNSS-denied environments, and has the potential to further reduce the weight of the platform. We also show that fusing the estimates obtained from our method with the existing INS output yields an additional performance increase in terms of SAR image focus, improving the resolvability and detectability of weak targets. The presented results open further avenues of research, not only in agile SAR imaging but also in autonomous GNSS-denied navigation.","Synthetic Aperture Radar; Signal Processing; Sensor fusion; drone; positioning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-20","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","At many airports, the arrival and departure demand often outpaces the available airport capacity. Therefore, the flowof arriving and departing aircraft needs to be controlled to ensure safe and efficient operations. Many airports have been implementing systems that provide electronic assistance for air traffic control in planning and sequencing the flow of arriving and departing aircraft. Those systems are called the ArrivalManager and the DepartureManager. At the moment the two systems do not take each other’s traffic situation into account. Arriving and departing aircraft are accepted to enter the same airspace, even though no information exchange exists between the two. The lack in information exchange is not problematic for airports operating independent arrival and departure runways, arriving aircraft paths do not hinder departing aircraft paths. However, for dependent runways, when aircraft arrivals hinder departing aircraft, and vice versa, the lack of information exchange between the two systems, ATC will not be able to fit as many departures into the arrival stream as is planned by the Departure Manager. This can cause severe (surface-) congestion problems at airports that rely on dependent runways. This study focused on the interaction between arriving and departing aircraft for dependent arrival and departure runway combinations and the magnitude of the resulting arrival and departure capacity interference. With this knowledge, this research developed and assessed strategies for coordination between Arrival Management and Departure Management. First, the uncoordinated Arrival and Departure Manager (ADMAN) was developed in BlueSky Open Air Traffic Simulator to represent the current management of arrivals and departures; the AMAN and DMAN schedule inbound and outbound independently from one another. Second, the coordinated ADMAN was developed in BlueSky Open Air Traffic Simulator as well. The coordinated ADMAN includes three different coordination modules between the AMAN and DMAN that aims to increase the operational efficiency of dependent arrival and departure runway combinations. Each of the implemented coordination modules checks the number of departure slots that are available in the scheduled arrival stream and intervene if necessary, taking into account different assumptions. To obtain insight into the future magnitude of arrival and departure capacity interference and to demonstrate the for a coordination mechanism between the management of arrivals and departures, fast-time simulations were performed with the uncoordinated ADMAN. This experiment used an arrival and departure runway combination with amissed approach dependency to assess future arrival and departure capacity interference. To express the severeness of arrival and departure capacity interference, capacity was used as Key Performance Area (KPA). The results showed that if the arrival load would increase, due to RECAT and TBS, the arrival and departure capacity interference worsens. These results demonstrated the need for coordination mechanism between the management of arriving and departing aircraft. A second experiment was set-up to assess the performance of the different coordination modules implemented in the uncoordinated ADMAN. The three coordination modules were evaluated in terms of capacity, delay, coordination module interventions and ATCO workload by performing fast-time simulations. Like the first experiment, the second experiment used an arrival and departure runway combination with a missed approach dependency to test the modules for different levels of arrival load during morning and evening arrival peaks. The results showed that the departure capacity could be increased, and departure delay could be decreased, when the AMAN meters the arriving aircraft as a function of the departure ground situation. As this research set the start for coordinated arrival and departure management for dependent runway operations, other concepts could be developed tomitigate the effect of arrival and departure capacity interference. Furthermore, to improve the realism of both the uncoordinated ADMAN and coordinated ADMAN, it is recommended to upgrade the Air Traffic Control module.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-20","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Despite the high amount of tooth removal procedures carried out each year, scientific understanding of these procedures is not present. Knowledge of force and torque behaviour is limited and knowledge about movements has never been subject to scientific research before. This study is an initial attempt to describe the factors that influence tooth removal in terms of forces, torques and movements. In-vitro measurements were performed that resulted in a dataset containing force, torque and movement time series of 181 human demonstrations of tooth extractions. This report showed how feature engineering and classification modelling were employed to find tooth removal explaining parameters in the dataset. The feature engineering process led to numerical features describing the force and movement (rotation) time series. The rotation features were found to be most descriptive in describing differences in tooth removal procedures. This introduced five distinct rotation strategies that grouped the human demonstrations based on similarity of extraction strategy. These groups have been used as classification labels in the supervised learning process. A Naive Bayes algorithm and a Logistic Regression algorithm were implemented as prediction models. These models showed that while the rotation features contributed the most to the prediction performance, there was need for additional force features to reach maximum prediction performance. The results showed how feature engineering and classification modelling are the first steps in understanding the procedure of tooth removal.","Feature Engineering; Classification; Tooth Removal; Understanding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Physical activity can be seen as an essential component of human health as it can contribute to reducing the risk at several diseases, such as diabetes, depression, and several types of cancer (World Health Organization, 2010, p.10). Physical activity behaviour is influenced by a high variety of variables, ranging from personal variables to the physical environment. The composition of public spaces can facilitate or hinder adolescent physical activity behaviour. Although a lot of research has been done already and studies increasingly included the physical environment, research shows inconsistencies regarding similar variables (e.g. Ding, Sallis, Kerr, Lee, &amp; Rosenberg, 2011). This makes it difficult to apply the knowledge in urban design practice. The objective of this thesis is to explore the role of urban design in contributing to increase activity levels of adolescents using quantitative statistics. Literature review is used to identify attributes of (adolescent) physical activity behaviour. From this review spatial attributes are selected to research the preferences of adolescents to visit public spaces for physical activity. A choice based conjoint analysis (CBCA) is used to estimate the relative importance of ten spatial attributes for adolescent physical activity in outdoor public space. To illustrate how such statistical method can be used to inform urban design a square in Westland, the Netherlands is selected as a test case to transform. Westland showed to be the least green municipality, and adolescents in Westlands appeared less active than the Dutch average. The attributes that showed significantly important from the survey were used to analyse and transform an existing public space. Choice based conjoint analysis can be a valuable method to use in urban research and design, as one can identify user preferences before actually transforming the physical environment. However it is important to carefully define and use the attributes for the analysis, and to avoid misinterpretation as much as possible. Choice based conjoint analysis can identify <i>what </i>spatial attributes are important and with that an urban designer can show <i>how </i>these can be implemented in urban design. ","Physical Activity; Public Space; Urban Design; Adolescents; Westland; Choice Based Conjoint Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","When building a convolutional neural network, many design choices have to be made. In the case of Deepfake detection, there is no readily implementable recipe that guides these choices. This research aims to work towards understanding the effects of design choices in the case of Deepfake detection, using the Python library Keras and publicly available datasets. The choices analysed are dataset composition, preprocessing, dropout rate, batch size, network architecture, and specific dataset. We also analyse the difference between training a network on original images and DCT-residuals of images. Lastly, we analyse the networks' generalisation and robustness capabilities. The goal of these experiments is to work towards a readily implementable recipe for Deepfake detection algorithms. Furthermore, this research provides an overview of image manipulation algorithms, an overview of recent research into convolutional networks, and an extensive overview of the Deepfake detection research field. To analyse dataset composition, we used different subsets of FaceForensics++, with different numbers of frames per video. We trained a shallow network, containing only four convolutional layers, on all three datasets. The dataset with one frame per video was the only one that did not result in immediate overfitting, although it contained less than two thousand frames in total. We continued with the small dataset and tested different preprocessing settings and dropout rates on our shallow network. We found that preprocessing and dropout were not able to increase the maximum achievable accuracy, although they were able to curtail overfitting. It is possible that accuracy did not increase due to the high variety of artefacts in FaceForensics++. Batch size also does not have any effect on the maximum achievable accuracy. However, the runtime required for training a network increases considerably as the batch size decreases. We tested DenseNet-121, Inception-v3, ResNet-152, VGG16, VGG19, Xception, and our shallow network on three different datasets: FaceForensics++, Celeb-df, and DeeperForensics-1.0. The goal of this experiment was to find what type of network is most suited for detecting Deepfakes with publicly available datasets of small size but high variation. We also wanted to see if there were differences in performance achieved on the different datasets. Although all networks except the shallow one were pretrained on ImageNet, three of the different networks tested immediately overfitted on all three datasets used: DenseNet-121, Inception-v3, and XceptionNet. The other networks encountered most difficulties with Celeb-df, on which none of the networks managed to reach 70% accuracy before overfitting. The easiest network to train on was DeeperForensics-1.0, on which our shallow network achieved 92.5% accuracy. However, when testing the networks' robustness, none of the networks trained on DeeperForensics-1.0 reached an accuracy higher than random on Celeb-df or FaceForensics-1.0. Shallow networks might be better suited for Deepfake detection on our small dataset. The shallow model and VGG16 achieved the highest accuracies. VGG19's performance is close to VGG16's. However, ResNet-152 is the deepest network used in this research and performs better than the shallower DenseNet, Inception-v3, and Xception. Lastly, training our networks on DCT-residuals was supposed to help our network focus on statistical image content rather than semantical image content. However, performance on DCT-residuals was at best similar to performance on original images. Our suggestions for continuation of this research are to experiment with different input sizes and other types of residual filters, collect larger (and higher quality) datasets with high variety, and to use interframe detection.","Deepfake Detection; Deepfake; Convolutional Neural Network; Imaqe Manipulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","To meet the goal of the European Union of becoming climate neutral in 2050, the Netherlands and North West Europe will integrate more and more variable renewable energy sources (VRE) into their power system. The uncertain weather conditions on which the VRE are dependent, will increase the need for a more flexible power system. An important measurement to control the balance of supply and demand in a power system with a lot of variable renewable energy is curtailing the excess power of renewable energy. However, the large amount of renewable energy that is currently integrated will result in an increase in lost power through curtailment. This increase in lost power can result in renewable energy projects (current and future) not getting the expected economic benefits, which can result in less investments in these projects. To prevent this, it is necessary to reduce this curtailment by either storing the otherwise lost power with batteries or by using it through sector coupling possibilities such as power-to-heat, power-to-gas, or power-to-mobility. The aim of this study is to research the potential of sector coupling options and batteries in utilizing the lost power from VRE curtailment by means of the IRENA FlexTool. In order to reach the objective of this study, two scenarios were used on two scales, the Netherlands and North West Europe and were modeled with the IRENA FlexTool. In order to compare the different sector coupling possibilities and batteries, an optimal design of experiments was used. The results of the sector coupling and batteries in this design of experiment were compared on their levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and the loss of load and curtailment of the power system. The study showed that the IRENA FlexTool is better suited to model smaller energy systems to gain a quick insight into the flexibility issues of loss of load and curtailment, instead of modelling larger complex energy systems. The modelling results of the IRENA FlexTool shows that the costs for utilizing the lost power of curtailment and avoiding loss of load differs for the Netherlands and North West Europe. For North West Europe, batteries have the lowest LCOE when almost all lost power trough curtailment is used. Hydrogen provides a good solution for the loss of load. Therefore, both battery storage and hydrogen could be a good substitution for natural gas in NWEU. For the Netherlands hydrogen storage is the option with the lowest LCOE when all lost power through curtailment is used and loss of load is avoided. Therefore, hydrogen could provide a good substitution for natural gas in the Netherlands. The difference in LCOE can be explained through the allocation of the power use of batteries and sector coupling, but this is not included in this study. Future research should focus on the interaction between the different options. This could provide useful results on how to efficiently allocate and use battery storage and sector coupling, when they are used in combination with each other.","Renewable Energy Curtailment; IRENA FlexTool; Sector Coupling; Battery storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Refactorings improve software quality and maintainability if applied correctly. However, identifying refactoring opportunities is a challenging problem for developers and researchers alike. In a recent work, machine learning algorithms have shown great potential to solve this problem. This thesis used RefactoringMiner to detect refactorings in open-source Java projects and computed code metrics by static analysis. We defined the refactoring opportunity detection problem as a binary classification problem and deployed machine learning algorithms to solve it. The models classify between a specific refactoring type and a stable class using the metrics as features. Multiple machine learning experiments were designed based on the results of an empirical study of the refactorings. For this work, we created the largest data set of refactorings in Java source code to date, including 92800 open-source projects from GitHub with a total of 33.67 million refactoring samples. The data analysis revealed that Class- and Package-Level refactorings occur most frequently in early development stages of a class, Method- and Variable-Level refactorings are applied uniformly during the development of a class. The machine learning models achieve high performance ranging from 80\% to 89\% total average accuracy for different configurations of the refactoring opportunity prediction problem on unseen projects. Selecting a high Stable Commit Threshold (K) improves the recall of the models significantly, but also strongly reduces the generalizability of the models. The Random Forest (RF) classifier shows great potential for the refactoring opportunity detection, it can adapt to various configurations of the problem, identifies a large variety of relevant metrics in the data and is able to distinguish different refactoring types. This work shows that for solving the refactoring opportunity detection problem a large variety of metrics is required, as a small set of metrics cannot represent the complexity of the problem.","Refactoring; software engineering; machine learning; data set; open source; Java","en","master thesis","","","","","","http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4267824 Appendix: Data Analysis and Machine Learning Experiments ShowEdit http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4267711 Appendix: Refactoring Data Set ShowEdit https://github.com/refactoring-ai/Data-Collection Repository link Refactoring Mining Tool ShowEdit https://github.com/refactoring-ai/Machine-Learning Repository link Machine Learning Pipeline","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

With the rise of the computer and internet, programming-related work environments have become very large and globally distributed, implying a friction when using agile in these environments. This study aims to explore what challenges occur when using agile in very-large globally distributed environments and explore for practices that can be used to deal with them. To do this, a variety of research methods is used to gain insight, those being a systematic literature review (SLR), interviews and online surveys. We identify 50 challenges that may be encountered and 72 practices that can be used to combat them. Our online survey verified that all found challenges are frequently encountered in practice and the majority have a significant impact when encountered. However we also identified multiple practices that are used often to combat certain high-impact challenges. The most important practices were identified to be training and coaching. Experts were invited to fill in an online survey to generate possible learning goals. These learning goals are used to create an education program prototype for very-large scale globally distributed agile software engineering. As examples, 4 use cases in different environments are provided to show the prototype can be used to construct a matching training program.

This process of chance in favour of attracting more affluent residents can lead to the complete displacement of local communities to less favourable neighbourhoods, differentially affecting segregation levels of vulnerable local residents. Stratford is an area in East London, which has primarily been shaped by the forces of the first industrial revolution, but is ongoing major structural transformations that are accelerating the processes of deindustrialization, economic restructuring to a tertiary economy and gentrification; as a result traditional working class groups are driven out the area. Simultaneously, there is little comprehensive national design guidance; as a consequence the local government struggles to develop a design framework that can mitigate challenges related to these issues. Therefore, the aim of the research is to explore reconfiguration scenarios of a neighbourhood in Stratford with regards to creating affordances that both can integrate local and global communities. In doing so, the research explores and tries to understand the role of design as well. Before exploring the reconfiguration scenarios, the research starts with a dma (density, mix and access) analysis of Stratford area in order to understand its socio-spatial structure. Based on the analysis, three key areas were identified: the detached high street, the combined high street and the connected high street. Each high street typology has completely different dma values and therefore have difference performances and capacity for change. The analysis concludes with the fact that the detached high street has the most potential for development. Therefore, the design analysis reflects on how different strategies can create the affordance of coexistence located on the detached high street and its surroundings. The following three scenarios were developed: soft strategy, high street strategy and the super strategy. Each strategy will be reflected on how they change the dma values as well as their capacity to implement different development schemes and qualities. By means of design exploration, it became clear that choosing more obvious solutions such as soft strategies and corridor development completely neglects the social infrastructure surrounding the detached high street, as well as lack the capacity to allow the implementation of different development schemes (especially schemes that work as a buffer against gentrification). As a result, these strategies can have unwanted consequences such as the exclusion of local people in certain areas. The super mix strategy, however, has the potential to create an environment affording the coexistence of the global and local, but will be difficult to implement because it requires the development of more extensive types of schemes, thus requiring both inducements and regulation, partnerships with government and non-profit actors. Notwithstanding the thesis has showed there is great potential for development that includes both the local and the global, and therefore hopes to inspire London’s governmental and private actors to invest their time and effort in creating a regulatory environment that could allow strategies such as the super strategy.","Stratford; Global; Local; Urban regeneration; Density","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","51.542276, 0.002361"

However, they cannot recreate complex geological features existing in realistic reservoir models such as faults and irregular reservoir boundaries. Corner point grids can represent these geological characteristics and can be adapted and represent any reservoir. In the subsurface reservoirs is usually typical to find fractures networks, and it is necessary to simulate the effect of them in reservoir models based on corner point grids. Although several works validate the precision of embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM) for representing fractures in cartesian grids, very few studies have been presented to examine the accuracy of fracture modeling in geologically complex reservoir models. In this work, the novel discrete fracture model, the Projection-based Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (pEDFM), is implemented to represent fractures in reservoir models based on corner point grids. pEDFM provides additional features to the EDFM and is applied to explicitly and consistently define fractures. It implements independent grid sets for the fractures (described as lower-dimensional domains) and the rock matrix irrespective of the grid domains’ complex geometrical shapes. The suitability of the original pEDFM method has been expanded to a fully generic 3D geometry, and it lets on including fractures with any orientation on the corner point grid cells, an important development for the method’s viability in field-scale applications. Further to the geometrical flexibility of EDFM, matrix-matrix and fracture matrix connectivities are readapted to account for the projection of fracture plates on the interfaces. This allows for consistent modeling of fractures with generic conductivity values, from high conductive networks to impermeable flow barriers. A fully implicit scheme is used to get a discrete system with two main unknowns (i.e., pressure and phase saturation) on both matrix and fracture networks. Several 3D test cases of reservoirs models with complex corner point grids and fracture networks arbitrary designed in them are presented to demonstrate the devised method’s accuracy and applicability. The results show that the pEDFM implementation for two-phase flow is highly successful for modeling fractures with a broad range of conductivity on field-scale reservoir models.","corner point grid; pedfm; Fracture modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-18","","","","","",""

The failure statistics show that the interruptions in the medium voltage have a high contribution in the mean outage time per year per customer. The interruptions in the medium voltage grid are often caused by failure of circuit components mainly the cables, joints, and terminations which account for 73% of the failures. The occurrence of these interruptions and their duration can be limited by proper maintenance measures. Partial discharge diagnostics provide a way for the condition assessment of the circuit insulation. The Smart Cable Guard (SCG) systems from DNV GL help in continuous monitoring of the medium voltage cable circuits during the circuit operation and aid the network operators in maintaining the MV grid. With its non-intrusive monitoring characteristic, we see that the SCG systems provide the measurement of partial discharges (PD) occurring in the cable circuit. Moreover, the partial discharge measurements consists of the information about the location of each observed discharge event along with the time of its occurrence and its corresponding discharge magnitude observed in picocoulombs for every minute. The partial discharge events occurring in the circuit are subjected to evaluation from an expert at DNV GL control rooms who qualitatively assigns a warning level (Level 1, 2, 3, or Noise) to the observed pattern of discharge events. This manual process of evaluation of PD events and assignment of warnings to them is a laborious task and the network operator has to rely on the availability of the expert and his/her accurate assessment. To reduce this dependence for the network operator, Alliander in collaboration with the DNV GL experts is developing an automated decision support tool to identify the partial discharge events and to aid the operator and the expert in evaluating the condition assessment of the cable network. This thesis proposes a clustering methodology using the ST-DBSCAN density-based technique for identifying high-density discharge events or `areas of interest' in the PD data obtained from the SCG systems. The clusters identified from the method are further evaluated by extracting their features or characteristics using the PD data attributes as well as describing their<br/>characteristics based on the context of the circuit. The performance of the clustering method is validated using the DNV GL warnings by formulating performance indicators and metrics to measure the performance. The clustering method along with the features extracted from the cluster contribute towards the development of the automated decision support tool.","Partial Discharge; Clustering; Smart Cable Guard; Medium voltage networks; ST-DBSCAN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The gait test station tests children’s walking in Child Brain Lab at Sophia Children’s hospital. The children in this project are at the age of 4-10 with different capacities.<br/>There are two scopes in this project, the service scope of the gait test and the experience scope of children. The service scope is to define the current procedure of the gait test. The procedure includes the gait test device, the gait test process, and the test conductor’s working experience. A service blueprint specifies the entire procedure. Another research with physical therapists, child experts, and parents by questionnaire is conducted in the service scope. With those experts’ experiences, I understand children’s related capacities to follow and finish a gait test; some design opportunities also are found. Regarding the scope of children’s experience, as the gait test station has not been set up at the hospital, the research with children is conducted at home, based on the defined service blueprint. In the Covid-19 situation, the children are researched remotely or at the family home with permission. With the research results, children’s current situations are defined and depicted in the experience maps. The current situations are four different typical situations at the gait test station. After the series of research activities, children’s current problems at the gait test station are defined. I formulate my design goal as Design an experience journey for children’s (aged 4-10) gait test to induce their natural walking, make them motivated and fun, or learn about the walking. A shortlist of design requirements is also concluded in the service scope. Before the design phase, there is a project phase of design sprints. I test and iterate different interventions in this phase for several rounds. With the intervention iterations, I can emphasize more on children to better design for them. With the iteration results, the design patterns are concluded on children’s experience maps. A list of design elements is also concluded from the iteration interventions. In the design phase, concepts have been generated with the combination of all the design patterns. As these are the combined concepts, I first evaluate if the concept includes all the design elements in different design patterns. The concepts are also evaluated with the hospital in the service scope. With these two evaluations, one concept has been selected. This concept contains three different tasks for different types of children. The three tasks are exploring walking knowledge, imitating animal walking, and sending animals to the jungle. Children can have one task during the gait test to achieve the envisioned experience. In the final concept, the technology tool is changed from the previous concept to enhance the walking experience. With the final concept, a new service blueprint and a technology roadmap are made as final deliverables. Considering a long-term implementation, I also implemented the concept into the interactive videos for short term use.

Besides, numerous ionic force field parameters are reported from various sources as researchers have specific target properties for their interests. Previous studies mainly used brute force optimization to find the most desired set of parameters in ionic solution. However, these methods are not efficient since the evaluation of the performance of a parameter set is time-consuming. This work used a stochastic optimization routine in machine learning to tackle the problem of black-box function optimization. This method shows excellent performance of locating the optimum regions of the black-box cost function in only a few iterations. To evaluate the performance of a set of ionic force field parameters, MD simulations are carried out in LAMMPS to compute ionic properties. The solvation free energy and ion oxygen distance are selected as the primary targets while the self-diffusion coefficient and contact ion pairs are regarded as the secondary targets. The optimum region of primary targets are found by direct optimization, then secondary targets are studied with optimized parameters of the primary targets. There have been found discrepancies between the optimum regions of different targeted properties. The dependence studies of individual ionic force field parameters ($\epsilon, \sigma, q$) are analyzed and parameterization trends are found out.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","It is a great challenge to accurately model the ﬂow through subsurface reservoirs. The fact that they are located a few kilometers below the earth’s surface means that it is very diﬃcult to locate ﬂow aﬀecting phenomena. Fractures are considered to be such phenomena. They can either enhance or block ﬂow which has a substantial eﬀect on the ﬂow through the reservoir. This research addresses the ﬂow properties of fractures and the location of fractures. This research introduces analogue fracture maps to get a grasp on possible fracture locations and introduces a classiﬁcation of fractures based on their orientation with respect to subsurface stress. Using this classiﬁcation, fractures are assigned diﬀerent permeability values, a ﬂow aﬀecting property. Using this approach a fracture map is obtained that can be used to model ﬂow through a reservoir. To model ﬂow, the projection based Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (pEDFM) is implemented. This method uses independent grids for both the matrix and fracture and couples them using a transfer function. Even when using the pEDFM method, the computational costs for running simulations through a ﬁeld scale model will be too large. Therefor the concept of multiscale is introduced and developed further in this research. This research uses algebraically calculated basis functions to prolong the coarse scale solution to ﬁnescale. Besides this, ﬂexible coarsening is introduced for a static Multilevel Multiscale (MMs) modeling approach and for Adaptive Dynamic Modeling (ADM). This allows the user to independently choose coarsening ratios for matrix and fractures. This research shows that fractures can be represented accurately using only two vertices on a coarse grid. This can reduce computational costs. Besides the ﬂexible coarsening, the research shows how the grid reﬁnement scheme can be used in eﬃciently in multiphase simulations. Using a grid re-ﬁnement scheme enables the user to capture a saturation front and to use a multiscale grid at the same time. The grid reﬁnement scheme works most eﬃciently when the cells belonging to high permeable fractures are coupled to the cells belonging to the matrix. The ﬁnescale solution This research ﬁnally shows the impact of geological uncertainty. The sensitivity analysis shows how geological uncertainty can have an inﬂuential impact on the problem that has to be solved. In the sensitivity analysis it is researched how a change in subsurface stress aﬀects the ﬁnescale solutions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","During offshore construction with a Semi-Submersible Crane Vessel (SSCV) the vessel is station keeping by means of Dynamic Positioning (DP). DP enables a vessel to keep position and heading by utilizing its own propulsion, while being exposed to the environmental forces caused by waves, wind and current. In a comparison study between offshore measurements and time-domain simulations, an increased vessel/thruster response for the offshore measurement was observed. The results revealed, that in operational environmental conditions, the measured vessel response shows increased oscillations in Surge, Sway &amp; Yaw, with periods of approx. 3-5 min. The goal of this thesis was to determine the causes for such an increased dynamic vessel response, which are not captured in time-domain simulations. At present, numerical methods and time-domain simulations that assess the DP performance of a vessel (e.g. aNySIM) assume a quasi-static current of which the variation is only caused by the tides. One thesis is, that time-varying currents on a scale of 1 to 5 minutes can cause an increased vessel response. Furthermore, the DP System as it is used onboard is not captured in aNySIM simulations. This means that the characteristics of the DP System onboard are but not represented in full detail in time-domain simulations. Vortex Induced Motion (VIM) has previously been observed to affect multi column floaters. However, the influence on a SSCV during DP-operations has not yet been studied. In this thesis it was investigated whether the unexpected increased motions originate from time-varying currents, VIM or the DP System itself. A significant challenge was posed to find current measurement data with a small enough time step to confirm the presence of such time-varying currents. One 45 min current measurement with a sampling rate of 1Hz became available. This measurement shows that time-varying currents on a scale of 1 to 5 minutes exist and cannot be assumed to be quasi-static. More research is required to confirm their presence. However, with this limited available data it was shown that time-varying currents can cause an unexpected motion response of a SSCV during DP-operations.In order to obtain the DP System characteristics, a DP Response Amplitude Operator (RAO) assessment was conducted wherein the spring and damping terms were derived as demanded by the controller and as experienced by the vessel. This assessment showed that between 20% to 67% of the demanded critical damping is lost over the control loop of the DP System. These damping losses cause the vessel to overshoot and the damped natural period to decrease. To determine the effects of VIM, current load tests carried out on the hull of an SSCV have been investigated. It was determined that strong currents on column type floaters can cause fluctuating forces and moments that originate from vortex shedding. Further, with real-time simulations it was demonstrated, that also VIM causes an increased, previously unknown, motion response of a SSCV. Lastly, a method was developed to extrapolate the current load test results to velocities below 2kn. Subsequently, in time-domain simulations it was shown that for current velocities above 0.5kn, the vessel experienced forces and moments that caused it to fluctuate around its setpoint.","Dynamic Positioning; Semi-Submersible Crane Vessel; Time-Domain Simulations; Time-Varying Currents; Vortex Induced Motion; Damping Losses","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-18","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","With data-driven control it is possible to design a controller for systems with non-parametric models. The intermediate step of modelling or identification of the system is not necessary, because a non-parametric model of the system can be obtained by means of experimental data. In the linear time-invariant (LTI) framework, these non-parametric models are well defined in the frequency-domain, they are represented as frequency response functions (FRFs). Data-driven control in the frequency-domain has gained momentum in the past decades, but still relatively few methods have been developed for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. One of the objectives of this thesis is to develop a controller synthesis method for MIMO systems. While the LTI framework has many advantages, such as the vast available literature and the relatively simple theory, it has its limitations. In reality, all systems have nonlinearities and some systems, especially position dependent systems (which are common in mechatronics), are less suitable to be modelled as LTI systems. The nonlinear dynamics are most likely interpreted as an uncertainty for which a robust controller has to be designed at the cost of performance. By taking into account the scheduling variable, in this case the position dependency, it is possible to improve the performance. To do so, the system is modelled as a linear parameter-varying (LPV) system for which an LPV controller is designed that takes the scheduling variable into account. This thesis is concerned with developing a controller synthesis approach in the LPV framework using non-parametric models of MIMO systems using the local approach. This implies that an LPV controller is designed for the nonlinear system at the operating points of interest, at these points the system is assumed to exhibit LTI behaviour. What follows is an interpolation of the multiple LTI controllers to obtain a global parametrisation of the controller in the entire operating range, such that local stability and performance is guaranteed at every operating point. Two novel data-driven LPV controller synthesis methods, based on LTI methods, are presented in this thesis. These methods improve the performance of a parameter dependent system compared to an LTI approach. The improvements are shown through simulations with nonlinear systems. From these simulations it can be concluded that the LPV controllers improve the performance compared to a similar LTI controller. Furthermore, an example is shown where an LPV controller is crucial to guarantee closed-loop stability of the nonlinear system.","LPV; Data-driven Approach; fixed-structure control; Robust control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Localization techniques help people understand their surrounding environment based on extracted position information in a geographic reference map. The development of global navigation satellite system (GNSS), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), computer vision (CV), etc., enables us to apply localization techniques for more specific tasks. Autonomous driving or robotics needs a reliable localization technique that both instantly retrieves an accurate positioning result and detailed information of the environment, which is challenging to realize in an urban environment. In our research, we propose a 3D point cloud localization framework in the urban environment to realize localization of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) static scans in mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds. 3D point cloud localization consists of two steps: place recognition which aims to find the location of a TLS point cloud in a big MLS point cloud and pose refinement which accurately aligns TLS and corresponding MLS point clouds. In place recognition, about 100 cylinder-like objects with 2D coordinate information are retrieved per million points in a TLS scan or a MLS scene, taking nearly 15 seconds. 5 TLS static scans in the experiment are all successfully matched to corresponding MLS scenes by the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) probabilistic estimation based on extracted cylinder-like objects. Results indicate that it is possible to realize place recognition by designing an object feature descriptor instead of a fine feature descriptor, even though TLS and MLS point clouds are collected at different times (2016 and 2020). A cylinder-like object feature descriptor saves time, compared with taking more than 100 seconds per million points during point feature extraction. In pose refinement, point clouds of TLS scans and corresponding MLS scenes are resampled and inputted to a neural network which consists of feature extraction block (FEB), correspondence search block (CSB) and pose estimation block (PEB). The output of the neural network is tuned by the global refinement process to realize pose refinement. The accuracy (£r , £t ), expressed as the mean rotation error £r in degrees (deg) and the mean translation error £t in meters (m), is (0.25 deg, 0.88 m) if the ground truth varies from (0, 0, 0) to (10 deg, 10 deg, 30 deg) in rotation and (0, 0, 0) to (30 m, 30 m, 10 m) in translation w.r.t. the (x, y, z) axis. The accuracy of a point-based registration neural network and traditional registration methods point-to-point iterative closest point (ICP), coherent point drift (CPD) is (∼10 deg, ∼10 m), (0.27 deg, 0.95 m) and (0.40 deg, 1.94 m), respectively. The run time of processing a million points for our neural network, a point-based neural network, point-to-point ICP and CPD is ∼5 seconds, ∼3 seconds, ∼50 seconds and &gt;100 seconds, respectively. Results prove that current point-based neural networks cannot work in an urban area, but our neural network achieves a more accurate result than some traditional registration methods. A neural network for pose refinement does not need prior information and is more efficient and more general than traditional registration methods as well. Overall, our research contributes to a general framework of 3D point cloud localization, incorporating both a traditional feature extraction method and a novel neural network. We hope this localization framework can be extended to other scenarios more than the urban environment, as well as other further applications e.g. urban city reconstruction.","Localization; Point Cloud; Deep Learning; Feature Extraction; Neural Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

To provide proper monitoring and maintenance to the PWS system, the DELTAP project and the TAPP-BDP project decided to use water quality field tests and a smartphone application to enable regular water quality tests to monitor the water quality of the PWS system. The TAPP could also engage the local households in the monitoring of their drinking water.

Robots often perform flawless demos in a controlled environment under the supervision of an operator but tend to fail in the real world when deployed for a long period of time due to faults and environmental disturbances. A robotic system is composed of different physical and software components whose characteristics are likely to change over time. Assumptions made about the system during the design phase may change over time, especially when a system is deployed for long periods. Such changes that are often ignored, need to be considered. Environments in which a robot operates are dynamic with high uncertainty and unpredictability. In such scenarios, capabilities such as situational awareness and self-adaptation will be useful to create more robust, resilient and reliable solutions. The objective for this thesis work is to develop a framework which will embed capabilities such as situational-awareness, context-awareness and self-adaptation within a robot. This research provides a novel, reusable and generalised localisation framework called Situation-Aware Self-Adaptive (SASA) localisation framework for robotics application. This framework is developed using knowledge representation and reasoning which will provide a robot with the capability of adapting according to the situation. We have demonstrated the applicability of the SASA framework to a mobile robot localisation use case. In this research work, we have demonstrated the performance of the framework during environmental disturbances due to poor illumination and featureless environment and internal fault due to component failure. We have also demonstrated the reusability, changeability and the consistency of SASA framework. This work showed that the situational-awareness and self-adaptation capability enhances the robot’s localisation ability and provides reliable localisation even in the case of environmental uncertainties and internal faults where conventional localisation systems fail. This thesis represents a leap forward in the direction of creating more reliable and resilient solutions for robotic applications and it lays the foundations for further research in this direction.","self-adaptation; situational-awareness; knowledge representation and reasoning; robot localisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The objective of this research is to create a framework for design teams, in order to improve the management of changes initiated by the client in the design stage of a construction project. This objective is achieved thanks to the use of Agile Project Management (APM), which offers a proactive approach.

(mentor); de Oliveira Barbosa, J.M. (graduation committee); Dronkers, T. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Marine pipelines are often operated at high internal pressure and temperature. This loading condition results in the development of axial compressive forces that can cause the pipeline to buckle globally. Global buckling occurs when significant lateral motion is present in the pipeline and excessive feed-in occurs at that specific location, which in turn forms into a sharp curve that can initiate destructive structural failure. Research has been conducted addressing the control of buckle development. The ""buckle initiation"" techniques were invented to mitigate the uncontrolled buckling of the pipelines on the seabed. These techniques involve the creation of less stiff sections in the pipeline (imperfections), so that buckling occurs in these locations. The most common buckle initiation techniques used in S-lay installation so far, are the ""snake lay"" method, the ""artificial vertical out-of-straightness"" and the ""distributed buoyancy"" method. However, these techniques require the addition of subsea structures on the seafloor or larger pipeline length, which can increase the pipelaying cost dramatically. A beneficial buckle initiation technique is the ""residual curvature"" method. The residual curvature method (RCM) principle is based on creating intermittent residual curvature sections in the pipeline so that buckling can be initiated at these locations. The curvature sections are created by adjusting the settings of the already existing installation equipment. So far, this method is only used in reel-lay installation. It is particularly urgent to examine if the local residual curvature method can successfully be applied in pipelines laid by S-lay vessels, since S-lay is considered the most common and frequently used technique due to its adequacy on different water depths and pipe diameters. The scope of this master thesis is to assess the feasibility of creating local residual curvatures in the pipeline by lowering the stinger during S-lay. The assessment is accomplished by simulating numerically the pipelaying process and the creation of the residual curvature, by analysing the behaviour of the pipeline while being lowered (in particular, looking at its twist/rotational behaviour) and by verifying if the alterations to the normal pipelaying procedure still respect the integrity of the pipeline and installation equipment.","Offshore pipelines; S-lay method; Stinger integrity; OrcaFlex; Pipeline rotation; Residual curvature; Stinger inclination; Bend moment- curvature diagram; Static analysis; Dynamic Analysis; Limit states; DNVGL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-17","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The actuator is designed to use the catalyst reaction of hydrogen peroxide as source of pressurization. The validated model shows that the developed actuator is expected to be a promising contender to increase the flight endurance of FWMAV.

With the recent successes of machine learning (ML) and especially deep learning (DL) techniques against cryptographic implementations even in the presence of dedicated countermeasures, various methods have been utilized to construct better and less complex neural network architectures. However, this process takes significant manual effort and expertise, where new architectures are constructed by adapting existing architectures or by following some methodology and filling the gaps with experimentation. While automated neural architecture search (NAS) exists and has been applied in the image classification domain, the side-channel analysis domain requires different metrics, as the machine learning metrics can be misleading in this context. In this work, we present a NAS method based on MetaQNN, which utilizes the Q-Learning reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to generate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We define two reward functions based on the guessing entropy (GE) metric, where one of these also rewards less complex networks. We use this NAS method to generate CNNs that rival the current state-of-the-art CNNs while reducing the complexity in terms of trainable parameters significantly. We also consider a naive ensemble, which manages to keep the combined complexity below the state of the art while improving the SCA performance. Since the goal of SCA research is to improve security, there should be a balance in research on improving attacks as opposed to research on how to improve defense mechanisms. In line with this balance, we adapt our Q-Learning based reinforcement learning neural architecture search method to generate sets of countermeasures, apply them a posteriori on existing datasets, and evaluate them against existing state-of-the-art CNNs. Since implementing countermeasures is not without its costs, we also define synthetic cost functions to countermeasures based on their parameters, and both restrict the countermeasure budget and reward unused budget. We use this method to generate cost-effective countermeasure sets capable of defeating different state-of-the-art CNNs.","Reinforcement Learning (RL); Side-channel analysis; Q-Learning; Neural Architecture Search; Machine Learning; Deep Learning; countermeasures; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

To properly ensure the stability of the barrier between both water bodies surrounding the jet, a scour analysis is often a necessity. Such analyses are inevitably coupled to the hydrodynamic processes occurring in jet flows, either in the form of loads on potential bed protections or equilibrium scour hole depths. Numerical models could assist in the design of bed protections by supplying accurate hydrodynamic input parameters for the design formulae or by predicting the hydrodynamic processes at play. Due to the limited computational power available, simplifications must be made within the numerical model to ensure reasonable computational costs. One of these simplifications is to resolve the flow in depth-averaged sense to create a 2DH model. To allow this simplification to be made, the performance of a 2DH model compared to a fully 3D model needs to be researched. By comparing simulations of a controlled environment and of a prototype scenario, insight in the predictive capabilities of the numerical models for possible other projects can be gained. This work aims to research the performance of 2DH and 3D numerical models regarding the reproduction of the hydrodynamic processes in shallow jets. First, it was investigated which hydrodynamic processes thrive at a prototype shallow jet by analysing measurement data available at Waterdunen. Afterwards, we systematically determine the performance of both a 2DH and 3D numerical model by setting up FINEL models both for a laboratory experiment of a shallow jet and for the shallow jet at Waterdunen. Insight in the predictive capabilities of 2DH and 3D numerical models for shallow jets can contribute to future design problems surrounding shallow jets. Information regarding the shallow jet at the seaside of the culvert at Waterdunen was obtained by Svasek Hydraulics, commissioned by the public government Waterschap Scheldestromen and the province of Zeeland, during a measurement campaign split into six individual measurement scenarios. Immediately at outflow from the culvert, the jet is subject to a 1:6 slope in streamwise direction. The geometry of the seaside channel is asymmetric, with 1:4 lateral slopes at either side of the channel. Furthermore, morphological changes as a result of the jet flow introduce an asymmetric topography in the channel. Visual observations during the measurement campaign indicated the flow can be characterized by an horizontal contraction over the longitudinal slope and an asymmetric flow profile depending on which casings were active within the culvert. The analysis of the measurement data shows the jet concentrates on the eastern side of the channel during all six scenarios. As a result, the recirculation zones on either side of the jet can be characterized as a small, non-dominant recirculation zone on the east side of the jet and a large, dominant recirculation zone on the west side of the jet. The streamlines show a continuous horizontal contraction until the flow hits the eastern side of the channel. Over the longitudinal slope, the flow seems to remain attached to the bottom rather than separating. However, due to a relatively large clearance of the ADCP measurements with respect to the bottom, this cannot be proven directly. It was decided to simulate the shallow jet of experiment 2.4.1 of van de Zande (2018) to investigate the performance of a 2DH and 3D numerical model for a laboratory simulation. In this experiment, the behaviour of an asymmetric shallow jet over a longitudinal slope at the point of the horizontal expansion was investigated. It was shown that both the 2DH and 3D numerical model were capable of reproducing the most dominant hydrodynamic processes within the jet. However, the accuracy with which the processes were reproduced differed significantly. The 2DH model reproduced too much curvature of the flow towards the lower wall of the flume compared to both the 3D model and the measurement data. As a result, the high flow velocities in the jet center were located further down in the channel. The flow velocities in the jet center were modelled with a maximum error of 12.4% in the 2DH model and 3.02% in the 3D model. The lower accuracy of the 2DH model is caused by the comparison between depth-averaged velocities and surface PIV velocities. Due to the additional curvature the recirculating velocities in the non-dominant recirculation zone were modelled too high by the 2DH model, with an error of up to 56.6% relative to the jet center velocity. In the 3D model, this error decreased to 18.9%. However, it was remarked the recirculating flow velocities in the PIV data were subject to clumping of tracer particles. The horizontal streamline contraction was simulated in the 2DH model, but can only be directly related to the changes in water depth. In both the 3D model and the measurements, this horizontal streamline contraction was shown to continue further downstream of the slope. It was concluded the horizontal streamline contraction is directly related to the vertical velocity profile, which was observed to differ from the standard log-profile both on the slope and downstream thereof. The 3D model was capable of reproducing the vertical velocity profile with a maximum relative error of 10%. In the numerical simulations at Waterdunen, both the 2DH and 3D models were shown to behave similarly. Both the 2DH and 3D numerical models were capable of reproducing the eastern concentration of the flow. However, the curvature of the jet further downstream was modelled more accurate in the 3D model. The better reproduction of the flow curvature in the 2DH model compared to the laboratory simulations is the result of the asymmetric inflow boundary, which allows the 2DH model to more easily resolve the flow curvature. Both models underestimate the flow velocities throughout the entire DOI. It was concluded this was caused by errors in the model input. Similar to the laboratory simulations, the 2DH model reproduced the horizontal streamline contraction over the slope but failed to reproduce the contraction further downstream. The 3D model was capable of reproducing the continuing streamline contraction. Furthermore, the 3D model reproduced vertical flow attachment over the slope, which complies well with the measurement data. It was concluded that a 3D numerical model can better reproduce the flow curvature in case of asymmetrical flows. Furthermore, the recirculating flow is better reproduced by a 3D model compared to a 2DH model. Finally, a 3D model is capable of accurately reproducing the vertical velocity profile, which supplies additional information of accurate flow velocities at the bed. However, on a prototype scale the differences between a 2DH and 3D numerical model are small. In channels with symmetrical boundaries, it is suggested to use a 3D numerical model in case the flow is subject to the Coanda-like effect. However, if the inflow into the channel is already asymmetrical, a 2DH numerical model can be considered to save computational effort. Nevertheless, when employing a 2DH model one should be wary of geometric and topographic asymmetries, as the effect of both factors on the flow symmetry is still unclear.","Numerical modelling; Shallow jets; Complex geometries; Horizontal streamline contraction; Coanda effect; Vertical flow attachment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The concept of geothermal technology relies on the harvesting of heat from the deep rock by injecting fluid that circulates through the porous, fractured reservoir rock between the injection and production boreholes, and thereby transports the heat to the ground surface. The presence of fractures can strongly increase the permeability of the rock and thus enhance the flow circulation in the system. Properly being able to model the fluid flow through the porous, fractured rock is therefore of importance in the optimisation of reservoir design. For that reason, this study proposes a new material model, which relates fracture initiation and propagation to a change in the permeability of the rock, assuming a smeared approach. The fracture-dependent permeability model is developed using the Diana FEA software, and can be used in combination with other fracture models and the mixture analysis for the simulation of hydro-mechanical behaviour of rock. The study investigates two different methods for the formulation of a fracture-dependent permeability, whereby both methods adhere to the cubic law, which defines the permeability as a quadratic function of its aperture. Evaluation of the model shows that it is capable of simulating extensional (mode I) fractures in the vicinity of geothermal boreholes. However, the analyses also indicate a mesh-dependency as well as a sensitivity to its input parameters. Furthermore, the fracture-dependent permeability model can only simulate hydro-mechanical behaviour in situations other than (enhanced) geothermal energy systems to a limited extent. Further model development is therefore recommended.","Geo-Engineering; Finite element analysis; Geothermal energy; Geothermal reservoir; Hydraulic fractures; Smeared cracking model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

To achieve 49% of CO2 reduction by 2030 compared to 1990, the Netherlands set a plan to generate 84 TWh of electricity from renewable energy sources, where 35 TWh need to be generated exclusively from onshore renewable energy sources (large -scale solar PV and wind onshore). Since large renewable energy projects require inter-municipal decision-making rather than a decision-making at a local level, the Netherlands introduced an instrument called regional energy strategy (RES) in the climate agreement. RES consists of dividing the country into thirty regions,<br/>in where each region needs to identify the necessary installed capacity of vRES and storage units along with the necessary investments in the grid. So far, the energy regions set their vRES plans, where 26 TWh of electricity generation from large-scale solar PV and wind onshore is expected. The regional transition entails many uncertainties. On one side, the electrification of different sectors such as industry and transport will lead to an increase in electricity demand. On the other side, the electricity grid has reached it’s maximum capacity in some regions. Therefore, the vRES plans (large-scale solar PV) set by the energy regions might not be achieved as planned. Therefore, in order to implement the energy region’s plans into the Dutch power system optimally, uncertainties in electricity supply and demand need to be taken into account. The approach adopted in this thesis consists first of the modelling of the Dutch power system as a thirty-region power system reflecting both the electricity grid and the energy regions. Second, developing a high spatio-temporal resolution electricity supply and demand profiles. Third, creating different scenarios to capture uncertainty in electricity supply and demand, where a two-phase scenario planning is developed. Generation type and capacity uncertainty (achievement of 50% and 100% of large-scale planned solar PV projects by the energy regions) are presented in the first phase and the allocation of the installed capacities to segments of two different electricity load shapes (medium growth and high growth) as a second phase decision. Last, optimizing the investment costs in generation and transmission expansion with energy storage units under the different scenarios. The optimization problem is formulated as a two-stage optimization problem. In the first stage, the investment costs in energy storage units along with the transmission lines to incorporate the 26 TWh planned electricity generation are minimized under the different scenarios in electricity supply and demand. In the second stage, the outcomes of the first optimization problem (the required energy storage and transmission lines capacities) are used as input in the second optimization problem, where the investment costs in generation, transmission and storage units to meet the 35 TWh electricity generation are minimized under the same scenarios. The generation expansion consists of expanding the generation from large-scale solar PV and wind onshore from 26 TWh to 35 TWh. The results of the first optimization problem show that under a medium growth of electricity demand, the target to reduce CO2 emissions by 49% can be reached under the achievement of both 50% and 100% of planned large-scale solar PV. However, under a high growth of electricity demand, the national target to reduce CO2 emissions by 49% by the achievement of 50% of large-scale solar PV is not reached. Both transmission lines (at different voltage levels) and storage units (battery and hydrogen) need to be expanded to incorporate the 26 TWh electricity generation. The best technology to generate the remaining 9 TWh according to the results of the second optimization problem is wind onshore. Moreover, the best location is Rotterdam-Den Haag region. As a result, the 35 TWh electricity generation can be integrated into the electricity grid in a cost-optimal way by using energy storage systems, flexible gas supply and the expansion of several transmission lines at the 380kV and 150kV voltage level. This work can be extended to explore other directions such as the variations of both CO2 cap and price, the coupling to other sectors such as gas network and the interconnection between surrounding countries.","LOPF; regional energy strategy; uncertainty; spatio-temporal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The analysis of the collected data was performed, which gave sufficient information to identify the existence of three perspectives among fourteen participants, while one participant was considered as a non-loader since his perspective did not show any link to the other perspectives. The identified perspectives were named as follows: Protocol Sticklers, Team-Oriented and Task-Oriented. The analysis of each perspective led to propose a framework that consists of: first, the performance of a thorough analysis to identify the perspectives of each member of a project team. Secondly, the strategy adopted to engage team members in a collaborative environment, should consider a combination of the suggested actions in order to guarantee the existence of the necessary antecedents for effective collaboration in BIM-based projects. However, the use of the framework will depend on the perspective that each member has, trying to make use of their perceived importance of a certain aspect of collaboration to share with the rest of the team, as well as working on the aspects they believe to be of less importance, in order to highlight the benefits of its implementation and engage them to promote a collaborative environment.","Collaboration; BIM; Construction; Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Metamaterials do not derive their properties from those of the composite, but from the artificial meso-scale geometry as well as from the unit cell structure. Mechanical metamaterials are constrained in that the mechanical properties are precisely defined and fixed; alteration between these properties simply is not feasible. However, if activated, metamaterials can be controlled and mechanical properties can be influenced. In this research project, a novel active metamaterial unit cell design for controlled damping has been introduced. Centimeter-scale electromagnetic actuators are integrated as activators in an elastic mechanical metamaterial structure. The design effectively exploits the way in which the reluctance actuator functions, and tuning of the integrated electromagnet allows for ranging Coulomb damping. A proof-of-principle unit cell demonstrator of 90mm and one of 45mm, in length have been made. The electrically controlled damping behaviour of the active unit cells has been validated for cyclic loading deformations and the force-displacement curve has resulted in a damped over stored energy range from 3% and 20% up to 34% and 132% respectively.","Mechanical metamaterials; Electromagnets; Miniaturisation; Damping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The increasing passenger demand for rail service in the Netherlands, urges the Dutch infrastructure manager (IM) ProRail to increase network capacity. Instead of building new infrastructure, ProRail promotes information and communications technology solutions which aim for a more efficient utilization of the existing infrastructure. One of the ways to achieve improved capacity utilization is through decreasing the variability of train runs, i.e. by attaining more uniform train driving profiles. A driver advisory system (DAS) constitutes such a solution and it serves as a support for the driver to perform the train driving tasks. Additionally, the rollout of the European Train Control System Level 2 (ETCS L2) on the first part of the mainline Dutch network is planned for 2030. Developing a DAS compatible with ETCS L2 operation would yield high quality advice. Still, until the complete roll out of ETCS L2, ProRail aims to improve capacity on given bottlenecks using existing systems. A DAS constitutes a nonsafety critical, Grade of Automation 1 system. Under DAS operation, the driver adjusts the train controls and he/she is responsible for the safety of operations. A frequently arising problem when using a DAS, is that its advice usually leads to conflicts due to poor or no consideration of the actual traffic. An approach to handle this, is to provide the speed profile calculation module of a DAS with a dynamic speed profile that considers static and temporary speed restrictions as well as speed restrictions originating from the signalling system. The latter approach increases a DAS’s awareness regarding the actual signal state. This study aims to tackle conflicts with the latter approach. This approach for coping with conflicts when using a DAS is mentioned by several publications or commercial DASs but none of them explicitly defines how this is achieved. The main aim of this study is to increase the awareness of a conceptual CDASOn board regarding the actual signal state in order to minimise conflicts in disturbed operations. The proposed framework addresses the a CDASOn board operating on top of the Dutch signalling system NS’54 and the ClassB automatic train protection system ATBEG. In order to increase the proposed model’s effectiveness, this information must be provided in real time. Realtime signalling information is delivered on board by the maximum allowed speed data stream (Figure 1). It is proven that the only missing function from existing ProRail systems to provide this realtime information flow, is to determine the red signal in real time. Thus, the initial objective of this study can be scoped down to determining the red signal. It is also proven that the goal of determining the red signal is equivalent to the goal of locating the predecessor train. This information is planned to be fed to the on board equipment of a DAS via a novel data stream. Additionally, this section explained how this data stream fits to the train control architecture using a CDASOn board.","driver advisory system; actual signal state awareness; train positioning; train describer data; global positioning system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

Understanding the performance of the humidifier as a function of its operating conditions is crucial for the efficiency of the fuel cell system. Therefore zepp.solutions BV, a system integrator of hydrogen fuel cell systems for the clean and mobile power generation, demanded advanced insight into the performance of their humidifier. Two models were developed to describe the heat and mass transfer in a gas-to-gas shell-and-tube membrane humidifier, furthermore the performance of the humidifier was extensively determined via experiments. The novelty in the model lies in the comprehensive combination of advanced correlations describing mass and heat transfer in the humidifier. Experiments at various mass flows, temperatures and pressures were performed on a Fumatech H20N humidifier, a gas bubbler has been designed and developed to humidify the gas stream. Heat transfer was measured to increase linearly with inlet temperature difference and was limited by convective heat transfer. Water transfer was found to be limited by diffusion and to increase exponentially with wet inlet temperature, dry air mass flow only had a small impact. The impact of mass transfer on heat transfer can not be neglected, due to latent heat transfer and transfer of energy by water being transported. For the analytical and numerical model, the heat and mass transfer coefficients are based on correlations found in literature. The membrane diffusion coefficient and both convective mass transfer coefficients vary over an order of magnitude or more in literature. The numerical model can predict the latent effectiveness with acceptable accuracy, the sensible effectiveness is mainly overestimated. For eighty percent of the cases the predictions are within (+.0061 to .22) and (-.11 to +.056) for the sensible and latent effectiveness, respectively. A further improvement requires more information about the membrane diffusion coefficient of the specific membrane material and appropriate correlations for the shell side Sherwood numbers taking tube placement irregularity into account.","membrane humidifier; membrane; mass transfer; gas-to-gas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-11-13","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Process and Energy Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a key component in the Earth System. Given its important role in the climate system, variability in the AMOC strength is expected to have great impact on the global climate. The current observational timeseries are not long enough to make climate projections for the end of the century or even longer. Therefore, coupled climate models play an important role in the making of end of century climate projections on the AMOC strength. A known issue with the current generation of global coupled climate models is that the grid resolution is generally too coarse to resolve smaller scale processes such as mesoscale eddies. Observations and modelling studies suggest that mesoscale eddies play an important role in the exchange of water between convection regions and downwelling regions. When such processes are absent or parametrized incorrectly, it can have an influence on the climate projections based on these model simulations. This study analysed the AMOC characteristics in two different simulations of the Community Earth System Model; a reference simulation (referred to as piControl) and a simulation in which the atmospheric CO2 concentrations have been increased to four times the initial concentration (referred to as 1pctCO2). First, the AMOC characteristics in the piControl simulation are analysed using both a Eulerian and a Lagrangian approach. The Eulerian analysis shows that deep mixed layers, an indicator for convection, are present in the subpolar North Atlantic. Compared to observations and higher-resolution ocean-only models are these located closer to the West-Greenland coast. Strong vertical velocities are found over the continental slopes, especially over the steep continental slopes around Greenland. Second, the Lagrangian analysis showed the consequences of the coarse grid in the model. Only a single pathway around the subpolar gyre was observed. This implies that particles will experience convection while crossing the interior of the Labrador Sea, but only will experience downwelling when their individual pathway comes close enough to the continental slopes around Greenland. Furthermore, there is only limited exchange of particles with the regions north and south of the subpolar gyre. In the export of deep waters to the subtropical gyre, does it seem that the particles are being blocked by the North Atlantic Current. Third, the changes in the AMOC characteristics in the 1pctCO2 simulation are compared to the piControl simulation. In the 1pctCO2 simulation have deep mixed layers disappeared from the subpolar North Atlantic and convection in this region has shut down. A new fresh(er) surface layer in the Labrador Sea has intensified the stratification and prohibits the formation of deepmixed layers. Instead of the deep mixed layers in the subpolar North Atlantic have new deep mixed layers emerged between 30N and 40N. In general are velocities reduced in magnitude in the 1pctCO2 simulation, but the stronger vertical velocities can still be found over the continental slopes. In conclusion, the results show that the CESM model can reproduce the two components of the AMOC reasonably well, but the connection in the formof mesoscale eddies is missing. This illustrates that a overturning streamfunction simplifies the complexity of the overturning process. The overturning streamfunction is a measure for the overturning strength, but it does not take into account how and if the convection process and the exchange between convection and downwelling are represented.","AMOC; Climate change; CESM; Lagrangian analysis; climate projections; Coupled models; Mixed Layer Depth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Hong Kong and Macau are two cities located in the Pearl River Delta that experience a significant flood risk due to storm surges. The increased losses and risks has sparked interest around the world for efficient and accurate flood forecasting. At the moment coastal flooding events are often simulated with difficult hydrodynamic models that reproduce the physical phenoms. Over the last decades there has been more interest in other methods to forecast storm surges, namely neural networks. Other than hydrodynamic models a neural network is capable is making predictions in seconds, while the model can take hours to finish simulation. fast and accurate storm surge forecasting is of importance for disaster and evacuations management strategies and will only become more important in the future. During this research the main goal is to develop a neural network capable of prediction maximum water levels due to storm surges in case of an approaching tropical cyclone. The neural network is trained with data that is obtained from hydrodynamic simulations. A synthetic storm database is used to provide the necessary data to conduct 1000 simulations of which the results are used in the neural network. The first focusses on developing a hydrodynamic model capable of accurately simulation tropical cyclone induced storm surges in Hong Kong and Macau. The model is calibrated in a way to reproduce the real world as close as possible. It accounts for the real life bathymetry, topography, astronomical tides and wind forcing. The storm surge model is validated extensively based on three historical tropical cyclones. The errors between the observed and simulated water level are below 20 cm, after calibrations of different physical parameters within the model. The second step of this research is to use the validated storm surge model to run synthetic storm simulations. Instead of using historical storms who only have been recorded for 40 years, a synthetic storm database is used containing 10000 years worth of data. From that storm data, 1000 synthetic tropical cyclones are selected that come close to Hong Kong and Macau. With the data obtained from the previous two steps, it is finally possible to training the neural network. In this network a total of seven input parameters (tropical cyclone track parameters) are used to estimate the maximum water level that will occur during the tropical cyclone. The input parameters considered are: latitude, longitude of TC eye, maximum wind speed, minimum eye pressure, radius of maximum winds, forward speed, forward propagation direction. During the development of the network, three different types of configurations are tested. Extensive validation and calibration shows that neural networks are capable of making maximum water level predictions for a large number of cases. However, variety in the quality of the prediction is observed. Improvements still can be made for more accurate predictions.","Tropical Cyclones; Storm surge; Synthetic storm simulations; Neural Network; Delft3D; Hydrodynamic modelling; Machine learning techniques","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","51.998819, 4.371447"

This new encoding reduces the data size and simplifies the usage. These files can be stored in relational and NoSQL databases. Relational and NoSQL databases have integrated JSON. CityJSON has therefore the potential to be stored and perform efficiently in relational and NoSQL databases. The databases are tested as part of a client-server architecture, because JSON is used in web applications and the 3D city models can not entirely be stored on mobile devices. GraphQL is used as the API layer between the database and the client, because it has the ability to optimise the usage of the network. This is necessary for location-based web applications on mobile devices to stay functional. This research attempts based on this use case to answer the following question: How suitable are MongoDB and PostgreSQL for the storage and querying of CityJSON using GraphQL? CityJSON has first been mapped to the relational database PostgreSQL and the NoSQL database MongoDB. CityGML has also been mapped to PostgreSQL with 3DCityDB to clarify the impact of different exchange formats. The databases are after that accessed and queried through GraphQL. The queries are based on the selection process of an AR application. The architecture is tested based on the number of queries between the databases and GraphQL, the request sizes, the response sizes and the retrieval times. The results show that the usage of JSON maps attributes more flexibly than the mapping of 3DCityDB, which can result in less tables and therefore less joins or queries. On the other hand, querying on a JSON attribute might result in higher retrieval times than querying an attribute with a predefined data type, but this is not investigated. Additionally, the usage of JSON makes it possible to store fields with varying data types such as the hierarchy of arrays. A difficulty can be that software such as GraphQL does not support fields with varying data types and is therefore less flexible. The developer has to work around that. In general, there are no real signs yet that MongoDB and PostgreSQL are not suitable for the storage and querying of CityJSON using GraphQL. Possible signs are that the indexing mechanism with the vertices list can not be stored in MongoDB and only to some extent in PostgresQL, but this might not be a problem since the indexes can be resolved to integer or real coordinates. The attribute presentLoDs can not be stored in MongoDB as well, but this might be solved with a small adjustment. The main recommendations of this research are that the SQL/MQL queries should be implemented as efficiently as possible without being connected to GraphQL first. This should be done to understand the performance of the databases and to understand the impact of GraphQL better. Besides this, a more general understanding of the suitability for all use cases could be provided with a framework that tests more types of queries.","MongoDB; PostgreSQL; GraphQL; CityJSON","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

This greatly facilitated advancements in interconnectedness of the functional systems in society, such as transportation or communication. Simulation gaming is a technique that can aid in comprehending the dynamics and interactions within these complex socio-technical systems. Simulation gaming became a very popular topic of research and many different aspects have already been thoroughly investigated. Yet, there are some components that still remained rather unexplored, such as affect among participants. Affect are the feelings, moods and emotional states that we, as individuals, can experience as a reaction to certain events and situations. The importance of researching the role of affect in simulation gaming can be attributed to the potential of affective gaming. Including a component that adapts to the affective states of participants can improve the gaming experience as well as the outcomes. This can provide a better understanding of the observed interactions and their complexity. Simulation gaming can be practiced for various purposes in different sectors. This research focuses on the role of affective states in trading simulation gaming. It provides the opportunity to analyze affective states experienced by participants and how that relates to trading behavior, such as decision making and negotiating. In order to study this, an existing simulation game was used to derive and analyze data. The simulation game that is being used for this research was developed as part of SamenMarkt. SamenMarkt is a project that had been established to investigate the supply chain of vegetables in the horticulture sector. Part of the SamenMarkt project was the development of a simulation game to examine the interactions between stakeholders in the supply chain. Human participants took part in the game in which they could buy and sell tomatoes. This resulted in different trading interactions between the players, such as submitting, receiving, winning or losing offers. In this research, the trade actions in the simulation game are investigated on their relationship with the affective states that participants experienced during the game play. This is performed by analyzing the occurrence of facial movements through the facial action coding system (FACS). The results showed significant differences for the occurrence of some action units between different trade actions or positive versus negative trade actions. These outcomes show that there are some specific action units that significantly differ in occurrence or intensity between trading actions, indicating that some of those events may evoke corresponding immediate affect. Based on the discussion, it can be argued that this trading gaming simulation does elicit affective states related to the trading process, e.g. positive affect resulting from a positive event, or negative affect emerging from a negative event. However, it requires further research to provide a more general conclusion regarding the meaning of certain action units and the relationship to the trade actions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-13","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

In this study, the membrane technology was proposed to test the feasibility of direct ultrafiltration (UF) of POME by using a-Al2O3 and PVDF membranes, and to figure out the recovery rates of water and oi. POME synthesis methodology was successfully generated in the lab with the oil droplet size distribution and oil concentration conforming to the characteristics of real POME. The optimal operating conditions for POME filtration was determined by executing ultrafiltration experiments at different permeate fluxes and pHs. Both membrane shown good performance at original POME pH (pH 5). Compared with PVDF membrane, Al2O3 shown great strengths in higher optimal flux (57LMH), lower required trans-membrane pressure (TMP), higher oil and water recovery. The formation of oil layer on Al2O3 membrane reversed the charge type of membrane surface, which transformed oil droplet-membrane attraction to oil droplet-oil layer repulsion that allowed for the higher rejection and steady filtration process. The effect of SDS surfactant was also studied to clarify whether it could significantly improve membrane performance. The addition of SDS brought in extra pollutant with the SDS micelle size smaller than membrane pores, which reduced permeate quality and increased fouling in UF process. In the aspect of process stability, SDS benefited a-Al2O3 membrane performance more than PVDF membrane. The bi-layers SDS formed on a-Al2O3 membrane resulted in charge inversion and increased hydrophilicity of membrane surface that respectively enhanced anti-fouling property and membrane permeability. In the long run, SDS addition stabilized TMP variation process and prevented the sharp TMP increase. However, to guarantee the permeate quality of membrane technology, SDS was not recommended to be added. To operate POME process with more stable TMP and less fouling, a-Al2O3 membrane was highly recommended for POME treatment with great potential of industrial application in the future. The discussion of pH effect on membrane performance reveals other important affecting factors other than pH. Severe fouling of PVDF membrane happened below IEP_PVDF (pH 2). The increased hydrophobicity caused by oil layer formation could explain the lower membrane permeability and the adsorption of more hydrolyzed LCFA in acidic condition led to larger proportion of irreversible fouling. While the less excellent a-Al2O3 membrane performance at pH 10 was mainly due to the adsorption of more LCFA and glycerol onto membrane, despite the membrane-molecules/oil droplets repulsion existed in ultrafiltration. Although the general filtration mechanisms involves in almost all cases, the most important interactions that mainly function vary with different membrane and feed type.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-01","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

Pulsed Electro-Acoustic (PEA) method is a widely-used method for space charge detection and measurement, in which the space charge profile is mapped through acoustic waves that are excited by applied pulsed-voltage. There are a few practices for pulse application into PEA circuit. Pros and cons of the different injection practices have been remained unknown due to limited accessibility to the critical points like the core conductor. Modeling of the pulse injection setups can help us with simulating the essential parameters, like voltage and current, at the unreachable spots. The way how the circuit can be modeled, selecting adequate software and transmission line model, strengths and weaknesses of the injection practices and the changes required for possible optimization in the practices are challenging questions that need to be answered. This thesis develops frequency-dependent models for all the PEA injection setups that are usually deployed for Medium Voltage (MV) mini-cables geometry. It shows, through a validation<br/>process, that PSCAD/EMTDC phase model can yield sufficiently accurate results with reference to the lab measurements. In the next stage, the questioned strengths and weaknesses of each original design setup are determined through a series of lab tests and computer-aided simulations by utilizing of which the best setup is recognized.

In such cases, portfolio managers make the assumption that the model is not working and they override its decisions for an entire year. This thesis studies the performance of quantitative models after these events and provides research based guidelines for future decisions on model overrides.A selection of investment factors representing the model will be used to explain the post-event abnormal returns. In general, the data consists of monthly observations on one cross-section of firms over a time period of several years. Consequently, it may contain unobserved firm or time effects. Ignoring such effects leads to inefficient estimates and biased results. Hence, robust inference is conducted by adjusting the standard errors of a pooled regression, and through modelling the effects in a panel regression.Multiple approaches show that the separate factors are not sufficiently able to explain the abnormal returns after an event, if compared to the model's performance in regular market circumstances. Consistent results for the post-event performance are particularly hard to find. Equally weighting all factors in a single regressor, leads to model performance being equivalent to that in non-event times after 9 months, which indicates that a override period of equal length is sufficient. Therefore, the current assumption that the model is not working properly after a merger or acquisition, is correct. The robust pooled model is favoured over the panel model in this research, due to its low complexity and its straightforward results. ","Financial panel data; Linear models; Asset Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Tests of General Relativity are often done in the Solar System by using tracking data from interplanetary space missions, to measure the perturbation on the orbits of the planets that is predicted by General Relativity. The next best opportunity for such a test is the BepiColombo spacecraft by the European Space Agency, which will arrive at Mercury in late 2025. However, a very similar perturbation is also produced by the gravitational oblateness of the Sun through the zonal coefficient J2. The exact value of this coefficient has been hard to determine despite centuries of observations of the solar shape, and besides the accuracy of the tracking data it is the main source of uncertainty for the tests of gravitational theory. Recent publications in heliophysics suggest that higher order effects might also be of relevant influence too, such as coefficient J2 being dynamic along the solar cycle, or the fourth zonal coefficient J4. This thesis project attempts to bring together two fields of research: the field that tries to test General Relativity (GR) in the Solar System, and the field of heliophysics that tries to unravel the structure of the Sun. The orbit of Mercury, as well as the observations of BepiColombo and it predecessor MESSENGER, are simulated in a virtual reality where settings of the solar shape are varied. Relevant parameters to tests of gravity are then estimated using a least-squares algorithm and their error is analysed. It is found that the amplitude of a periodic component of the solar oblateness can be found with an uncertainty of 0.02% of the value of J2. It is also found that if a periodic component exists with an amplitude higher than 1%, it can lead to errors in the experiments of GR to the point that results oppose the theory of General Relativity. Expected values for J4 from heliophysics currently do not influence the orbit of Mercury by a measurable amount. Based on this work, it is recommended to those in the field who test General Relativity using data from BepiColombo, to take this effect into consideration to prevent getting results in their experiments that can lead physicists in the wrong direction concerning the development of gravitational theory.","General Relativity; Sun; Solar oblateness; PPN parameters; Solar activity; Gravitational physics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

For self-driving vehicles, streaming video and real-time gaming, the devices involved (e.g. vehicles, cellphones, etc.) might not have enough capabilities to perform all the computations and might not have sufficient storage capacity; MEC can be used here for offloading data computations and content caching. To enhance service quality and user experience, MEC hosts and MEC applications should be located close(r) to the end-users, which increases the number of handovers between MEC hosts to maintain MEC service continuity for mobile end-users as well as the costs for the telecom operators. Therefore, a balance needs to be found. Consider the fact that mobile UEs need MEC service handovers to maintain service continuity and handovers may cause service interruptions which can cause severe degradation to MEC service qualities and user experience, hence the number of handovers between MEC hosts experienced by end-users should be minimized. To find a suitable deployment of MEC hosts and MEC applications in order to minimize the number of handovers, three greedy algorithms and two heuristic algorithms are introduced, implemented, tested, compared and analyzed in this thesis to see which identifies the deployment mechanism that has the smallest number of handovers. When it is time for a mobile UE to connect to a new MEC host and there are multiple potential choices of the new MEC host, the most suitable one for the UE needs to be determined dynamically according to the real-time condition of each possible MEC host. To achieve this, reinforcement learning is considered. Three different reinforcement learning algorithms based on SARSA learning and Deep Q Network are introduced, implemented, tested, compared and analyzed in this thesis. Furthermore, a decision-making mechanism is designed to cope with exceptional situations where the required service quality cannot be guaranteed.","Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC); MEC host; MEC application; MEC application instance; 5G; optimization; ETSI; 3GPP; relocation; handover; Reinforcement learning; SARSA learning; Deep Q-Network; Markov Decision Processes; Python","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An attacker performs a profiled attack when he has a physical and identical copy of the target device, meaning the attacker is in full control of the target device. Therefore, these profiled attacks are known as the most powerful attacks in the side-channel analysis. This physical leakage is analyzed by machine learning and, in the last years, mostly deep learning, which both are used as a profiling tool to perform a side-channel attack. The best known deep learning technique for side-channel analysis at this moment is the convolutional neural network (CNN). However, this thesis investigates a well-known deep learning model that is never used before in side-channel analysis. The deep learning models RNN, LSTM, and GRU are tested and evaluated to look for the best hyperparameters. We show the influence of different models, amount of layers, dropout, activation function, units, recurrent dropout, and batch sizes in the experiments. We also show that using different sequence length gives a speedup in training. To reduce the sequence length, we use a linear regression technique. After that, we show that sequential data models are a suitable alternative for side-channel analysis; however, their results do not surpass the CNNs. After this, we experiment with an autoencoder as a preprocessing algorithm to ""clean"" noisy traces. We show that the LSTM autoencoder easily removes a hiding countermeasure with noise. However, a hiding countermeasure with delay is more challenging for the LSTM autoencoder. Combining both countermeasures seems impossible for the LSTM autoencoder. The performance we see when cleaning the traces also affects the guessing entropy. Lastly, we use an embedding layer as the first layer for MLP, CNN, and a sequential data model in the side-channel analysis. We experiment with different output dimensions and conclude that an embedding layer is a valid alternative to change the data dimension when using an MLP or a sequential data model.","Side-channel analysis; Machine learning; deep learning; Recurrent networks; long short-term memory networks; Autoencoder; embedding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

In this framework, transition zones are deemed as the most sensitive locations on the railway track, especially to high vibrations and impact loads. This causes high maintenance costs and is often very annoying, as the availability of the track gets limited during maintenance processes. One of the main reasons of this problem is the stiffness change of the railway supporting structure which is sometimes abrupt. This thesis will shed some light on the factors playing roles in altering the vibration intensities in level crossings. Moreover, the effects of these factors on ground vibrations will be highlighted. Further on, a model is presented which incorporates all these parameters. This model can be used to predict the change in ground vibrations in level crossings. The objective of this thesis is to determine the influential parameters in terms of the response vibrations in the surroundings of railway tracks. On that account, following an in-depth literature study, and based on the analysis of the measurements performed at Movares, it was suggested to investigate three factors being the ambient temperature effect, the hanging sleeper scenario and the inhomogeneity of foundation and analyze their impacts. The in-situ measurements illustrated a correlation with temperature, where the vibrations are amplified during hot periods and in the summer season. Besides that, the reports indicated the presence of the hanging sleeper scenario, where the suspension between the rails and the foundation is no longer active. It was also reported that locations with inhomogeneous foundations experience higher vibrations than those with quasi-homogeneous foundations. On those grounds, it was decided to study the effects of the hanging sleeper scenario, the ambient temperature and the presence of a slab-track crossing on the track. A complete vehicle/track/soil numerical model has been used in the parametric study in order to assess the factors affecting the response vibrations induced by trains and to quantify their impacts. Along with that, the numerical results have been validated, to some extent, with analytical results. More specifically, the steady-state response obtained with both approaches are compared present a good agreement. The results exhibit that the hanging sleeper phenomenon has a substantial effect on the vibrations. Furthermore, the existence of a level crossing (representing a foundation inhomogeneity) proved to be of significance as well. Lastly, the ambient temperature possesses a limited impact which could turn severe in extreme conditions.","Vibrations; Railways; transition zones","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, providing additional visual feedback has been found to provide benefits to HA interfaces by complementing their advantages and mitigating their weaknesses. However, the implementation and understanding of this interaction are still quite limited. In this study, we provide new insights into this interaction by extending these findings to the HA teleoperation of an industrial robot, in which the HA is comprised of a set of Virtual Fixtures (VFs). Two methods of providing additional visual feedback are implemented for the use case of dross removal and are evaluated in a human factors experiment. The first method is the implementation of a set of visual cues, designed to complement the HA and force feedback. The second method is the use of a head-mounted display (HMD), instead of a desktop monitor, providing additional depth information and an increased sense of immersion. Both methods proved to be beneficial, but only in certain aspects of the operation. The visual cues were found to significantly improve safety in terms of peak collision force, whereas the HMD significantly improves the performance. Additional analysis suggests the use of an HMD causes improvements in the manipulability of the interface. Furthermore, improved scores in the van der Laan questionnaires and the user preference indicate an increased user acceptance due to the implementation of either of the methods. This study provides additional insight into the importance of visual feedback for HA and provides two methods to take advantage of its potential benefits in the teleoperation of an industrial robot.","Teleoperation; Haptic Assistance; Virtual Fixtures; Haptic Feedback; Visual Feedback; Dross Removal; VR; HMD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

In reality, it is a very complex matter for everyone to be able to access and drink safe water. Water is essential to maintain life on earth but as a resource it is not always located and in the state that is ideal for consumption. Often what is accessible is either contaminated, in dispute or not appropriate for its intended use. With regards to water safety, Bangladesh is the country with the largest proportion of people exposed to arsenic contamination around the world, the situation of which has been described by the World Health Organisation (2010) as the “largest mass poisoning of a population in history”. From the various technologies available, it has been established that Piped Water Supply Systems show a lot of promise in providing safe water to Rural and Peri -Urban communities of Bangladesh. Issues with this new system include lack of trust in the system, high costs, infrastructural and technical issues and operation and maintenance issues. These along with a lack of knowledge on water safety and varied literacy rates are some of the factors that contribute to low acceptance of the system. Awareness and educational campaigns have had a positive influence on communities regarding their choice of safe water sources. New and effective methods of building awareness through different channels is needed for long term impact and behaviour change. Approximately 50% of the rural households own and use smart phones with Internet access, and this number is rapidly increasing. This shows scope for monitoring water supply systems and building knowledge with smart phones in order to reach and engage communities. Uncertainties within the system were identified and information topics under the themes of Water quality, Health, Water practices and Water sources was designed to be communicated to the people of Bangladesh through the TAPP smart phone application, in order to build their knowledge and understanding of water safety. The long term goals of this project includes acceptance and engagement of Bangladeshi communities towards Piped Water Supply(PWS) systems and to affect the behaviour of people with regards to their choices on consuming safe drinking water. The use of ICT as the communication channel is relatively low cost and has a broad range of possibility to reach the citizens. The impact can be great if the knowledge penetrates within the families, and thus help in changing people’s decisions around drinking water.","Water safety; Sustainable development; Rural and Peri - urban; ICT; Information and Awareness; Smart phone Application; Piped Water Supply Systems; Bangladesh; Interaction Design; User experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

LOFAR is considered as a pathfinder to the new and the largest radio telescope under construction, the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) covering an area of 1000,000 sq. metre. The similarities between the systems of the LOFAR and the SKA allow extension of calibration strategies from LOFAR to SKA. The calibration strategy employed for the LOFAR radio telescope assumes identical embedded element patterns (EEPs) among the antenna elements, which leads to systematic calibration errors. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the impact of this assumption on calibration errors for the low band antenna system of the LOFAR radio telescope (LOFAR-LBA). To this end, a simulation of calibration of the stations of the LOFAR-LBA system by holography is developed and implemented during this thesis. Results from the simulation are compared to investigate the impact of calibration errors with respect to the systemic errors from a LOFAR-LBA observation. Calibration methodologies that allow the inclusion of individual EEPs such as holography, superstation calibration and stand alone station calibration are briefly explored to facilitate comparison of computational costs involved in their respective implementations based on the systemic structure of LOFAR. Holography is identified and chosen for development of an instrument model with the inclusion of individual EEPs and implemented both as a simulation and on LOFAR-LBA measurement data. Holography on LOFAR-LBA is first implemented through simulation within the observed range of the signal-to-noise ratio from the measurement data. Results do not indicate appreciable errors in calibration after including individual EEPs in the instrument model owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio. An attempt was made to implement holography on LOFAR-LBA measurement data and several issues with the data were identified. The identified issues with LOFAR-LBA data were resolved and the code from the implementation of holography on LOFAR-HBA is made compatible to LOFAR-LBA data. Improvements in calibration results were expected with increasing SNR during the simulation. However, it was observed that the incorporation of individual EEPs into the instrument model to perform holography resulted in gain estimates very close to the gain estimates with the assumption of identical EEPs. This illustrates that while incorporation of individual EEPs does have an impact on the calibration results, the additional computational effort is not justified.","Array calibration; Embedded Element Patterns (EEPs); Holography","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Southern Chotts Basin hosts reservoirs within the Triassic, Permian and Ordovician units that contain significant hydrocarbon accumulations whilst the Jeffara Basin contains outcrop analogues of the same hydrocarbon­bearing formations. The basins experienced a late Hercynian shortening phase which involved the uplift of a major topographic high (Tebaga de Medenine). This high, in conjunction with a older regional high, the Telemzane Arch influenced the deposition and geometry of the Permian and Triassic units across both basins. This shortening event is characterised at the scale of hundreds of meters by E­W striking folds into which the mid­late Triassic and early Jurassic units are deposited. The folding is also observed at field scale (10’s meters) through small fault­related folds in the Permian deposits of the Tebaga de Medenine. This late Hercynian phase occurs between the late Permian and early Jurassic in the basins. Fracture data collected from the upper Permian and lower Triassic units (Jeffara Basin) provides an analogue to the fracture networks at depth (Southern Chotts Basin) in the Paleozoic reservoirs. A conjugate fracture system observed in the field (from fracture pavements) corroborates with the interpretation of regional shortening in the basins. Seismic attribute analysis on depth slices in the Paleozoic reservoirs also shows the conjugate system at depth. This analysis is integrated with outcrop fracture data and FMI data from wells to create an open fold distributed fracture model of the system in the basins. This model indicates the main driver for fracture generation in the region is folding and is used to predict the fracture networks at depth. This is undertaken using discrete fracture network (DFN) modelling of the subsurface. This model is integrated with a deterministic model from the seismic time slices to create a hybrid predictive fracture model of the early Paleozoic reservoirs. Analytical aperture modelling of the fracture model demonstrates the fractures varied in openness depending on orientation and fracture length. The conjugate set orientated at 240∘and longer joints detected from seismic attributes presented the widest aperture size. These fractures in the subsurface at implications on the transmissibility of the reservoirs, especially Permian units which have low bulk rock permeability and the lower Triassic (TAGI) sequences which are susceptible to compartmentalisation.","Structural Geology; Tebaga de Medenine; Shortening; Natural Fractures; Fracture Network Characterisation; Fracture Network Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-12","","","","","","33.422350, 10.221321"

Mangroves are essential for their interaction with hydrodynamic and sediment processes at mangrove-mud coasts. Earlier on, solutions were sought in building ’hard’ structures, such as concrete sea walls, to lower incoming wave energy and enhance sedimentation to restabilize erosive coastlines and bring back mangroves. As these approaches proved to be counterproductive and even accelerate destabilization of the coastline, nature-based solutions might provide a new path to a durable solution. A pilot project was initiated in Demak, Indonesia, where several permeable brushwood and bamboo dams were constructed near the receding coastline. The open structure of the dams allows sediment to ﬂow through, while they decrease wave heights by dissipation. This creates calmer conditions behind the dams and allows mud to settle. The deposition of ﬁne sediments enhances a rise in nearshore bedlevel and provides nursery ground for mangroves to reestablish, realizing a ﬁrst step towards rehabilitation of the mangrove ecosystem and restabilizing the coastline. A conceptual 2DH process-based model, using Delft3D FM, was created to analyse the effect of permeable structures under changing boundary conditions at various shorelines. Three boundary conditions were varied to see the influence on dam performance: wave height, wave direction and suspended sediment concentration. A decrease or increase in wave height resulted in similar rise in bedlevel elevation behind the dams. Without the dams, an increase in wave height increased the tidal ﬂat elevation and steepened the foreshore, inducing a concave proﬁle shape. Placing the dams on the tidal ﬂat induces extra rise in elevation, but won’t mitigate the erosion of the foreshore. Smaller wave heights tend to reshape the proﬁle towards a more convex proﬁle. When dams are implemented on, an increase in bedlevel behind the dams occurs. The waves stir up sediment at the tidal ﬂat boundary which are redistributed by the tidal currents forming a more convex proﬁle. The dams could be placed best close to the shoreline to allow for the natural redistribution of the sediment when at the same time induce a rise in bedlevel for mangroves to reestablish. Altering the nearshore sediment supply affects the dam performance signiﬁcantly. The dam performance increases for lower sediment supplies. Dams reduce erosion due to decreased sediment input, but it is likely a short-term solution. For higher sediment supplies, the coastline can more effectively restore by itself and the dams reduce in efﬁcacy. The model results show an increase in dam performance for increasing wave angles (shore-normal to shore-parallel). The bed shear stress is decreased more effectively for smaller wave angles, but also reduce the sediment concentration behind the dams. With the many distinctive boundary conditions at mangrove-mud coasts in mind, the simpliﬁed model setup is made easily adaptable to enable future use of the model. Based on the model setup for Demak and the model results in this research, an improvement on the computational grid is suggested before applying the model to other coastal sites.","Morphodynamics; Delft3D-FM; Permeable structures; Mangrove rehabilitation; Mud coast; Indonesia; Building with Nature","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Research on the (re)use of the outflow from an urban area as an alternative water resource is increasing in recent years. This research requires spatial and temporal information on the status of components of urban water cycle. Several hydrological models exist for the purpose of urban water management. However, none of them considers modeling the total urban water cycle by a water balance approach in a spatial explicit manner. Distributed Urban Water Cycle Model (DUWCM) is developed in this thesis to investigate the benefit of a scalable and efficient water balance model that simulates the rainfall-runoff system and water supply-wastewater system in urban areas. Two case studies were carried out to verify the model and demonstrate the capability of modeling a large hydrological catchment respectively. DUWCM is developed as adaptable to a planning-support tool UrbanBEATS. Spatial representation of the second case study will be provided by it in squared and hexagonal tessellation. Hexagons have been applied in many spatial modeling fields, while rare applications can be found in water balance modeling. A comparison of model results from squared and hexagonal grids is done in this study. The comparison demonstrates that the difference in flow direction and sampling of the land cover ratio between square and hexagon blocks results in obvious differences in the location and the magnitude of peak flows. Since hexagonal grids perform better in flow path simulation (de Sousa et al.,2006), it is expected to be preferred over squared grids in distributed hydrological models. Thus, DUWCM, being scalable in the number of blocks and shapes, has the potential to be widely applied in sustainable water management.","Total urban water cycle; Spatially distributed model; Hexagonal grid; Urban water balance modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method User research, market analysis, creative sessions and observational studies have been implemented to support the iterative process towards a solution. The creative process was divided in three cycles. The focus of the first cycle was to find a solution with high feasibility for the company, by combining products on the market and adding small but crucial design intervention to create a unified system for flat roof surfaces. The second cycle aimed to create a solution suitable for tiled roofs, which is exceedingly common in the Netherlands, yet thus far incompatible with a green roof. The focus was on creating a solution which would enhance the exterior of the building, to increase the desirability of the design (an opportunity based on client research). The two cycles resulted in two concepts with a very opposing solution approach. These concepts were presented to the company and a selection was made. This selected concept was the start of the third cycle. In this cycle, the feasibility is established by detailing the embodiment of the system. Furthermore, the viability is illustrated by a future development roadmap. Design This project’s main challenge can be summarized as finding the balance between: 1. introducing an entire roof-system to market; 2. without losing the flexibility in the wide range of products (PV, heat pump or green roof) available to fit the variance in client and household needs; 3. and with the least amount of in-house produced parts to fit the company’s resources. The solution of this project is an entire roof-system, consisting of market available components and components proposed to be developed and manufactured by the company Paviljoen 3, which are implemented into the system according to distinct development phases. By combining existing products on the market, solely introducing components which are crucial for the viability of the roof-system and separating the innovation of system’s components into separate phases, this solution diffuses the investment costs for P3, while enabling them to acquire empirical insights concerning the system, which they can apply in further system development. They can have intensive prototyping and experience using market-bought products, before they invest in launching their own product. The design cycle ends with a final prototype of the developed components, and a company evaluation. The report concludes with a list of recommendations for the company to pursue further concept development.","Sustainable; Roof-system; Solar panels; Green roof; Heat pump","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Being able to measure the effect of strain rate in a material provides more reliable material data as input for material models. Strain rates up to 10 per second can be tested using a (fast) hydraulic testing machine. Strain rates upwards from 500 per second can be tested using a Split-Hopkinson bar, but for the strain rates in between no such standard method is available. The goal of this thesis is to provide a design guide for a reliable experiment that measures the effect of strain rate, in the range 10-100 per second, on the tensile stress-strain curve of a metal. The test method proposed in this thesis consists of two parts. The first part is a test using a universal testing machine to determine material behaviour at low strain rates of 0.001-10 per second. A regular dogbone specimen with a longer grip section is used for the UTM tests, which provides the material data to design specimens for the second part. The second part is an impact test where a drophead impacts a specimen, causing it to strain. The specimens are U-shaped strips with a dogbone at either side to test material behaviour at higher strain rates of 10-100 per second. For both tests, strains are recorded in the grip and gauge sections by means of a DIC system. The main advantages of the proposed test method are (i) that no sensors are required in the drophead as the load is extracted from strain measurements in the linear elastic grip section, while the gauge section is allowed to deform plastically and (ii) by using DIC, unobtrusive measurements are taken of the strain field in the recorded area. Two analytical models have been developed, one for the universal testing machine tests and one for the impact tests. The analytical models for the UTM tests and the impact tests have been compared to a finite element model of the same specimen. When plastic strain in the gauge section becomes the most dominant component of the strain, both analytical and FE strain curves show good agreement. Numerical simulations of the impact test have been done by means of an explicit, dynamic, non-linear impact simulation using finite element analysis. A parametric study has been done using the FE model to determine the effect of drophead mass, impact velocity and specimen dimensions on the strain rate in the gauge section and the measurement accuracy. Based on the results of this study, a guideline is presented for performing the experiment. In conclusion, a novel test method and corresponding guideline to determine the stress-strain curve of metals at intermediate strain rates in the range of 10-100 per second has been presented and demonstrated by means of numerical simulations. As a future step, a set of experiments should be performed to prove the validity of the proposed test method.","Steel; DIC; Strain rate; strain rate sensitivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

(mentor); Timmerman, Pieter (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The application of vertical forests in the building industry is a popular development with promising advantages regarding sustainability. However, placing trees along a façade gives additional loads which often results in extra material use. This is undesired concerning building design, costs, and the environment. To mitigate these adverse effects, trees could be used as load-bearing structural elements. To increase the stability of such elements, it might be advantageous to connect the trees to each other. Such connections can naturally be created with inosculations: self-growing connections in which the bark and inner tissue of two trees merge. Applying living trees as structural elements requires a deeper understanding of both the botanical and structural behaviour of trees. Likewise, more must be known about the botanical and structural behaviour of self-growing connections. This research expands the knowledge on the topic of using living trees as structural elements, both as single tree elements and self-growing interconnected tree elements. This aim is reached by proposing a structural model of (interconnected) trees, which is verified by comparing the outcome of the model with the outcome of winching tests. Furthermore, a design is made in which living trees are used as structural elements in a vertical forest case study. This lays the groundwork on how to approach a living tree design, both from a structural and botanical point of view. The structural model is verified by carrying out winching tests on the Living Tree Pavilion, including one single tree, one pair of cross-connected trees and one pair of parallel-connected trees. Additionally, winching tests are performed on a tree in an airpot, in which boundaries constrain the root system. During the winching tests, a force is applied to the tree system, and the elongation is measured on several locations of the tree, providing insight into the strain distribution. Additionally, the displacement of the trees is measured at the height of the force application. Based on geometry measurements, the trees are modelled as solids in a finite element software. From the models of the interconnected trees, a compound solid is created which behaves like a single solid. The winching load is applied to the models to allow for a comparison between the results of the winching tests and the models. The geometry measurements show indications that leaning trees create an oval cross-section, which is influenced by the presence of inosculations. The winching tests show that an unconstrained root system is stiffer than a root system constrained by an airpot. Furthermore, the tests show that interconnected trees do not have favourable stiffness qualities compared to single trees. A comparison between the model and test results indicates that the finite element model is a plausible representation of reality for the single tree, the parallel-connected trees, and the out-of-plane results of the cross-connected trees. The finite element model fitted poorer with the in-plane winching test results of the cross-connected trees. More research is needed to determine whether diverging tree characteristics, in the direction that is rarely subjected to loads, could explain the discrepancy in measured and modelled behaviour. Two designs are created in which living trees of the Wonderwoods vertical forest carry the loads of a plant container. There are three reasons why cross-connected trees are not favourable over a design with single trees. First, the single trees can bear the plant containers at a younger age. Second, the risk of trees not creating suitable inosculations is high. Third, as interconnected trees share one container, the competition for space can become fierce. This research concludes that a system of interconnected trees as structural elements is not favourable over a system of single trees. This is mainly because no clear advantages in terms of strength and stability could be found in both the winching tests and the design for Wonderwoods.","Vertical Forests; Self-Growing Connections; Trees; Winching Tests","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); Verma, T. (mentor); Steringa, J.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The residential built environment in the Netherlands is on the verge of a transition of its thermal system. The Climate Agreement has suggested that municipalities will have to play a leading role in transitioning their neighborhoods' currently natural gas-driven heating systems towards sustainable alternatives. But changing the thermal systems of these neighborhoods will have consequences for the gas transmission system operator: Gasunie. Currently, no model captures this transition from the perspective of municipalities as key instigators while studying its implications on a transmission system operator. Therefore, this thesis presents a data-driven agent-based model representing the Dutch built environment consisting of municipalities, neighborhoods and energy sources to study the effect of municipal decisions in this transition on Gasunie's infrastructure. A novel municipal decision-making framework is designed that hypothesizes various factors contributing to municipal decisions in this transition. Aggregating peak gas demand to the level of Metering and Regulation stations in Gasunie's network captures the emergent behavior of interest from an infrastructural point of view. Simulation results show that the decisions of municipalities matter for the regionally required capacity in Gasunie's infrastructure, depending on the regional built environment characteristics, national transition goal, unfolding scenario, and municipal strategies. But the limited availability of renewable gas is a significant model driver and limits municipalities in what they can decide. It can be concluded that insight in the supply-side availability of the renewable gasses for the built environment in combination with multi-stakeholder coordination with the national policymaker and municipalities on the thermal transition can contribute to unraveling the uncertain character of this system and its implications for Gasunie's infrastructure. The agent-based model can expose the formulated theory of municipal decision-making and its effect on Gasunie's infrastructure while exploring and discovering what-if scenarios of interest for Gasunie and other stakeholders. It can potentially be used as a decision-support or debate starting tool by the involved stakeholders to show how their interests, characteristics, and decisions shape the change of this thermal system towards its sustainable future.","Agent-Based Modeling; Energy Transition; Thermal Transition; Built Environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

The sand eliminates the wave loads before they can reach the levee. Making use of sandy shores as flood protection in a freshwater lake environment is unique. The main goal of this thesis was to find the causes of the formation of beach cusps and their morphodynamic behavior at the Houtribdijk. From a literature study, we had found that high-angle wave instabilities are the likely cause of beach cusp formation. This mechanism causes longshore transport of sediment due to differences between wave run-up when waves arrive at the beach under an acute angle. Low-energy environments like these are influenced by higher-energy (stormy) events, caused by wind forcing that produces short, steep, and erosive waves. Topography and bathymetry measurement data along two kilometer-long transects was available, as well as constant hydrodynamic measurements at two locations. Using this data, we quantified the number of cusps, their alongshore position, wavelength, amplitude, and the asymmetry of their top-view shape. By extrapolating the prevailing theory on high-angle wave instabilities, we arrived at a conceptual model for the large scale (kilometer-long) morphological changes of the beach. This conceptual model then related these changes to the hydrodynamics we thought were responsible. <br/>The results of this analysis indicate that the number of cusps increases under the influence of high-angle waves. Also, their peaks will start moving in the same direction as the waves, causing them to ‘lean’. Most of these changes are on a time-scale in the order of days, while some larger features migrate in the order of months. We have found that environments like these are very likely to develop beach cusps.","low-energy; beach cusps; high-angle waves; sandy shores; lake; ShorelineS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","52.663097, 5.368982"

A number of methods have been proposed in the literature. This master thesis aims to provide a framework for energy providers to forecast charging demand due to increased EV adoption. Specifically, this research examines the effects that rental EV adoption has on charging demand at Icelandic energy provider ON Power’s fast charging stations. Further, it establishes how increased technological developments and infrastructure spending can be balanced to avoid unnecessary costs, and if ON Power’s charging infrastructure is prepared to meet the electricity demand that a fully electrified rental car fleet would bring. To answer these questions, an agent-based modeling framework was constructed to simulate charging demand in ON Power’s network. The model simulates all tourists that use rental cars in driving the Icelandic ring road as if the entire fleet consisted of EVs. A case study is conducted where the Icelandic ring road is split into nine zones, and six scenarios that each reflect different technological developments are simulated using the modeling framework. The research findings indicate a significant change in charging demand. Firstly, rental EVs affect seasonal charging demand with more than half of the demand occurring in the summer months of June-August. Secondly, geographical charging demand shifts from mostly being in the greater capital area, to mostly being outside of it. Thirdly, a sufficient charging infrastructure at Keflavík Airport is a major factor in the electrification of the Icelandic rental car fleet. The research findings further indicate that with the right strategy, it is well within reach for ON Power to handle the rental EV charging demand. A strategy is proposed for ON power to avoid unnecessary spending while still meeting charging demand, which considers current demand, future demand, and how new charging station locations should be determined.","ABM; simulation; charging demand; electric vehicles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Peak shaving is a technique that consists of shifting electricity consumption from hours of high demand to times of low demand, and has been gaining popularity in recent years. It allows to reduce peak loads which must be met at all times, which in turn reduces the need to resort to less efficient and more expensive power plants to see that all peaks are met. This paper proposes two methods to operate a battery energy storage system (BESS) for peak shaving of daily load profiles, based on the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. The first approach treats historical profiles as deterministic paths and solves the DP algorithm for each profile. Then, an operating plan is obtained in real-time by combining the policies calculated for each path. The second approach treats data as stochastic paths, from which it derives a probabilistic model for the target path. Given this model, the DP algorithm obtains an operating plan for the entire day ahead. We also propose three modifications that can be applied to the two methods which aim at the improving the reliability of the methods. The performance of the proposed methods is examined through numerical experiments on both artificial and real data.","Dynamic programming; Peak shaving; Battery energy storage system (BESS)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

This is largely due to the fact that an increasing amount of people is choosing to live alone. The aim of this thesis to understand the forces behind the rise of the solo dweller and to find a proper way of designing a nature-inclusive residential building that will accommodate the needs of this group. The answer to the research question: “What is the value of urban nature for solo dwellers?” was found by means of a critical discourse analysis, case studies analyses and a re-interpretation of nature within cities. Solo dwellers can be divided into two categories: people who choose to live alone and people who are forced to do so. The former group thrives on the opportunities that the urban environment provides. The latter group, however, is generally more vulnerable to feelings of loneliness and social isolation. Re-interpreting nature as “something that is left to be altered by time rather than being controlled by means of human intervention” can strengthen the idea of the open city as introduced by Richard Sennett. The open city is favourable to the solo dweller, who needs to have opportunities instead of obligations. Open cities are not fixed forms, but rather open in time. This type of environment is especially fit for solo dwellers, who suffer under excessive control, similar to spontaneous and ruderal vegetation. If we strive for reconciliation between humans and nature, we must allow both to appropriate spaces; to leave their marks of inhabitation; to dwell within the city. Spontaneous and open forms of urban nature seem to be suitable for the networked individual, the solo dweller who is capable of living alone. However, more managed forms of urban nature, such as urban rooftop farms, are more suitable to the latter group. They provide a meeting place and an activity that can be shared.","Solo dweller; Living Alone; Urban Nature; Open City","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","One million homes","52.4004518, 4.8757375"

The audible warning is based on a woman's voice, varying in three levels of urgency, speech-rate and syntax, and incorporate a lateral deviation measurement by varying the lane width. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the experiment was changed to a N=1-study, meaning that only one participant, namely the lead researcher, partook in his own experiment. The driving experiment consisted of 81 runs, each having a TOR after approximately 8 minutes of automated driving. When the automated vehicle is in control, the human driver is asked to do a secondary task, namely the challenging game Tetris on a tablet to get distracted from the situation on the road. It was found that an increase in urgency (take-over type) means a decrease in take-over time (TOT). No significant differences were found for the speech-rate in relation to the TOT, whereas for the syntax, only the STR and UTR had significant differences. Lateral deviation was found to increase when urgency increases, which means that accuracy decreases with higher urgency.

(mentor); Dukai, B. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The surface water extent around the world is constantly changing due to natural factors (e.g. geology and over-abstraction of water), climate change (e.g. higher water evaporation due to warmer climate) or human activities (e.g. reservoir construction). Water reservoirs are important for the management of the ecosystem, as both humans and the natural environment depend highly on them for their existence and well being. Flood control, agricultural irrigation, electricity generation, drinking and municipal water supply are only some of their main uses. Considering this, it is of high importance to have accurate maps that depict the reservoir outlines to determine their surface extend and storage capacity. However, their extend is not always well defined or there are discrepancies between various surface water datasets. This dissertation aims to provide an answer about which datasets match better as well as identifying the problematic areas by performing a quality control analysis. The main challenge of this thesis is that all available datasets have certain limitations regarding their coverage and quality. The waterbody delineation from satellite images is affected by the atmospheric conditions (e.g cloud obstructions) or topographic elements that create artifacts and influence the correct classification of water pixels. OpenStreetmap (OSM) on the other hand, has uncertain quality over locations, as the data is freely supplied by volunteers. Moreover, HydroLAKES which was created based, amongst others, on the Global Reservoir and Dam Dataset (GRanD), is still incomplete. In this thesis, an intercomparison of accuracy algorithm that can perform large scale analysis is created, by using the country of Angola as a use case, five datasets as input (Global Surface Water, Sentinel 2, OSM, HydroLAKES, GRaND) in both raster and vector format and the cloud processing platform of Google Earth engine. The identification of similarities or mismatches between the datasets is performed in terms of positional accuracy. Two quality measures have been considered for the pairwise comparison of features: percentage of overlap and Hausdorff distance. In addition the completeness of the datasets respectively to the total common water area of the water reservoir datasets is reviewed. The results of this research shows that large scale analysis for the comparison of accuracy between water reservoir datasets of different formats is possible. The pre-processing of the input Satellite data is semi-automated. The created automated algorithm for the main analysis offers information for all corresponding features between datasets. More specifically, statistics about the shape similarity, the percentage of overlap and the water area completeness of the datasets are being presented.","Volunteered Geographic Information , Satellite Imagery, Positional accuracy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

The studio Methods and Analysis advocates the research process consisting of contextual, conceptual, and disciplinary analysis that results in a fully-fledged architectural intervention.

The design of the courtyards implemented these instruments to mediate between resolving the issues found in the current situation and the surroundings.

When sufficiently boron-doped, diamond has metal-like conductivity and in comparison with other electrode materials has several advantages, such as lowand stable background current, reduced biofouling, broad potentialwindow, corrosion resistance and chemical stability. However, current fabrication processes rely on top-down techniques, that often require cleanrooms and expensive micro fabrication techniques. This research focuses on a low-cost bottom-up fabrication technique by using an inkjet printing process to locally increase the substrate seeding density. Thin-film BDD can then be selectively grown into electrode geometries. The BDD electrodes can be used as more robust and better performing electrodes for detectingmicropollutants in environmental monitoring or for detecting biomarkers in saliva, sweat or blood, in health monitoring. Inkjet manufacturing is an emerging production process in micro fabrication. Due to its accuracy, material efficiency, and given that it is a digital process, inkjet printing is a strong candidate for bottom-up fabrication of low-cost and customizable BDD (micro)-electronics. Two inkjet printers were used to investigate themicro fabrication technique for a BDD chip electrode. A hacked desktop Epson printer was used to demonstrate the capabilities of selective seeding using ’diamond’ ink on silicon substrates and to grow patterned thin-film intrinsic diamond. However, the printer lacks the required control to produce continuous structures with high accuracy. A second method for selective seeding was employed by using a PIXDRO LP-50 commercial research printer, which has a high resolution, motion controlled print bed. With the application of surface treatments, such as oxygen plasma, on the silicon substrate and the development of different inks, continuous films of nanocrystaline diamond with line resolution of approximately 60 μm are produced in a final chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth step. In addition, by loading the printer with a silver ink part of the diamond film has been coated with silver, which demonstrates that a reference electrodes or electrode leads can be manufactured with the same production technique. This research demonstrates the potential for the bottom-up fabrication of chip electrodes using the inkjet printing process. Furthermore, as this process is not limited to the production of BDD electrodes, it opens the path towards bottom-up fabrication of other (boron-doped) diamond sensor devices, such as gas sensors or 2D heaters.","Diamond; substrate seeding; bottom-up fabrication; Inkjet Printing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

(mentor); Aravind, P.V. (graduation committee); Pourquie, M.J.B.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Although the Dutch energy supply is gradually progressing from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, the consequences for the grid are becoming increasingly evident. Meanwhile, the gas extraction from the Groningen natural gas reserve is de- clining as the induced earthquakes in the northern Netherlands persist. Hydrogen, as a flexible carbon-free molecule, offers a potential solution to the overcapacity of the electricity grid and thus has the potential to fulfill an important role in the fu- ture energy supply. It has recently been proved that by making few adjustments in the grid assets, the existing gas grid can be made compatible with hydrogen. A relating issue to hydrogen distribution through the gas grid is the resulting hydrogen qual- ity. Similarly to natural gas, the roll-out of a national hydrogen grid needs a national quality standard. There will be a variety of end-use applications, such as hydrogen boilers and fuel cell technologies that have different quality requirements.<br/>This report researches the influences of the distribution of hydrogen through the existing gas grid. There are five sources of contamination: odorant, inward permeation of air through polymer pipelines, particles circulating in the grid, leaks causing an entrance for contaminants and byproducts from hydrogen production technologies. All five sources are considered, but the focus of this report is on inward permeation of air through low pressure polymer pipelines. There are three significant risks which are linked to the permeation of air: feed dilution, explosion risk and damage to fuel cells. Fick’s laws for diffusion were used to create a computation model, from which relationships were found between seven variables and the amount of contamination. Correlations were found between the amount of permeated air and the pipeline material, pressure, inner diameter, wall thickness, flow velocity, temperature and soil type. Pure hydrogen was modelled to be distributed through the low pressure grid at different conditions. After traveling 100 meters through an MDPE pipeline with 26 mm inner diameter and wall thickness of 3 mm at a flow velocity of 1 m/s, 1.4 mg oxygen and 1.9 mg of nitrogen per m3 hydrogen will have diffused into the pipeline. The results have been implemented in a case study in Stad aan ’t Haringvliet in Goeree-Overvlakkee, and the contamination for the farthest distance in the grid was found to be 0.057 ppm oxygen and 0.085 ppm nitrogen at a flow velocity of 1 m/s. Following the research set out above, no issues were found in connecting hydrogen boilers to the existing grid. Low temperature PEM fuel cells are more sensitive to impurities than boilers and some concerns were found under certain specific conditions with exceeding the current hydrogen fuel contamination limit for oxygen stated in ISO 14687-2. After traveling 529 m through MDPE and 5.8 km through HDPE the oxygen limit was exceeded. This is not considered as a constraint for the development of a future hydrogen grid, as this upper limit was set for the fuel requirement of metal hydride storage, and existing hydrogen road vehicles have another means of storage. A positive side effect of the presence of oxygen in the hydrogen feed is that it reacts with carbon monoxide, thereby decreasing fuel cell poisoning effects. Nitrogen contamination of the hydrogen feed can dilute the fuel and only at high concentrations increase fuel cell cathode poisoning caused by carbon monoxide. These high concentrations are not expected to be achieved as a result of inward permeation of nitrogen. Consequently, through the obtained results in this research it is believed that a sufficiently high purity hydrogen can be achieved in the existing distribution grid.","hydrogen; gas grid; gas quality; distribution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

These consumers are the next generation parents, generation Z born between 1995 and 2010. Research has been conducted into the needs and values of Generation Z and Parents within the field of pregnancy. The research draws on internal desk research, trend research, interviews, and a survey. The challenge for this project was that the majority of Generation Z are not parents themselves yet, which makes it difficult to predict their future desires. This led to the research question:How to create a new value proposition for Philips Avent that corresponds to the future needs, values, and behaviour of the next generation parents, Generation Z, while the majority of this generation is not yet in this phase of their life? The internal analysis, consisting of strategy, product portfolio and target audience analyses, revealed the potential value of the app in the way Philips Avent approaches their target group. Furthermore, Philips Avent wants to become more present for parents in the pregnancy stage. At the moment, Philips Avent only focuses its portfolio on specific childcare routines leaving the partner or other relatives out. Philips’ strategy shows that Philips is moving towards a connected healthcare system, which means that connected products and services ensure that data can be converted into better healthcare for their consumers. Trend and desk research, consisting of global, parenthood en generation Z trends revealed that omnichannel as a retail strategy, personalised experiences, consumers’ health and wellbeing, doing things from home online and inclusivity are becoming more important to people in life. Furthermore, in parenthood, the parent’s own life, equal parenting, their health, and parenting apps are important aspects during this stage of life. Lastly, Generation Z shows that they are health-conscious, they find transparency and responsibility important in companies, they rely on multiple sources when it comes to their health and buying products, experiences are more important than products, they are influenced by social media and are targeted the best through digital storytelling. After determining pregnancy as a scope, interviews and a survey with Generation Z and expecting mothers have been conducted and were validated through a questionnaire amongst mothers of all generations. The insights showed that Generation Z can feel insecure about the future when it comes to climate change and the corona crisis, their purchasing behaviour is mainly influenced by social media and Philips as a company did not stand out to them. Pregnant women can feel insecure when it comes to being prepared for parenthood, combining normal life with pregnancy and the feeling of not knowing what is normal during their pregnancy. A three horizon strategy is proposed, including advertisements showing real pregnancy situations, a personalised omnichannel experience and new products and services that fit the whole pregnancy experience building up to a future vision. This strategy is based on the findings from the research and a creative session with people from Philips and the target group.","Generation Z; Pregnancy; Omnichannel; Roadmap; Platform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Also, because the Netherlands has the ambition to build 1 million houses by 2030, it offers the opportunity to tackle the concrete in the Dutch housing sector and apply the concept of reuse and standardization. This study aims to contribute to a more sustainable built environment and to provide a design tool on how to design a sustainable and reusable concrete facade system. Through literature study and analyses of case studies, the most important design criteria have been set up that focuses on the aspects<i> of </i>building efficiency, standardization, sustainability and adaptability<i>.</i> The three main strategies that have been used that summarize these criteria and form the final design strategy are: Rethink, Reduce and Reuse. The process begins with Rethink. Firstly, designing the facade system for repeated use, through standardization, and finding the best suitable dimensions for the facade system. Secondly, by increasing its functional flexibility and adaptability by designing it for multiple uses and target audiences. The second strategy, Reduce, helps the design to reduce waste, material and CO2 emissions. Firstly, by researching how to make concrete more sustainable. Secondly, by building lightweight through the use of a lightweight shape and material, such as lightweight aggregate concrete. At last, the strategy of Reuse will come into play where modularity forms the basis for a reusable design that focuses on the building efficiency by means of the concept of design for disassembly. As a result, these strategies conclude in a final design strategy that consists of a decision chart that guides the architect or client and offers multiple options for building systems. This enables the architect or client to have design freedom while providing an easy guide that helps to choose a building system. In order to successfully implement a sustainable and reusable concrete facade system, it is recommended to present a good business case that focuses on the barriers of reuse and how these can be best resolved.","Reusable Facade system; Sustainablity of concrete; Design Strategy; Design Tool; Modular Building System","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

The relationship between urban heritage with new-developed urban area –the discussion between past and future, is always an interesting and exciting topic for me. The location, position, attention and many other characters of the urban heritage changes with the urbanization process, which usually cause disconnection, paradox and chaos. There are counter-examples in these cases, but no matter what, they are usually not built to adapt to the current urban environment. However, the urban heritage usually has great potentials for the city development. For example, heritage tourism is seen as a way to bolster struggling urban economies and redevelop municipal spaces (Chang.T.C, Milne.S, Fallon.D, Pohlmann.C, 1996). Therefore, how to turn contradictions into opportunities is what we need to focus on. The initial assignment of this project comes from the recreational and co-using demands of the historical country estates owners in Arnhem, Gelderland. But is this the true issue of these estates? What is hiding behind this demand? What makes the owners felt wrong? Do these estates integrate well with the newly developed urban environment?

This is not due to the complexity of the required repair, but due to, among others, the shortage of sufficiently educated and motivated Biomedical Equipment Technicians (BMETs). This research will focus on the knowledge gap of how to use, maintain and repair medical and laboratory equipment and the missing motivation of BMETs in LMIC by setting up a Pilot Course. The objective of this research is to verify the possibility to train BMETs in LMIC with the required set of skills and knowledge with an online training and the possibility to intrinsically motivate participants to perform better within an online training, whilst taking local limitations and cultural norms and values into account. Based on the findings, a recommendation will be given for the creation of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) to train BMETs in LMIC. In addition, if proven intrinsic motivation can be stimulated during training, the next step would be to prove intrinsic motivation to perform better on the job as BMET can be stimulated during training. In that manner, this research aims to set the first step in decreasing the large number of reported out of service medical and laboratory equipment by closing the knowledge gap and by increasing motivation among future BMETs. A Pilot Course was created educating participants with knowledge and skills required to use, maintain and repair the Patient Monitor. In addition, several surveys were spread to request expectations, feedback and general input with regards to the development of a MOOC to train BMETs. Within the Pilot Course four cohort groups were created. This research will focus on the distinction between two of the four groups; a group exposed to motivational incentives and a group not exposed to motivational incentives. This distinction must verify the possibility to intrinsically motivate participants to perform better in a Pilot Course. The Pilot Course itself, together with the surveys must give insights on how to design and setup a MOOC to train BMETs in LMIC. It was found that BMETs can indeed be educated with the set of skills and knowledge exposed to in an online training. There was no significant difference found in performance in the Pilot Course between the different cohort groups and thus no significant impact of the motivational incentives on performance detected. The completion rate was higher for the group not exposed to the motivational incentives. It was also found that the completion rate was higher among participants from South-East Asia compared to Africa, which was not caused by the different cohort groups, but by the propensity to stick to discipline coherent to the Asian culture. No other significant relations or results were found. Based on these conclusions my recommendation is to create a MOOC to train BMETs in LMIC to close the currently existing knowledge gap. When designing the MOOC, I would recommend using guidelines and recommendations presented in this research. Additionally, I recommend to further investigate the possibility to intrinsically motivate participants during training and thereby influence their behaviour to perform better as a BMET.","BMET; LMIC; MOOC; Motivation; Medical equipment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In proton therapy, robust treatment planning is currently used to account for uncertainties in patient alignment and proton beam range. A way to overcome the limitations of robust treatment planning is to use probabilistic treatment planning, which can be computationally expensive due to the calculations of statistical measures of stochastic dose parameters. For this purpose, the method of Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) has been introduced to alleviate computational costs. PCEs are helpful to evaluate the statistical measures analytically, or via sampling, and can usually be evaluated faster than through calculations with the dose engine. In this research, the work of Salverda et al. (2019) is extended upon improving probabilistic treatment planning with Polynomial Chaos Expansion for proton therapy. Probabilistic treatment plan optimizations with patient data in ErasmusMC's iCycle were found to be too costly for clinical use with computation times in the order of 1-3 weeks. The goal of this research is to alleviate the computational cost of probabilistic treatment planning, in which percentiles of stochastic dose volume parameters are used, with the aim of a proof of principle for clinical use. <br/><br/>New methodologies on the calculation of the value, gradient and Hessian of percentiles of dose volume parameters, and treatment plan optimizations with these methods, are tested on a simplified 3D geometry with a tumor and an organ in Matlab. The optimizations are performed with the `fmincon' solver, using the default interior-point algorithm. The construction of PCEs is performed with the OpenGPC package, developed by Z. Perkó et al. (2016). <br/><br/>Three exact improvements on the calculation of the value, gradient and Hessian of percentiles of dose volume parameters have been implemented and show an overall reduction in computation time of 30%. These improvements yield a similar speed-up in the total optimization time of a probabilistic treatment plan, depending on the dose parameters in the objectives and constraints, and their computation times. Furthermore, the accuracy of the gradient and Hessian of percentiles of dose volume parameters has been improved through the introduction of a monotonicity constraint on the PCE coefficients. To reduce the computation time even further, an approximation method is devised for the calculation of the gradient and Hessian of percentiles of dose volume parameters. This method shows a decrease in computation time from 5,600 seconds to only 220 seconds per calculation of the value, gradient and Hessian of a percentile of a dose volume parameter for the 3D geometry and a sample size of 500,000. The problem is that the approximation method is quite heuristic and its accuracy cannot be predicted in general. However, relatively accurate percentile approximations are produced with small absolute errors. Optimizations of probabilistic treatment plans are performed with the exact and approximate method, yielding small differences in terms of dose distributions due to differences in sample size. The cases with the approximation method yield the fastest optimization times and are shown to be 7.6 times faster, from 5.3 days to 16.5 hours, than the case with the exact method and a sample size of 500,000. The cases with the exact method show to be 2.5 and 1.2 times faster for a sample size of 50,000 and 250,000 than for a sample size of 500,000 respectively. The higher number of iterations in cases with the approximation method and cases with the exact method for smaller sample sizes outweigh the rapid increase in computation time for higher sample sizes with the exact method.<br/><br/>A decrease in computation time is shown for probabilistic treatment planning, in which percentiles of dose volume parameters are used, in general, and also in implementations in the 3D geometry with and without the approximation method. In future research, the decrease in computation time with the exact improvements should be investigated in optimizations with patient data in iCycle. Also, the approximation method should be tested on different geometries and for multiple uncertain parameters in the geometry to investigate whether this method is robust enough to be tested in optimizations with patient data in iCycle. As a conclusion, the new methodologies in this research do improve probabilistic treatment planning with Polynomial Chaos Expansion for proton therapy by alleviating computational cost, but a proof of principle for clinical use is not yet achieved.","Proton Therapy; Polynomial Chaos Expansion; Probabilistic Treatment Planning; Erasmus-iCycle; OpenGPC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-31","","","","Applied Mathematics | Computational Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Transverse jet injection into supersonic crossflows is encountered with Aerospace applications such as fuel injection in Supersonic Combustion Ramjet (SCRamjet) engines and reaction-jet-based attitude control systems. In particular, for the case of SCRamjets, the short residence times of the fuel in the combustion chamber can be countered by the rapid mixing process in the near field of transverse jet injection. Research in the field focused on the development of jet trajectory correlations and the characterisation of the flow large-scale structures through, predominantly, flow visualisations and numerical simulations. The advent of full-field, quantitative experimental techniques has brought more insight into the jet behaviour in the interaction far-field. However, there is a scarcity of full-field quantitative experimental data in the near field of the injection. This study investigates the effect of a set of major flow control variables on the near and mid-field of the interaction by performing experimental measurements of transverse jets injected into a Mach 2 crossflow. To achieve this, the techniques of Schlieren imaging and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) are used in tandem. The PIV setup consisted of a dual-camera layout, which made it possible to obtain 2-dimensional mid-plane velocity vector maps in the range up to 17 diameters. During the investigation, the jet Mach number and the jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratio were varied. The obtained Schlieren images and PIV vector fields displayed the characteristic interaction and jet shock structures, including the bow and boundary layer separation shock, the jet barrel shock and Mach disc. The location strength and width of the jet wake and the counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP) formed aft of the injection were indicated by the streamwise and vertical velocity, respectively. Increase in the jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratio led to increase in the near field jet penetration and blockage, causing a stronger bow shock and larger separation. Turbulence intensity contours and velocity deficit and vertical velocity profiles also show an increase in the wake and CVP upwash strength and penetration. Variation of the jet Mach number was found to affect the flow field significantly. Switching from sonic to supersonic injection caused less blockage near field, yet similar penetration was seen in the mid-field. The formation of the characteristic CVP seemed to be delayed, and the extent and strength of the turbulent structures were smaller as compared to the sonic injection case.","Supersonic; Jet; Turbulence; SCRamjet; Crossflow; Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV); Schlieren; mixing; trajectory; Nozzles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); RWTH Aachen University (degree granting institution); Aalto University (degree granting institution)","2020","Current evacuation plans for underground mines are inefficient and outdated. Simulations have proven that smart evacuation can significantly increase the efficiency of escape times in case of an emergency. In a smart evacuation, miners are given real time instructions on a smart device (such as a smart-watch) about their route to a safe haven if an emergency occurs. In order to make smart evacuation possible, an optimization model is needed that determines the most efficient route to safety. Currently, shortest path algorithms, such as Dijkstra’s algorithm, Floyd-Warshall’s algorithm, or ant colony optimization are used for solving the optimization models. These algorithms, however, are computationally inefficient (Dijkstra and Floyd-Warshall) or may not provide the optimal solution (ant colony optimization). In this thesis, a mathematical programming method will be used to calculate the most efficient escape plan. Mathematical programming translates the goal of finding the most efficient escape solution to an optimization problem. The goal of this optimization problem is to minimize the total distance travelled by all individuals that are underground in case of an emergency. This is done by setting an objective function, which sums up all the distances travelled by the miners, and a set of constraints, which are used to localize the miners and safe havens. The ensuing problem statement is solved using the network simplex algorithm. This principle was used to calculate escape solutions in four different scenarios: with or without blocked pathways and with or without correcting the distances for the stamina of the individual miner. Four different types of results were generated: the division of miners among the safe havens, the total distance travelled by all individuals taking part in the evacuation, the path of an individual miner (called Miner X), and the running times of the different scenarios. It was found that blocked paths can have a large impact on the division of miners among safe havens and can significantly increase the total distance travelled. Using stamina categories increases the path length of Miner X (who has a high stamina) and also the running times of the algorithm. It can be concluded that the algorithm works for all four scenarios. As including blocked paths does not give a time penalty, but will locate trapped miners and send their colleagues on safer escape routes, using this feature has no downsides. The usefulness of adding stamina categories to the algorithm can be debated. The running time of the algorithm increases, while the solutions for realistic numbers of miners do not change. Furthermore, there are philosophical and social questions about the ethics of using these types of categories.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences | European Mining Course","European Mining Course",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Space debris objects with sizes between 1 and 10 cm form the greatest risks for creating new collisions with active spacecraft as they are too small to track and too large to be shielded against. This research has simulated the performance of a space-based laser system on the removal of these small-scale debris objects. The selected system is placed in a Sun-synchronous orbit and consists of a high power 20 kW laser that shoots 600 J energy pulses with a repetition frequency of 33.33 Hz. The system detects and tracks the objects in-situ using a 1.5 m telescope from 800 km distance. From a distance of about 500 km, the laser fluence on the targets is sufficiently high to trigger ablation on the material surface. This decelerates the debris object and lowers its lifetime. The laser is tested on a randomly generated debris population of 5 000 objects. The results show that after 10 days of simulation, the lifetime of 334 objects are effectively lowered below 25 years and 614 objects are lowered below one month. At longer simulation time the efficiency decreases since less and less objects are left to target. Extrapolating the results, the laser could on an annual basis lower the lifetime of more than 36 000 objects below 1 month and 18 000 objects below 25 years, which is very promising. The results show that a space-based laser system is highly efficient as an Active Debris Removal (ADR) technique for debris objects between 1 and 10 cm.","Space; Debris; Removal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Even though the mortality rate has decreased over the years, the need for a higher quality of life after severe burns remains. Decreasing the probability of a severe contraction is essential for increasing the quality of life. Mathematical models have been developed to predict skin contraction over time. However, the computations are time-expensive and not suitable for applications that require many simulations, for example, when considering input uncertainty for patient-based predictions. To that end, the application of neural network surrogates is studied to accelerate the computations of a morphoelastic numerical model for the prediction of skin contraction. Two datasets are generated from a one- and two-dimensional model respectively and are used to train the neural networks. It is shown that a feedforward neural network can accurately learn the nonlinear mapping between the input parameters and the outputs of the considered morphoelastic models. The trained neural network provides fast and accurate predictions on skin contraction and strain energy. Furthermore, a first step is taken towards a hybrid model where a neural network is applied as a surrogate for computationally expensive time-stepping in the numerical model. The added value of fast neural network surrogates is demonstrated in two clinical case studies. It is shown that the surrogate can be used to perform input parameter studies by comparing an age study with the morphoelastic model with the age study using the neural network. The neural network can reproduce the age study with high accuracy in just a fraction of the time. Secondly, a concept application is designed to demonstrate patient-based predictions using Monte-Carlo simulations to cope with input parameter uncertainty. The application provides predictions for skin contraction and the strain energy, based on the age of the patient and the wound size.","Neural network; burn injuries; skin contraction; surrogate modeling; morphoelasticity; hybrid modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The historical centre of the city is characteristic for its colonial set-up. During the last few decades the city of Semarang has been expanding rapidly. Nowadays, the historical centre of the city is not central anymore. In Semarang, the functions which require a lot of space such as health care facilities are likely to be located in the peripheral, newer neighbourhoods, where space is still available. And so, the dense historical cores of these cities lack medical functions. During more certain times, Indonesia’s health care system already has to deal with challenging circumstances. As the scarcely distributed and non-inclusive character of the Indonesian health care system has to deal with one of the biggest crises in medical history, opportunities arise as people are forced to focus on the distribution of health care services. As Dutch-colonial buildings are available in the historical centres of large Javanese coastal cities, transformation could provide a solution to the lack of appropriate places for the establishment of health care institutions. In this graduation project, a possible role for Dutch-colonial architecture as host for medical applications is explored. The technical possibilities of Dutch-colonial buildings, regarding their ability to adapt to the Javanese climatic circumstances and their structural integrity have an important role in the project. How can centrally located Dutch-colonial architecture serve as a foundation for the development of a socio-cultural and socio-economical based health care facility, in order develop a more inclusive medical system in Indonesia? The design which is developed in this graduation project is a modular system which is easy to replicate in segments. In this way, the new medical function can be tailored to fit the existing structures.

One of the main factors of non-wear is the high weight.

To illustrate this potential, the goal of this thesis was: ""To show the potential of pneumatic prostheses by designing a lightweight pneumatic elbow prosthesis, with a functionality equivalent to existing prostheses"". Methods: The design process was divided into five phases: Analysis, Conceptualization, Embodiment, Manufacturing and Assembly, and Testing. The analysis brought to light the functions, requirements, wishes, and design values. The two design phases, conceptualization and embodiment, translated these into a potentially viable prosthesis. Afterwards, a prototype was manufactured, assembled, and tested to see if the functions, wishes, and requirements were met. Results: The prototype weighs almost 1300 [g]. A payload of 4.0 [kg] can be lifted to 87 [<b>°</b>]. In theory, 2.5 [kg] can be lifted throughout the entire range of motion, up to 140 [<b>°</b>]. The maximum pronation/supination torque is over 2.8 [Nm] throughout the entire range of motion of ± 90 [<b>°</b>]. The locking mechanism is theoretically capable of passively holding over 6 [kg] in any position. In theory, an average of 125 cycles can be achieved per 25 [g] CO2 cartridge. Discussion: The prototype does not have an integrated fuel source. The weight of the prototype exceeds the maximum by almost 280 [g]. Switching to electronic control significantly decreases the prosthesis mass. The frame of the prototype was under-constrained, leading to an increased friction for higher angles of flexion. Conclusion: The combination of the high functionality and low mass of the prototype shows potential for pneumatic actuation for prostheses.","Pneumatic; Elbow; Prosthesis; Lightweight","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ICLS method uses an additional advection step with a correction-velocity field to restore global volume loss/gain. We present the volume-of-fluid-based local interface-correction level-set (VOF-LICLS) method. This is an extension to the ICLS method that aims to restore volume locally. This is achieved by coupling the ICLS method with the VoF method. In each time step we evolve both the level-set function and the volume fraction function. The VoF advection is performed using a Lagrangian-Eulerian method on a dual mesh. From the advected LS field volume fractions are constructed and compared to the advected VoF field. This allows us to use local volume fluxes for the velocity field, instead of a global volume flux. The construction of the correction-velocity is performed with the use of an analytic equation and the local volume fluxes. The novel volume correction procedure is then executed iteratively. The level-set equation is discretized in space with a finite element approach. Instabilities occur for the standard Galerkin approach for pure advection equation, so the SUPG method is used in order to obtain stable solutions. The performance of the developed method in this thesis is compared with LS and ICLS for three different test cases. We report a significant improvement for local volume conservation, and we observe that VOF-LICLS yields more accurate interface positions.","Level-set method; Volume-conserving; Finite element method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, when we look at historical centres with their vernacular buildings, we seem to prefer them to the modern ones. According to Amos Rapoport there are three types of societies; primitive, vernacular and the modern. Each of these societies operates in such a fundamentally different way that we cannot understand their architectural differences just by comparing their looks. We need to delve into the characteristics of these societies to understand the different appearances (Rapoport, 1969). Materials could suddenly come from everywhere and building components were standardised because of mass-production (Salingaros, 2014). The buildings became more anonymous and less an expression of the place (Golden, 2012). The relationship to nature changed, modern society went from a symbiosis to a dominating role in which it exhausts nature and creates waste and toxins. Gradually, society is discovering the negative sides of this industrial efficiency. With the upswing of sustainability awareness we recognise that our ‘throwaway society’ is no longer acceptable (Chapman, 2015). We demolish recent buildings that seem to be fine and there is a growing number of vacant office buildings (Gemeente Amsterdam, 2013). At the same time there is a shortage of housing, but demand and supply do not seem to match because there is a lack of flexibility and attractiveness. To prevent future vacancy we need to focus on transforming the office areas into mixed-use urban areas instead of mono-residential areas. In redevelopment, there are many considerations what to maintain and what to demolish. How few interventions can we do to achieve this intended quality? How can we reintroduce attractive vernacular qualities in existing office buildings to transform them into attractive, vibrant, multifunctional and resilient urban areas? Through the research, I discovered three issues with modern society's approach to building, resulting in three design objectives: AESTHETICS | Creating lively, local and personal facades. FUNCTION | Making change in function and preferences possible. TECHNOLOGY | Using biodegradable materials.","Vernacular approach; Vernacular design strategies; Office building; Biodegradable; redevelopment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Intecture","Second Life","52.387667, 4.842936"

In contrast to the frequency and gravity of contractures following from skin grafts, the phenomenon itself is still poorly understood and subject of studies. The development of an accurate model of skin contractures will allow medical researchers to better understand the healing process compared to current in vitro experiments and thus enable the design of efficient and patient-specific treatments. In this work we provide a mathematical model able to capture both the mechanical and biological processes involved in skin graft healing. Two-dimensional morphoelastic equations are used to model the mechanics of contraction of skin during the healing process. A system of equations describing the cell components (myo-, fibroblasts, collagen density and signalling molecule) is solved separately to derive the forcing terms for the mechanical system. The finite element method with bilinear quadrilateral elements is used to solve the differential equations on a moving time-dependent domain. A flux corrected transport (FCT) algorithm is used to stabilize the biological equations, thus enforcing positivity of the constituents in the dermal layer and nonlinearities are treated using Picard iterations. Time stepping is performed by applying the Euler backward scheme for the mechanical system and the implicit midpoint rule for the biological system. The results are replicated using the IGA (Isogeometric Analysis) library G+Smo in C++. The results of the IGA implementation provide a solid basis for future algorithms using IGA.","finite elements; bilinear elements; morphoelasticity; skin grafts; contracture; flux corrected transport (FCT); isogeometric analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

This research aims to explore the possibility of using information from driver inputs, dynamic vehicle states, and features of the road environment to improve motion cueing through simulator prepositioning. Probabilistic models were established to predict longitudinal maneuvering for a short scenario consisting of a drive on a two-lane road through a rural area. By combining the accelerator deflection, the vehicle’s velocity and the future speed limit in a logistic regression model, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.84 for acceleration prediction and 0.77 for deceleration prediction, using a lookahead time of 5 seconds. In order to use these predictions for motion cueing, the prediction model was extended to a prepositioning module. The proposed design was tested in combination with a classical washout algorithm on a small hexapod-based driving simulator in a human-in-the-loop experiment. No distinguishable results were obtained in objective and subjective evaluation of the motion cueing quality, as possibilities to improve motion cueing were limited with the experimental setup used. Nevertheless, the workspace usage was improved significantly. The average distance that could be maintained from the edge of the simulator’s workspace, could be increased from 0.025 meter to 0.084 meter, for equivalent motion cueing.","motion cueing; driving simulation; prepositioning; maneuver detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-11-05","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The purpose of this research is to gain insight into the design process in healthcare building projects, more particularly into the way the end-users groups like the medical caregivers and the design team exchanged information and participate in developing the design. The focus of this research is the end-user design team interactions in the hospital design process.<br/>The main research question is: In hospital building projects, how does the project organization translate the end-user information into design? By performing a single case study, data was collected through context analysis, document analysis, and in-depth interviews about end-user involvement, information flow, and decision-making process in Erasmus MC Rotterdam new building project. Ten interviews were conducted with different members of the project organization including project managers and leaders, design experts, and also external advisors. The research analysis illustrates a participative design and decision-making process and the three main findings of this research:(1)End-users from different groups were involved in the design and decision-making process and the level of involvement was different in each stage. There is mainly a consultative form of user involvement that evolved into a co-design form in the technical phase of design. User representatives and designers were members of technical design teams: TOTs in this phase looking for design solutions together. (2) Two groups had key roles during the process: User Coordinators and the Building Expertise group. User Coordinators ensure the gathering of user information and engagement of end-users during the design, and they are the information exchange link between the end-users and the design team. The Building Expertise group in this project had an intermediator role acting in different boundaries of the organization. (3) Design decisions are based on continuous consultation with end-user representatives which are linked to the project organization at all levels. There was a transparent and informed decision-making process. Review matrices were decision-making support tools used by different groups including different end- end-user groups and help different groups exchange information in different boundaries. Research findings and the analysis gives a better understanding of information management, end-user, and stakeholder management in healthcare building design and planning and give insights on project management and how to organize the information exchange and the team interactions and use different methods and tools during the briefing and design process in complex building design projects like hospitals.","User involvement; End-user behaviour; Healthcare design; Design process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.911026, 4.467844"

The photovoltaic materials and devices (PVMD) group in TU Delft has developed the c-Si solar cell using poly-SiOx as carrier-selective passivating contacts. The utilization of poly-SiOx as carrier selective passivating contacts is relatively new and very interesting to be analyzed as its bandgap can be varied by changing its oxygen content. This can be used in the solar cell to increase the Jsc. In this work, the 2T perovskite/c-Si tandem solar cells' optimization has been conducted by means of optical and electrical simulations. Optical simulations of the 2T, 3T and 4T perovskite/c-Si tandem solar cells in GenPro4 are presented. The main objective is to show the new type of bottom cell's optical performance in the 2T, 3T, and 4T tandem solar cell. Furthermore, the two-terminal (2T) perovskite/c-Si tandem solar cell's electrical modeling framework with the new type of the bottom cell has been developed. In this model, the optical generation profile from GenPro4 was successfully imported into the semiconductor simulations software called Sentaurus TCAD. The perovskite and c-Si solar cells have been optimized separately. The perovskite solar cell optimization was conducted by changing parameters such as contact resistance, surface recombination velocity and thickness of each layer. This leads to the increase in the perovskite solar cell efficiency from 15.83% to 21.50%. This top cell was combined with a c-Si bottom cell with an efficiency of 25% to form a two-terminal (2T) tandem solar cell. The two-terminal (2T) perovskite/c-Si was further optimized by optimizing the tunnel recombination junction. The optimization of TRJ was done by varying the doping concentration of indium tin oxide (ITO) and spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. As a result, the 33.70% efficiency of the two-terminal (2T) perovskite/c-Si tandem solar cell was obtained.","2T perovskite/c-Si tandem solar cell; carrier-selective passivating contacts; GenPro4; Sentaurus TCAD; opto-electrical modelling framework; contact resistance; surface recombination velocity; thickness optimization; tunnel recombination junction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

These constraints are meant to ensure that the application exhibits predictable behavior by having bounded response times. The worst case execution time (WCET) is an important property of programs, which must be bounded to allow for a response time analysis of tasks. While estimation of the WCET is a difficult problem, modern commercial off-the-shelf processors with multiple processor cores make the WCET estimation problem even harder to solve, because of the existence of shared hardware resource contention among co-running tasks. This work proposes a parametric WCET estimation tool, with which configurable and reproducible experiments can be created to investigate the co-runners’ problem for specific task sets. The created tool runs on two hardware platforms, both featuring ARM Cortex quad core processors. Three different benchmarks suites are implemented in the tool, which can be configured to run in arbitrary combinations on the processor cores. These are a set of synthetic benchmarks meant to stress the memory system, a subset of the Mälardalen WCET benchmark suite and a subset of the San Diego vision benchmark suite. The value of the tool is demonstrated through three sets of experiments. With these experiments, the effects of shared hardware resources are investigated in detail. We show that the experienced slowdown is highly dependent on multiple factors. First, a major factor is the sensitivity to the co-runners’ effects of the task itself. Two extremes are investigated, from a task being insensitive to a task being highly sensitive. Another factor is the size of the input data, which is shown to be a major contributor to the experienced slowdown. Finally, we evaluate the delayed execution of co-running tasks, which in some cases has a significant effect on the experienced slowdown. When we consider a task’s slowdown as a function of the delayed execution of its co-runners, the knowledge on this function’s behavior for specific tasks provides an optimization strategy that could be used to mitigate the problem of shared hardware resource contention.","real-time systems; computer engineering; worst-case execution time","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

To the best of the author’s knowledge, this study is the first to apply an integrated waste management approach to optimize SWM in this context. The approach consists of assessing the integrated environmental and economic burdens of the collection, transportation, sorting and treatment processes of a SWMstrategy. Approximately 10 alternative high potential SWM strategies were composed and selected out of a very large pool of possible SWM strategies. The environmental and economic impact of these high potential SWM strategies for the Efteling case was subsequently assessed using the WARM LCA model and a custom economic assessment model. The results reveal that emission reductions of up to 190 ton CO2 equivalents (TCO2E’s) per year, relative to the current strategy, can already be achieved by separating and recycling more fractions from behind-the-scenes (BTS) waste. This corresponds to an increase in yearly avoided SWM system emissions of about 25% for the Efteling case (from a life-cycle perspective). When public/semi-public (PSP) waste is also included, emission reductions of up to 800 TCO2E’s per year can be achieved for single-fraction separation (e.g. PMD or PET) and up to 960 TCO2E’s per year for two-fraction separation (e.g. PMD + paper or PMD + cups). This corresponds to major increases in avoided SWM system emissions of 110% and 131% respectively. It was also found that small interventions in the transport and/or treatment waste management components can make a big difference in the environmental and/or economic impact of a SWM strategy. A majority of the alternative SWM strategies has an eco-efficiency (emission reduction cost-effectiveness) ranging from €39 to about €140 per TCO2E saving. This eco-efficiency is (much) higher than that of a range of benchmarks such as the eco-efficiency of solar-pv panels at a non-industrial scale, wind turbines at sea and the eco-efficiency of office building insulation. This indicates that optimizing waste management should be given more priority in (scientific) research as well as in practice.","Solid Waste Management; Integrated Waste Management; Life Cycle Assessment; Recyling; Waste Management; Waste Logistics; Eco-Efficiency; Life Cycle Costing; Semi-Public Spaces; Waste Transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","51.6506518, 5.0497462"

This is even more important in structural forms, such as shells and arches that are predominantly designed by their structural requirements. However, the typical design process starts with the design by the architect, and the subsequent analysis and development by the structural engineer, resulting in inefficiencies, not only in the process but also in the sub-optimal result, as the more developed a project, is, the least effective and more costly it is to optimize. Therefore, this report outlines the development of an automated pipeline that integrates the whole lifecycle of a structure, from conception to end-of-life. The focus is on developing an integrated workflow for designing and fabricating a structurally optimized shell using computational methods for form-finding, structural and lifecycle analysis, as well as fabrication, with the end goal of facilitating an automated additive manufacturing production. The structure should be able to withstand applied wind and snow loads using construction materials that are strong in compression, such as earth as a load-bearing material. The design should also be adaptable, within the limits of the material strength or the spatial constraints of the system. In the beginning, the topic is introduced and the research framework is defined. The relevant laboratory and numerical tests are mentioned. Next, literature research is conducted in the relevant fields. More specifically, the research are avenues are divided into form-finding shell structures utilizing computational tools, in earth as a construction material and in additive manufacturing in construction, as well as context. Then, a research by design method is adopted in two directions; a physical set-up and workflow for robotic additive manufacturing with earth is developed, as well as an optimal mixture that makes the most of the capabilities of the developed set-up. Next, a computational form-finding and digital fabrication process that are informed by the developed material and physical setup are defined. The generated form will be evaluated with finite element analysis (FEA) software. The algorithm integrates stress line additive manufacturing principles to direct load paths. The resulting forms are compared with corresponding non form-found and form-found shells in terms of material reduction, as well as with standard construction for environmental impact.

However, there is no mechanism to allow maintaining them updated at the same pace that cities evolve, or when error correction is necessary, eventually diminishing their value. Many cities around the world already possess such models which are mostly used for experimentation and research purposes. Such an example is also the city of Rotterdam, whose 3D city model is not regularly updated and has to be outsourced for that purpose. This thesis investigates into addressing this issue by proposing and implementing an integrative maintenance workflow. The workflow is designed to fulfill what the maintenance needs of a typical municipality are expected to be. Those needs were identified after conducting an analysis of the current situation and collecting information from practitioners within the municipality through interviews. The workflow is a combination of 3D city model versioning and visual editing capabilities with the aim to effectively maintain CityJSON encoded models in an intuitive way. Its implementation includes two prototype software implementations: a versioning component, which is utilized to create a workflow inspired by git flow and allows concurrent maintenance and alternative scenario testing in a non-linear and distributed way, and a visual editing component capable of editing CityJSON encoded 3D city models by extending Blender’s functionality. Following the implementation, the workflow was tested by simulating real world maintenance scenarios. The tests demonstrate the feasibility of maintaining 3D city models with such a workflow and more specifically the suitability of git based workflows. At the same time some key parameters of the versioning mechanism are identified which if tuned properly they can optimize the performance, behavior and robustness of 3D city model versioning.

(mentor); Liu, H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Visualizing the point clouds is an integral part of processing the data, which enables users to explore and interact with the point clouds more intuitively. However, most of the current point cloud renderers are developed in non-immersive environments. In the last few years, some new technologies, such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR), have emerged and introduced new ways of presenting the 3D content. Among them, AR is the most commonly used technology, since AR applications can be used on mobile devices without specific equipment like helmet and handles. There are already plenty of existed applications for mobile AR environment. These mobile AR applications play important roles in fields like architecture, industrial design, navigation, advertisement, medicine and gaming. However, the use of point clouds in mobile AR environment is still waiting to be explored. Like rendering point clouds on other platforms, the biggest issue of showing point clouds in the mobile AR environment is that point cloud datasets usually have a massive amount of data. Moreover, the mobile devices have relatively limited CPU and GPU resources, reaching ideal performance, and the visual quality requirement is quite challenging. Also, the current \ac{clod} methods are developed for desktop, VR, and web-based viewers. The cLoD method has to be improved and revised in order to fit the mobile AR environment. In this paper, an interactive visualization of point clouds using cLoD method in the mobile AR environment will be realized. The main idea of this method is to reduce the number of points to be rendered considerably. A cLoD model that has an ideal distribution over LoDs is used in the method, with which can remove unnecessary points without sudden changes in density as present in the commonly used discrete level-of-detail approaches. Camera position, orientation and distance from the camera to point cloud model are taken into consideration while filtering the points as well. In order to further improve the visual quality, an adaptive point size rendering strategy is applied. What is more, for user's convenience, in the \ac{gui} some setting options are provided to the rendering system to change the value of parameters required in the rendering. The performance of the rendering system is evaluated with multiple quantity indicators and examined by different types of datasets. The result shows that our method can significantly improve rendering performance and meanwhile achieve good visual quality. The finalized rendering system is suitable for most of the indoor applications and some of the outdoor applications. What's more, a comparison between our cLoD method and the traditional mesh-based approaches will be presented to show that our cLoD method has the potential to replace mesh models in some cases.

(mentor); Hamdioui, S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The adoption of Microprocessors is increasingly diversifying to several embedded and mo- bile devices. Growingly they can also be found in Smart Cards, RFID tags, SIM cards, Pay TVs, identity cards and passports. These devices store, processes and transact sensitive information like social security numbers and credit card numbers. Ensuring security of such systems is of paramount importance. Attackers use Fault injection as one of the tech- niques to induce faults into the processor in order to gain access to the sensitive information to abuse it. Vulnerability Analysis of the processors can help chip designers to counteract some of these risks. This analysis can be achieved by investigating the resulting fault space upon exhaustive simulation of fault injection attacks. Therefore, efficient tools and frame- works are needed to provide such security verification, where critical vulnerabilities can be discover and mitigated at design-time. Multiple tools and frameworks for simulation based fault injection of hardware designs are available in literature, each with their own shortcomings. Two main strategies have been proposed in literature, one based on tool manipulation while other based on code modifica- tion. Applying tool manipulation, a designer can automate the process to inject faults in the system and obtain simulation results in a fast manner. However, this approach is limited by the features provided by the tool, which makes difficult to explore many different fault models. Additionally, in most cases, results require manual inspection to be interpreted. The latter approach, which is code modification, can inserts agents to cause the faults (i.e., saboteurs) or vary the existing design (i.e., mutants). It allows designers to achieve a high degree of control in terms of the type of fault and the injection method. However, current so- lutions are limited to a specific language, design or scenario. Hence, the literature presents many different strategies and tools to apply faults to investigate hardware behavior, but still the interpretation of vulnerabilities related to processors are not considered in such tools. Moreover, a complete automated framework capable to get a design and process it to report vulnerabilities and behavior issues related to security is still needed. This thesis proposes a framework that provides a complete toolset able to evaluate vulner- abilities of processors in hardware description language. Its main steps comprises design instrumentation, simulation based fault injection and automatic fault classification. RISC-V is chosen as the target architecture due to its open source nature and its increasing adoption by academia and industry. Code profiling was carried out on the frameworks to identify bot- tlenecks to performance. The results were used to optimise execution time of simulations using the framework. Performing Fault injection campaigns requires running simulations in the order of 100k, which requires systems with high computing power to complete them in reasonable time. Therefore, multiprocessor support was implemented in simulation frame- work, which could be enabled or disabled during the injection campaign. The framework was used to perform fault injection campaigns on PicoRV32 and DarkRISCV processors. A comparison between the processors is made based on their major failure signatures. Anal- ysis of finding design constructs in the processors which cause the major failure signatures was carried out. The results from this vulnerability analysis are used to propose software and hardware countermeasures to make the design more robust against fault injection.","Fault Injection; RISC-V; microprocessor; microcontroller; Fault injection attack; countermeasures; WatchDog","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

Through desk research and interviews with representatives of the case firm this description is developed. The findings show that both a proactive strategy by the company as individual proactive behavior by employees can have a big impact on the performance regarding circular activities. People who are showing proactive circular behavior need to be supported and given recognition by the organization. The other way around, these people can triumph and establish organization-wide implementation of their initiatives through issue selling and perseverance.

Traditionally, corner reflectors have been utilized; whose strong and stable scattering characteristics make them suitable for these purposes. Such reflectors also provide flexibility in exerting control over the network of points to be analyzed. However, the use of these reflectors is beset with the following challenges: settlement under self-weight, inefficient drainage retaining excess rain/snow, one setup per track etc. Based on the experiment carried out with several reflector devices at Wassenaar, The Netherlands, here we show that specific next-generation artificial reflectors can address some of the challenges posed by conventional corner reflectors while allowing the integration of measurements from several deformation monitoring techniques. As part of the experiment, a deliberate 7±0.05 mm vertical movement is imparted to radar transponder MUTE-1 which is estimated from Sentinel-1 radar images within 0.01 to 0.69 mm deviation while the line of sight motion and radar cross section change realized as a result of imparting deliberate tilt to DBFm device is estimated within 0.47 mm and 1.7 dBm<sup>2</sup> respectively. The displacement results from SAR images for MUTE radar transponders are validated using a ground survey campaign. Displacement results in the horizontal direction (East-West projection) suggests that the location WASS01 housing devices MUTE-1 and DBFT tilts in the western directions (estimates of maximum tilt vary from 0.9 to 1.95 mm) while WASS02 location on which MUTE-2 is installed exhibits an eastward tilt (about 2 mm in magnitude). These tilt motions result from the susceptibility of concrete foundation design to swelling and shrinkage of soil. By analyzing meteorological data in conjunction with SAR results from installed devices, we find that the impact of heavy rain remains limited to the conventional reflector type, suggesting that the downward-pointing design of DBF CRs drains the water preventing its accumulation in the apex. Comparative stability analysis demonstrates that next-generation reflector devices (MUTE-2, DBFT and DBFX) can be utilized to determine motions in the vertical and horizontal direction and detect changes in orientation of the device over a vegetation area with low backscattering characteristics with sub-millimeter precision. We anticipate this study to be a small step towards a more sophisticated ground segment for SAR satellites consisting of reflectors that can adequately provide knowledge about deformation characteristics of the area under investigation.","InSAR; IGRS; Radar Transponders; Double backflip corner reflectors; Corner reflectors; geodesy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","","52.121, 4.389"

The site comprises the village of Doel, the natural reserve of Saeftinghe, the nuclear power plant of Doel and the largest dock of the Port of Antwerp in a 2 km long prone-to-flooding area, which is currently facing some anthropic phenomena such as pollution, infrastructural expansion of the harbor and dismantlement of the nuclear power plant. In its process of northbound expansion at the expense of the estuarine territory and the polder-land, the Port of Antwerp has turned Doel into a ghost town by means of expropriation and economic pressure, while the flora and fauna of Saeftinghe are endangered by the alteration of their brackish habitat caused by pollution and water level rise due to both infrastructural growth and climate change. This everlasting dichotomy between natural and anthropized processes poses here the dualistic problem of extinction/preservation and if/how can architecture depict a self-healing survival scenario for this specific site in the Post-Anthropocene, attempting at climate change mitigation and nature metabolism at the same time. The project first addresses the aforementioned issues within a regional strategic and energetic plan which foresees the “de-polderization” of the area, its transformation into a controlled tidal zone for soil and water recovery and the simultaneous expansion of the natural reserve. Moreover, the thesis wants to takes a position regarding the future re-use of (parts of) the nuclear power station starting from 2025 (the date Belgium is supposed to start the phase out of nuclear energy). On the architectural scale, the building here implemented is a “knowledge ark” with laboratories and academic-related spaces, a facility which can exploit not only the world-level Port infrastructure for an optimized logistic (coldchain) but also the proximity of the natural reserve and the former agricultural vocation of the area. This repository building consists of a seed vault and a frozen zoo for the conservation of species through cryopreservation technique, but most importantly is an architectural object designed to resist or accommodate time and territorial transformations, for guaranteeing a possible rebirth of both nature and culture. To do so, the architecture imagined for the Doel site is physically linked to the water-level-rise process. When/if the level of the Scheldt rises above 2 meters (worst case scenario), the whole area will be flooded and any human survival unlikely. In these circumstances, the water will trigger the self-destruction of the facility, spreading the seeds contained in the vault all over the area and thus favouring the rebirth of nature in unpredictable climatic conditions. In the end, the Seed Vault/Frozen Zoo constitutes, like Doel, the nemesis of the Port but, also like Doel, will eventually evolve into a ruin in case of loss in the fight against, pollution and climate change.","Anthropocene; Climate Change; Sea-Level-Rise; De-polderisation; Destruction; Nature Recovery; Port Infrastructure; North Sea; Water-related Territory; Extinction; Preservation; Cryo-conservation; Antwerp; Doel; Natural Reserve; Ghost Town","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Transitional Territories","","51.324620, 4.262284"

From the first astronomers and philosophers of ancient times, who looked at the night sky searching for answers, to the scientists and engineers of modern missions, commanding space probes to the edge of the solar system, space has always been at the epicenter of scientific discovery and human curiosity. From the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, to the robotic rovers exploring Mars, space missions have always relied on the latest technological advancements in order to enable physical or remote exploration of celestial bodies. Traditionally, designing a space computer required significant amount of resources, leading to designs with impressive radiation performance records. However, such designs were lacking computational performance, required years of development and as a result increased the total cost of the mission.<br/><br/>In recent years, the advent of CubeSats meant that access to space became available to a wider community of enthusiasts, researchers and private companies who were developing low-mass spacecraft made out of Commercial Off-The-Shelf components (COTS). These components however, were designed with the goal of maximizing performance and power, with little to no flight heritage. Several novel technologies were proposed in the field of error detection and mitigation, in an effort to bridge the gap between COTS processors and their radiation-hardened counterparts. Even though the commercial semiconductor industry has increased the reliability of its products by continuously improving their designs and processes, CubeSats or other low-mass spacecraft that use these components are still less reliable than their larger counterparts.<br/><br/>Given the aforementioned, this thesis aimed at exploring the latest developments in the field of space embedded systems and error detection techniques, in an effort to produce a software flow able to detect faults with increased compatibility across processor models. In order to accomplish this goal, the thesis was carried out at ARM Limited, as part of the Software Test Libraries (STL) team responsible for developing efficient assembly tests for detecting random faults. The Cortex-M55 CPU was chosen as the test-bed for this work, in order to develop STL routines for a reference module. TheMain Interface Unit (MIU) was chosen to act as the proof-of-concept, since it is an important module in every Cortex-M processor, interfacing the core with the main memory.<br/><br/>More specifically, a series of tests were developed for every major module within the MIU. The design started from the largest module first, which yielded a good trade-off between coverage and time. The tests comprised of efficient assembly routines designed to trigger specific memory access patterns, targeting different portions of logic each time. At the same time, a verification software flow was developed in order to test the newly designed routines against a multitude of possible configurations and initialization parameters. This activity was necessary to ensure that the developed software will be able to operate in a variety of end applications, either in the context of a Real-Time Operating System or baremetal application.<br/><br/>The developed STL tests were subjected to a series of fault simulations using a state-of-the-art hardware simulation tool called ZOIX. Permanent faults caused by accumulated damage were modeled as stuck-at-faults, whereas transient soft-errors were modeled as transient toggle faults. Determining an accurate fault injection interval, required knowledge of the radiation environment that a COTS-based mission would encounter. A state-of-the-art space simulation environment called SPENVIS was used in order to acquire metrics on selected reference missions on Low Earth Orbit and Geosynchronous Equatorial Orbit. This helped setting the upper limits on upset rates, which were in turn used during fault simulation to recreate realistic conditions.<br/><br/>The developed software tests exhibited solid performance in detecting permanent faults, while achieving promising results in transient fault simulations, given certain assumptions. A series of recommendations is given for future research work on the current framework, in an effort to learn from the challenges faced and tackle some of the identified limitations. Given certain assumptions, there is evidence to believe that STLs could be indeed used for random error detection in future CubeSat missions, without increasing the total cost disproportionately.","embedded systems; error detection; radiation effects; Space Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","DoubleMSc.

The fundamental attitude prioritzes interdependence between humans and nature, conviviality and collectivity (locals) whereas superficial cosmopolitanism views transform the village into a commodification. Currently, the village is consumed by tourists in an efficient and functional way, in the sense that tourists buy wine and then leave the village, granting instant gratification, However, this generalizes rural villages, flattening its local specificity and disregards its true spirit.

Researchers have not yet been able to accurately substantiate all of the benefits because their intangible nature makes their quantification challenging. Apart from the lack of exact quantification of the profits, the Threats of BIM cause the need for evaluation. The objective of this research is to evaluate the costs and benefits of BIM implementation. The quantification focuses on the Execution phase of a project when BIM costs are considered to be the highest. What could constitute a standard method of evaluating the costs and benefits of BIM in Construction Projects? The answer to the main question that motivated the research is given through the development of a transparent and evaluative Framework that is based on Cost and Benefit Analysis (CBA) and is potentially applicable in any construction project. This Framework is structured on an Excel Spreadsheet, analyses BIM results and produces numerical data. The purpose of this method is to capture information, quantify costs and benefits and calculate the benefit-to-cost ratio. Consequently, the Framework is applied on 5 construction projects, namely, the Case Studies, and generates the B/C ratio which ranges from 1 to 8. Briefly, the evaluative method considers as inputs the BIM costs and workflows, is applied on the construction site in order to capture information on time and quantify the costs and benefits. The result is the CBA of BIM implementation and particularly the B/C ratio. Once the Framework is implemented, users are able to evaluate BIM costs &amp; benefits, update BIM strategies and thus, raise awareness within academia and industry.","BIM, Building Information Modelling; Costs; Benefits; CBA; Evaluation Framework; Construction Projects; Contractor; Quantification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

This has been accomplished by significant advances in optimisation algorithms, and notably the development of adjoint-based gradient computation, which provides objective sensitivity information at comparatively low computational cost. This enables the use of first-order optimisation methods for more complex design problems. On the other hand, interest in inverse design methods has steadily diminished over time. This is because these methods come with significant disadvantages or weaknesses, such as requiring strong simplification or only being narrowly applicable, e.g. incompressible, potential flow. However, by applying the advances in optimisation techniques to an inverse design strategy, a versatile and effective design tool can be created with functionalities not offered by direct design techniques.<br/><br/>In order to evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of such a method, an adjoint-based inverse design tool for 2D axial compressor blades was developed. The tool requires a baseline geometry and a target pressure or isentropic Mach distribution along the blade wall. It then analyses the flow field around the initial geometry and modifies autonomously the shape to reach closer to the desired target distribution. A discrete adjoint approach is used to compute the gradients of the objective with respect to each of the design variables. The objective and its gradients are used by a the first-order SQP optimisation algorithm to iterate the design until it matches the target distribution as closely as possible.<br/><br/>The newly developed design tool was used in an attempt of improving the performance of the NASA stage 35 stator blade. For comparison, also single- and multi-objective direct design optimisations were performed. It became clear that while significantly cheaper in computational cost and simpler in program complexity, the inverse design method cannot be used to reliably produce improved designs. The value of the resulting design is entirely dependent on the quality of the target distribution. It is up to the designer to create a target which is physically possible and leads to increased performance. <br/><br/>Still, inverse design does provide unique capabilities not offered by direct design. The tool was successfully used to retrieve the blade geometry used in a different work based on published isentropic Mach number distributions. The obtained geometry closely matched the actual geometry used in the source work. This demonstrates the accuracy of the method and the fulfilment of a use case not offered by other design methods.","Adjoint; Inverse; Desgin; Compressor; Airfoil; Blade; CFD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

During breakup season, it is of great importance to be informed about the river ice cover condition in order to mitigate breakup flood risk. The Athabasca River near FortMcMurray, located in Alberta, is particularly prone to ice jam events and subsequent floodings. Satellite remote sensing techniques provide the necessary means to monitor the ice cover. Because of the wide availability most research and operational services for SAR river ice classification are based on single- or dual-polarized images. However, such imagery is limited in its ability to distinguish certain river ice types and open water states. The research presented examines how SAR polarimetry influences the detecting possibilities of specific ice types. Sentinel-1 (dual-polarization), RADARSAT-2 (quad-polarization) and RADARSAT Constellation Mission (compact-polarization) data were used to classify river ice during breakup. This study was about analysing a stretch of the Athabasca River which is prone to ice jam formation. First, SAR images from the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 breakup were studied to find the temporal and spatial patterns of the radar backscatter. Next, sample areas with known ice stage (sheet ice, ice jam or open water) were selected. The sample areas of each ice stage were compared to assess the influence of SAR characteristics, as incidence angle and overpass time. In the last part of this study, a Random Forest classification was implemented in which intensity, texture and polarimetric features were used. Results show that classification accuracies increase with the inclusion of polarimetric decomposition features and GLCM mean texture features by enhancing between class separability and reducing the misclassification. Accuracies of 85.6% (Kappa = 0.78), 91.2% (Kappa = 0.87) and 91.0% (Kappa = 0.87) were obtained for Sentinel-1, RADARSAT-2 and RCM, respectively. The majority of the confusion between classes was due to similarities at backscatter signatures in very small incidence angles, mainly between open water and sheet ice under melting conditions. Also sheet ice early in the breakup season was confused with ice jams. To reduce the likelihood of misclassification, it is recommended to only use images with incidence angles higher than 30º and to include polarimetric and texture features in a classifier. Additional improvements can be achieved when using expert knowledge for tracking, since previous SAR images can provide added information when one understands the temporal patterns of river ice breakup. Further research should be directed at the development of an automatic classification approach that should be able to detect ice jams during the entire ice covered season. Having more knowledge about river ice breakup may help to eventually develop a river ice forecasting system, which may significantly reduce flood risk.","River ice; Breakup; Classification; Random Forest; SAR; Remote sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","56.732014, -111.375961"

Increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in the energy system brings about novel implications and challenges in the field of energy security.

The Netherlands has a favourable position and infrastructure for large scale hydrogen roll-out. The objective of this research is to explore how hydrogen utilized in the Dutch built environment affects energy security performance. Moreover, what geotechnical characteristics of hydrogen are responsible for a change in energy security performance. A framework for analysis is constructed and applied to the current Dutch energy system as a reference case and two future energy scenarios. The data requirements are retrieved through desk research and interviews with stakeholders and experts in the field. The research concludes that hydrogen positively affects future energy security performance. The geotechnical characteristics of hydrogen can explain the differences between the results of the scenario. These emphasize a shift in energy dependencies, global hydrogen markets, increased diversity due to the broader system role of hydrogen and efficiency reductions.

Partly due to this economic growth, the urban population is expected to increase significantly in the coming decades. In the group of urban migrants, more than half comes from rural areas, indicating a large sum of poorly educated, low skilled workers as major part of the migrant group. The main reasons to migrate to urban areas is the increased job opportunities and education. These influxes of low skilled workers to the urban areas intensify the informal sector in cities like the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. This informal sector comprises those working in informal business, as well as a huge group of domestic workers, apprentices and unpaid family workers. Being able to participate in productive commercial activity is the first step to alleviate oneself from poverty. The problem is that the formal, governmental institutions reject the idea of informality in areas where government is in managerial position. Informal economies are banished from government-controlled housing areas. This is out of fear for the unbound nature of informality, while the formal intuitions main drive is to control everything. The lack of informality, be it informal housing or informal economy, creates order, stability and the ease for the government to exert oversight. However, this lack of informality would also create a vacuum of opportunities to make a living for people, as the informal ways of generating income would also be the only way of generating income for people lacking education and skills. The goal should therefore be to incorporate the informal lifestyle and usage of the low-income households into the formal planning so the informal is not only seen as a problem anymore but as a part of the solution. Through this project I hope to show the possibility that formal and informal is not just two ways of life that stand in contrast with each other, but that it can coexist and, in which low income people can make a better living for themselves.","Dwelling; Informal; Formal; Public Housing; Affordable Housing; Addis Ababa; Ethiopia; Architectural Ethnography; Praxeology; Typology; Architectcture; Courtyard housing; Income Generation; Mixed Income Housing; Global Urban South; Urban Densification; Urban Migration; Informal Economy; Global Housing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Global Housing","Addis Ababa Living Lab: Creating Resilient Dwelling Clusters for Urban Resettlement","9.030001, 38.708055"

A novel approach, typically used in magnetic resonance spectroscopy, was employed to pre-process the baseline-corrected spectra and remove features for which it was unlikely to originate from the ferritin core. This allowed for the isolation and preservation of the general lineshape of the signal belonging to the ferritin core. <br/>The spectra were further analysed using both a phenomenological approach and by employing the Spin Hamiltonian.<br/>The phenomenological analysis showed that in the 20-70 K temperature range, the amplitude peak-to-peak of the ferritin-core signal decreases linearly with decreasing temperature, while its lineshape changes from Lorentzian to Gaussian between 150 and 70 K. The blocking temperature was suggested to occur between 10 and 20 K, where the signal amplitude was lost.<br/>Whether and how the lineshape of the ferritin core signal shifts or broadens below 70 K could not be determined due to a six-line signal contamination, most likely caused by manganese impurities, obscuring the ferritin-core signal in the field range where its resonance field is positioned.<br/>In order to study the magnetic properties of the ferritin core, and therefore gain insight on the magnetic and electronic structure of the ferritin core, a Spin Hamiltonian approach was employed.

Modifications of the atmosphere associated with anthropogenic climate change are projected to increase the frequency of favorable conditions for convective storms, and it is absolutely critical to understand the implications of these changes to prepare for a resilient future. To this end, the fate of convective gusts in Europe in a future warmer climate is addressed through the output of two high resolution regional climate models (RCMs). One RCM includes convection permitting (CP) physics, and the other assumes hydrostatic conditions in which deep convection is parameterized. It is found that the magnitude and characteristics of extreme straight line gusts from mesoscale convective systems are well resolved in the CP-RCM but not in the hydrostatic RCM. <br/>The RCMs are forced with a high carbon emission scenario for the end of the 21st century, and the CP-RCM shows an increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme convective gusts over mainland Europe. These changes are likely related to an increase in conditions where strong wind shear (≥15 m/s) simultaneously occurs with unstable environments (lifted index ≤-2). However, the inherent low frequency of extreme convective storms requires continued investigation to draw more robust conclusions. In addition, the environmental conditions in which the severe gusts take place indicate the importance of addressing gusts separately from the more commonly studied effects of climate change on extreme convective precipitation. This thesis provides an important bridge to understand the fate of extreme gusts from convective storms in a future warmer climate and the high potential of CP-RCMs in such studies.","Gust; Climate Change; Weather Modelling; Convection; RCM; HARMONIE-AROME; KNMI; Extreme Weather; Extreme Gusts; Convective Storms","en","master thesis","","","","","","Website with a summary of my master thesis: http://www.camillacecilia.com/thesis","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

The weirs are being scheduled for replacement, where weir Grave is the first one in 2028. They are reaching their end-of-life time. One of the main issues that became of more importance in the recent years is ship collision. In the past 20 years two major ship collisions happened on two different existing weirs in the Meuse, one at Grave and one at Linne. The place of impact at the weirs was significantly damaged after those collisions. As a consequence, the water level dropped and inland navigation was not possible for one month. In this study an inflatable weir is proposed as replacement of the existing steel weirs in the Meuse. A conceptual inflatable weir design is made for location Grave, for replacement of the existing weir. The design is based on existing literature, such as the inflatable storm surge barrier Ramspol. The design for Grave is considered to be scalable to the overflow (Poirée) parts of the Meuse weirs. One of the aspects that has not yet been considered for those inflatable weirs is ship collision. The theory and formulas found for the existing collision analysis are not fully applicable to the inflatable weir, mainly due to large elastic deformation of the inflatable weir. In literature a standard expression has been found to quantify the ship force on the colliding structure. This expression forms the basis of the analytical model. The inflatable weir in the analytical model is schematized by a two-dimensional plate sheet. An effort was made to validate the strain found in the analytical model by a numerical model in Ansys. However numerical instabilities were found that lead in considerable modification of the desired model and so the results indicated no representative outcomes.<br/>To see what happens during the ship collision a physical scale model was made, with scale 1:25 for accurate representation of the physical phenomena. <br/>Sixteen experiments were done with four different draughts and four different velocities of the ship. For the experiment with the scaled maximum draught (0.14m) and velocity (1.1m/s). The full video experiments are uploaded to the 4TU-datacentrum (https://data.4tu.nl/portal). The two aspects uplift of the ship and gliding over the weir observed in the experiments are not yet included in the analytical model, therefore the analytical model is extended. The extended analytical model showed a 25% deviation with the uplift of the ship and a 15% deviation with the displacement of the weir from the experiments. With the extended model it was calculated that the limit strain is not exceeded and that the strain is maximum 5% on top of the static strain of 1.9%. Concluding, the first steps have been taken into research of ship collision on inflatable weirs. Further investigation on the ship with V-bow, the propeller of the ship and a more extensive numerical model is recommended for ship collision on inflatable weirs.","Ship collision; inflatable structure; inflatable weir; inflatable dam; Meuse","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","51.76886,5.73573"

As vehicles are getting increasingly automated, the human factor is diminished or eventually removed from automated driving. Until then, a combination of human input and automation is necessary during automated driving. This research focuses on the interaction between humans and machine and how a safe interaction can be designed by incorporating meaningful human control. Initially, the aim was to study how different personalities are reflected in driver workload induced by take-over requests (TORs). However, the COVID-19 circumstances changed the aim to validate the design of the driving simulation experiment by means of an N = 1 experiment. Design variables that have been found to play a role in driver workload are varied in the validation experiment. These variables are the duration of the time budget, traffic density, location of the TOR and task involvement during automated driving. Subsequently, workload was measured by a combination of subjective and physiological indicators and driving performance. Notably, this study includes the Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD) and Standard Deviation of Normal to Normal peak intervals (SDNN) as heart rate variability (HRV) measures, which is a novel approach in studies measuring TOR-induced workload. Despite the study design that involved performing an N = 1 driving simulation experiment, significant differences between attribute levels have been found. This study provides recommendations on an empirically-validated set of design variables for future studies involving TORs and driver workload, specifically for the future study on personality and automated driving.","Automated driving; Driving performance; Driving simulation; Raw Task Load Index; Heart rate; Heart rate variability; Validation; Workload","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","Meaningful Human Control over Automated Driving Systems",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Transportation of slurries over a distance has always been one of the main objectives for the dredging industry. To accomplish a transport, centrifugal dredge pumps and mixture pipelines need to be perfectly intertwined. For the centrifugal dredge pump, available information is relatively scattered or confidential. The performance of a centrifugal pump is mainly determined by conducting experiments with actual slurries or estimated on the performance characteristics obtained from water. Besides empirical research in laboratories and field studies, numerical Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations have become an interesting asset in creating models for multiphase situations. This mainly due to increasing computational power that is currently available. The goal of this research is to gather and analyse information on particle trajectories near impeller blades and its unsteady head characteristics in a centrifugal dredge pump for visual validation of Cao et al. (2019) CFD model outcomes. In the literature research, information was gathered on empirical models, CFD simulations, an analytical description of particle behaviours along impeller blades, (dimensionless) pump characteristics and impeller/shell designs. On the experimental side, the executed experiments consist out of head and discharge recording by throttling the exit valve for pump characteristics in single phase water conditions and mixture conditions at 564, 846, 1128 and 1410 RPM. The used impeller has a diameter of 155 mm and is a so called ""open impeller"". At mixture conditions, delivered volumetric concentration (Cvd ) of 5%, 8%, 12%, 15% and 20% are reached with glass bead particles of 1.5mm and 3.0mm with a density of 2500 kg /m3 . High speed image recording are made of the impeller blades at above mentioned situations but with a steady exit valve set to 50% open. The experimental study gives an interesting inside on the behaviour of particles internally. On the particle trajectory side, where PIVlab image analysis are conducted, the result can be used partially on the streamline verification from the CFD model of Cao et al. (2019). This especially applies for the single phase situations and partially less for the mixture situation due to problems with particle distinguishing. Summarised, this means that the conducted experimental study is not able to fully verify the CFD model outcomes of Cao et al. (2019) for the instantaneous streamlines and concentration distribution between the impeller blades. Though, it supplies a steady base for further research. For the unsteady head characteristics that are enhanced during mixture loading at high-concentrations on the other hand, interesting data is collected. The unsteady head characteristics shows an enhancement in noise at the lower side of the spectra with an increase of concentration and engine speed. At low engine speed, the unsteady head amplitude has a wider spread that results in a lot of short quick amplitude changes. For an increase in speed, these quick amplitude changes are reduced and become more stable. The conditions are similar as in single phase water conditions due to a shift towards the lower side of the spectra. This same behaviour is visible in Cao et al. (2019) CFD model outcome. <br","Dredging; Impeller blades; Centrifugal dredge pump; PIVlab; Slurrypump; Mixture pump; Particle trajectories; Unsteady head; Slurry transport; open impeller; Dredge pump","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-01","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

This limitation typically leads to applyingsimpler execution models such as non-preemptive scheduling. A problem with anon-preemptive real-time system is that finding a schedule without causingdeadline misses is NP-hard. Finding a schedule is therefore done with online schedulingpolicies, i.e. policies that make decisions upon arrival or after execution ofa task to schedule the next one. Onlinenon-preemptive scheduling policies are typically priority based, namely, theypick the highest priority job to schedule based on criteria as period or absolutedeadline. These are work-conserving policies which cannot keep the processoridle while there are still pending jobs in the ready queue. Non-work-conservingpolicies allow an idle cpu while there are still jobs in the ready queue. Whilethis increases schedulability, it also has an increased overhead. Current stateof the art policies like Precautious Rate Monotonic (PRM) and Critical WindowsEarliest Deadline First (CW-EDF) have an idle-time insertion policy which caninsert an idle time in the schedule (between the execution of the jobs) whilestill having pending jobs. PRM verifies whether the highest priority job in theready queue is able to finish without causing a deadline miss for the highestpriority task in the system, which is the task with the lowest period. PRMimproves schedulability with increased overhead of <i>O(1)</i>.CW-EDF comes with additional overhead <i>O(n log n)</i> in which it verifies ifscheduling the highest priority pending job will result in a deadline miss for thenext job of all other tasks in the system. PRM has low overhead, while CW-EDFhas better schedulability despite having higher overhead. Alimitation of these non-work-conserving policies is the missing support for event-triggeredtask, where jobs are released at unknown time instants. Namely, the existingnon-work-conserving policies are designed for strict periodic tasks. In thisthesis we will introduce a policy which has schedulability as high as CW-EDF,but prior to running the system it detects the critical tasks which have aninfluence on the idle-time insertion policy. We ignore the non-critical tasks duringthe idle-time insertion policy, reducing the runtime overhead. We also introducea policy which will support time-triggered tasks, by using an arrival curvewhich stores the possible behavior of the event-triggered task. With this arrivalcurve we will reduce the number of deadline misses compared to the existingnon-work-conserving policies.  ","real-time systems; non-work-conserving; event-triggered; arrival curve","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

(graduation committee); van Wesenbeeck, B (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Conventional dike reinforcement measures do not take vegetation into account, while vegetation contains wave damping properties. Reasoning for this is that vegetation in general is seen as temporary and hence may be removed in the future. In this case study for the Dutch waterboard WDOD, the wave damping properties of vegetation in a floodplain along the river IJssel (Duursche Waarden) are studied. Duursche Waarden consists of mostly willow species and is adjacent to a dike. It is part of Natura2000 and hence it is a protected vegetation area and not considered to be temporal. A general approach is developed for similar sized (riparian) forests as Duursche Waarden (1.1 km2) to map the vegetation and obtain the vegetation parameters. This approach is also applied to Duursche Waarden. First of all the different vegetation areas within the riparian forest are identified with the help of aerial photos and field observations after which they are prioritised with the help of a Multi Criteria Analysis. The prioritised vegetation areas are divided into uniform and non-uniform areas and studied in detail. Uniform and non-uniform areas are distinguished based on tree species, structure, height and density with the help of field observations, aerial photos and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. A representative distribution of the vegetation parameters over the different vegetation areas is obtained with the help of one method. The vegetation parameters interesting for wave damping are the frontal area per volume and the bulk drag coefficient of leafless vegetation. Leafless vegetation is of interest since most extreme storms occur in winter. On top of that leaves seem to have insignificant contribution to wave damping in the full scale physical experiments of white willow trees conducted in the Delta Flume at Deltares. These experiments were performed in 2018. A new definition is introduced for the frontal area per volume. The frontal area density distribution over the height is estimated with the help of point clouds retrieved from TLS measurements and validated with hand measurements and studies of similar vegetation. Two methods are used in estimating the frontal area with the help of literature: the alpha shape and grid method. These methods are used for merged point clouds from Multiple Scanning Stations (MSS) and a point cloud from a Single Scanning Station (SSS). The SSS method includes a shadowing correction factor. Finally, the values of the frontal area per volume are chosen based on assessing the outcomes of the MSS method, SSS method and hand measurements. The bulk drag coefficient is estimated using selected values from literature. Dense vegetation contains relatively higher values for the vegetation parameters than sparse vegetation. This will result in more wave energy dissipation and hence more wave damping for dense vegetation. The frontal area per volume of sparse to moderate dense woody vegetation (values on average of about 0.01-0.20 m-1) in uniform areas is believed to estimated best and most efficiently with the MSS method. In non-uniform areas hand measurements are believed to be estimated best and most efficiently by hand measurements. The frontal area per volume of dense woody vegetation (values on average greater than 0.20 m-1) is most uncertain. Therefore, both hand and TLS measurements (with the SSS method) should be used to estimate the frontal area per volume. The wave attenuation by vegetation is estimated using the numerical wave model SWAN 1D and 2D computations including and excluding vegetation using the obtained vegetation parameters. No currents are included. Hydraulic conditions of Hydra-NL calculations using Bretschneider are used for both SWAN 1D and 2D computations. A comparison between Hydra-NL and SWAN 1D computations including model uncertainty for exactly the same conditions show similar outcomes for SWAN. SWAN 1D computations showed wave attenuation due to vegetation with a magnitude of 0 to about 44 cm for all dike locations adjacent to Duursche Waarden. SWAN 2D computations without vegetation show significantly lower outcomes than 1D computations without vegetation: on average about 12 cm. This difference is explained by refraction and directional spreading resulting from the spatial variability in water depth and fetch of the studied area. Therefore the studied area is believed to be better described by 2D computations. One combination of the wind direction and water level is proven to be governing for all dike locations. Following 2D computations, the failure mechanism ‘erosion of the outer slope’ with a return period of 66666 year results in an estimated maximum wave height of 77 cm for dike locations adjacent to Duursche Waarden. This is a reduction of about 23 cm compared to the results of Hydra-NL. Indicative calculations suggest that dike reinforcements are still needed at Duursche Waarden. The wave damping is estimated to be 16 to 24 cm at dike locations adjacent to relatively large vegetation areas of sparse to dense vegetation. Dike locations at which the significant wave height is the greatest are called critical dike locations. The wave damping for these critical dike points is estimated to vary between 4 to 7 cm. In a report by Deltares an overview is made of promising wave damping foreshores in the Netherlands. Rough estimations show possible wave damping at Duursche Waarden of about the same order of magnitude as found in this study. Also studies on similar vegetation show significant greater values for the wave damping, suggesting rather conservative than optimistic outcomes in this study.","wave damping; vegetation; terrestrial laser scanning; floodplains; river","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Aside from this state-driven initiative in line with the Paris agreement, several Dutch cities have presented their own climate initiatives. The city of Amsterdam has pledged to reduce its CO2 emissions by 55% in 2030 compared to 1990 levels which surpasses the national goal by 5% [2]. The capital has laid out a detailed plan to achieve these goals and it is clear that the electrification of mobility and heating, along with the roll-out of solar energy across the city, will play an important role in the future. Amsterdam is planning to install 1 million solar panels by 2022, aims to ban non-electric cars from the city by 2030 [3] and wants all buildings to be heated gas-free by 2040. While all of these steps are very helpful regarding the reduction of greenhouse gasses, they pose a big challenge to local grid operator Liander to ensure sufficient grid capacity [4]. The spokesperson of Alliander (parent of Liander) estimates that in 2050, peak power demand in Amsterdam could be 2.5 to 6 times higher than now. From the 25 substations in the city, which transform high-voltage electricity to middle-voltage, a minimum of 11 will not have sufficient capacity by 2030. The problem lies with an increase in both electricity supply and demand. On the supply side, as more and more Renewable Energy Sources (RES) have entered the Dutch energy mix in the past decade the strain on the electricity grid has increased. While wind turbines have largely been built offshore and feed into the high voltage grid, on-land turbines and especially large scale solar generation are mainly connected to the middle-voltage (MV) grid which is primarily designed to distribute electricity, not to accept it. On a sub-level, solar panels installed on private roofs deliver their electricity to the low-voltage (LV) grid. The capacities of cables and transformers in residential areas are sized to deliver electricity from generator to consumer, and not the other way around. Liander has indicated that capacity is sufficient to deal with privately owned solar for now, but that the significant increase envisioned by the city of Amsterdam will pose a problem in the future.","electrification; solar; storage; battery; smart grid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
