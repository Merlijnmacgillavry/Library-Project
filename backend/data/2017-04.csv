(mentor); Winterwerp, J.C. (mentor)","2017","Additional thesis - Historical engineering works such as weirs, land reclamation and large scale deepening modified not only the local morphology and hydrodynamics but also tidal characteristics and sediment transport patterns in the tidal river Ems. The loss of intertidal area and ongoing deepening contribute to the flood dominance while decreasing the river’s flushing capacity and enhance tidal amplification. The increased tidal asymmetry continuously pumping and accumulating fine sediment upstream into the Ems River system. This river is renowned for its high suspended fine sediment concentration and such high concentration work together with an increasing water depth for a reduction of the river hydraulic roughness. In order to investigate the key factor that contributes to the time lag of high water occurrence along the river, a depth-averaged 2DH hydrodynamic Delft3D model is applied. The results of the numerical studies indicate both the increasing of upstream discharge and the reduction of hydraulic roughness contribute to a smaller time lag of high water between Papenburg and Emden. However, if the tidal weir at Herbrum is removed or the Manning coefficient for the bottom roughness is increased, the discharge almost has no impact on the time lag of high water occurrence at Emden and Papenburg.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Beekman, A.Q. (mentor)","2017","This project is about developing a solution for cath lab physicians. A cath lab physician is a medical doctor, with a background in cardiology, neurology, electro physiology or radiology, who performs cath lab procedures. A cath lab procedure is a minimal invasive procedure in which a catheter is brought into the body of a patient via a small incision. Cath lab physicians suffer from injuries due to the heavy physical workload of their job. The lead apron they wear to protect themselves against the radiation used during the procedures, in combination with long periods of standing, are the main cause of these injuries. An analysis is performed to get more insight in the nature of the injuries and of the environment of the physicians. To start prototyping in an early stage, a short ideation phase took place directly after the analysis. As a result, this phase brought requirements, wishes and concluded with two design directions. A stool with some new features was the best solution. This stool was designed to support the user. The seat will prevent the injuries on the legs while the integrated sternum support reduces the forces in the back muscle. A test was performed to validate the effect of the sternum support. The test shows a reduction between 10% and 15% of the tension in the back muscle. Further research will have to show if the use of the designed solution will actually prevent hernias in the future.","Cath lab; Physicians; Healthcare; Medical; Support; Body support; Protection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2018-04-28","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","This graduation project focuses on the stressful moments of elderly people with dementia, caused by changes in their environment. A research through design approach was followed with the aim to design a product that reduces the amount of stress experienced by the elderly. During the analysis phase, five different studies have been performed to identify the behaviour of the elderly in stressful situations, getting an understanding of how dementia influences the daily changes and how stress can be treated in a personal way. The main objective of those different studies was to point out which stress moments could be influenced by changing the interaction within. Furthermore, a deeper look into the influences of dementia as an illness on the experienced stress was conducted. The context of stress before dinner time is found as most valuable to change the interaction. This context is described by the caregiver and observed by the designer as recurring each day, multiple times a day. The elderly struggle to cope with the fact that they might not be able to sit at their usual spot at the dining table. From these insights, there was chosen to develop an interaction that reduces (the) stress from the moment the table is set till they have to go to the table for lunch or dinner. ‘Puzzled’ supports the cognitive abilities of the elderly and uses distraction as a main tool to lower the amount of stress experienced before dinner time. The concept is introduced by the caregiver right after the table has been set. Six design iterations were done and tested in context of elderly home de Herbergier in Delft, The Netherlands. During the test the elderly responded positively to the puzzle game and had fun playing it at each stage of the iterations. Finally, the observations of the iterative test sessions and the feedback from the elderly and the caregivers were used to evaluate and reflect on the introduced puzzle concept. Considering the feedback, recommendations were made to optimize the interaction, user experience and influence on the stress level of Puzzled.","dementia; well-being; mood regulation; stress; design for dementia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2017","This thesis puts forward a design for an affordable 3D scanner that can easily capture accurate 3D models of the human hand. Such 3D scans are a requirement for designing and manufacturing personalised products, which open up a new world of design possibilities by tailoring products specifically to a single person. An example of such a product is Carpifix, a personalised wrist orthosis that takes away key usage problems present in current orthoses. In addition 3D scanning can be used to objectively track progress of hand therapy or to gather detailed anthropometric data, including multidimensional shape information, for product design or other medical purposes. A highly iterative approach is used to further develop the photogrammetry-based scanning technology and integrate it into a comfortable and easy to use to product. Key aspects of the scanner are a practical, secure and reliable system architecture, and low-cost components. In addition, it includes an interface both on the scanner and a separate application to facilitate an effortless and structured process of scanning, processing, utilising and archiving 3D models in the various relevant contexts. Thereby allowing anyone, including people who are not skilled anthropometrists, to obtain accurate measurements. Evaluation using a prototype shows the design is capable of producing accurate and complete reconstructions of the hand and ±15 cm of the arm with a 90% success rate. Defects in the remaining 10% of scans are generally limited to a section of the arm, with the hand reconstructed properly. The integrated design developed as part of this project is sufficiently robust to be evaluated in a real-world pilot application. From this the product’s embodiment design should to be further optimised for manufacturing and the interaction concept further evaluated and implemented. In addition, development of further software features such as automatic measurement and treatment progress tracking that unlock the potential of 3D scanning as well as cloud processing should be considered. Finally, additional improvements to the scanning system may be evaluated if it is determined that the current reconstruction quality is not sufficient or its limitations are problematic.","3D scanning; photogrammetry; anthropometry; hand; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2018-04-28","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

Applications of SPM's include intra-operative end-time predictions, improved surgical training and assessment, computer-aided surgery and increased autonomy in robotic surgery. This thesis evaluates the use of an SPM for intra-operative recognition of surgical phases in laparoscopic hysterectomy cases (n=40), based on manually annotated instrument usage data. Using a Random Forest model, an out-of-sample accuracy of 77% is achieved. The phase-recognition model is shown to predict surgical end-times with a mean absolute error of 16 minutes and is additionally found useful in the task of surgical phase extraction.

(mentor); Janbaz, S. (mentor)","2017","Materials and devices with advanced functionalities often need to include functionalities such as surface features into complex 3D geometries. Precisely controlled bio-nanopatterns, printed electric components and sensors/actuators are all examples of such surface features. However, the vast majority of the refined technologies that are currently available for creating functional surface features only work on flat surfaces. Shape-shifting of an initially flat structure into a desired 3D shape offers a powerful solution for creation of such advanced materials. This thesis presents initially flat constructs that upon activation change their shape to a pre-programmed 3D shape, thereby enabling the combination of surface-related functionalities with complex 3D shapes. The new technique is based on 3D printing of shape memory polymers which can be programmed to exhibit large anisotropic deformation upon triggering by high temperature. The programming is based on different patterns of printing with which anisotropic contracting elements and passive panels can be planned by rational combination of multiple 3D printed plies. Using proposed programming strategies a large variety of 3D shapes could be achieved including double curved constructs. In addition to 3D target shapes, in order to increase the accuracy of assembly sequence controlled activation can be planned by heat transfer control. This novel printing strategy can serve as a general platform for programming the shape-shifting of flat material.","3D printing; shape memory polymer; shape-shifting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); García Almudever, C. (mentor)","2017","Running quantum algorithms in a quantum machine may solve some complex problems that are intractable for even the most powerful classical computers. Quantum algorithms can be described by quantum circuits consisting of a set of qubits and a sequence of gates operating on those qubits when the quantum circuit model of computation is adopted. This circuit description on an algorithm usually assumes that any kind of interaction between qubits is possible. However, in real experiments, qubits are placed on a specific physical qubit layout, which constraints the possible interactions between qubits due to its limited connectivity. One possible layout for arranging qubits is a 2D array with 4 neighbours per qubit, which corresponds with the topology of surface code, one of the most promising quantum correction codes. In such 2D nearest-neighbour (NN) arrangement of qubits not all pairs of qubits that have to interact during computation can be directly connected (be neighbours). This means that non-adjacent qubits or qubit states need to be moved or routed (by e.g. SWAP operations) and be placed close to each other when required. In this thesis, we applied different routing algorithms used in Network on Chip (NoC) for defining the routing paths when quantum states are moved. After investigating 7 different NoC routing algorithms, we redesign and adapt them to the quantum scenario. We use the quantum plane simulation platform for comparing the routing overhead and the success rate of such routing algorithms when running 4 different quantum algorithms. We conclude that the routing algorithm which has the best overall routing performance is the one called Hot Potato. It is deadlock and livelock free in perfect qubit lattices, and shows the best fault-tolerance when faulty qubits are considered.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-04-26","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Quantum Engineering / CE Lab","","Computer Engineering","",""

This decreases the risk of complica ons due to hypoxia of the brain, but the surgery is long and requires a highly skilled vascular neurosurgeon. A er over 500 ELANA surgeries at University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU) the current clinical success rate is approximately 80%. Non-successful surgery can lead to severe complica ons or even death. Therefore, it is crucial to op mize the technique. In our research we aimed to improve the design of the ELANA toolkit in order to increase the laboratory success percentage, which was 88% in previous studies.

In this study, the kinetics of austenite to bainitic ferrite is studied through in-situ high temperature laser scanning confocal microscopy (HT-LSCM). Quantitative measurements of the evolution of microstructure is performed by digital image processing techniques. These quantitative results have been compared with predictions of existing phenomenological models developed for bainite to study the temperature and composition dependence. In the temporal evolution of microstructure, nucleation and growth phenomenon have been investigated separately. Due to the complex characteristics of bainite transformation, two approaches exist for modelling the transformation kinetics based on different assumptions of the underlying mechanisms at play. Two classical nucleation theory based models are studied- Offerman et al model for austenite to ferrite transformation and Quidort and Bréchet model for bainite. In the framework of the displacive theory of bainite transformation, Ravi et al model is investigated. Growth of individual bainitic ferrite plates and overall austenite to ferrite growth is investigated through the study of plate growth rates and temporal evolution of bainitic ferrite fraction respectively. Quantitative predictions of three growth models: local equilibrium, paraequilibrium and Gibbs Energy Balance model have been compared with experimental observations. Additionally, global kinetics of bainitic ferrite fraction is measured experimentally using dilatometry.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Novel Aerospace Materials","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The ever growing use of renewable sources of energy led to a need for energy storage. Mainly due to the intermittency nature of applications like solar and wind. In addition, the need for regulation of the greenhouse gases led to the development of carbon capture and storage applications. Thus, the combination of those two factors accelerated the production of renewable fuels (called also solar fuels). Renewable fuels is a power-to-x solution of storing the surplus electric energy produced from renewable sources, via multiple steps processes. Hence, solar fuels can contribute immensely in a lorg-term, large-scale energy storage solution. Those fuels are synthetic hydrocarbon that derive from hydrogen (produced from renewables) and the CO2 captured. Some possible fuels are methanol, methane and liquid hydrocarbons. Amongst, those, methane is the most promising solution. It can be synthesized with a single reaction, it has high energy density and can be easily distributed. The methanation of CO2 is an exothermic catalytic reaction and takes place in multiple fixed bed reactors in row. In order for this renewable methane to be used as SNG, high purity levels are required. Hence, novel techniques are researched to achieve the necessary purity of methane in fewer process steps. The present study focuses on one of those techniques called separation enhanced methanation of CO2. The principle behind this technique is the removal, in situ, of the vapor produced by the reaction, to increase the conversion of reactants. This topic is approached experimentally. A fixed bed reactor built in house is used for the experiments. For the hydrogenation ofCO2 a nickel catalyst is used, coupled with two different zeolites (3A and 4A) for the adsorption ofwater vapor. Initially, the pure catalyst’s performance was tested. Subsequently, the combinations of catalyst-zeolites (physical mixture) followed to determine the enhancement of the process. Two GHSV were applied in the experiments, for different temperatures in the range of 200±C-360±C. Also, different combinations of catalyst-zeolite 4A were deployed, regarding the size of the catalyst particles. Fromthe results, it was concluded that the proximity of the catalytic sites to the zeolites surface plays the most dominant role in the performance of the process. This proximity is linked to the average particle size and the uniformity of the bed. The highest conversion rates were achieved in the range of 260±C to 280±C, with values of up to 98,5% of conversion.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Sustainable Process and Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Griffioen, M. (mentor)","2017","Due to the increase of elderly people, the number of hip fractures rises as well. The most common hip fracture is an intertrochanteric fracture. This fracture is treated by inserting an intramedullary nail to support the fractured femur fragments. Before the intramedullary nail can be inserted, the bone fragments need to be realigned by translating and rotating the foot, a procedure called fracture reduction. The misalignment is caused by the contracting muscles around the hip joint. Automating the fracture reduction could reduce the fatigue of the surgeon and could increase the accuracy of the fracture reduction, which results in faster and better recovery of the patient. Additionally, the exposure to radiation for the operating room (OR) personnel could also be reduced. This creates a healthier working environment. Gupta [1] already developed a two degrees of freedom (DOF) prototype robot for automated fracture reduction. The robot applies rotations and translations via a shoe strapped to the foot of the patient. Due to the lack of stiffness between the foot and the femur, a lower limb model is needed to control the fracture reduction robot to get a femur alignment accuracy of 2 mm and 2⁰. The derived dynamical model of the lower limb consists of multiple masses, springs, and dampers, in which a spring represents the lumbed muscle forces of a group of muscles. The individual muscle forces were derived using the Hill muscle model. The model was validated using measurement data and fluoroscopic images obtained during hip surgeries by Ravishankar [2]. The steady state translations of the model were fitted on the data and the results were used to develop a full scale physical lower limb model. Due to model inaccuracies and a lack of required measurements, fracture reduction rotations were not taken further into consideration. The physical model was used as a test object for the fracture reduction robot. Different control schemes were tested on the robot connected to the physical lower limb model. The controllers used the obtained model of the lower limb to find the desired translation of the robot. The internal model control (IMC) scheme was able to translate the femur distal part without a steady state error or overshoot. In the performed tests, the admittance controller also did not have any overshoot and was able to achieve an accuracy of less than 2 mm. Besides this, the admittance controller ensures the safety of the patient by taking the reaction force of the lower limb into account. In future work, more hip surgery measurement data should be gathered, research should be performed on fluoroscopic image detection of the femur, and automating the rotational part of the fracture reduction should be further examined. Overall, the performed research indicates that the model shows great potential for safe and accurate control of autonomous fracture reduction by a robot. [1] S.

(mentor)","2017","A method has been developed for designing composite 3D skeletal structures. This method can be used to design weight optimized fiber reinforced structures that can carry complex loads in high performance applications such as satellites. These designs are realized through Size, Shape and Topology Optimization, using a ground structure approach as a starting point. This enables modeling of both the highly anisotropic properties of fiber reinforced materials, as well as arrangements in various stages of development that exploit those properties. Rather than applying these three optimization processes purely sequentially, a more robust approach is presented which increases the likelihood of arriving at design solutions that are global optima. A trade-off between theoretical optimality and manufacturability is made by implementing manufacturing constraints. This is done at various stages in the optimization process, rather than as a final translation step where a theoretically optimal solution is converted to a realistic design. Merely implementing manufacturing constraints as a final design step may lead to a design which moves away significantly from the optimal design that was arrived upon at an earlier stage. Manufacturing feasibility has been addressed by analyzing and building several samples showcasing a joint design that forms the building block for the type of structures that can be designed using the methodology presented in this thesis. The results indicate that, especially for stiffness-critical applications, this is a feasible approach for building structures that can be significantly lighter than state of art additive manufactured structures, while approaching similar levels of design freedom.","Composites; Fiber Reinforced Materials; Design Optimization; Grid Stiffened Structures; Manufacturing Constraints","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","","",""

A framework is also set up which assists in making decisions related to the launch event. Through market research and analyses a design brief for the launch event is developed. In addition, the market strategy is also developed to ensure the eventual launch event integrates well with it. After three concepts have been developed they are evaluated by performing user tests and analyzing data on the performance of previous marketing activities. The final concept is validated by holding a real design competition, which tests the competition element of the launch event. After choosing the final launch event (a promotional tour through the US), it is further detailed by means of co-creation. Additional activities are added to the event to provide the tour with a purpose and make it more unique. A marketing communications plan is also developed to again ensure integration. The marketing strategy is validated by attending a one day fair for brands and influencers. Furthermore the tour if further validated by discussing it with one of our partners. The thesis ends with a conclusion which shows that the tour is feasible and likely to be implemented. The main hurdles which still need to be overcome (finance and timing) are also discussed.","Launch event; Branding; Design; Marketing; Strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Aviation contributes significantly to anthropogenic global warming, and one promising possibility for mitigation is climate-optimised routing. For the REACT4C project a novel approach was used to simulate the variation of aviation water vapour and NOx emission climate impact with location and weather patterns, but this is too computationally expensive to apply beyond initial research. Results showed about 10% climate impact reduction from a 1% cost increase. For implementation of climate-optimised routing, algorithms are needed which will allow climate impact to be estimated in real-time from weather predictions. This research focuses on formulating algorithmic approximations of aviation water vapour and NOx emission climate impact based on local weather data by systematically examining correlations between climate impact data and weather data at the time of emission in the REACT4C dataset. The methods and models used for generating the REACT4C data are assessed in detail down to their first publications and potential errors and omissions are identified. The analysis is split into direct water vapour, short-lived ozone from NOx, and methane from NOx climate impact. Long-lived ozone and stratospheric water vapour from methane effects are neglected. The water vapour and NOx ozone and methane Climate Cost Function (CCF) results from REACT4C are reverse-engineered to the original grid they were emitted from to prevent inflation of statistical power. Weather and chemistry data at the time of emission are interpolated to the same grid for regression analysis. Literature reviews are used to identify causal predictors and derived variables. A variety of statistical tools are applied to assess variability of the CCFs and search for the best predictors. Four algorithms are developed for each species, using zero-dimensional instantaneous regression analysis. A tailored trade-off framework is applied to choose the best algorithm for application. The chosen algorithmic CCF for water vapour emissions is linear with potential vorticity and has an adjusted R2 of 0.59. Both the mean and the variance of the water vapour climate impact appear strongly determined by the altitude of an emission relative to the tropopause. The relationship between water vapour CCF results and emission altitude is investigated to critically reflect and expand on results from a previous publication. The chosen algorithmic CCF for ozone is bilinear with geopotential and temperature plus their interaction and has an adjusted R2 of 0.42. Ozone climate impact appears moderately determined by altitude and temperature of the emission location. The relationship between ozone CCF results, background NOx concentration and latitude during emission is investigated to critically reflect and expand on results from a previous publication. The chosen algorithmic CCF for methane is bilinear with geopotential and the solar incidence, and has an adjusted R2 of 0.17. Methane climate impact has low variability and is relatively independent of weather at the time and location of emission. The relationship between methane CCF results and background NOx concentrations during emission is investigated to critically reflect and expand on results from a previous publication. Methane climate impact can be more accurately predicted by using simulated ozone climate impact, but the variance left unexplained by the ozone algorithm would lead to worse results in application. The correlation between methane and ozone is weaker than in previous studies. Chemical concentrations, lightning frequency, and lightning NOx production at the time and location of emission do not predict aviation NOx climate impact beyond the extent of basic meteorology unless a large amount of predictors are included in the regression. The chain of models and assumptions from basic climate science to algorithmic CCFs is assessed to identify relative effects on uncertainty of the results. Several steps are identified that should be revisited and several opportunities for future data analyses to increase understanding and certainty of algorithmic CCFs. Future steps for research into and application of algorithmic CCFs depend on upcoming verification activities for the results presented here.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations / Aircraft Noise and Climate Effects (ANCE)","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In contrast to this community noise planning makes use of A-weighted decibel metrics such as LA and SEL. This research investigated the relationship between EPNL and the A-weighted metrics LA and SEL. This project was coupled with a need for aircraft noise estimation capabilities within the Aircraft Noise & Climate Effects (ANCE) and the Flight Performance & Propulsion (FPP) departments. For this purpose an aircraft noise simulation framework was created using available tools within both departments. The core of this framework is the noise simulation program INSTANT which predicts aircraft noise based upon aircraft models generated by Initiator, engine models made in GSP, and flight trajectories simulated by a point mass model. These four programs were used in unison to simulate aircraft flyovers of ten aircraft. The results of these simulations were analysed to determine the relationship between the three metrics. It was found that there is a strong relationship between the three acoustic metrics. It can be said that one could focus noise reduction efforts on one metric and expect to achieve similar results for the other two metrics. Furthermore, it was shown that the simulation framework offers many fascinating research topics at both the ANCE and FPP departments.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Engineering Control & Operations","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The following thesis report describes the process and outcomes of the graduation project from the MSc Strategic Product Design at Delft University of Technology, carried out for the company NightBalance. NightBalance is a medical company with a product that provides therapy as a treatment for patients with position dependent sleep apnea disorder. The goal of this project was to investigate and identify opportunities for increasing patient’s use and adherence to NightBalance’s new device with the use of a connected care service. After an iterative process of exploration, analysis, conceptualization and evaluation, the project proposes the creation of a patient focused connected care service that uses short subsequent therapy phases and programs to help patients improve specific aspects of their disorder, one at a time. The proposed service is enabled by the company's device combined with a new digital environment. The earlier creates interventions and collects progress data during the patient’s sleep, while the latter adapts the therapy goals to each patient’s progress, and provides step by step guidance from specialists to achieve those goals. In this report, the author starts by showing the insights of the project’s research and analysis in three main areas: Benefits for the organization from the introduction of a connected care service, learnings, and potential pitfalls from analogue cases. Opportunities and limitations for the introduction of such a service from the company’s situation and current developments. Points of pain and delight from the patient’s experience with the disorder and treatment, as well as drivers that have an influence on their compliance. Later, the combination of these insights lead the author to a phase of ideation, where concepts are generated to achieve the project’s goal and improve the offering that NightBalance delivers to its patients. The generated concepts are then evaluated with medical specialists and the R&D team of NightBalance, which pointed out the most promising one for further development. The last chapter of this report presents the complete description of the proposed connected care service and its components. It also outlines an implementation plan, points out potential benefits and pitfalls for the different stakeholders of the healthcare chain, and gives recommendations for the company to tackle those pitfalls. Finally, the report ends up with a collection of reflections from the author on the project’s process and results.","sleep apnea; connected care; service design; strategic design; user centered innovation; Healthcare","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2019-04-25","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovatie Management","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2017","To reduce the usage of Indium (rare material) in CIGS, ultra thin, high efficiency CIGS based solar devices have been developed in our group. One approach is to fabricate hybrid tandem cells between hydrogenated amorphous silicon and CIGS. Because the a-Si:H top sub-cell limits the current of such a device, it is desirable to texture the top transparent conductive oxide of the tandem cells for better light in-coupling inside the active layers. This project focused on textured ZnO:Al as the top TCO for the hybrid tandem cells to improve the device’s current. In this project, substrate temperature and sputtering pressure were varied. By varying sputtering conditions, different texture types of ZnO:Al could be found by wet-etching in HCl 0.5%. The different morphologies of textured ZnO:Al could be explained by the compactness of the material. The textured ZnO:Al had high transparency (around 80%) and low resistivity (as low as 5.5e-4 Ohm.¬cm). Then, further examination on the effect of light trapping of different textured ZnO:Al, textured a-Si:H single junctions were made. It was found that the textured top TCO resulted in maximum 9% increase in short circuit current in wavelength range from 300nm to 600nm of the textured single junction cell. This assisted the textured ZnO:Al choices for hybrid tandem cell. In textured hybrid tandem cells, the current of the top sub-cells increased by 0.77mA/cm2 or 8% increment in device’s current. Aside the experimental work on the textured devices, a new empirical model ""AID model"" was developed to integrate in the GenPro4 model. This empirical model took advantage of spectrophotometer measurements to generate the vectors inside the scattering matrices to describe light’s behaviour at the interface. Incorporating the AID model with other models, GenPro4 can be used with a wider spectrum of textured surfaces.","textured ZnO:Al (AZO); rf sputtering; tandem cells; amorphous silicon; CIGS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Benndorf, J. (mentor)","2017","Mine design and mine planning are essential to a mining operation as they do not only dictate the outline of the mine, but essentially determine the financial robustness and success of the mining operation. However, as mining is a conservative business mine design is still mostly done by hand. To indicate the effect of uncertainty in mine design, Vallee (2000) reported that 60% of the reviewed mines had an average production rate that was 30% lower than their designed capacity. To provide in better mine design researchers and companies have developed and proposed number of guidance tools in recent years to help optimize mine planning. However their efforts have mainly focussed on open-pit mine design whilst largely ignoring underground mining, which is more versatile and therefore more difficult to assess. Furthermore, the optimization algorithms that have been developed are mostly based on average-type or interpolated resource models, which do not allow assessing uncertainty. Several stochastic approaches have been proposed by Dimitrakopoulos and others as a tool to involve stochastic techniques in mine design optimization as a way to assess uncertainty. However, few practical stochastic solutions have been developed for underground mine design. To contribute to the recent efforts made by the TU Delft in the ‘Horizon 2020 – Real Time Mining’ European Union Research and Innovation Programme, this research has focussed on combining underground mine design optimization with several stochastic analyses. A stope layout optimizer was developed in Matlab based on standard genetic algorithms, a sub-group of evolutionary algorithms. This model was tested on two validation data sets where it showed good optimization performance. A stochastic optimization module was added and tested, but as the validation data set was linear, it showed no added value. Using a resource model of a copper / zinc VMS deposit a number of stochastic approaches were tested. By performing a minimal downside risk / maximum upside potential analysis a stochastic optimization and elimination approach was tested under different economic scenarios by using 20 unconditional economic block model simulations. A stochastic risk analysis using the same 20 economic block models was done to study the effect of stochastic probability on economic value, ore tonnage, waste tonnage, average ore grade and average arsenic content. Lastly, a stochastic design optimization was done using 100 unconditional economic block models and its optimization performance was compared to that for a traditional non-stochastic optimization. Both the minimal downside risk / maximum upside potential analysis and the stochastic design analysis showed better optimization results than traditional optimization using average type orebody models. However, as in the min / max approach emphasis was on robustness instead of profitability, it was unable to show the same degree of improvement over traditional optimization.","Stochastic Optimization; Mine design; Underground Mining; Genetic Algorithms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Resource Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2017","Abstract Pilot study Introduction: Falls are a primary cause of accidental deaths, serious injuries, dependency and society costs. The response to perturbations could identify how well persons are able to reject perturbations. The aim of the study was to compare four different medio-lateral swing perturbations in order to select the most appropriate perturbation type and intensity for further perturbations studies. Methods: Five healthy subjects aged between 18 and 40 were included. Baseline walking on an CAREN was measured, followed by four perturbation trials in which the similar perturbation was twelve times repeated. Subjects were exposed to two different perturbation types; contra-lateral and ipsi-lateral perturbations and two different perturbation intensities; 0.05m displacement in 1.77s and 0.035m displacement in 1.62s. The perturbation response was quantified using the gait sensitivity norm and observational analysis. Results: The lager intensity of 0.05 m showed an increased response to contra-lateral perturbations compared to the lower intensity 0.035m (p=0.02). Contra-lateral perturbations tend to result in a larger response compared to ipsi-lateral perturbations. Subjects showed opposite responses to contra- and ipsi-lateral perturbations. Following contra-lateral perturbations, subjects decreased MOS and step width in the fist two step following the perturbation and increased step length and step time. In response to ipsi-lateral perturbations, subjects increased their MOS and step width, but decreased step length and step time. Conclusion: The contra-lateral perturbation of 0.05m intensity and the described protocol were recommended for further studies in order to discriminate fall-prone subjects. Abstract Study with stroke survivors Introduction: Around 40% of stroke patients show residual walking disabilities that increase fall risk. Therefore, it is important to identify patient specific responses related to fall risk. The aim of this study was to determine whether the ability to recover from external perturbations on the walking surface could discriminate patients from healthy controls and discriminate fallers from non-fallers in the stroke patient group. In addition, relations were studied between clinical fall assessments and perturbation responses. Methods: 14 stroke patients and 15 healthy controls were included in the study. Baseline walking on a CAREN was measured, followed by a trail with ten contra-lateral perturbations with an 0.05m displacement in 1.77s. The trials were performed in fixed speed and self-paced walking. The perturbation response was quantified using the gait sensitivity norm and observational analysis. Group differences in perturbation response were tested between stroke and healthy subjects and within the stroke patient group between fallers and non-fallers. Clinical fall assessments were correlated to GSN outcomes. Results: Stroke patients showed a larger perturbation response based on the gait sensitivity norm compared to healthy controls (p = 0.04) in fixed speed walking. In self-paced walking, stroke patients showed a larger gait sensitivity norm response (corrected)(p=0.04) and a larger step time (=0.02) and MOS response (p=0.03). Stroke patients showed reduced step width response (p=0.03). No differences in perturbation responses were found between stroke patients with and without fall history. Positive correlations were found between the timed up and go (TUG) score and GSN outcomes (p=0.03, p=<0.01, p=<0.01, p=<0.01). Conclusion: The lacking identification of fall prone stroke patients can be related to the inconsistency of current clinical fall risk assessments. The correlation between TUG and GSN can be explained because both are performance measures instead of subjective assessments. As stroke patients compensate for deficits in functionality, the higher GSN outcomes might indicate a less efficient way to cope with the perturbation compared to healthy controls. Although the GSN does not specifically indicate which gait indicator showed an enlarged response and how stroke patients and healthy persons reacted differently on a step basis, it does give a discriminative overall response between stroke patients and healthy subjects. Therefore, it might be an effective way to quantify the response to perturbations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BioRobotics","",""

In the present thesis the spectral rehomogenization method is validated and its feasibility as- sessed in two-group pin-by-pin nodal diffusion calculations. It is found that significant cross section error reductions can be achieved, as well as reductions in errors related to the pin power distribution. However, improvements to the method are necessary in highly heterogeneous media to ensure adequate error reductions in group cross sections associated with fast and epithermal neutrons.

(mentor); Benthien, H. (mentor); Hegenbart, M. (mentor)","2017","Cellular solids are characteristically excellent energy absorbers due to their capacity to store large amounts of energy through compression. A bioinspired design approach identified the Pomelo fruit (Citrus Maximus) as a biological role model for energy absorption. Fruit peels’ biologically most important functions lies in the need to provide protection of the seeds from mechanical damage or other negative environmental influences. This qualifies such biological structures as role models for the development of novel structures that protect commodities from damage. The main structural principle extracted from the Pomelo is a density graded strategy. With maturing additive manufacturing (AM) technologies allowing unprecedented control over structural topology, controlled lattice structures can now be investigated . Using a class of AM, selective laser sintering (SLS), lattice structures were fabricated out of polypropylene and subjected to static and dynamic compressive loadings. The lattices were designed to determine the influence of the biomimetic density grading, cell shape and cell size in 3 distinct lattice configurations. Quasi-static simple compression results are compared to analytical micro-mechanical models, finite element method simulations and digital image correlation. Dynamic impact data is assessed using high-speed camera images and evaluated with an analytical momentum analysis. Data analysis is discussed and it is concluded that the density grading strategy beneficially influences the energy absorption. This is attributed to a combination of local plasticity manipulation and higher densification strains in static regime. In dynamic tests, the collapse initiation trigger led to controlled, more gradual collapse with lower corresponding loads.","cellular solids; 3D printing; pomelo; additive manufacturing; lattice; energy; adsorption; biometrics; SLS; compression; impact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-09-01","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Wal, W. (mentor)","2017","The Saturnian moon Enceladus is one of the most geologically active bodies in the solar system. Ridged terrains dominated by intense tectonism are observed on both hemispheres while plume jets emanating from geological surface cracks are con?ned to the South Polar Terrain, thereby suggesting lateral heterogeneity of the satellite's internal structure. While the latter is not directly accessible, thermodynamic modeling provides important insights on its composition and physical properties. This study aims at building a consistent thermal model of the ice-ocean system to derive the layering of the ice shell and its lateral variations. Comparison with current ice shell thickness estimations and key observables such as mean density, moment of inertia factor or heat flux allows to further constrain the satellite's core density. We start from building internal structural reference models composed of four spherically symmetric homogeneous layers: a core, a salty liquid water layer, a lower warm ductile ice layer and an upper cold brittle ice layer. Since the total ice shell thickness is small compared to the satellite's mean radius (less than 10%), we apply and validate the thin shell approximation. It allows us to further compute a three dimensional thermodynamic model of the ice-ocean system accounting for the dissipation of tidal energy induced by diurnal tides. We show that the higher the core density, the thinner the ice shell to keep the salty ocean density within a realistic range (typically below 1250 kg m-3). We show that tidal dissipation solely occurs within the viscous ductile ice layer, and increases towards the poles. The resulting tidal polar surface heat flow is roughly ?ve times higher compared to the equatorial one. We finally propose a method to derive lateral variations of the brittle-to-ductile boundary that is consistent with the computed temperature distribution. Comparison with output power measurements and current estimations of lateral variations of the ice shell thickness allows us to constrain the core density around 3000 kg m-3, corresponding to a partly de-hydrated core.","Enceladus; Interiors; Planetary thermodynamics; Tides","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Astrodynamics and Space Missions and Planetary Exploration","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Atmospheric free flight scaled flight testing is an affordable way to investigate the dynamic properties of an aircraft, while enabling a wider range of test possibilities than a windtunnel. This research is the first step into the development of a scaled flight testing model and as such will highlighted the difficulties and discrepancies which will be faced when scaling is performed. This study has the objective of investigating the effect of scaling on the aerodynamic properties and of the flow field at the tail location, with the focus on take-off conditions. The full scale case is a regional aircraft, the ATR72, with an unswept and slightly tapered wing. The scaled case is 14.7% geometric scaled The analysis of the aerodynamic properties is split between the clean wing and the wing with an additional surface in the form of a flap. The aerodynamic properties investigated were the lift, moment and drag curve, and the maximum lift coefficient. The clean wing was analysed using a quasi-3D analysis called Q3D, which is a combination of a vortex-lattice method (AVL) and a vortex panel method (XFOIL). A modification of XFOIL, called RFOIL, is used to analyse the difference in maximum lift coefficient between the airfoil of the scaled and full scale case. RFOIL is selected because of the better results near stall. The wing with flap is investigated using a vortex lattice method, in this case again AVL, where the airfoil with flap is investigated using the Euler-solver MSES. Finally the maximum lift coefficient for the wing with flap is analysed with the semi-empirical Pressure Difference Rule. The Pressure Difference Rule states that there is a ratio between the peak pressure and the trailing edge pressure, on a surface, at which maximum lift occurs. The methods are limited in their incorporation of viscous effects, the 2D-analysis tools (XFOIL, RFOIL and MSES) only include viscous effects in the small boundary layer region. AVL does not include viscous effects directly, but only via a correction factor for the lift-curve slope. However, the results found in literature using these methods are satisfactory. An analysis of the wake field is done using methods developed by the ESDU. The wake properties of both the scaled as well as the full scale are calculated using semi-empirical models and use a simplification where to place the vortex sheet. The dimensions and velocity loss of the wake itself can be calculated using either a method by ESDU or a method by Schlichting. Results showed that both these methods provided similar solutions. The scaling of the wing proves to change the aerodynamic properties and the similarity is no longer present for all the investigated aerodynamic properties. For both the wing with and without flap this is the case. These differences are mainly due to Reynolds number effects, the Mach number effects are only minimal on the lift coefficient. Due to the limits on the selected methods the exact magnitude of the difference found can not be guaranteed, but the trends in the found differences are certain. A basis for this is found in the different boundary layer properties, the scaled wing exhibits a thicker boundary layer, leading to a decambering effect, and laminar separation bubbles are found to occur. Both the clean and wing with flap shows more outboard loading for the scaled wing. The scaled wing exhibits a thicker wake, with a larger velocity loss. The difference between the full and scaled clean wing is thus larger than the difference between the full and scaled wing with flap. The reason for difference between the full and scaled wing can be found in the increased drag (coefficient) of the scaled wing. The reason behind the larger increase in wake for the clean wing is due to the fact that the difference in drag coefficient between the full and scaled case is larger for the clean wing than for the wing with flap. An investigation to minimize the differences between the full and scaled wing is done. It is decided to change the airfoil shape. Improvements are visible for the optimized airfoil, on all the aerodynamic properties. The optimized airfoil shapes tends towards a thinner airfoil and thus an investigation into solely optimizing the thickness of the airfoil is also done. This also proves to give better results than the original airfoil, however, not as good as the shape optimized airfoils.. This thinner profile was also investigated in the configuration with a flap, but here it proved to decrease the performance of the airfoil with flap. The difference between the full and scaled case can be reduced by an optimization. If an optimization is to be done, it must be done on the whole of configurations and flight conditions. As the next step into a development of a scaled flight test model, the exact extend of tests must be determined, only then can it be investigated how scaling affects the results of testing. No direct solutions exist to completely overcome the gap between the full and scaled aerodynamic properties of a flight testing model, however airfoil shape optimization does provide a better similarity.","Scaled Flight Testing; Aerodynamic properties; Wake; Flap; Similarity; Scaling; Optimization; MSES; RFOIL; XFOIL; Q3D; AVL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); Rocco de Campos Pereira, R.C. (mentor)","2017","Unregulated development is one of the core problems in post conflict areas. Current rebuilding and city planning face tremendous challenges regulating rapid development of the urban environment and reserving and preserving space for the public domain. The latter one has been often disregarded its importance. It has been found that public space and social places are part of the basic needs espcially in developing countries. Integrating that public dimension within current contexts of post conflict conditions have great challenges. Those challenges related to social-cultural, political, economic, environmental and physical-urban contexts. This thesis focuses on Dodona, a neighborhood in capital Prishtina, Kosovo. The neighborhoods urban fabric changed rapidly in the aftermath of the conflict and the limited quality spaces are in decay and affect livability of the area. In order to design (spatial) interventions for the Public Carpet Dodona, 6 urban strategic themes are developed that aim to create synergy on political, social and cultural level and 25 patterns of post-conflict development are found through socia-spatial analysis of the neighborhood. An integrated approach has resulted in a 3 level priority design concept, the minium level, the desired level and the maximum level. That concept results in the design of 7 public domain interventions for Dodona. These interventions act on existing problems and challenges found in the context and integrate the renewed public focus of the government. The design proposes a basic interventions, innovative ideas for space use, reserves space for an public-private interaction, offers space to new public activities and tries to create synergy between spatial and social on different scales. The design showed that there are 5 conditions that contribute to the development of Dodona’s public network: the available space, entrepreneural spirit, transition to comfort, range of development and scale. The interventions in Dodona can provide interesting urban program, contribute to the urban quality of the area and create a new public domain. Various neighborhoods and their public space quality are challenged by the post conflict processes. The interventions proposed in for this neighborhood could be used in different contexts when adapted to the local situations.We have to think and act different when it comes to challenging urban conditions. These conditions ask for innovative thinking in order to create space for living, working and public life. A good approach and integration of all its actors need to be part of any spatial intervention. However, this thesis showed that interventions in the public domain can be integrated in an urban area, can bring urban quality and in that way can contribute to the achievement creating a livable neighorhood.","post conflict processes; unregulated development; public space network; social dimension; urban design; Prishtina; Kosovo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Complex Cities","","42.66290, 21.16550"

(mentor)","2017","The core business of an airport is its air-side activities but it could not function without fluent, multi-modal and resilient land-side connectivity with its surroundings. The AirportCity is located in a dense urban area and therefore also the most important land-side transport interchange of the Netherlands. Due to the growth of air travellers on a global scale (6,3% in 2016, IATA), it has been decided the terminal will be expanded by building an extra A-pier and Terminal. This allows for a 30% growth in the number of passengers from 2019. However, the land transport modalities nearly reach their limits and the capacity has to grow along the future aviation capacity. This design project provides a vision and design concept from a passengers’ point of view for a transport hub in 2025. The user-centred approach, focused on arriving passengers and their meeters (family/friends who pick-up a passenger from the airport) is complementary to Schiphol’s business perspective and the ambition to become Europe’s preferred airport. Transport hub vision: The 2025 vision contains an underground land-side transport hub in a large welcoming AirortCity hall. It was found that the arriving passengers’ experience was neglected compared to the departing passenger. As a focus area, the needs and wishes of meeters and arriving passengers are defined: 1) dominant practically motivated meeters and arriving passengers and 2) dominant emotionally motivated meeters and passengers. The first group is located on the two remote hubs connected with a shuttle. Facilities for the second group are located in the AirportCity hall: the meeters can wait close to the arriving passengers. Product-service system: The arrival process at Schiphol is not transparent for the meeter which makes time management between meeters and passengers difficult. The interactive waiting environment makes the arrival information clearer for meeters by visualized and personal information. This empowers meeters to manage their time and spend it more freely at the airports land-side commercial facilities. The entertaining element of the interactive waiting environment emphasizes the ‘Schiphol experience’ in the AirportCity. The mood between meeters (excited) and arriving PAX (devoted to the airlines schedule) appeared to be very different. Therefore, the final design concept functions as a welcoming wake-up call for arriving passengers to make them aware and excited about the meeters presence. Additionally, the design concept is guidance to help the passenger to continue his journey seamlessly after a flight.","seamless; Schiphol; transport hub; design; vision; arriving passengers; Meesters; meeting point; AriportCity; Wayfinding; land-side; passenger flow; airport; passenger experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The world energy market has become very volatile due to the increase of renewable sources of power (solar and wind energy) and it asks more flexibility to fossil power stations. Gas turbines are of great importance for the generation of power both in combined cycles and in combined heat and power installations. If in the past gas turbines operated on a continuous basis (base load), nowadays there is the necessity for gas turbines to operate at part load during periods of excess of renewables. Up to now, many combined cycles and combined heat and power installations show little flexibility and their contribution to grid stability is limited. Vendors use several traditional techniques to part-load gas turbines: decreasing firing temperature, decreasing inlet airflow (inlet guide vane closure), recirculating the compressor airflow or a combination of these techniques. The cycle efficiency drops significantly at part load when using these traditional control techniques. Furthermore, traditional gas turbine control techniques struggle to keep emission levels low (NOx and CO). An option to overcome these problems is the use of Flue Gas Recirculation (FGR) for which the gas turbine flue gases are recirculated to the gas turbine inlet. When recirculating the flue gases, the inlet temperature of the gas turbinewill rise resulting in a lower mass flowthrough the installation and lower power production. Flue Gas Recirculation has been studied before in the literature to increase the CO2 content and decrease the NOx content in flue gases but not to allow part load operation. The uniqueness of this research is to enable part load operation of combined heat and power plants and combined cycles with FGR. In particular, there is a lack of studies on the impact of FGR on the thermodynamic cycle and the gas turbines components (e.g. compressor and turbine). In order to investigate the part load controls, a model of a Brayton cycle has been developed and validated with THERMOFLEX. The results show that FGR is more efficient than the other part load controls for both the combined heat and power plants and combined cycles. In particular, the use of FGR can theoretically increase the cycle efficiency of the combined heat and power plants at part load up to 9% with respect to traditional control techniques.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-04-21","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Energy & Process Technology","",""

Obesity is appointed as a pressing 21st century public health threat by the World health organization. Current sedentary behaviour in Western society is key in fast spread of the obesity epidemic. Children are most vulnerable to obesity because overweight children have a 50% chance to become obese as an adult. Latest research pleads for the approach of obesity as a contagious disease. The obesity epidemic spreads to social ties by shared social norms on eating and activity behaviour. The urban environment had played a role in the stopping contagious diseases from spreading in the beginning of the 20th century. Now urban design should find a way to stop the spread of this social epidemic, obesity. In this research four methods were used. The first method is a literature study. Through studying literature the approach of obesity in the last 30 years, the new approaches in social epidemiology and the approach through urban design were studied. Additional semi-structured interviews with experts in both The Netherlands and New York gave more insight in the latest trends and future challenges for this approach of obesity. The literature study formed the base for the ObeCity model, containing essential urban design intervention that would reduce the obesity spread among children. Solutions in this model are general and not yet applicable to a specific design location. Through a context analysis in Beverwaard, the second method used in this research, a more in depth understanding of the local context was obtained. The ObeCity model was adjusted and prioritized based on this local context. In Beverwaard active transport is already well integrated in the urban structure. However means to prevent the social epidemic from spreading, like surprising elements in the streets, were lacking. Research suggested Participatory Action Research (PAR) as a sufficient method to strengthen health perception and encourage the use of public space. Through this method the participants are involved and gain control over their environment. Also the involvement of community members when designing public space increases the chance for the community to use this space for physical activity. So this method on the one hand served the community. On the other hand it served the research and gave more insight in the needs of the target group to become physically active in the urban environment. Through this data the ObeCity model was adjusted for the last time. The creative ideas of the target group during the PAR process were direct design inspiration. These designs were adjusted to the guidelines of the model and applied in the neighbourhood through drawings and models in the final design process. So the ObeCity model involves both trends in research, spatial context and social dynamics in the neighbourhood. The use of this model when designing public space is therefore likely to stimulate physical activity in the neighbourhood among children. The in the translation of the model to spatial design, interpretation of the designer and inspiration from the PAR process eventually create the design. In Beverwaard playgrounds for functional, dramatic and explorative play contribute to the reduction of obesity. Pedestrian lanes were transformed in thematic spaces for social bounding and bridging and testing social norms. Further research is needed to monitor the effects of this design and specify the applicable elements of the ObeCity model and PAR process in order to stimulate physical activity among children even better.","Healthy city; obesity; urban design; communication; participatory action research; cocreation; children","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","","",""

(mentor); De Vries, P.A. (mentor); Yang, Y. (mentor)","2017","The aim of this thesis is to investigate the feasibility of determining the preload in bolts in High Strength Friction Grip Conections and performing in situ measurements. The magnitude of the preload is important for the behavior of High Strength Friction Grip Connections, as it defines the fatigue life of the connection and limits the displacement of the joint. For this reason, it is important knowing the preload at any point during the service life of the connection. This thesis first analyses the causes that may lead to an insufficient initial preload and the factors which may result in a preload loss over time. Then, the state of the art in the determination of preload in High Strength Friction Grip Connections is reviewed and the strain gauge method is tested to define the potential of this method on performing in situ measurements, for two reasons: 1) so far, the in situ tests with this method were not possible, because of a complicated installation procedure. For the tests presented in this thesis, a new type of strain gauges (BTMC strain gauges) is used, which simplifies the installation procedure and 2) the strain gauge method is less affected by factors which govern the in situ measurements. This is done by imitating the in situ conditions in the lab and determining the uncertainty interval of this method. Then, this method is tested on a connection of an existing structure. The results show that it is possible to do in situ measurements with the strain gauge method. It is also shown that the best way to determine the force with a maximum accuracy is by conducting time consuming calibration tests. Therefore, in the last part of this thesis four approaches are suggested, which aim to reduce the number of calibration tests, without loosing much of the accuracy in the estimation of the force.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

Since the suggested links might not be correct, people who are familiar with the involved ontologies can improve the outcome of this process by assessing the generated matches. The aim of this thesis is to investigate how to design a system which facilitates ontology understanding and involves users in the instance matching evaluation process. The tool is meant to be used by domain experts, with limited knowledge in Semantic Web technologies. To achieve this, a graph visualization of the ontology was developed and then evaluated during a two-phase iterative process. Later on, an instances-matched confirmation module was created and coupled with the visualization system. The user evaluation showed that domain experts are able to perform ontology exploration tasks similar to existing ontology visualization platforms and underlines people’s behaviour when they are exposed to large amount of data. The evaluation results also support the idea that users manage to improve the quality of the instance-matching by successfully using the match confirmation module.","ontology; ontology matching; semantic web; rdf; owl; visualization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

Function approximators solve a part of the curse of dimensionality when learning in high-dimensional state and/or action spaces. It can be a time-consuming process to learn a good policy in a high dimensional state space directly. A method is proposed for initially limiting the state and action space to a subset of the variables of the Markov Decision Process. Therefore, the agent will initially learn a coarse policy. It is then gradually exposed to new state and action variables to increase the dimensionality of the state and action space to the ones posed by the control problem. A local function approximator has been developed that supports the expansion of state and action space. The concept is applied to the Model-Learning Actor-Critic, a model-based Heuristic Dynamic Programming algorithm. Its functioning is demonstrated by training a reinforcement learning agent for 2-dimensional hover control of a Parrot AR 2.0 quad-rotor. It is shown that the agent is able to learn faster and to achieve a better policy when being exposed to the action and state variables gradually than all at once from the start.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","","",""

(mentor); de Smit, A. (mentor)","2017","Objects surrounding us are predominantly static. This report describes a step towards a more dynamic world. A new composite is introduced that is able to change its shape like a hinge. The process started with analysing and reproducing a composite consisting of a low-melting point metal and a silicone, created in 2016 (by van Meerbeek et al.). The composite is stiff when the metal is beneath its melting temperature, but when it is heated above its melting temperature it becomes flexible. Providing many advantages, like reversible stiffness and the ability to move back to its original position (using the shape memory of silicone). The next step was to make the composite move without the use of human force, but by using materials. This is where ‘Shape Memory Alloy’ came in, an alloy that can return to a pre-programmed position when heated above its transition temperature. Combining these materials resulted in a hinging composite that can be actuated by changing the temperature of the individual components. The choices and findings concerning the created composite are described. It was discovered that the low-melting point metal can be directly heated using electrical current, making it possible to use 3D printing to create the elastomeric base of the composite with. The unique qualities of this technique were used for the base of the composite. Subsequently it was researched what possibilities there are to move the composite two-way (front and back). Finally, all design decisions of the final composite are explained. It was researched which opportunities this composite has in terms of product development. A creative session with fellow-designers was the first step to explore various applications. Ideation was done next to get a broad base of ideas. Three ideas were developed into concept from which one was chosen as final demonstration product. This product features movement from 2D to 3D, showing the qualities of the hinging composite. Other possible future suggestions and applications are given. It is recommended to do more research on the composite to improve its qualities. It can be made stronger by expanding the size of both the Shape Memory Alloy and the used low-melting point metal. This report only describes the first steps towards a hinging composite that, when developed further, can in the future be applied in for example furniture, medical and sport applications.","Hinging composite; shape morphing; Shape memory alloy; Field’s metal; hinge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Zlatanova, S. (mentor)","2017","As world urbanization continues apace and total population increases, there is an immediate demand for better monitoring and exploitation of space. In view of the above, the “Smart Cities” concept has been developed and numerous efforts are made to deploy technology to this end. The main information needed for city development and planning is road modality and the relevant occupancy patterns. However, it is quite difficult to collect this information. There have been several different approaches towards providing this information and various methods have been used. However, each of them has weaknesses which do not allow it to be used on its own. On the other hand, thanks to the new technological developments and due to the growing needs of society over the last years, the system of Wi-Fi monitoring sensors has been increasingly used in outdoor environments. Many companies have already used this method to collect data and provide information about users’ behavior in places such as public areas, shopping centers and malls. Nonetheless, the contribution of this thesis is the study of the applicability of this method, the assessment of the reliability of its outcomes and the identification of crucial parameters which significantly affect the final accuracy. Thus, the aim of this research is to investigate what kind of road modality and occupancy patterns can be recognized using Wi-Fi monitoring sensors in a city area as well as which setup parameters can influence the final outcome. The system is implemented in the city of Dordrecht, which constitutes the research area of this study. First of all, the design of the observation network is described and the relevant parameters are taken into account. Using the data collected by the system and the known distances between the sensors, the movement speed of each device is computed. Street-uses criteria of the research area are also used as input to the system, and in combination with the computed speed three categories of users are recognized and each device is categorized as “pedestrian”, “bicyclist”, or “vehicle”. Under this classification each street’s road modality is studied. The relationship between the categories throughout the day is investigated and preferred streets for each kind of users are recognized. Based on the ability of the system to identify every device in the research area throughout the day, the movement behaviors of users are researched and similarities between them as well and the most frequent patterns are identified. Three sets of movement patterns are studied considering the number of sensors which scan the same device within a time period. Each set is investigated separately for every kind of users. Moreover, using the number of devices scanned at each sensor point, occupancy patterns are identified both for users as a whole and for each user category separately. It is argued that this constitutes an important advantage of the system. Rush hours, recession periods and movement trends are recognized for the different days of the week as well as the occupancy relationship between the research area and its surroundings. Finally, a questionnaire and random samplings with Bernoulli trial are used to validate the outcomes. A quite strong correlation between the system’s results and reality is revealed, especially with regard to pedestrians and bicyclists. However, despite the quite promising findings, further implementation and testing of the system in different environments is needed in order to draw an indisputable conclusion about its effectiveness.","Passive Wi-Fi monitoring; road modality; movement patterns; occupancy; Smart Cities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","OTB","","Geomatics for the Built Environment","",""

(mentor)","2017","The main products of this graduation are a new pattern language to map difficult/technical interventions in spatial tiles, a GIS model for assessing urban metabolism potentials and restrictions and a new approach for applying urban metabolism measurements on neighbourhood level. A personal motivation for me is the relation between the urban metabolism analysis and the impact it has on the urban design. Important questions are ‘where in the city should the urban designer or planner do something?’ and ‘how big does the intervention need to be?’ Often these questions are not addressed properly related to the theory of urban metabolism. The spatial component is often lacking and therefore the impact of urban metabolism on urban design is not well established. This graduation project focuses on bridging that gap. The testcase for this project is the city of Amsterdam.Amsterdam wants to be one of the frontier cities in the subject of circularity. This ambition is shown by the reports the city of Amsterdam has made. However it stays unclear how the analysis and the interventions relate to the context of Amsterdam. Where in the city would which measurements be implemented? And how that would change the city, how would it look? This leads to the research question: What is the spatial impact of the meaningful sustainable measurements, for key urban flows, which create a more circular city of Amsterdam? The studied flows in this graduation project are electricity, heat, drink water and phosphate. The project creates an inventory of twelve spatial intervention in creating circularity for the flows. The inventory contains the 1) spatial requirements and 2) theoretical potential. Based on the spatial requirements an allocation tool is created. This GIS based model for assessing urban metabolism potentials and restrictions is one of the outcomes of this graduation project. This model is not only an analytical step towards the urban design, but an outcome in itself. However the goal of the graduation project was to see what is the spatial impact of urban metabolism. For this a location was chosen based partially on the GIS model. For this location spatial exploration is made The exploration shows the possible potential of each measurement and their spatial impact. By comparing all the possible interventions we get a design brief for the location. Then a more in depth design experiment is made for an area in Slotervaart. This to see how the design can not only be a technical solution but also add to the urban quality. The design zoom-in contains 3 elements which can be replicated in the area of Slotervaart in similar areas. These elements are 1) a housing block with row housing, 2) housing block with high density housing, 3) neighbourhood nutrient hub. The design impressions show how the elements look, work together and add value to the site. Showing the relation between how much the interventions solve and their spatial impact. This shows the real spatial impact of the interventions related to the potential circularity. The used process is a new approach for applying urban metabolism measurements on neighbourhood level.","urban metabolism; electricity; heat; drink water; phosphate; urban design; Amsterdam; circular cities; circular solutions; GIS; allocation tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","","",""

(mentor); Visser, O.W. (mentor)","2017","Massively Multiplayer Online Games are played by millions of people from around the world who play together in large virtual environments. With sometimes even a million gamers playing the same game, the load on the virtual environments they play in needs to be distributed between servers to deal with this many players. Several techniques have been proposed, and are used in practice, to partition the load of these distributed virtual environments. Massively Multiplayer Online Games often try to facilitate as many players in a single virtual environment as possible, but even advanced spatial partitioning techniques cannot handle the load generated by the players when a large group of them gathers in a small area. Players usually have in these virtual environments a limited vision range making sure that game clients are not overwhelmed by status updates for all players in the environment, this approach also proves problematic when crowding occurs. We propose socially aware load partitioning and interest management, with the aim of reducing the load on the virtual environment and the game clients when crowding occurs, which takes the social relations between players into consideration when partitioning the load and deciding who should see whom. In this thesis we look specifically at how we can fairly compare various techniques and how we can effectively use social data to improve the scalability of distributed virtual environments. To evaluate and compare the performance of our socially aware techniques we design and implement an extensible framework which facilitates the evaluation of a wide variety of distributed virtual environment techniques and policies. As input for this framework, a workload is required that includes the components these techniques optimize for. As such we propose a new player behaviour model that supports player movement and interaction. In this framework existing techniques have been implemented in addition to our newly designed socially aware techniques and policies. The experiments using our framework show that socially aware techniques can result, assuming that the interaction probability between players can accurately be predicted, in better performance and scalability than their spatial counterparts. Further experiments with various proposed socially aware policies indicate that all these policies succeed, to varying degrees, in grouping friends together in the same partition. Experiments with socially aware interest management show that the proposed policies can achieve significant performance improvements, the best results are obtained when combining socially aware load partitioning and interest management.","Scalability; Distributed System; Virtual Environment; Behaviour Model; Socially Aware; DVE; MMORPG; Online Games; Social Strategies; Research Framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Distributed Systems","",""

(mentor); Su, Z. (mentor)","2017","Infrastructure managers outsource maintenance activities to maintenance service contractors. This gives rise to misalignment between a contractor's short-term objectives and an infrastructure manager's long-term objectives. Infrastructure managers have started to explore various forms of contracts in which they incentivize contractors to work in the infrastructure managers' best interest. In this master thesis, a game-theoretical approach is taken for the design of new contracts. In order to align their objectives, the infrastructure manager announces a policy to the contractor, in which he specifies which decisions he will make as a reaction to the contractor's decisions. This problem is formulated as a dynamic reverse Stackelberg game. The payment scheme the leader pays to the follower is considered the leader function. This payment scheme is dependent on the infrastructure's failure rate. The resulting game allows both parties to achieve the best possible result, while taking into account the hierarchical and the sequential aspects of an infrastructure maintenance contract. In the resulting dynamic reverse Stackelberg game, both players maximize their utility over their planning window by adapting to each other's decisions at each consecutive decision stage. The utility of the leader is dependent on the infrastructure's failure rate, that in turn is dependent on the infrastructure's deterioration dynamics and all maintenance actions. The infrastructure manager gives the contractor incentives to perform the maintenance actions that are optimal for the infrastructure manager, at stages that are optimal for the infrastructure manager. This results in a leader function for the infrastructure manager and a set of maintenance actions for the contractor that maximize each player's utility. Two scenarios have been examined: one with complete information and one with incomplete information. Two models have been constructed based on this game: a general model and a replacement threshold model that restricts the follower to apply a threshold to the condition of the infrastructure; replacements are then performed at the stage that the condition of the infrastructure passes a threshold. The first model achieves the best possible result, while the second model is more realistic and more computationally efficient. The models can be used by infrastructure managers to design contracts to optimize their utility.","maintenance outsourcing; infrastructure maintenance; dynamic reverse Stackelberg games; game theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","A principal-agent problem is a mathematical framework for modelling contractual relationships, where a principal delegates tasks to an agent in exchange for reward. Many real life contracts are of this type. The agent does not have the same objectives as the principal and he possesses hidden information. Two types of hidden information is generally considered: moral hazard (hidden action) and adverse selection (hidden type). This asymmetry of information can be exploited by the agent for his own benefits, which can reduce the principal's utility. The goal is find a mechanism, in the form of a contract, that aligns the principal's and agent's objectives and maximises the principal's utility. Previous economic studies focuses on finding analytical solutions on specific cases. In this study we consider numerical solution approaches for a principal agent-problem with moral hazard, and a generalised principal-agent problem with moral hazard and adverse selection problem. The moral hazard problem is a bi-level programming problem and it is solved by assuming the agent's optimal effort is an implicit function dependent on the contract. The generalised principal agent problem is an infinite programming problem. For that we propose two numerical solution methods: the discretisation method and the basis function method. Both are tested on a option contract problem with moral hazard and adverse selection. From the experiment, the discretisation method seems to be the better performer.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

However, the ongoing empirical blockchain discussions on these effects are unstructured, due to high complexities. Both practitioners and researchers therefore struggle to get to the core of blockchain technology consequences. We use a Grounded Theory approach to map the ongoing blockchain discussion, which leads to our empirical core category that explains the core of the blockchain discussions: the disintermediation of trust in environments with highly institutionalized values. Blockchain technology is thus often related to trust in our empirical data. However, following the conceptualization of Reliance – Trust and Control by Nooteboom, we show that blockchain technology should be more related to control, instead of trust. Futhermore, we argue that complete control is not always possible in blockchain- systems due to inherent character of decentralized decision making and thus, trust is still a factor in some blockchain environments. We conclude that blockchain technology is a technology that increases control over counterparties in a transaction, but decreases control from a systems-perspective. A transfer of power in the system therefore takes place in blockchain environments. We therefore present our final core category as: power transfer in environments with highly institutionalized values. This strong conceptualization of blockchain technology helps actors understand and discuss the essence of blockchain technology, and provides a much- needed empirical basis for further scientific research. Further development of this conceptualization of trust and control is needed to structure the ongoing blockchain discussions in both scientific literature and practice.","Ground Theory; Blockchain Technology; Trust; Control; Conceptualisation; Effects; Issues; Functions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering, Systems and Services","","Information and Communication Technology (ICT)","",""

It is primarily used for lab scale operations by pharmaceutical technologists in the research to new types of medicines or vaccines. The ez-Control regulates the environmental conditions, such as pH and temperature, inside the bioreactor during fermentation. The product was introduced to the market in 2007, and has reached the end of its life cycle. A follow-up product should therefore be developed, which integrates a user-friendly design, technological trends and a new look-and-feel. The user-centred design approach was applied in the project. This approach gives extensive attention to the needs, wants and limitations of end users at each stage of the design process. Observations, interviews and co-creation sessions were for example methods applied. Observations in laboratories showed that user-friendliness cannot be achieved by designing only a biocontroller, but that the entire set-up should be designed as one system, including bioreactor and wiring. It was found that user-friendliness demands elimination of as many cables and tubes as possible. By involving the user throughout the project, an easy-to-use biocontroller was designed that eliminates every wiring. The BioFuse is a fusion of biocontroller and single-use bioreactor, both in functioning and appearance. The majority of the functionalities are positioned at the bottom of the bioreactor, in contrast to the ez-Control’s bioreactor where everything to control the fermentation process enters through the lid. For operation, the bioreactor is positioned on top of the biocontroller and locked with a twist. This twist secures the connection of nearly all functionalities, thereby eliminating almost every cable and tube. User tests with a prototype of the BioFuse lead to the conclusion that the user-centred design project has resulted in a biocontroller with significantly improved usability.","User-centred design; biocontroller; bioreactor; usability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2022-04-20","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Steele-Dunne, S.C. (mentor)","2017","This thesis focuses on identifying flood-prone locations, flood vulnerability and analyzing risk for the Municipality of Rotterdam. Municipal call center data of flooding complaints from 2012-2016 are investigated to identify the most flood-prone locations, which are called hot spots. This is performed by creating heat maps of the flooding record locations. The most dominant hot spots for multiple analyses are all situated in the sub districts of ‘Rotterdam Centrum’, ‘Delfshaven’ and ‘Noord’. Most flooding records are related to gully pots (≈55%), followed by sewer related problems (≈20%). Flood vulnerability is investigated by analyzing the influence of amount of inhabitants and degree of imperviousness on the hot spot locations. Both factors are involved in the origin of the hot spots. Investigating the influence of rainfall on flooding incidents pointed out an exponential relationship. From comparing differences in resulting flooding records for heavy/extreme rainfall events and cloudbursts, it can be concluded that Rotterdam’s drainage system is better capable at handling short heavy bursts of rainfall than consecutive hours of rainfall. The influence of seasonality on flooding incidents has also been investigated. There do appear to be seasonal patterns, which can be linked to blockages of gully pots by leave fall. In the risk & asset management analysis, asset maps related to infrastructure are created. They are used to calculate risk levels, based on the company values matrix of the Water Management department of Municipality of Rotterdam. The lower elevation of Rotterdam’s city center and surrounding downward slopes, which have been identified from the created elevation map, might contribute to the increased flood vulnerability and hot spots in the city center area.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resource Management","",""

The experiment consisted of a primary Tunnel-in-the-Sky tracking task, where the pilots had to fly with one non-haptic and two haptic settings. Primary task performance was measured by means of position errors and roll and pitch rates. A secondary task was presented to the pilots as bucket shaped figures superimposed on the outside visuals, where the participants had to indicate the direction of the divergent figure. Secondary task performance was measured by success rate, average time to answer correctly and - by means of eye-tracker measurements - head-up time and number of gaze switches. Next to these objective measures pilots provided a subjective measure of their mental effort after each run. Lastly, the haptic and human induced forces were recorded, to be able to measure whether the pilot was fighting or cooperating with the haptic feedback provided. Results of the experiment show that haptic feedback can significantly increase task-sharing performance of the pilot, especially for a challenging primary task, but that too dominant haptic feedback can introduce a risk of over-reliance.","experiment; haptics; haptic; guidance; task-sharing; human-machine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-03-01","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","","",""

This is caused by a lack of physical activity and unhealthy food diets. Children playing outdoors is positively and significantly associated with the child’s physical activity. Peerdrops is a small Dutch company that creates product, graphic and experience designs. Next to working for clients, Peerdrops also develops its own products. One idea of such a product is the game Buiten Baas. This graduation project focusses on developing the product idea of Buiten Baas by Peerdrops, into a finished product. Buiten Baas is a game that encourages children between the age of seven and twelve years old, to play more outdoors and therefore empowers the children’s physical activity. This by playing a fun game! The overall product idea of Buiten Baas is a dice shaped game with on each face six medals. On each medal a (physical) challenge is written, which should be performed by the player in turn. Sometimes the player should perform this challenge alone, against one other player or with the entire group. The challenges are divided in six different categories: speed, agility, endurance, create, guess and chance. The player who first collects one medal of each category (except chance), wins the game. The final design of Buiten Baas is a dice of 140 x 140 x 140 mm. All faces of the dice have an indent, preventing the medals from sticking out and influencing the way the dice will roll. The material of the dice is EVA foam, because this material is soft and flexible to throw with. Moreover, it is resistant to outdoors use and it is often used for children’s products. The material cannot be easily damaged and it has a very neatly finishing. Injection molding is chosen as the most suitable production technique for the dice and the design is made suitable for this production technique. The medals of the game are made of PP. This material is very child friendly and not toxic. The medals will have a diameter of 38 mm and a thickness of 3 mm. The medals are injection molded to create an aesthetically pleasing product, which is worth paying for. The medals are imprinted with the challenges and the logo of the game. For Buiten Baas it is suggested to have a batch size of at least 10000 pieces, which will have a cost price of around €6 per game. This results in a selling price of around €30, if Peerdrops would sell the product to a reseller, who would sell it to the customers.","outdoors; game; children; physical; activity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2017","Corrective osteotomy is the treatment for malunion of bone segments, which is required after insufficient fracture management. To perform this procedure adequately, 3D imaging is used to make a virtual plan of the osteotomy. In order to transfer this virtual plan to the patient in the operating room, a navigation method is required. Existing navigation techniques are able to transfer a virtually planned osteotomy with an accuracy of about one millimetre. Although the existing techniques are accurate, the gross of them require large incisions. In this thesis, a novel navigation technique is developed which transfers a virtually planned osteotomy to the patient in a minimally invasive way. Four concepts are proposed based on existing literature, which are graded using a multi-criteria analysis. The best performing concept is a small robotic system with a rigid connection to the patient, called the ‘Osteobot’. A prototype is developed and successfully controlled using a kinematic model. After the development phase, the navigator is tested in two experiments under different conditions. The outcomes of the first experiment show a resulting translation and rotation error of less than 1 mm and 1⁰, respectively. The motors of the current prototype do not have enough power to limit the workspace of the oscillating saw, which results in a less accurate osteotomy in the second experiment. Nevertheless, the Osteobot looks very promising to be able to perform a non-invasive osteotomy. Taking into account the little time for prototyping during this project, these preliminary results look very encouraging. As confirmed by surgeons, the Osteobot could well become a powerful solution to perform accurate and minimally invasive osteotomy surgery.","Osteotomy; Bone Cut; Robotic; Navigation; Transfer; Guidance; Computer-assisted Planning; Virtual Planning; Minimally Invasive; Orthopaedic Surgery; 3 DoF; Stewart Platform; Malunion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","Systems and Control","SC52030",""

Cities will keep growing, they will become increasingly polluted and gridlocked, damaging inhabitants’ health and making it hard for them to get around. Mobility is one of the key-drivers for creating a livable future city because the urban lay-out is determined by the infrastructural network. This project focuses on mobility attitudes and behaviour in the context of new and emerging urban transport opportunities, such as those related to smartphone travel applications, bike and car sharing, electric vehicles, and increasing support for public transport, walking and cycling. In addition, we technically arrived at a place where the urban mobility might soon undergo fundamental changes. Around the globe researchers are working on technical innovations like new drive technologies and collision recognition systems, while others explore autonomous driving systems. From a purely technical standpoint, the first driverless vehicles could take to the roads today, but technology is much faster than ethics, law, and policy. These technologies are not publicly accessible yet, which results in a lack of understanding and acceptance of the main public. The conclusion of the research led to two main design goals: 1.

(mentor); De Ridder, H. (mentor); Van Lanschot, F. (mentor)","2017","Surgical removal remains the preferred treatment for tumors. In order to ensure complete removal, a margin of surrounding healthy tissue is removed together with it. Research has found a relationship between the width of this resection margin and tumor recurrence; patient outcome is improved with greater margins. In order to ensure that no tumor tissue is left in the wound bed, the Erasmus MC has adopted a new protocol that involves intra-operative assessment of the margin of the resection specimen by a pathologist and surgeon. When part of a margin is suspected to be inadequate, the surgeon will remove more tissue from that location in the wound bed. However, communicating the location of an inadequate margin is difficult, as resections may have complex shapes and shrink. The Erasmus MC’s pairwise parallel tagging method involves placing tag pairs in both the resection specimen and the wound bed, so that an inadequate margin in the specimen can be traced back to its original location in the patient. As this method’s first implementation involves the time consuming step of suturing tags onto tissue by hand, a product is needed to streamline the tagging process. The design of this product system, consisting of the tags, the applicator and remover, started with an analysis of the current situation, and formulating the design goals and criteria. A concept was developed and materialized, and several prototypes were built. Other than the time required to apply the tags, the main concerns of the surgeons were found to be accuracy, reliability and ease of use; these are all addressed in the design. Its small head and long shaft facilitate application in the oral cavity, during oral cavity tumor surgeries. The tags have tiny metal staples that anchor themselves into tissue by folding inwards; this anchoring method is quicker and more reliable than sutured tags. The applicator features two sets of jaws, in order to apply tags in pairs; this improves accuracy and application time. A tag remover allows extraction of the tags when the surgery is finished.","medisign; tumor; surgical instrument; medical instrument; medical device; tumor removal; resection; tumor resection; medical design; surgical instrument design; tagging; tags; tag","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","MSc Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2017","For over a decade Darknet has been gaining tremendous popularity proportional to the growing concerns fostered by lack of anonymity and privacy on the World Wide Web. In the recent years, illegitimate use of the Darknet has resulted into investigation in the research community that is analogous to a domino effect further adding to popularity of this type of network. Unfortunately, higher percentages have been attributed to the illegitimate use of the Darknet rather than to the legitimate use. This is because researchers of the Darknet communities have relied on the knowledge obtained through the use of Breadth First Search crawling algorithm. Crawling makes up the main step in the exploration of these communities. Crawling is also an effective method to understand the topological and semantic structure of the Darknet communities. The algorithms chosen to crawl thus, decide the knowledge obtained from these communities. This thesis demonstrates how these crawling algorithms spread out over the Darknet communities and how this affects what and how much we know about them. The considerations presented eliminate the skew in the representation of Darknet communities. The knowledge explored through the behavior of BFS, DFS and RFS algorithms have been presented in this thesis.","crawling algorithms; Darknet; Tor network; LDA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-04-27","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Cybersecurity","",""

This paper presents a decision aiding approach with Simulation-Based Many Objective Optimisation to demonstrate that these burdens can be overcome and that the approach can be not only of added value for the content of the decision making, but also has a strategic role in the decision making process. The decision aiding approach can lead to (1) increased trust in the optimisation results, (2) more awareness about the preferences of other stakeholders, (3) faster convergence of the preferences of the decision makers and thus more progress in the decision making process and (4) increased support for the selected solution.

(mentor)","2017","Oil shales are sedimentary rocks containing organic matter in the form of Kerogen which accounts for more than 5 trillion barrels of oil in place according to Birol, 2010; therefore, oil shales represents a plausible solution for the constantly increasing demand for hydrocarbons. Oil shale production is currently done using two different techniques, surface retorting and in-situ retorting. The last one being the focus of this study. During this process, the sedimentary rock containing the kerogen is brought into a high-temperature environment with oxygen deficit. At this stage, the organic matter is subject to a thermo-chemical decomposition that finally releases the hydrocarbon in liquid and gas forms. This process is also known as pyrolysis. During this process, solid and fluid components experience compositional and physical changes, which requires complex chemical models represented by multiple species and several governing relations. In this work, we first developed a numerical solver for closed systems with simple kinetics models. This initial work allowed us to analyze the dynamic behavior of each component during the chemical decomposition of the kerogen and its impact in the porosity of the system. Then, we described an accurate base model for chemical decomposition of kerogen. This model was then implemented in our in house simulator ADGPRS. The model is based on the most recent understanding of pyrolysis process, and it incorporates coupling of chemical kinetics to heat and mass transport. Due to the high number of species, variations of porosity as consequence of the transformation of solid species into fluid products and complex multi-scale structure of porous media, the simulation performance of the high-fidelity model is limited. Therefore, in the second step of this work, we introduce a hierarchy of coarser models to improve the run-time of forward solution without significant reduction in accuracy. We applied coarsening in time, space, and chemical representation, and quantify errors introduced at each coarsening level. In conclusion, we provided recommendations for large-scale modeling of in-situ upgrading process.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

An attempt to answer this question is made by modelling different data sources into a Serious Game and testing the assumptions. After analysis of the gaming data, the questionnaires and the debriefing it can be concluded that in this experiment there was a correlation between better assessments and higher scores. However experts did not assess damage differently when presented with extra information, nor did they make significantly different decisions. From the qualitative section of the experiment the explanation was found that the extra information proved too much and experts were able to extrapolate with the marginal data that represents the current industry practise. This suggests that new information requires training, as our built environment gets richer in terms of data, the assessment of this built environment becomes too much for humans to cope with and solutions can be sought in the application smart algorithms, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.","User Generated Data; Crowdsourcing; Big Data; Smart Asset Management; Object Generated Data; Asset Maintenance; Road Infrastructures; Internet of things; Game-based simulation experiment; experiment; simulation; serious gaming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence the title: ‘Spreading Fairphone’s philosophy across consumer electronics’. The project is split into three phases: Analysis, Conceptualization, and Materialization. The analysis consists of a product exploration into the very wide domain of consumer electronics, on the market, trends and developments and the potential user. The results from these studies provided insights that helped determine potential products for Fairphone to develop. One of those product directions was the starting point for the conceptualization phase. A more specific design brief, accompanied by a design goal and an interaction vision served as guidelines for explorations, prototyping and interviews to derive concept directions. A process of iterative prototyping helped to design the final design proposal for Fairphone: The relive are modular headphones that can record binaural audio when shooting a video with your mobile phone. This adds a 3D sound effect to videos, allowing the viewer to experience the recorded moment more lifelike, as if he was there. This perfectly fits the current market, where new ways to immerse the consumer into different types of content are being explored (e.g. virtual reality, 360 degree video). The accompanying app allows users to effortlessly record and share binaural audio and video. The app contains a section with curated or popular videos that are not only experiential, but also informative in line with Fairphone’s mission or other sustainable initiatives.","headphones; Fairphone; ethical; modular; binaural","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Design for Interaction - Integrated Product Design","",""

An energy source which has been researched more intensely the past years is HT-ATES - High Temperature Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage - system. This technique makes it possible to remove the heat pump from conventional HT-ATES energy sources and utilize waste heat or heat from sustainable sources. This paper discusses the robustness a HT-ATES triplet system. A case study is being done to test the triplet system in the present and with different climate scenarios in 2050. The triplet system consists of three storages instead of two as in conventional aquifer thermal energy storage systems. This third storage serves as a temporary storage and minimizes heat loss. With this system, the heat pump can be removed, creating a completely durable thermal energy storage system. The different scenarios show the possible effects of global warming. The system is tested in various climate scenario to see if it is robust and what the effect of global warming is on such a system will be. The results show that global warming indeed has a big impact on the functioning of a triplet system. These problems can be tackled by evaluating the climate at the location of construction of a triplet system. With this evaluation, an optimal design of the triplet system can be made. The number of solar panels and dry coolers can be optimized. Also the storage temperature inside the storages can be optimized for the present climate.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

(mentor); Doubrovski, Z. (mentor)","2017","Mycelium-based materials are still fairly unknown to society, which offers a great testing ground for design research in order to explore the ways in which these materials can be introduced to society. This research project aims to explore what advantages and challenges additive manufacturing (AM) and mycelium-based materials might bring each other, in terms of technical and experiential performance. In this thesis the material is analyzed separately regarding the material, structure and process (MSP) (Lussenburg, 2014). For finding the right 3D printing technology for the material three additive manufacturing methods are analyzed: material extrusion, binder jetting and sheet lamination. All three technologies serve well as manufacturing process for mycelium-based materials. Through a phase of simulating the technologies by hand, some common advantages and limitations and some conflicting advantages and limitations. From these opportunities can be found. Each of these fields should be researched more, to understand what the impact is on the materials and what possibilities they might bring. Because of the scope of this project only one of these fields, will be analyzed more deeply, namely the field of local controllability. From which the following vision is created: ‘Mycelium-based materials allow designers to control the material’s properties through small changes in the ingredients of the material, while using a natural and environment friendly material. 3D printing provides the possibility to control these ingredients locally and/or gradually. The combination offers the possibility to create materials/products with different aesthetic and technical properties within one product. Moreover, it allows the designer to set the parameters for design, while nature (the mycelium) adapts to the environment and completes the form of the product.’ In the second phase of tinkering, which was 3D printing with a 3D printer, the 3D printing technology of material extrusion, was used to generate samples with different properties throughout the material samples. This was the technology that achieved the best results in the first phase of tinkering. However, for achieving different properties might not have been the best technology. After producing 15 samples with different ingredients, most were contaminated. Besides all the samples felt very hard and brittle, hence soft/hard contradiction should be made with another technology or material ingredients. Because all the samples were contaminated or did not grow, it is difficult to test the fungus/no fungus contradiction. The vision was also researched by doing in-depth interviews, with two 3D print experts and two mycelium experts. The showed that there is a possibility that this vision might come true, however a lot of research should be done for understanding possibilities in achieving different qualities.","Additive manufacturturing Product design; Mycelium-based materials; 3D printing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","design engineering","","","",""

The result of this project is a new sun visor combination for a DAF CF truck. A broad analysis that was performed was based on four pillars: Influence on Efficiency, Aesthetics, Materialization and Visibility & Sun Protection. This analysis resulted in various criteria, opportunities and insight in the deficiencies of the current DAF CF sun visor. An opportunity was found to satisfy the criteria of the four pillars with a combination of an external and interior part. Sun protection & Visibility is improved by an interior sun protection while the exterior sun visor improves Efficiency, Materialization and Aesthetics.","design; Sun visor; truck","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

But retailers face difficulties to make successful use of digital technologies in the store. Digital innovations in-store are frequently seen as unnecessary, unintuitive and uncomfortable by the consumers. Furthermore, the personalization strategies initiated with digital technologies are not using personal data in a humanized way. Therefore, the assets of the physical store and personal data are not fully utilized to build a consumer-brand relationship, which is an important function of the physical store in the omni-channel shopping journey. Based on these problems, the following research question was formulated; how to build a consumer-brand relationship in-store making use of personal data? The aim of the thesis was two-fold; to develop a design framework which can be used as guidance for designing a new brand touch point in-store successfully and to design a new in-store experience for Nike making use of this framework. For the set up of the design framework, personal data categories are related with the personality structure developed by Hollander (1967). The insights derived from this framework are combined with the Design for Emotion model developed by Desmet (2002). The final design framework functions as guidance in personalized emotion-driven design practices, which can be applied when designing digital brand touch points in order to build an emotional consumer-brand relationship on a personal level. The framework is successfully used for designing a new interaction for the Nike store.

These questions are concerned with an aspect of architecture everyone experiences and deals with on a daily basis but not everyone is aware of. This aspect is the effect of architecture. Furthermore, this is not just the effect but most likely also the objective. The question then rises; If by designing a building the impact on a neighbourhood can be so substantial, then why is it that there is a tendency to design the building from the inside out instead of the other way around?

(TU Delft Industrial Design Engineering)","van Kuijk, J.I. (mentor); Ozcan Vieira, E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Relevance - <br/> Autonomous cars can offer many benefits and potentially nullify the road accidents caused by human error (94%). One of the threats, however, is the mode transitions between the levels of automation. In a highly automated vehicle (level 4), the vehicle can drive completely autonomous, but only during a defined use case after which the user has to take over. This leads to sudden changes in workload which can be detrimental to driving safety. The current designs do not acknowledge these safety issues yet. Therefore the goal of this project is to design a system where the transitions to and from autonomous driving in a highly automated car are comfortable and safe. The project is executed in collaboration with the design agency VanBerlo.<br/><br/> Literature study - <br/> A literature study led to the identification of seven human-factors issues that affect the transitions between levels of vehicle automation, expected to emerge between 2020 and 2032: Vigilance decrements, complacency, manual skill decay, motion sickness, loss of situational awareness, predictability of the car and mode transitions<br/>For automated driving, being a new development, it seems recommendable that the design should focus on building trust with the system and creating a built-in co-pilot that supports the driver in the new, more complex cockpit.<br/>These different automation modes have been divided in assisted driving and autonomous driving with the difference being that in the latter one the system is responsible. In assisted driving, automated features like adaptive cruise control (ACC) and lane keeping can still be used making the system more complex. During autonomous driving, three measurable user states have been defined. Different studies show it takes 30-5 minutes from a sleeping state, 40 seconds from an inattentive state and 8 seconds from an attentive state to get back to the right driving performance level.<br/><br/> Field research - <br/> A test ride with a partial-automated vehicle (Tesla model S) shows minimal feedback from the automated features which leads to confusion. Also, trust was a reoccurring issue emphasised during this ride. Observing six students of a driving instructor during the lessons show unsolved issues in planning, traffic rules and communication. Calm, clear and structured feedback from the instructor was favoured. The driving instructor emphasises the importance of communication to other road users.<br/><br/> Design goal - <br/> The research concludes in the design goal: ‘Make the transitions between fully automated and assisted driving safer by increasing the situational awareness when needed, re-engaging driver vigilance, avoiding mode confusion and establish trust with the system.’<br/><br/> Design - <br/> During assisted driving the HUD shows in combination with augmented reality what the status is of ACC and lane keeping and visualises their functionality to prevent confusion. Levers behind the steering wheel are used to control these features. Holding both activates autonomous driving. The steering wheel provides haptic feedback to indicate the take over after which it retracts as a strong symbolic message of giving the steering wheel to the system.<br/>A framework is designed based on the literature research to facilitate the transition back to assisted driving where situational awareness and driver vigilance increase stepwise before a take over. Haptic feedback in the seat emphasises and pushes the user in the desired user state. If the desired user state is not met afterwards, auditive feedback is used to warn the user until the user state is met. These modalities are always combined with visual feedback to make the message clear. Holding both levers again initiated assisted driving. The steering wheel comes back as a symbolic message of taking the wheel and provides haptic feedback at the point of take over.<br/><br/> Evaluation - <br/> A qualitative study with an interactive prototype, potential users and experts on automated driving is done to evaluate the design. It shows that the feedback modalities of the design work to facilitate the transitions. It is expected, however, that the steering wheel is presented back to the user in an earlier stage to initiate the take over. It remains unclear how the augmented elements work to facilitate ACC and lane keeping. <br/>Next steps should be to evaluate the design further and design a system that communicates with other road users and add more functionality to the retracting steering wheel.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Unfortunately, consumers are often unaware of the existence of refurbished products or see them as inferior to new products. This project serves as a design case that shows how designers could increase the acceptance of refurbished products. Strollers are interesting for refurbishment, because they have a predetermined lifespan and a high residual value after their first life. Within this project, a concept of a stroller was designed that increases the acceptance of refurbished products and has emotional added value compared to a new product. Every refurbishment cycle, the pattern of the stroller concept is updated with routes the parents enjoyed to walk, which creates a unique stroller. By showing its history on the product, an emotional connection between the parents and the stroller is created. Eventually, the concept was evaluated with users and recommendations for both the concept and designing to increase the acceptance of refurbished products were made.","design; refurbishment; strollers; emotional added value","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovatie Management","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Houben, L.J.M. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor)","2017","To the North of the city of Concepción in the South-West of Chile, lies the town of Dichato. It is situated on the south-eastern side of Coliumo Bay. The Universidad de Concepción (UdeC) owns a marine concession in this bay, which includes a section of beach and sea for a Marine Biology Station (EBMD), belonging to the Faculty of Natural and Oceanographic Sciences. The objective of the EBMD is to provide research and educational support in the field of marine sciences. The EBMD concession consists of several onshore buildings with research and educational facilities, some of which are unfinished or damaged due to the Maule 2010 earthquake of magnitude Mw 8.8. Furthermore, there are remains of an old jetty for the docking of a Marine Biology vessel, which was also destroyed in 2010. Thus, UdeC is interested in redeveloping the EMBD, as there is no location for mooring of the vessel and transhipment of goods, as well as incomplete construction or use of several onshore facilities. To solve this problem, as well as to stimulate local authority interest in funding of the redevelopment of the EMBD, a design proposal is made. First the required functions, with as primary function mooring, and the in-situ conditions are investigated, leading to a Program of Requirements. Five design alternatives are established and weighed in a Multi- Criteria and Cost-Benefit Analysis, which leads to the conclusion that the Traditional option is most suitable, due to vast Chilean experience with the type of design and limited costs. From the Program of Requirements it is decided to focus on the offshore aspects of the design solution, in this case the jetty and the breakwater. The design of the jetty is carried out according to the Chilean design codes, and using the structural analysis and design program ETABS, which can incorporate seismic loading. The final design of the jetty includes a concrete deck on a steel frame, with steel piles embedded in the rock in a Marco Duplas (inclined) configuration to resist lateral loading. All elements are tested for structural soundness. The breakwater, on the other hand, is designed through a combination of wave modelling using statistical methods and DELFT3D; and a crest height and stone dimension analysis using BREAKWAT3.0. The upgrade of an existing unfinished building and the pavement are treated in lesser detail. For all elements of the EBMD upgrade, resilience is taken into account as a primary factor in extreme impact design, focussing on allowing structures to have a quick recover capacity, since it is not feasible to design coastal structures to resist impacts like large-scale earthquakes and tsunamis. The damage to the designed elements in the case of a repeat of the Maule 2010 earthquake and tsunami is analysed in an Extreme Impact Evaluation. A range of hazards, including several modes of structural failure of the jetty and breakwater, as well as relevant geohazards for the site, are classified according to level of risk. Mitigation measures are suggested as well. Finally, following a more detailed cost breakdown and a construction timeline, it is concluded that the proposed design solution is feasible within a construction time of 35 weeks and estimated costs of 450 mil CLP. The construction of the jetty and breakwater allows the EBMD to carry out its scientific and academic research safely and more efficiently, whilst also limiting damage and incorporating resilience in the event of large-scale earthquakes and tsunamis.","Chile; Concepcion; earthquake; tsunami; jetty; breakwater; ETABS; DELFT3D","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering / Structural Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","","-36.540455,-72.93272"

(mentor); Song, Y. (mentor)","2017","A recent development on the field of additive manufacturing is the ability to print conductive materials alongside non-conductive materials, predominantly plastics. With the addition of the possibility to insert external components during the manufacturing process, this allows for the integration of mechanical and electrical functionality into a single structure, manufactured in one manufacturing process. This has resulted in a manufacturing technique which is referred to as 3D printing electronics. The goal of this project is to explore the possibilities of 3D printed electronics for the practice of product design, and to provide support for its application. The project is divided in four main phases: Analysis, Synthesis, Implementation and Evaluation. The aim of the analysis phase was to gain understanding of the current state of the technology, and to identify opportunities and challenges. The synthesis and implementation phase are structured around a on a case study. The synthesis phase featured a number of iterative design cycles, where in-depth knowledge about the possibilities and limitations of the technology has been gained. The implementation phase focusses on the implementation of 3D-printed electronics in the context of a functional product, providing a more hands-on and detailed view of the consequences and possibilities of the application of 3D printed electronics for product design. During the course of the project, a number of opportunities has been identified, most notably: • • An increase in design freedom for product designers • • Promotion of miniaturization of design • • Acceleration of the design process • • Improved sustainability in product design and manufacturing The selected topic for the case study is wireless power transfer. The main reasons for the selection of this topic in combination with 3D printed electronics were the potential to increase the design freedom for (batter powered) products and added value to the user in term of e.g. ease of use and the fact that it provides the opportunity to thoroughly test the technical capabilities of the technology for three-dimensional trace construction. During the case study is was demonstrated that using the Voxel8 printer that is available for this project, it is possible to create planar Qi-compliant charging coils. Furthermore, an electric toothbrush was redesigned. This redesign has demonstrated that it is possible to integrate three-dimensional inductive charging coils within curved product housings. Although the technical functionality of the designed wireless charging coils is not optimal, the integration of the coils has demonstrated the technology’s potential in terms of providing design freedom for the design of (battery powered) products. Also, the application of 3D printed electronics and the resulting integrated charging coils have enabled an improvement for the user interaction in terms of ease of use in storing and charging. However, five main challenges have been identified that should be dealt with to allow the technology to realise its full potential. Firstly, the design process for 3D printed electronics requires dedicated design tools and software support, which is not available at the moment. The needs regarding both the mechanical as well as the electrical design aspects should be addressed, and design guidelines should be migrated or translated and implemented at an early stage in the design process. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that Multiphysics tools such as COMSOL Multiphysics® can be introduced as a valuable design tool. Second, the slicing procedure of three-dimensional conductive traces is insufficiently developed, as examples of trace segments that cease to connect with each other are plentiful. Although the stacking of multiple trace layers proved to be an effective measure, it could be regarded as a suboptimal solution due to the increased feature size and conductive ink cost price. Third, the resistance of conductive materials that are available for 3D printed electronics is an important limiting factor to the application of the technology. Fourth, although a number of successful applications have been demonstrated during this project, the spatial resolution is a limiting factor to the application of 3D electronics printing. It is inferior to conventional PCB manufacturing techniques, and the case study has exposed that for 3D printed wireless power transfer coils the spatial resolution is directly linked with the performance of a design. Fifth, reliability of the printing process has proved to be a significant problem for manufacturing 3D printed electronics using the Voxel8 printer. These reliability issues involved inaccurate deposition of both substrate as well as conductive material. These five predominantly technical aspects form significant obstacles to the progression towards a wholesome manufacturing solution, and should be dealt with in order to realize the technology’s full potential.","Printed Electronics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

With the power of physics and a sharp understanding of IT by their side, they started working on a set of speakers that sound amazing in any situation. From this technical perspective they developed speaker both for the living room and for professional goals. Dutch & Dutch speakers cancel out sound waves that go to the rear of the speakers, making the speakers cardioid. This reduces refractions from walls behind the speakers, which improves the clarity of the signal that reaches the listener.This project investigates the positioning options for the cardioid technology on the professional market. As the sound is cancelled out in the rear of the speakers, a promising direction is to reduce noise nuisance that are the result of an event. This hypothesis was investigated via qualitative research; interviews with event organisations, sound engineers, acoustical experts and people who experience noise nuisance were interviewed. Unfortunately, cardioid technology on its own is not up to the complicated task, that requires a combination of constant monitoring and good relations between event and neighborhood. Even then, the market for speaker systems on events is really demanding, and not the right option for a market introduction. Opposed to the touring and live events market, there is the installation market. Once a speaker is installed here, it just has to work the same way. This is a better start for a market introduction for a startup. After an analysis of the possibilities, a focus on the club market was chosen. On the installation market, manufacturers follow two different strategies: 1. They hide their speakers in the shadows. The speakers are often of high quality, both in sound as in handling, but are also rather dull. These brands are very trustworthy, and deliver equipment for the absolute professionals. 2. They use aggressive shapes and colors, that throw the appearance of the speaker in your face. These speakers scream at you that they are going to produce a whole lot of sound. These kind of speakers are often really heavy, and also really trustworthy, Between these two strategies, there is room for a different positioning for Dutch & Dutch: they can be the elegant, beautiful other option. They are unobtrusive, but instead become a part of the interior. They do get the recognition that the aggressive speaker brands get, but in a more sophisticated and calm way. Currently, interior designers and audio system engineers have to work around each other in terms of designing. With the Dutch & Dutch speakers, it should be possible to integrate both worlds, resulting in a better end result. The project further explains the positioning and branding of Dutch & Dutch in more detail, with clear options for conveying the brand message. Important for the brand is the connection with the audience. This is not only good for the brand Dutch & Dutch, but should also work in the advantage of the clubs that Dutch & Dutch works with. In the end, the goal is to develop a long lasting relationship with both clubs and the club audience.","branding; positioning; audio; portfolio","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","SPD","",""

(mentor)","2017","In optimization, many variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem exists with all sorts of restrictions and characteristics. Heuristics that find near-optimal solutions are known and tested on in the literature, such as heuristics that escape local minima with the use of large neighborhoods. An example is Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search, which can be used to find near-optimal solutions for rich Vehicle Routing Problems. In order to understand the differences between this heuristic and other heuristics that use large neighborhoods, an overview of the most related minima-escaping heuristics is provided in this thesis. Unfortunately, studies that involve real-world data are limited. Therefore, this thesis involves a study on how to configure the components of Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search, such that it can be used on real-world data. This study is carried out at ORTEC, a company that provides optimization software and analytical solutions to all sorts of companies, and customer cases are used for testing. Most of the time, an initial solution is required as input for the minima-escaping heuristics and the importance of the quality of this solution is not specified. Therefore, the influence of the construction method for an initial feasible solution on the performance of Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search will be investigated as well. It turns out that this influence is case and configuration specific. To intensify the search and explore smaller neighborhoods as well, local search methods are added to Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search, which will improve the solutions that are found. The research concludes with an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search that is tuned for the real-world cases that are investigated at ORTEC. Because the computing time that is available for real-world cases is usually limited, a simplified version of the heuristic will be provided as well.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-04-13","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","Computational Science and Engineering","",""

The main research question to be answered is ‘What are the equity and efficiency impacts of introducing transit signal priority on a city bus network?’ The method used to answer the research question is divided into a number of steps. First commonly used transport appraisal methods are outlined as are their shortfalls in how they deal with the issue of equality. Next the term equality is discussed which leads on to the components necessary for an equitable transport appraisal method, which is then defined. Third, the technical requirements for TSP are found. The next step tests this new method by identifying two contrasting zones (socially advantaged and socially disadvantaged) in the chosen study area, County Dublin, Ireland, by mapping socio-economic Census 2011 data using ArcGIS. The purpose of the contrasting zones is to test the equity based transport appraisal method. From that, TSP is modelled on the two identified routes using the National Transport Authority of Ireland’s ‘Greater Dublin Area Transport Model’. Next the change in travel times and modal split is evaluated using the equitable transport appraisal method and a more common financial based transport appraisal method, again for comparison purposes. The results of this study are in two parts. The first set of results are from implementing TSP on two contrasting socio-economic zones. The North Clondalkin corridor links a socially disadvantaged zone to employment and the Stillorgan corridor links a socially advantaged zone to the same employment location. The results show an approximate 10 minute reduction in travel time by bus on the North Clondalkin corridor and an approximate 7 minute reduction in travel time on the Stillorgan corridor. Both the car travel times and the cycle travel times see no significant change (less than 1 minute). The second sets of results are the equitable and financial results of the two transport appraisal methods. The proposed equitable transport appraisal method shows that there is a 57% change in equality from the North Clondalkin zone and a 36% change in equality from the Stillorgan zone. Both see an increase in the level of equality within the zones and balances the level of equality between the zones when TSP is implemented. The CBA reveals a net present value benefit of €285,000.00, generating a cost benefit ratio of 1,8. The use of the equitable appraisal method has the ability to see the effects a transport proposal has at a disaggregate level rather than the aggregate level of a CBA. Only focusing on the aggregated level has the potential to hide equity fluctuations between areas and therefore increase the level of inequality. However this issue is tackled in this paper with the use of the outlined equitable appraisal method which can be used in conjunction with a CBA.","Transport; transport planning; equity; bus priority; Transit Signal Prioirty; Gini Index; Lorenz Curve","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Applications for space telescopes require ever higher resolutions. This is driving space telescopes to keep getting bigger as they need a large primary mirror to achieve these resolutions. Such large instruments are also heavy and cost a lot of money to launch. Current launchers offer a limited amount of space making it impossible to launch a telescope with a monolithic mirror larger than five meters in diameter. Over the last few decades, the interest in utilizing segmented deployable mirrors in order to achieve larger effective apertures has steadily increased. The Space Systems Engineering department of the faculty of Aerospace Engineering at the TU Delft started working on a deployable synthetic aperture telescope in 2014 and is now continuing the research in cooperation with ESA, TNO and ADS. The optical design of the Deployable Telescope System (DTS) is already in an advanced stage. However, much work remains to be done. One of the main challenges is designing a highly accurate and stable deployment mechanism for the primary mirror elements of this instrument. Position and orientation tolerances for the primary mirror elements have been determined in a previously performed top down systems engineering approach. The most critical requirements are on the piston and tilt of the mirrors. The required piston and tilt accuracies of each mirror element are 2[μm] and 2[μrad] respectively. The key to achieving accurate deployment is to separate the deployment motion into a course deployment of the mirror segments, followed by a separate fine calibration stage that allows for accurate tip, tilt and piston control. From the literature study that precedes this thesis proposal, it was concluded that it is a challenging task to design a deployment mechanism for the deployable telescope that can offer sufficient accuracy. The goal is to design the mechanism such that it is reliable, lightweight and suitable to the current optical design. The design should allow for the mirror segments to be folded close to the telescope body so that the stowed instrument fits within a minimal envelope. This thesis covers the design process for the deployment mechanism for the primary mirror elements of the telescope. Successfully designing a deployment mechanism with all these qualities will be a big step forward in realizing the DTS. Due to the deployable design, this telescope can be an order of magnitude less heavy and requires a lot less space inside a launcher when compared to current telescopes. The concept will also allow for the development of telescope mirrors much larger than five meters in diameter.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","Aerospace Engineering","Space Systems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Sakes, A. (mentor)","2017","Background: Ductoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure, using a sub millimeter fiber optical camera, to explore the mammary ductal epithelium for Pathological Nipple Discharge (serous fluid discharged from the milk duct) and breast cancer, detecting lesions up to eight years before other modalities. Although ductoscopy can revolutionize breast disease screening, an improved method to take a biopsy during the procedure is needed. The goal of this study was, therefore, to develop a new biopsy method for the removal of a small tissue sample during ductoscopy for the pathological examination and a definite diagnosis. Method: In order to develop the novel biopsy instrument the clinical situation and cutting forces were analyzed. The novel biopsy instrument, contains ∅1:0x0:1 mm and ∅1:2x0:1 mm needles including a knife design at the tip. The needles are actuated by the handle design, able to create a single- and a counter rotating motion. Subsequently the fully functioning prototype has been evaluated on its mechanical functionality and biopsy capabilities. In these experiments three different tip geometries: The Straight-, Beveled- and Reverse beveled-knife, were evaluated based on the resection time, displacement, operation force Biopsy points and sample volume. To mimic the ductal wall and tumorous tissue, gelatin with a Young’s modulus of 150 kPa was used. Results: Comparison of the two rotational configurations demonstrated a decrease in all tested variables (resection time, displacement and tissue cut angle), using the counter rotation configurations. The Beveled tip designs showed an inability to debulk the lesion, however the other two geometries, the Straight and Reversed beveled tip proved to be able to debulk the breast mimicking phantom. The resected volume was 1:0 mm3 sufficient for future pathological examination. Conclusion: The experiment has revealed the potential clinical application of the instrument to debulk lesions found in the mammary ductal epithelium. Even so, more knowledge on the biomechanical properties of the lesions and an in-vivo experiment is needed, to find an optimal knife design for the different clinical situations. In future the novel instrument could be combined with a ductoscope, improving the diagnosis of breast cancer patients in an early stage of the disease.","Biopsy needle; Biopsy instrument; medical instrument; miniature instrument; prototype; breast cancer; Pathological Nipple Discharge (PND); ductoscopy; endoscopy; proof op principle; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-04-12","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Medical Instruments & Bio-Inspired Technology","",""

(mentor)","2017","With heavy duty propulsion systems under development for upcoming Mars missions, such as the Space Launch System and the Interplanetary Spaceship, the stability of high-performance liquid-propellant rocket engines is of renewed interest. High-power-density rocket turbopumps forward pressurized fuel to the combustor at high rates. Turbopumps operate at extreme design conditions, where propellants may cavitate, and cause instabilities. Of particular interest is Rotating Cavitation, which is characterized by a non-axisymmetric cavity distribution that rotates super-synchronously with the pump impeller. Rotating Cavitation can cause severe structural vibration and fatigue fracture, which have, and may again lead to loss of the mission. Rotating Cavitation is traditionally suppressed through casing treatment. To comply with the high market pressure dictated by the private space sector, it needs to be suppressed through impeller design, before expensive production and testing initiates. Despite significant research, no general impeller design guidelines exist to avoid the onset of Rotating Cavitation. State-of-art predictive methods are either prohibitively time-consuming, or yield limited prognostic capacity. Predicting Rotating Cavitation requires time-accurate 3D numerical assessment, and an explicit understanding of the physics that drive its mechanism. It has recently been hypothesized, that Rotating Cavitation is caused by strong coupling of cavity dynamics between blade passages, which is governed by blockage. This hypothesis facilitates the blockage-based assessment of Rotating Cavitation, which is presented in this thesis. The goal of this project is to devise a new numerical capability to predict Rotating Cavitation during the design phase of turbopumps. This is achieved by reducing the computational cost of calculations. Mesh dimensions and the complexity of governing equations can be reduced by accounting for viscous- and cavity-blockage with models derived from first principles. Reduced-order blockage models are incorporated into inviscid, one-phase numerical simulations. The method is validated through comparison with high-fidelity simulations and experimental data from literature. The total-to-total pressure characteristics of a 2D cascade is captured within 0.26% error, and the flow displacement due to cavity formation on a hydrofoil within 5% error. Rotating Cavitation is captured in a 2D cascade, at an order of magnitude less computational cost than what high fidelity methods require. The thesis proves the hypothesis, that Rotating Cavitation is a purely blockage-driven phenomenon.","turbopump; flow instability; rotating cavitation; blockage model; body force method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-04-12","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); Broersma, S. (mentor)","2017","To date, buildings use 40% of the world’s energy and emit 20% of the world’s CO2. Therefore the EU developed the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, that requires all new buildings to be nearly zero-energy by the end of 2020. This is only possible when the buildings themselves produce renewable energy. This requires ample use of photovoltaics (PV). The aim of this thesis was to create a modular and flexible photovoltaic sunshading system for facades. In the last few years, building-integrated PV have become increasingly popular. With the new generation of thin film solar cells, PV panels have become more flexible, lighter, better performing and cheaper. This creates a huge opportunity for better building-integrated PV (BIPV). Combining solar panels with sunshading provides the opportunity to render facades multifunctional and to create an aesthetic addition to buildings. The flexibility and light weight of thin film was used to create a PV-integrated sunshade which is modular, durable and has a high user control and transparency. This flexible PV-integrated sunshade has been tested against current PV-integrated facade solutions; PV-integrated cladding, PV-integrated glass, and PV-integrated louvres. The results show that the initial costs of the flexible PV-integrated sunshades is lower than those of comparable PV-integrated louvres. However, this does not compensate enough for the lower efficiency of the thin film solar panels used in the design. Especially PV-integrated louvres have a considerably higher energy yield, because of the better angle towards the sun and the higher efficiency of the solar panels used. On the other hand, PV-integrated flexible sunshades perform better in usability, because of higher user control and transparency as compared to current BIPVs. However, to compete with the current BIPVs, the energy output should be comparable. The reason for the low energy yield of the amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin film used in the flexible PV-integrated sunshade is that its efficiency is too low. For the design of the flexible PV-integrated sunshade, therefore, it would be recommendable to use another technology. There are better performing thin film technologies available. Already, CdTe and CIGS have a much higher efficiency, which is expected to increase even further. For example, with CdTe an efficiency of 16% is possible as compared to 10% for a-Si panels. Using CdTe solar panels would almost double the energy yield; the payback time would be between 8 and 9 years. This makes them very compatible with the current PV-integrated louvres.","Solar panels; Thin film; sunshade; BIPVs; PV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-04-12","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering + Technology","","Building Technology","",""

The home which elderly lives in is a home for 365 days and they need to enjoy it in every moment of their 3rd life stage. When people get older they are not more able to be active as they were before, from all age groups elderly stays the most in their direct environment; therefore the lived their living has to be sufficient to their daily requirements. Old age is one of the most important stages of the life, which has it’s own indications so as if it gets recognized, would reduce their issues and problems providing a life-style with comfort and health. In this survey increasing the health of elderly besides providing them a suitable living environment is the main intention. Defining the indications of suitable living environment for elderly (specifically in Iran) concerning their mental and physical issues aiming to increase their prosperity is the question that this research would answer it. It has been researched how the future is going to looklike, And what are the life wishes of this certain demographic group. In developed countries, solutions concerning this issue are already conceived and also implemented. However in developing countries like Iran this issue is almost a new topic, which involves developing potentials. The most Iranian retirements live with other age groups in same type of apartments except a group, which yet have their own private house that usually is too big for an elderly couple. Public housing for elderly in Iran is maybe the least developed architectural typology. Inquiries have shown that the majority of older people wish to live near friends and relatives, even living with their children or grandchildren but only a very small number expressed any interest in old people’s homes. In this case we are going first find out why the retirement homes as a type of elderly settlements are sufficient as basic need of a shelter and feel of safety but the need of being respected and self-esteem and finally self-actualization is the most unsuccessful issues, which has an irreparable influence on elderly’s mentality. Therefor architects and urban designers are obligated to consider and implement spaces for this needy target group to have a safe environment in addition to keep the ownership and independency of their living conditions; maintaining to their requirements, also benefit from good social environment.","old age; home environment; health; elderly; requirements; Iran; life style; housing; prosperity; development; living conditions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The field of upper limb prosthetics focuses on the development of artificial replacement devices for upper limb loss, from partial finger loss to amputation of the entire arm at the shoulder. Hand and hook prostheses are designed to replace the functionality of a missing hand and can be powered either by external sources (e.g. electricity) or by the wearer’s body movements. Body-powered upper limb prostheses are as of yet preferred over electrical devices due to the possibility for extended physiological proprioception. In body-powered systems the user can generate force in only one direction, through pulling, so a choice must be made to either voluntarily open (VO) or voluntarily close (VC) the tongs. Both principles of operation have their own strengths and shortcomings in different situations and prosthesis users indicate that having both at their disposal would be preferred. Prehensors that offer both principles of operation are referred to as hybrid devices. A problem with current devices of both the VO and VC variety is that they do not offer the performance demanded by amputees which leads to rejection and abandonment of prostheses. A literature study indicates that a well-designed hybrid prosthetic prehensor might be able to offer amputees the performance they desire. However, of the eight known hybrid designs none perform well enough to become successful. The goal of this thesis is to find a new prehensor concept that incorporates both principles of operation and does so in a way that functions better than those already known. The eight known hybrid devices are analysed for the individual advantages and disadvantages of their designs. This produced a set of three properties desired in any future prosthetic prehensor in addition to it being hybrid: a passive VO pinch force, change of principle of operation through cable excursion only, and a VC mode that is available without having to resist the VO spring element. None of the existing devices share all these three. Eight new concepts for gripper mechanisms are generated. All combine both principles of operation but only two possess all three desired properties. Of these two the simpler and most feasible mechanism was developed further. In the chosen concept the two tongs are allowed to move past each other instead of connecting at the tip, making it possible to apply grip onto objects in two different ways. During the first half of cable excursion the tongs move closer together until they overlap at the halfway point. During the latter half the tongs move away from each other. A spring works towards the initial opened gripper position with a second spring only activated in the second half of the tong movement. This leads to different spring forces in the two modes. A first design of the concept is generated and a prototype is manufactured. A series of mechanical tests is performed with both the VO and VC modes of operation of the prototype in order to compare its performance with similar VO and VC hook devices. Its VO capabilities are slightly below the performance of the other examined prostheses. Its VC capabilities are comparable to the other examined devices. The functionality of the concept is assessed through the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP) and its score is compared with scores of body-powered hooks from literature. The SHAP tasks are performed in both VO and VC mode and the individual preferences are noted. Six out of 26 tasks could not be completed because of tong design. Users perform on average 4.4 ± 3.8 and 1.8 ± 2.3 points better when they could use their preferred mode on a task-by-task basis than when they were limited to only VO mode or VC mode, respectively. This is the first instance of a hybrid prehensor scoring significantly better than either mode alone. The device is also the only prehensor that combines the VO and VC principles of operation and possesses all three desired properties. Design improvements are recommended for the tong shape to improve grip and performance.","prosthesis; prehensor; terminal device; body-powered; voluntary opening; voluntary closing; VO; VC; hand prosthesis; gripper","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-12","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Biomechanical design, Biorobotics","",""

(mentor); Zandbergen, B. (mentor); Naeije, M. (mentor); Van Zeijl, H. (mentor)","2017","Active propulsion is required in order to further develop the capabilities of small satellites like CubeSats. At TU Delft a micropropulsion system is being developed based on a Vaporizing Liquid Microthruster (VLM), using liquid water as propellant. This research presents the manufacturing, characterization and testing of an existing VLM-design. It focuses on the thruster component of the propulsion system, which is called the MEMS-VLM. The breadboard model consists of an inlet module, multiple heating chamber modules and a nozzle, integrally manufactured using MEMS-technology. The heating chamber modules consist of flow channels etched in silicon, of which the walls support silicon carbide heaters. These heaters are suspended in the center of the cross-section. The nozzle is a two-dimensional convergent-divergent duct. Characterization and testing of the MEMS-VLMis done in a bottom-up approach. First, the geometry and electrical properties of the flow channels and heaters are characterized, after which the performance of the heating chamber and the nozzle are independently studied by models and experiments. In order to facilitate manufacturing, minor changes are implemented to the design of the nozzle, electrical interface and fluidic interface. With these changes, successful manufacturing of theMEMS-VLM is achieved. Microscope images show significant but acceptable deviations between design dimensions and manufacturing results. Furthermore, resistance measurements of the heaters indicate partial mechanical failures in 20 out of 154 measured heaters. The thermal behavior of the heating chamber is studied by means of analytical models for conduction and radiation and a one-dimensional steady state model for convection. The conduction study shows that the chamber wall temperature is homogeneous, while the suspended heaters formhot spots. The convection model is used to study whether sufficient heat transfer can be expected to fully vaporize the propellant flow. It is found that at a chamber wall temperature as little as 10 K above the boiling point, full vaporization can be expected. An experimental setup is made to test the heating chamber, ultimately attempting to validate the design and the performance models. The ability to power the heaters with constant current and measure the mass flow, pressure and dissipated power is demonstrated. Furthermore, amethod to determine the local chamber temperature based on the resistance of the heaters is presented. However, current leaks and partial mechanical failures are detected in the heaters during tests with nitrogen gas, which compromise the ability to operate with liquid water. Hence, full validation of the heating chamber models could not be achieved. With respect to future designs it is recommended to change to metallic heaters, which are placed outside the chamber. The silicon chamber wall then serves as a heat exchanger. It is furthermore recommended to change the capping wafer material to glass, so that the boiling process can be studied optically. A second experimental campaign is done to determine the performance of the nozzle, which is described by the discharge factor CD, the Isp-efficiency ´I sp and the thrust coefficient CF . Nozzle performance tests are carried out in vacuum, using gaseous nitrogen as propellant. The pressure is adapted in order to match the Reynolds number in the nozzle throat to the designed operating conditions. At a measurement Reynolds numbers of Rem ¼ 1400 the performance quality factors are found to be CD ¼ 0.68§0.06 (discharge factor), ´I sp ¼ 0.3§0.05 (Isp-efficiency) and CF ¼ 0.33§0.06 (thrust coefficient). The poor performance is primarily explained by excessive friction and rarefaction losses in the divergent section of the nozzle and are expected to improve when increasing the Reynolds number and when decreasing the expansion ratio. Design validation of the MEMS-VLM could not be achieved, as on various aspects the design is rejected. Nonetheless, the experimental approach has been successful in revealing critical design recommendations and demonstrating the ability to test a microthruster, improving the understanding and advancing the development of micropropulsion at TU Delft.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The introduction of metal into the aeronautical industry made the wings and aerostructures stiff and rigid. High-lift devices and movable surfaces allow for discrete deflections to increase lift coefficient and control of the aircraft. Several researchers have proposed concepts for variable camber, allowing continuous deflections. This is achieved by shape memory alloys, piezoelectric actuators, fishbone structures and pressure adaptive actuation. The concept of variable stiffness is not applied in aviation nowadays. This thesis is focused on applying variable camber and variable stiffness to a Cessna Citation X inboard flap, for which a full scale actuator is produced and tested. The loads are estimated on the inboard flap with the morphing part in neutral, 15 degrees downwards and 15 degrees upwards position. The maximum loads and moments are found in the descent flight condition, which equal 209.7 N and 15.24 N¢m in neutral position. Deflection downwards increases the force and moment to 631.6Nand 37.19N¢m, whereas in upwards position the force and moment equal -253.4Nand -12.68 N¢m. With the expected loads on the trailing edge of the flap, the actuator can be designed. The top bellows are designed 2.62 times larger than the bottom bellows, because of the expected loading ratio. The wedge angles are approximately 30 degrees, which are the maximum angles for deflection in positive and negative direction. The bellows and trailing edge are made from polycarbonate, where the bellows and the inner sheet of the trailing edge have a thickness of 4 mil (0.10 mm) and 6.7 mil (0.17 mm). The trailing edge is made from 30 mil (0.762 mm) polycarbonate sheet. The stringers are replaced by aluminumspars for the test setup. The main issue found in the testing phase, was the air tightness. Even though the bellows were not completely airtight, the bellows could be inflated by applying 10 psi (0.69 bar) air pressure. In the testing phase, the maximum deflections and deflection speeds have been measured. On average 13 degrees upwards deflection and 7 degrees downward deflection is reached. The actuation speed equals 150 deg/s and deflection rates range from 0.88 Hz to 3.33 Hz. The stiffness and damping have been determined as well. The stiffness increases with air pressure, for a 4 mil inner sheet thickness the stiffness increases from 3.46 N¢m/rad to 5.38 N¢m/rad, the 6.7 mil inner sheet increases more, from 3.96 N¢ m/rad to 9.03 N¢ m/rad. It is expected that the stiffness can be varied linearly between the neutral and inflated (10 psi) state. A thicker inner sheet gives a higher stiffness. The damping coefficients are only determined for the 4 mil inner sheet. The damping coefficients equal 0.119 in deflated, 0.143 in neutral and 0.226 in inflated condition. The natural frequency could be determined from the damping test as well. The natural frequency was approximately 2.99 Hz for the deflated and the neutral tests and 3.71 Hz for the inflated tests. The equivalent torsional stiffness corresponding to this natural frequency equals 1.21 N¢ m/rad, 1.24 N¢ m/rad and 1.88 N¢ m/rad for the deflated, neutral and inflated tests respectively. The stiffness and damping coefficients are used in a torsional spring damper differential equation, together with the mass moment of inertia for the trailing edge, which is calculated in CATIA™. The mass moment of inertia equals 0.422 g ¢m2 for the 4 mil and 0.434 g ¢m2 for the 6.7 mil inner sheet. Another analytic model is created as well, determining the deflection from the final shape of the inflated bellows. Since the actuator is still in an early development phase, it is expected that the actuator and analytic models can be improved withmore research and better production techniques.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

The problem is considered urgent due to the threat of an extreme event such as a hurricane or La Niña rainfall in combination with a predicted growth in future flood risk due to sea level rise and heavy rainfalls due to climate change, subsidence and increased urbanization. The current proposed solutions do not offer protection against all the causes of the floods and are not effective in the face of climate change. Therefore, a new flood protection plan must be proposed. An integral solution is proposed for Cartagena at the conceptual level.

The impact of flexible modes on the linear controller is assessed as well as the robustness of the LQR controller to parameter variations. Using the nonlinear model a backstepping controller is developed and implemented. Lyapunov stability analysis is used to assess the robustness and performance of this controller to different types of exogenous disturbances and model perturbations. Specific inaccuracies in the position of the center of mass lead to significant performance deterioration. Therefore an estimator is developed. The estimator design is integrated with the controller, thus stability of the overall system is ensured. Finally, a comparison between the performance of the proposed linear and nonlinear controllers is performed.

(mentor)","2017","A recent trend in robotics is aimed at the cooperation between human and robot. This has led to an increased development of collaborative robot manipulators. Typical characteristics of collaborative robots are their user-friendly and lightweight design, innovative compliant mechanics, the implementation of various safety features and advanced control capabilities. These characteristics enable humans to work alongside the manipulator or interact with it. The implementation of passive compliant components such as springs and pneumatics have a beneficial effect on the level of safety for the operator. However, the added complexity often has a negative influence on the degree to which an accurate description of the system dynamics can be derived. Furthermore, the lightweight design and increasing payload-to-weight ratio amplify the effect of exogenous alterations to the system, such as attaching an object to the end effector. The work in this thesis is aimed at obtaining an accurate description of the system dynamics for control purposes. In doing so, special attention is given to dealing with instantaneous time-varying phenomena. An online semi-parametric approach is used to produce a valid description of the inverse dynamics of the considered system. The method consists of a non-parametric part which is described using Gaussian process regression (GPR) and a parametric part for which the parameters are identified using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). In this thesis, instantaneous system changes are introduced by attaching an unknown object to the end effector of the manipulator. The EKF implementation is specifically aimed at rapidly compensating for the response induced by this object. The GPR is used to compensate for remaining modeling errors. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated in simulation. The semi-parametric description achieves high modeling accuracy, fast adaptation to instantaneous system changes and reasonable generalization capabilities. Implementing the proposed solution in real-time applications requires additional research on the subject of online GPR.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Nanotopography has the ability to induce osteogenic differentiation of human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSCs) without the addition of chemical supplements. Understanding of the early mechanisms that interact at the membrane-topography interface and subsequently induce the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs as a result of nanotopography is key to facilitating a rational design of e.g. multi-functional implant surfaces. Nevertheless, these early mechanisms are yet to be elucidated and systematic approaches in the variation of pattern dimensions and arrangements that are essential in their discovery, are deficient in literature. Electron Beam Induced Deposition (EBID) is a bottom-up, direct writing technique capable of producing high-resolution nanoscale structures and is proposed in this thesis as a fitting technique for facilitating a systematic approach in the variation of pattern dimensions and arrangements. In this thesis, EBID’s potential has been demonstrated by producing osteogenic patterns from literature with a higher degree of control in feature dimension and position, as well as a series of additional patterns and complex structure shapes that further demonstrate the high positioning accuracy of EBID. Furthermore, mechanisms that potentially act at early membrane-topography interactions are explored in this thesis. One mechanism that could potentially play a role in these early interactions is the proposed ability of membrane curvature to mediate lipid and protein composition and subsequently induce curvature-induced diffusion barriers in the membrane. By forming non-phase separating- and phase-separating Supported Lipid Bilayers (SLB) onto ring-like structures we have demonstrated the potential of curvature to bring about diffusion barriers in lipid bilayers through the induction of lipid phase separation at sites of curvature. In addition, this effect was further amplified upon the introduction of a curvature-sensing protein: Cholera-Toxin subunit B. Combined, the high-resolution patterning properties of Electron Beam Induced Deposition and the ability of Supported Lipid Bilayers to study the effect of shapes on lipid- and protein composition within the membrane in a bottom-up approach propose a platform suitable for scrutinizing the mechanisms that act at the membrane-topography interface.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-11","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering (BME)","","Biomaterials & Tissue Biomechanics","",""

This study was performed to provide the means for architects and façade designers to design better usable OFE’s and improve personal control over indoor air quality and thermal environment in the future. Therefore, aspects affecting the usability of OFE’s was investigated, followed by determination of requirements, the design of an OFE meeting these requirements and the development of a Design Guide. This was done by combining a literature survey, database analysis and context mapping study. The literature studied contained on the one hand very specific information about the use and physical aspects of operable windows and on the other hand more general information on operable windows was part of the greater whole. The database analyses presented that objections of roommates, draught and noise from outside the building revealing the most important reasons for not always being able to open a window when needed. Besides, open answers gave additional practical insight and it was found that the increase in roommates decreased the positive response to always being able to open the window when desired. Thus, mainly explicit and observable knowledge where provided by the literature survey and BBA database analysis. The context mapping study learned that direct communication with users helps to understand their tacit and latent needs, which helped to provide the means to improve OFE designs in the future. The eleven requirements for better usable OFE's are: User-friendly, Clear design intent, Effective, Supply is fresh air of sufficient quality, Fine-tuning capability/adjustable, Low noise ingress, (Mental) connection with outside, Proximal/ highly controllable by occupants, Robust, Parallel use of windowsill and window and Align design and management & security policy.

The development of the concept was based on several identified problems of the Indonesian construction sector. The project concluded with a first design of the CAST formwork system, in this project referred to as CAST FS I. Although CAST FS I provided a useful tool to communicate the potential of the CAST formwork system concept, it was only suitable to create small scale prototypes. Due to the limitations of the CAST FS I design, the concept had not been tested on a full scale and therefore no proof had been provided that the concept will actually work. This thesis describes the development of CAST FS II. CAST FS II is a new design of the CAST formwork system that was created to make the development of a full scale prototype possible. The full scale prototype and CAST FS II design were used to test the technical feasibility, ease of use and safety of the CAST formwork system. The design of CAST FS II was created with an iterative design approach. The full scale CAST FS II prototype showed promising results on the levels of technical feasibility and safety. The results of the ease of use testing, however, showed that the design of CAST FS II was still too complex. This thesis concludes with a final redesign of the CAST formwork system: CAST FS III. The design of CAST FS III was based on the test results and focusses on improving ease of use.","Formwork system; Building system; Construction method; Concrete; Casting; CNC milling; Kampung; Indonesia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Reducing the hydrodynamic drag of marine vessels is a key approach to decrease energy consumption. In addition to saving fuel costs, this also decreases greenhouse gas emissions. One possible method to reduce turbulent drag for a ship is coating its hull with riblets. Riblets are micro-fabricated structures whose design is based on shark skin. Earlier riblet studies have reported maximum drag reduction of 10%. The goal of the present work is to accurately measure the drag of 3 different riblet coatings in the cavitation tunnel. This setup, located at the Ship Hydromechanics group of the TU Delft generates a turbulent boundary layer for freestream velocities between 0.3 and 3.5 [m s ]. Two steps were taken to achieve this goal. Firstly an accurate measurement procedure was developed, which allows 1% accurate drag reduction studies in the cavitation tunnel. This procedure is then sub-sequently used to study the 3 different riblet coatings. These were provided by Fraunhofer IFAM and Océ, who used a mould pressing and elevated printing technology respectively. Cavitation tunnel measurements were analysed using the propagation of uncertainty and Particle Imaging Velocimetry[PIV]. The former determines the contribution of individual measuring sensors to the uncertainty of the measured drag reduction. It was found that the velocity and drag force require the longest measuring time to guarantee statistically converged results. PIV studies were used to determine the correct magnitude of the freestream velocity, as the pressure sensor of the cavitation tunnel systematically overestimated the freestream velocity. Measurements for the supplied coatings showed drag reduction for all plates. For Fraunhofer IFAM maximum drag reduction amounted to 7%, while for Océ this value is 5%. Comparing with values from literature shows slight under performance. This is presumably caused by small manufacturing effects on the riblet surface. To improve current work, the velocity region where accurately can be measured must be enlarged. This is because the expected optimal performance for the Océ and Fraunhofer IFAM coatings are located before and beyond this region respectively. For the low limit velocities, small ranged force and velocity sensors should provide more accurate results. For high velocities entrained air must be removed from the setup. This can be done using a vacuum pump, although more analyses on this system is required as the measured drag is affected by this device.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

(mentor); van Paassen, M.M. (mentor); Pool, D.M. (mentor)","2017","The time-varying adaptation ability of human operators in basic manual-control tasks is barely understood. Most identification methods do not explicitly take into account any time variations. An identification procedure based on both batch and recursive autoregressive exogenous (ARX) models is presented for capturing the operator's controlled-element adaptation in compensatory tracking tasks. The operator's time delay was assumed to be constant and estimated beforehand. Conditions with constant controlled-element dynamics, matching recent experimental work, and gradual and sudden transitions in the controlled-element dynamics were considered. This study introduces a procedure to fine-tune forgetting strategies for these different conditions and for different remnant intensities. Both the use of a constant scalar forgetting factor λ and a constant forgetting matrix Λ, containing separate forgetting factors for each ARX-model parameter, was analyzed. Batch ARX-model identifications applied on conditions with constant dynamics, indicate that a high bias results when the operator's remnant is not coupled to the linear operator dynamics. By means of Monte Carlo simulations, an optimal forgetting factor is found for all conditions. For the human-operator model considered, the use of a forgetting matrix did not result in an improvement over the use of a scalar forgetting factor. An evaluation of real experimental manual-control data shows that the method has potential to capture the operator's adaptive control characteristics.","ARX model; forgetting factor; human operator; manual control; recursive least squares; time-varying system identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-10","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","","",""

(mentor); Winkler, S. (mentor); Kraft, B. (mentor)","2017","Reaction Wheels (RWs), the primary attitude actuators on most spacecraft, are one of the largest on-board disturbance sources due to nondeterministic bearing behaviour at low angular velocities of the RWs. The configuration design of redundant Reaction Wheels Arrays (RWAs) can be divided into configuration optimization and control allocation. The former of these two coupled subproblems concerns the optimization of the RW axes alignments and RW torque/momentum capacities in order to achieve maximal combined control authority. The control allocation subproblem concerns the on-board distribution of attitude control signals onto the individual RWs, separately for both the torque and the momentum domain. The latter is also referred to as null space control. For redundant RWAs, the allocation is not unique and enables the optimization of secondary objectives such as power- and/or effort minimization while avoiding low angular RW velocities. In this thesis, a novel, deterministic, non-iterative null space control algorithm is presented which is based on the direct control allocation method for ∞-norm minimization presented by Markley et al. Using a cascaded approach, the algorithm is capable of reaching the ultimate AMS while autonomously operating the RWs within predefined momentum ranges whenever physically possible, performing rapid switching of RW rotation direction only when strictly necessary, yet allocating energy optimal, 2-norm minimized momenta for large parts of the AMS. Secondly, this thesis presents a global solution to the configuration optimization problem of RWAs with linear actuator models and a control effectiveness matrix that is time invariant and independent of the state. The resulting optimization problem is solvable effectively using a combination of steepest descend and PSO algorithms. The theory presented in this thesis is verified using an Airbus proprietary, high fidelity orbital simulation model, also used extensively in ongoing ESA satellite projects such as Sentinel, Swarm, Euclid and Jason. The presented RWA configuration optimization procedure, in conjunction with the on-board control allocation algorithm, is demonstrated to yield superior performance to conventional methods, paving the way to more agile, more autonomous spacecraft, operating with higher pointing accuracy without changing actuation hardware components.","null space control; reaction wheel array; control allocation; configuration optimization; momentum management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-10","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","Mechanical Engineering, Track: Control Engineering","","47.667886, 9.385859"

(mentor)","2017","Sometimes a complex combinatorial problem has easily identifiable subproblems for which methods are available. Often, strong interactions between these subproblems prevent us to use these methods in a straightforward way. In railway industry, finding a schedule for train service and shunting tasks is an example of such a problem with clearly identifiable, interacting subproblems: Trains with given length have to be parked on a track (BinPacking), a route to that track has to exist (Motion Planning), leaving trains need to be composed of multiple train units of arrived trains (SetCover) and service tasks have to be performed to trains (RCPSP). In practice, we often see that humans tend to split such a problem and solve it sequentially, e.g. they first solve the parking problem and then the routing problem. Often, solving such problems in a sequence enforces complex feedback loops. We present a method for decomposing the problem into subproblems such that algorithms for subproblems can be designed independently, without enforcing feedback loops. Subproblems will contain shared variables, for which they must cooperate to find a feasible assignment for the complete problem. Cooperation between subproblems is achieved by iteratively letting one of the subproblems propose a set of changes to a global assignment of variables, a single variable change is selected by letting all subproblems vote. Subproblems will be coordinated by a coordination algorithm to enforce progress.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Algorithmics group","","","",""

To improve access to the hip, exposure table-attachments can be used. However, these table attachments suffer some problems. Firstly, surgeons cannot optimally position the leg and execute manual prosthesis checks. For the patient, the table attachment can cause complications due to mechanical traction. To operate the table an extra person is needed. To solve these problems the ‘Float’ is designed. The Float enables orthopedic surgeons to position and hold the operative leg of hip-patients. The ‘Float’ uses an ankle brace to fixate the foot and shank of the patient. While the leg is fixated, a ‘ball socket nipping mechanism’ enables the surgeon to move the leg with three degrees of freedom. A fourth degree of freedom is reached by sliding the ‘Float’ over a plate. A suction cup can fixate the device in its current position. In addition, the ankle brace can be de-attached from the Float device to check the leg length and impingement. The third check; stability of the joint, can be executed when the ankle brace is attached to the Float device. In practical terms, the ‘Float’ can be easily moved in and out of the OR.","","","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2018-04-07","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Flipsen, F.S.J. (mentor)","2017","The circular economy framework is made up of many loops and principles. There are different business model archetypes and design principles that can help companies to transition towards the circular economy. For a company with the intention to do so, the question arises what combination of all these aspects is most favourable. In this report, this is explored in the context of Bugaboo. They are Dutch company that produces high quality strollers. Their ambition is to reduce their environmental impact as much as possible and consider a transition towards circularity as an opportunity to do so. They have elaborated ideas on how to shape this transition but are concerned whether their plans will realise the desired results. To find out if they will, four scenarios are created, detailed and evaluated. The first scenario is a linear take, make and dispose scenarios that has little to do with circularity. The second represents the current situation and the third represents the plans of Bugaboo. The fourth scenario closes all loops of the techno cycle. A life cycle analyses adjusted to circular product scenarios is performed to find out which of the scenarios has the lowest environmental impact per functional unit. All scenarios scored better than the linear scenario. But surprisingly, the more circular scenarios had a very similar result to that of the current situation. The analysis of the results revealed that this was caused by high amount of parts that had to be replaced in the refurbishing process. The reason that so many parts need to be replaced in refurbishment is the high quality standard that strollers need to have if they are sold by a company. For 2nd hand consumer to consumer sales the quality demands are much lower. So from an environmental perspective, 2nd hand use should be promoted and stimulated as much as possible. The lifetime of the strollers should be elongated as much as possible. This can be done be stimulating users to recondition the stroller themselves. One example on how to do so is detailed in a product design suggestion. It is a precut adhesive film that fits exactly to the aluminium surfaces of the stroller to cover up any scratches.","circular product scenarios","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Integrated Product Design","",""

As CO2 is the main constituent of the martian atmosphere, the pres- ence of mesospheric CO2 ice clouds has been suggested, and then confirmed by spectro-imaging observa- tions coming from satellite data. These clouds fascinate scientists because none of the current atmospheric models have been able to predict them. They also raise important questions about the martian mesosphere dynamics and properties. Since the early 2000s, a lot of instruments study these clouds in order to detect and map them. These observations are very important in order to be able to model better the atmospheric processes that take place on Mars as the CO2 cycle has a significant impact on its climate. Several studies already developed methods to detect them but now these have to be improved and analysed better to fully characterise the clouds. What I am going to do will be then to analyse the three last years of observation from the OMEGA instrument onboard Mars Express, map the CO2 clouds and study their distribution. The aim of this thesis will be to study the inter-annual variations and the properties of the clouds and try to corre- late them with atmospheric parameters (amount of dust in the atmosphere, temperature, altitude) coming from other observations. The main objective here is to determine how these clouds form and what the source of the condensation nuclei is. With the results of our analysis, the climatology of Mars and its atmosphere dynamics will be refined.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-12-31","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","MSc Space Flight, track Space Exploration","",""

The plants and soil have to stay contained to not spill all over the biotope, and during transport the plants may be cut off from light, be exposed to adverse temperatures and suffer drops and bumps. Plateau was designed with all the challenges it may face during its lifetime kept in mind. It is a straightforward biotope in the shape of a very narrow rectangular case which can be hung up as a living painting or placed on a flat surface. Its geometric form language contrasts with the organic plants inside and brings out the structure and beauty of the plants and even its roots on the other side of the glass. The product was embodied through an iterative design process going through many possible construction possibilities to get the desired design hermetically sealed.

(mentor)","2017","Over one hundred scour holes are located in the Rhine-Meuse delta. These scour holes have relatively large depths and steep slopes and could pose a risk to the stability of river banks and hydraulic structures, especially since some scour holes are still growing. Scour holes develop at locations where either the hydrodynamics or the erodibility of the soil varies locally. In the Rhine Meuse delta, the subsoil stratigraphy is believed to play a large role , as it is composed of alternating layers of poorly erodible clay and peat and highly erodible sand. Local and large scale erosion are therefore not evenly distributed over the river bed and at locations where a top layer of clay or peat becomes too thin, exposure of an underlying layer of sand can result in a scour hole. Anthropogenic activities also have a large impact on the development of scour holes, such as the presence of hydraulic structures (e.g. groynes, bridge piers) and changes in geometry, which cause local changes in hydrodynamics. Moreover, deepening of river beds by dredging may have removed protective clay layers exposing underlying sand bodies. Finally, the closure of the Haringvliet caused higher flow velocities and therefore erosion in the connecting branches in the central part of the delta. In order to judge the potential risk, understanding is needed on the behaviour of scour holes in the Rhine-Meuse delta. A thorough data analysis is therefore performed on a large set of bed topography data. By performing experiments in a scale model more knowledge is obtained on the detailed physical processes influencing scour hole development. In order to predict future scour hole development the applicability of the method of Breusers is tested that predicts the depth and slopes of scour holes behind bed protections. As a first step in this research an attempt is made to develop an objective and generic identification method in order to identify scour holes in the future or in other river branches. Although a method based on the statistical characteristics of the river bed results in a good first approximation to indicate scour zones, the analysis shows that bed irregularities and large variations in scour hole shapes and sizes complicates this method. It is therefore advised to always study scour holes in more detail individually. As the closure of the Haringvliet in 1970 led to erosion in the connecting branches, it is likely that this also influenced the growth of scour holes in that area. After relating the current growth of the scour holes in the delta to the current bed level trends, it is seen that despite these degrading bed levels, the scour holes in the connecting branches do not show the largest growth. This is explained by studying the evolution of scour hole growth over the last five decades in two connecting branches (Oude Maas and Dordtsche Kil). It shows that most scour holes in the area already exist for decades and have reached a stable state. Most of the scour holes show a large growth after 1970 which is likely related to enhanced flow velocities caused by the Haringvliet closure. However, the analysis furthermore shows that only few scour holes developed just after 1970 of which some are expected to have been caused by dredging activities. The influence of the Haringvliet closure on the development of new scour holes seems therefore limited. The analysis of long term evolution of scour holes in the Oude Maas and Dordtsche Kil furthermore shows that the scour hole behaviour varies strongly and does not show similar trends, not even when they are located in the same river reach. This is likely related to the large variations in local conditions such as changes in geometry, the presence of structures, such as bridges and groynes, and the composition of the subsoil.","scour; tidal rivers; heterogeneous subsoil; delta; Rhine-Meuse delta","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

When having experience with manipulating a certain object or appliance, a robot should be able to generalize this behaviour to novel, but similar objects and appliances. When a human has to do a simple task like pushing a previously unseen button or rotating a knob, it has an idea of how to do this. Based on prior experience with similar object parts, a concept for this kind of manipulation tasks is formed. In this work we use a similar idea to learn robots to infer how an object or appliance should be manipulated. We make use of a neural network approach to generate manipulation trajectories for a robot. An instruction in natural language and a pointcloud of the 'manipulatable' object part are encoded into a compact feature representation. We use a recurrent neural network to generate a manipulation trajectory, conditioned on this learned feature representation. We report on experimental results with our model, first letting our recurrent neural network hallucinate manipulation trajectories. This shows that it has learned reasonable patterns. Then we compare the generated trajectories, conditioned on the learned feature representation, with the current state of the art. We show that for some simple tasks our model generates better trajectories, but in general does not have enough training data to generate reasonable trajectories for more challenging and complex tasks.","Robots; Deep Learning; Neural Networks; Sequence Learning; Recurrent Neural Network; Manipulation Trajectories; Learning from Demonstrations; Encoder-Decoder","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Van den Ende, E.A. (mentor)","2017","Healthbox operates within the subscription ecommerce industry. Every two months, Healthbox delivers boxes to users homes filled with new, interesting, full size, healthy products. The Healthbox informs and inspires users about new products and brands, and ensures an always up-to-date healthy lifestyle. Each Healthbox is created by a health-related ambassador and has a minimum value of 90 Euro. A Healthbox can be ordered once or users can purchase a subscription which lasts for at least one year. Healthbox pursues an ideal situation which implies selling as many boxes as possible. To make sure more boxes are sold, users should first be made aware of the existence of the brand and the product Healthbox offers. It is assumed that more purchases are made in case more users know about the existence of the brand. So in order to meet the desired situation, the brand awareness of Healthbox should be increased. In the past few years, Healthbox has noticed the positive effects of user-generated content shared on social media in relation to its sales. User-generated content shared on social media increases brand awareness and can positively influences users purchase behaviour. Today’s user might often be relying on the recommendation and opinion of a friend or acquaintance found within their social media network. This process of getting users to buy through user-generated content describes a behaviour change. These findings were the starting point for this graduation project. In order to contribute to Healthbox desired situation, this graduation project provides a fitting solution for increasing the brand awareness. The fitting solution is designed around company, context and users needs, concerns and abilities by means of a user-centered approach. The final design implies a product-service system which stimulates and supports users to share content about Healthbox during the unpacking process. First, an extensive external, internal and users analysis (including desk research, an online survey, observations, context mapping and interviews) led to different ‘enablers for sharing’. Insights from the analysis showed that users are stimulated to share in case they receive a memorable experience or material gain in terms of rewards. Findings from the user analysis combined with literature research gained knowledge about many different ways to deliver memorable experiences. Positive surprises in terms of added value, desired additional information and experiences that fit user needs work up to memorable experiences. Furthermore, users indicated that the final design should inspire, motivate and support, the call-to-action should be placed at the fingertips and the design should be easy accessible regarding usability. This analysis phase highlighted different opportunities and threats concerning sharing online content. The analysis and more in depth focus on sharing content introduces the ideation phase in which solutions concerning the problem situation are generated. By performing individual and co-creation sessions, fitting solutions to different considerations were found. Insights from these creative session resulted in three different design directions which were validated by the users and evaluated based on predetermined criteria. Eventually, the ideation phase led to the creation of a new unpacking experience with: ‘the Experience kit’. The experience kit opens up a wealth of new intuitive interactions between user and Healthbox. A new unpacking experience generates intrigue and triggers engagement. Using the experience kit stimulates and supports users to create and share content about Healthbox during the unpacking process. The product fits users needs, concerns and abilities by offering added value and a possibility to receive material gain. Desired additional information is provided by means of a seamless connection with a health-related ambassador. This unique experience changes the current unpacking experience and gives it texture and reality through desired elements of discovery and surprise. Adding this unique experience will allow Healthbox to offer their users a memorable experience, leading to increased user appreciation and brand loyalty, while simultaneously trigger the user to recommend the brand to others. Even better, the experience kit will be passed around friends and family because of its fun and interactive nature, spreading the brand message even further. Using real product prototypes, a simulation of the Experience kit was tested among many (potential) users. Insights showed high user acceptance and potential, however some challenges regarding feasibility remain. The end of this report describes how the company should face these challenges in order to work up to realization of the design. This graduation report has hopefully inspired Healthbox regarding increasing its brand awareness approached from an user-centered perspective.","unpacking experience; subscription box; brand awareness; user-generated content; social media","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Vlught, T.J.H. (mentor)","2017","Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) is a renewable energy technology which can operate as a base load source of energy in equatorial areas. By converting the thermal energy of the sun stored in the oceans into electricity, this technology provides a sustainable solution for tropical islands. One of the key factor to accelerate the roadmap towards an economic breakthrough of this technology is the reduction of the capital cost of the OTEC power plant. The cost build-up of an OTEC power plant is dominated by the heat exchangers. For the current proposed designs, these heat exchangers are titanium plate heat exchangers. The primary reason for the selection of this material is the ability to withstand the seawater corrosion. In this research, thermally enhanced polymers have been evaluated as a possible alternative material. In this work, a review on various polymers showed that high impact Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) showed the best parameters overall to be utilized as the polymer for OTEC heat exchangers. This material is cheap, relatively creep-resistant and chemically-resistant towards the working fluid and seawater. The required geometry for the operating conditions of large-scale OTEC unfilled high impact ABS heat exchanger plates have been determined with Finite Element software. This resulted in a required plate thickness of 1.7mmand 2.4 mm for the condenser and evaporator respectively. With these results, a thermodynamic feasibility was determined with a model of the proposed geometry using the control volume method. In this study, the required increase of surface area was determined of the geometry compared to a base-case titanium heat exchanger. It was determined that the required surface area increased by 33.8% for the condenser and 29.6% for the evaporator compared to the titanium base case. This is achieved by compounding the polymer with 52.4% thermally enhancing carbon fibre. Furthermore, it has been concluded that unfilled high impact ABS does not provide a feasible configuration due to the limited thermal conductivity. In the financial analysis, the capital costs were evaluated of both the titanium heat exchangers and the thermally enhanced polymer plates. Due to the technical complexity of the cost estimation of a large-scale OTEC power plant, it was not possible to provide conclusive results in the capital cost savings as a result of the proposed modifications on the heat exchangers. However, the findings show a strong economic potential for this type of material compound as an alternative for the current titanium heat exchanger plates.","Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion; Polymer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process & Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The increasing scarcity of surface area around airports can cause conflicts between the various stakeholders if one of the stakeholders likes to expand. In order to use the available area as efficient as possible, air cargo companies such as KLM Cargo must find a sustainable solution to remain competitive in the market. Combining two separate manual sorting and storing processes in the Mail and Express (Equation) products may provide this sustainable solution. When a design has been made for a combined automated sorter with regard to a roughly expected growth in demand, the expected effects on an operational level of combining the two processes is still largely unknown. As the complex in- and outflow processes of various commodities might encounter certain constraints in the system, since it is not as flexible as in the current situation. When a constrained in the system has been reached, this can cause the performance of the system to decrease, possibly resulting in a lower quality of the products handled. In order to have an indication at which moment the constraints of the combined automated sorting system have been reached an extensive data analysis and modelling study has been performed on the performance of the combined automated air cargo sorting system. By first analyzing the current demand patterns and then using various future scenarios to vary these scenarios, the input for the models is obtained. Also, the KPI’s for the new system are determined. Next, the performance-critical processes are determined regarding the determined KPI’s using the Theory of Constraints, literature and experts. These processes will now further be analyzed regarding the various future scenarios in a discrete-event simulation study and a static model. The simulation study resulted in the localization of the bottleneck in the system and how this effects the system given the uncertain future demand patterns in 2035. It was found that in high overall demand patterns and peak days, the system was not able to process the demand. Various solution strategies have been tested and implemented in the model, such as a configuration change and the implementation of a nightshift in order to process the higher loads and mitigate the found constraints, resulting in a functional system during these demand scenarios. The effects of combining can generally be seen as a consideration between lower costs and a decrease in product differentiation. Mail products can now be handled more ergonomically and more efficient, Equation products will have a decline in quality as the less flexible in- and outfeed may result in longer cut-off times. The study provides a stepwise approach into analyzing the expected performance of similar combined automated air cargo hubs. It also shows the limitation of the Goldratt’s TOC, which cannot be applied directly to a complex input-output system with multiple interacting (contra) flows. A discrete-event simulation study provides a powerful tool to assess the performance and pinpoint the most constraining process in these complex input-output systems.","air cargo; sorting; internal transport; hub; mail; express cargo; automation; discrete event simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Transport, infrastructures and Logistics","",""

In this study, nanoparticles deposited on quartz fiber filter discs using aerosol generation were used to show the possibility of textile nanofinishing which can be applied to produce an advanced class of antimicrobial agents. The influence of various parameters on the particle size has been studied and singlet nanoparticles of silver (less than 10 nm) were successfully produced. Antimicrobial tests were carried out on the synthesized nanoparticles deposited on the filter fibers of various sizes, compositions and agglomerated states. A time-kill curve was determined based on the cell count of the bacteria at each time interval. Antimicrobial activity of the synthesized nanoparticles was very effective (comparable to 6 μM AgNO3), and faster death of bacteria was obtained for non-coalesced (high-surface area) particles when compared to the coalesced ones (low-surface area). Size-selected particles and alloyed particles produced by spark mixing also seemed to have an effect on the bacterial colony.

(mentor); Van Terwisga, T.J.C. (mentor); Godjevac, M. (mentor); Munts, E.A. (mentor)","2017","A previous work at Royal IHC, following the observation from sea trials of trailing suction hopper dredgers (TSHD) that the turning performance of bow tunnel thrusters significantly reduced at slow forward speeds, studied the flow behaviour and performance of bow tunnel thrusters at slow forward speeds using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Simulations were performed, on model scale, first with a simplified wedge model of a containership and then with a simplified wedge model of a TSHD with the thruster modelled by an actuator disk. The numerical results deviated significantly from experimental results from literature. The present work aims to investigate this deviation. Simulations are also performed with a full thruster unit to compare with the actuator disk approach. Also, possible improvement in thruster effectivity is explored by altering the tunnel geometry of the TSHD wedge. First, a grid convergence study is performed on the containership wedge. Next, simulations are carried out for a range of forward speeds - for selected thrusts for the actuator disk approach, and corresponding rpm’s for those thrusts for a full thruster unit. In case of the actuator disk approach, the numerical results show a steady increase of transverse force (Fy) with increasing forward speed, contrary to observations in sea trials. The circulation around the wedge, resulting from interaction of the jet from the tunnel and the cross-flow due to the forward speed, results in the wedge to behave as a slender body in a flow. This results in a transverse force, analogous to Kutta-Joukowski lift, that results in increased Fy. A full thruster unit in place of the actuator disk result in a different flow behaviour and variation of Fy with forward speed. In this case, an initial decline in Fy is observed before it increases monotonically. Comparison with experimental result of the containership wedge and numerical results by both actuator disk and thruster unit show considerable deviation. The transverse force due to the circulation around the hull presents a plausible explanation. The conclusions from the grid convergence study for the containership model are utilized in meshing the TSHD wedge. Simulations performed for a range of forward speeds, first with actuator disk approximation, indicated lowered thruster performance as was observed in sea trials. The pressure contours over the hull imply that the resultant of the forces around the inlet – due to low pressure caused by high velocities of the flow into the tunnel – and those around the outlet – due to low pressure caused by high velocities of outflow – is such that there is a net thrust deduction. Simulations with thruster unit also show lowered thruster effectivity. The tunnel of the TSHD wedge is then given a forward bend of 45o at the tunnel inlet and outlet in order to explore the possibility of improving thruster performance. It is expected that the changed geometry will result in better inflow at tunnel inlet, and the action of the cross-flow on the jet will result in a ‘straightened’ jet with lesser interaction with the hull compared to a jet from a straight tunnel. The CFD results, with actuator disk approximation, indicate that thruster effectivity improves in case of higher forward speeds and reduces for lower speeds. It is advisable to perform the study with smaller tunnel bending angles such that the jet-flow interaction is favourable for the entire range of speeds.","CFD; Bow tunnel thruster; ANSYS CFX; Nienhuis; trailing suction hopper dredger; thruster unit; actuator disk; model scale; tunnel thruster performance; thrust deduction; IHC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime and Transport Technology","","","",""

The goal of this project was to research the potential of 3D-printing as an addition to traditional manufacturing, aimed at the production of customized and/or small series of products. There are 7 different manufacturers approached and interviewed on this topic. It was found how and through what workflow manufacturers currently applying 3D-printing, and how they would expect to use 3D-printing in the future. Chapter 3 describes how these results were translated to the design challenge of this project; How to help manufacturers with the integration of 3D-printing within their traditional production workflow? External and internal brainstorm let to the development of a provisional concept (Chapter 4); Design optimization and production planning for 3D-printing. The concept was prototyped and tested by applying it on 3 use cases that were provided by two manufacturers; AXA & Attema. Through an agile process the provisonal concept was optimized and validated, and let to the development of the Ulti-Expert. The Ulti-Expert is a software tool that consists of a design optimization plug-in within CAD-software and a production planning web-environment. Through the plug-in manufacturers will be able to get real-time feedback on their design in order to optimize it for production with 3D-printing. They are able to use the production planning environment to estimate what capacity will be needed to produce a specific amount of these parts, calculate its costs and to determine how fast it can be produced.","Additive manufacturing; 3D-printing; Fused deposition modelling; Design for additive manufacturing; Rapid manufacturing; Rapid prototyping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2017","Cracks are commonly occurring phenomena in concrete structures. Cracks provide paths for the ingress of deleterious substances, therefore endangering the durability of the structure. When cracking gets excessive, manual maintenance and repairs are required, which are both costly and time consuming. The demand for durable structures and materials that limit the need for manual repair and maintenance are leading to innovative solutions, such as the inclusion of the biological self-healing mechanism developed by Dr. Jonkers at the Delft University of Technology. This autonomous self-healing process utilizes mineral producing bacteria to help mend cracking in concrete, thereby enhancing the reliability and lifetime of the material. The bacterial spores are embedded into the concrete, along with organic compounds in capsules of polylactic acid for protection. Once a crack is created and water starts to seep through, the bacterial spores activate from their dormant state and start to metabolize the nutrients, resulting in the formation of calcium carbonate crystals which seal the crack. Self-healing can potentially reduce the necessity for regular maintenance and repair, thereby lowering long-term costs, resulting in more economically viable structures. However, in order for self-healing concrete to become applicable on an industrial scale, some obstacles still need to be overcome, such as the high production cost of the healing agent at present. Moreover, concerns regarding the influence of this novel technology on concrete characteristics need to be evaluated and addressed accordingly. The purpose of this present study is to identify and evaluate the most optimal and cost-effective form and quantity of the self-healing agent, in order to achieve a significant improved self-healing capacity without compromising other concrete characteristics. To assess the effect of the healing agent on the mortar characteristics, material characterization tests were conducted, both on fresh and hardened mortar samples. Three different forms of the healing agent were employed during these experiments: i.e., encapsulated particles, grinded particles and the loose components. The investigated dosages of healing agent used were 5, 10 and 15 kg/m3. The experimental results indicated that the healing agent performed best, in terms of its effects on mortar characteristics, when applied in the form of loose components. The effects on the material characteristics seemed to increase significantly when a higher dosage of the healing agent was used. In order to designate the performance efficiency of the healing agent, attention was paid to three requirements: the presence of mineral formation in the cracks, reduction in crack permeability and evidence of bacterial activity in the mortar. Microscopic techniques, in conjunction with crack permeability tests, revealed that full healing of cracks occurred in the bacteria based specimens, whereas this occurred only partly in the control specimens. The bacterial mediated process resulted in efficient sealing of cracks up to 0.47 mm, after 56 days of water submersion. Optimal performance was observed for the specimens containing the loose components in a dose of 10 kg/m3. That the crack healing potential was indeed bacterial induced is supported by oxygen profile measurements, which revealed bacteria based consumption. The effects of different healing regimes on the healing performance were also investigated. The study reveals that a damp environment is the most stimulating regime for the self-healing mechanism. In sum, the novel healing agent appears to be most efficient when administered in the loose components form, in a dose of 10 kg/m3 and in a wet environment. Under these circumstances, the agent shows the greatest potential for increasing the durability of concrete at an acceptable price.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-04-03","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Materials and Environment","",""

One such new perspective is the business model concept, which has become a useful stepping stone towards building new strategic tools for public entrepreneurship. The problem is that the business model concept needs to be adapted to remain useful in the public sector. This research synthesises insights from business modelling, public entrepreneurship and public value literature into a set of theoretical constructs that lay out a framework for understanding and discussing public business models, which I propose to be reformulated as mission models. The major contribution of this paper is the mission model canvas, which is a visualisation tool for public managers to find better ways of achieving their organisational missions. The value of this conceptual framework originates from making public value and policy-making more tangible using the business model concept. Future research would include further validation and testing of the framework within suitable public contexts.","public business models; public value; public entrepreneurship; mission models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering, Systems and Services / Information and Communication Technology (ICT)","","EPA Engineering & Policy Analysis","",""

A central theme in this thesis the demountability of IBCs, as a result of which several release agents are tested for their suitability in and effects on IBCs. <br/>Injection bolts have been used successfully in engineering practice using epoxy resin to limit the amount of slip in bolted shear connections with normal clearance holes, but no explicit results are available for connections with oversize or slotted holes. The use of oversize or slotted holes may be beneficial for the (re-)erection process of structures, and thus it is investigated what the effects of such oversize or slotted holes are on the connection behaviour. <br/>First, it is examined if grout is suitable as an injection material in injected bolted connections (IBCs), as well as what precautions are necessary to ensure proper demountability of grout and(epoxy) resin-injected bolted connections. Secondly, the connection behaviour under short-term loading is determined, on the basis of which long-term creep tests are carried out. Finally, a new injection material is developed based on the preliminary conclusions drawn from the short- and long-term tests. <br/>It is concluded that IBCs can be demounted by treating the connection members with a release agent. The results of the experiments show that the long-term behaviour of resin-injected connections is governing the design, but that modelling of this time-dependent behaviour requires additional testing. The short and long-term performance of the newly developed material (resin reinforced with steel shot) in IBCs with oversize holes is significantly better than that of only resin, on the basis of which it is recommended to further investigate the potential and behaviour of this material in engineering applications.","shear connection; injected bolted connection; slip-resistant; epoxy resin; injection; shot","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Crosstalk is the unwanted eﬀect of a control pulse on the other qubits. The coupled NV-13C system is explored, and numerical techniques to optimize the control of multiple and single qubits are used. In this report the eﬀect of the Bloch-Siegert shift in the weak driving regime is investigated ﬁrst. This is done by studying the eﬀect of a π-pulse when two carbon qubits are driven at the same time on resonance. It turns out that in this weak driving regime the eﬀect of the oﬀ resonance is very small, and changes the ﬁdelity not more than 0.3%. Furthermore the eﬀect of a square πpulse on 4 nearby qubits is studied. If the pulse is not optimized (thus square), the pulse cannot be done in less than 100µs while retaining at least 99% ﬁdelity.

(United Nations: Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2015). Climate change, inequality, peace and security issues are just some of the factors affecting urban areas and at the same time posing new challenges for urban planners. However, one approach that rises in popularity in order to provide cities with solution on the basis of these complex issues is the idea of establishing a circular economy in the built environment. In this framework and having as a starting point the high ecological footprint of the Netherlands, the present report attempts to propose an alternative spatial strategy for one of the most competitive metropolitan regions, Amsterdam Metropolitan Region, for 2040. In other words, our approach focuses on how we can realize a regional strategy that aims at lowering the ecological footprint by proposing a concept that has in its core the idea of “carbon-scapes”. Namely, we propose a set of policies, projects and actions that can shape a hybrid sustainable landscape where reduction and reuse of CO2 are our main principles for circularity and urban development. One of the key elements to support this vision for the region is the construction of a regional CO2 pipeline network that connects CO2 consumer with CO2 producer. Nevertheless, the project addresses a versatility of urban challenges, such as the symbiosis of cultural, natural and urban landscape, the reuse of vacancy, the regeneration of public spaces, the productivity and efficiency of land, as well as the importance of landmarks (museums) as a catalyst for urban growth. Considering that the ecological footprint is expected to reach higher levels, if we do not find a way to establish a new agenda of spatial design and policies that would include circularity, this research addresses a widely known waste material (CO2) as an asset to implement it. In general, it can be seen as an additional layer and an example for combining ecological footprint issues and circularity so as to achieve a more sustainable future also in other regions, beyond the AMA.","co2 emissions; circular economy; Amsterdam metropolutan area; carbonscapes; ecological footprint; urban growth; co2 pipeline","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","","",""
