Surf pools mimic good surfing conditions found along the coast. This thesis is about the technical feasibility of a new surf pool concept, creating surfing waves in a circular pool by towing ship-like hulls around. The hulls are towed along the outer wall of the pool and waves generated by these hulls propagate inwards and break on an island in the middle of the pool. The waves break around the island which theoretically leads to endless surf rides. The initial design as suggested by Webber is based on a pool diameter of 200 m and a water depth of 3 m. The objective of his design to generate 2 m high waves for intermediate to expert surfers. Because of the lack of knowledge about ship induced waves in such an enclosed environment, a physical and a numerical model study are carried out. Various hull sizes are towed in a towing tank and the surface elevations are measured and analyzed. From this physical model study it was concluded that the wave pattern behind a hull is the result of a complex interference pattern and is easily disturbed when the velocity beside the hull becomes large. The difficulties of wave generation by a hull therefore lie in the return currents. The magnitude of the return flow is a function of the blockage, the percentage of the cross section of the pool blocked by the hull. In case the blocking and the velocity are too large, water accumulates in front of the hull and the wave field behind the hull is disturbed, the so-called trans-critical regime. Maximum wave height is found when to towing a hull at the onset of this trans-critical regime. The initial wave pool design is evaluated, and it was concluded that the water depth of 3 m is insufficient to generate the desired 2 m waves. Therefore an amended design is presented. Water depth is increased to 7 m and the generation area is enlarged to reduce the blockage to 5%. The large generation area causes a weak return flow and therefore less turbulence in the pool. In such a cross section it is considered technically possible to generate 2 m high surfable waves.","waves; surfing; ship; pool","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences; Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","Wave pools are designed to mimic surfing conditions as they exist along coasts. The Liquid Time Wave Pool concept, invented by Greg Webber, suggests a new method for wave generation. Waves are generated by a hull which moves in a channel. These ""ship waves"" break on a slope creating surf. Key feature of the concept is to make ship waves surfable. To investigate the possibility of creating surfable ship waves an experiment is conducted. During this experiment hulls are towed through a channel and the generated waves are measured using a stereo photo technique. The objectives of this study are to: 1) Investigate the possibility of making ship waves surfable; 2) Investigate the capability of the stereo photo technique to measure water surface elevation and surface velocity over a specific area. Existing theory offers the possibility to estimate wave fields using Froude depth numbers and the blocking of the channel cross section by the hull. The Froude depth number represents the ratio of the ship speed and the shallow water celerity. When Froude depth numbers and blocking values are low, hull speeds are much smaller than the shallow water celerity. The regime is called sub-critical and a dominating secondary wave field is expected. When Froude depth numbers and blocking values are high, hull speeds are high and currents around the hull can become critical. The hull speed when return currents become critical is called the limit speed. Hull speeds exceeding the limit speed account for the trans-critical regime. The trans-critical regime holds a dominating primary wave system and a negligible secondary wave system. The angle of the generated wave determines the peel angle of the surfing wave. The peel angle is the angle enclosed by the wave crest and the path of the breakpoint. Peel angles mainly determine the surfer speed. To gain insight in wave angles and surface velocities of ship waves and to verify existing ship wave theory a physical experiment is conducted. In the experiment hulls with different blocking coefficients are towed through a channel at different speeds covering the sub-critical and trans-critical regime. The wave field generated by the hull is simultaneously photographed by two distinct calibrated cameras. These stereo photos taken by the cameras are input to the stereo photo algorithm. The output of the algorithm is the water surface elevation and the surface flow velocity of the wave field. It is found that the stereo photo technique offers a great possibility to derive water surface elevations and surface flow velocities. Water surface elevations are verified using parallel measurements by wave gauges. Accuracy of the technique highly depends on camera calibration which must be improved. Limiting factors for accuracy using the technique are the pixel resolution of the images, computational power and the density of the floats. Using the stereo photo technique theory is validated. It is found that the wave field in the trans-critical regime holds strong currents. These strong currents make the trans-critical regime not suitable for surfing. The sub-critical regime holds weak currents and wave angles suit the range of the required peel angles. The Liquid Time Wave Pool design should account for towing speeds and blocking coefficients leading to the sub-critical regime.","waves; surfing; stereo; photo; ship","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

Kwaliteitsverhoging van kantoorruimte als middel om huurders te binden.","Neecke, A.","Arkesteijn, M.H. (mentor); Koppels, P.W. (mentor)","2007","Omstreeks 2001 is de economie drastisch verslechterd, maar deze is zich momenteel weer aan het herstellen. De effecten van de laagconjunctuur werken echter nog door in de vastgoedmarkt. Toen er nog sprake was van een hoogconjunctuur breidden bestaande bedrijven zich uit en werden er veel nieuwe bedrijven opgestart. Dit had tot gevolg dat er een grote behoefte was aan kantoorruimte. Een deel van de kantoorruimte die hiervoor gebouwd werd, werd door ontwikkelaars op risico ontwikkeld. Op het moment dat de economie omsloeg, duurde het nog enige tijd voordat de in ontwikkeling genomen kantoren op de markt kwamen. Deze vertraging wordt veroorzaakt door de voor vastgoed kenmerkende lange realisatietijd en is onderdeel van de varkenscyclus. Omdat de economie echter verslechterde, krompen veel bedrijven in of gingen failliet. De vraag naar kantoorruimte nam af en er ontstond veel leegstand. In de zo ontstane vragersmarkt zien veel huurders hun kans schoon om te profiteren van de marktomstandigheden. Doordat kantooreigenaren hun panden graag willen verhuren om inkomsten te genereren, zakken de huurprijzen en worden incentives geboden aan potenti huurders om hen over de streep te trekken. Huurders hebben hierdoor de optie om te verhuizen naar een nieuw kantoorpand met dezelfde kwaliteit als hun oude pand, maar een lagere huur, of een nieuw pand met dezelfde huur, maar een hogere kwaliteit. Wanneer een huurder besluit te verhuizen, laat hij een kantoorruimte achter, waarbij de kans aanwezig is dat de eigenaar van dat pand niet direct een nieuwe huurder zal vinden. Met name bij oudere kantoorpanden is dit een risico. Daarom wordt het voor kantooreigenaren steeds interessanter om te achterhalen wat zij kunnen doen om hun huurders te behouden. Het is een optie om de kwaliteitswensen van de huurder binnen de bestaande huisvesting te voldoen. Vanuit deze insteek is de volgende vraagstelling geformuleerd: De vraagstelling van dit onderzoek is of het voor een verhuurder van kantoorruimte financieel aantrekkelijk is om door middel van het verhogen van de kwaliteit van een kantoorgebouw de zittende huurders te behouden? Het is financieel aantrekkelijk voor een kantooreigenaar om te investeren in de kwaliteit van een kantoorgebouw, wanneer de te verwachte extra inkomsten van deze investering even hoog of hoger zijn dan de kosten die nodig zijn voor het realiseren van de kwaliteitsverbetering. Het is het meest aantrekkelijk om te investeren in de mate van herkenbaarheid van een gebruiker in een kantoorgebouw, waarbij gedacht moet worden aan de herkenbaarheid van de naam op de gevel van het gebouw. Na deze gebouwfactor is het het meest aantrekkelijk om te investeren in de hoofdentree van een kantoorgebouw, gevolgd door de mogelijkheid om ramen te openen en ten slotte de kwaliteit van de gevel. Om de aantrekkelijkheid van een investering in de kwaliteit van van de genoemde gebouwfactoren te visualiseren, is een investeringsmodel ontwikkeld. Dit model bestaat uit een assenstelsel met vier assen, dat is opgedeeld in twee delen: de mogelijke investering en de benodigde investering. De mogelijke investering is de investering die een kantooreigenaar kan doen op basis van extra huur die hij voor een kwaliteitsverbetering van een gebouwfactor kan vragen en de benodigde investering is de investering die daadwerkelijk nodig is om de ingrepen te financieren die nodig zijn om de kwaliteitsverbetering te realiseren.","kantoor; kwaliteit; vastgoedbelegger; investeren; huurder","nl","master thesis","Technische Universiteit Delft, Faculteit Bouwkunde, Vakgroep Real Estate and Housing","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","Since the container revolution in the mid-sixties and the scale increase it caused, seaports face changing technological developments and economic circumstances. Terminal operators and port authorities have to deal with an increasing number of uncertainties. Especially in container transport competition plays a major role. Containers have a relative large mobility and container transportation routes are less bounded to modalities, ports and logistic chains. As a consequence the substitutability of ports is considerable. Port selection within the logistic chain is part of the selection of the logistic chain which is the primary choice. The market power of shipping companies has been enhanced to the extent that they have gained control of logistic chains. The capacity of container carriers is still growing and as long as there is enough freight to transport they tend to call at less and less ports. There are huge challenges for container ports and their terminals to remain competitive and to handle the anticipated growth with an increase of their productivity, a reduction of port congestion (e.g. Maasvlakte II) and improvement of their hinterland accessibility (e.g. the Betuweline). The overall objective of this research is to provide port authorities with a tool to support their strategic investment planning in a competitive market. The tool should provide port authorities with information on the impacts of, structural and non-structural, capacity improvement measures on the future demand for container service. The present thesis contributes to this objective by the development of the Port Competition Model, a supporting planning tool. The port can be considered a node in a transport network with competition, which faces a dynamic situation concerning the timing and sizing of capacity expansions of other ports and changes in the transport network. The challenge is to incorporate the aspects of the full dynamics of port competition over the network in the Port Competition Model by simulation of the competitive strategies of other ports and the sensitivity of decisions on port investment for such strategies. To this end the Port Competition Model needs to represent varying market shares over the years in order to reflect strategies of other ports. When port planning is based on varying market shares of competitive ports it can be defined as ""dynamic port planning"". The focus of this research is the reaction of a particular port on a change in the transportation network. A scenario for such change is the entry of new routes via a competing port. This leads to decreased demands and benefits for the particular port. Potential reactions of the ports on this change include investment in port expansion and improvement of hinterland connections. The expansion of a port's surface area takes a central place in this research. The density of ports in Northwest Europe is the highest in the world. This implies severe competition. Four of the five biggest European ports are situated within the Hamburg - Le Havre range: Rotterdam, Antwerp, Hamburg and Bremen. Within this range the ports compete mainly on transit containers. The Port Competition Model has been developed for these four ports within the Hamburg - Le Havre range.","port; planning; dynamic; competition; tool","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

Due to mutual interdependency between the actors involved and ever-changing partnerships, managing this process is a complex task. Hence, trying to steer and control this process by means of traditional local-government-based hierarchical planning is nearly impossible. To aid this process a special management system for multi-actor urban decision making is introduced in this thesis. The system models the multi-actor process and the decision making activities in this process as a multi-level network, which consists of actors, activities, and the decision-making relations between them. As a result it provides each actor with the possibility to manage and enhance both his organisational and personal networks and the activities which go along with it. Two key system concepts are the dynamic solution space and the equal collaboration structure based on mutual interdependence. In order to implement these ideas, commonly-used critical path algorithms are insufficient, and a Linear Programming model is used instead. An experimental tool in early development is introduced.","multi-actor network; operations research critical path planning; interorganisational; solution space modelling; formal and hybrid structures","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Architecture, Real Estate & Housing","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","For socio-economic and safety reasons it is desirable to be able to model shoreline retreat. To that end, it is essential that models predict dune and beach profile change under storm conditions as accurately as possible. Several approaches to dune erosion modelling have been proposed. The wave-impact driven dune erosion model decouples inner surf and swash zone sediment transports from dune face erosion, enabling a combination of this model with a process-based morphodynamic model for the nearshore. Such a combined model allows for a physical feedback between nearshore hydrodynamics, dune face erosion and the evolution of the nearshore and foreshore from that erosion. The present report describes a study on wave-impact driven sediment flux. Previous research by Fisher et al. (1986) resulted in a linear relation between wave impact and dune face erosion volumes. In their approach the total erosion of a dune during a certain period is considered as the summation of the specific erosion volumes from single impacts on the dune face. From observations during large-scale dune erosion experiments in the Delta flume, it is concluded that dune face erosion under wave attack takes place in periodical slump events, preceded by a period of wave attack. In this research, the relation between wave impact and dune face erosion volumes is studied taking into account the periodicity of slump events. To this end, wave impact, period of wave attack and corresponding dune erosion volumes are defined and derived from data of the large-scale dune erosion experiments. Wave impact for a predefined period is derived from in-situ pressure and flow velocity measurements, while erosion volumes for entire tests and for individual slump events are derived from respectively in-situ profile measurements and video data. Stereo video calculations are used to process video data into 3D-profiles. The period of wave attack is derived from video measurements. The resulting values show a clear coherence between wave impact and sediment flux. Several relations can be fitted through the data points for the situation where the dune face is entirely above still water level (SWL) and the dune face has a near-critical slope. Fitted relations are not applicable for the situation where the toe of the dune is below SWL, as this implies a fundamentally different dune erosion process.","dune erosion; video monitoring; dune modelling","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engioneering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","The primary energy use for house heating has increased strongly in the second half of the previous century. The environmental and economical impact of this high energy consumption has augmented the use of affordable insulation materials which have moderate environmental impact. Sheep wool is one of these natural products which are becoming more popular in the construction industry. Because sheep wool insulation, as a product, is very new on the market and also produced at this moment on relatively small scale, the general properties of sheep wool and especially the properties regarding moisture transfer have not been examined in great detail yet. Therefore, in first instance, a broad research is done about the wool fiber as a material and about the moisture transfer properties of wool (samples) in the hygroscopic range. Traditionally, the vapor transfer inside a material is governed by sorption on one hand, and on the other hand by the resistance to vapor flow. For sheep wool, the (steady-state) sorption behavior of wool has been studied extensively. Also the vapor resistance has been studied in some detail. But, the ?-factor of two wool insulation products with identical mass density can lay far from each other, both being measured according to the German norm (DIN 52615). Because of these differences, it was decided to measure the ?-factor of sheep wool insulation in this study using the well-known cup method. In addition, since wool samples may exhibit varying properties, the sorption isotherm of the wool was measured as well. And finally, besides these two experiments, a third experiment was carried out which focused on the time and space-dependent vapor transfer in a column of wool. The data from this quite unique experiment may indicate whether the vapor transfer inside the wool can be described using a Fickian diffusion model (i.e. one effective differential equation for the vapor transfer) or that non-Fickian effects do occur. The analysis of the cup method indicated that the vapor resistance (?-factor) lies between 1,2 (at 60% RH) and 2,12 (at 95% RH). As the ?-factor is expected to be constant or decrease with increasing RH, it is speculated that the increase of ?-factor was probably due to dilution of the salt solution. Consequently, the measurement of the permeability at lowest measured RH at the start of the experiment is probably the most reliable one. Therefore, it is concluded from this experiment that the ?-factor is 1,2 ±0,2. In these measurements it was seen that the sorption occurred in two stages after a step in RH. The first stage was fast, and occurred within a couple of hours, while the second step was very slow and took days to reach thermodynamic equilibrium. The second sorption stage was hardly present in the 45-60% RH range, but it was clearly observed in the range of 75-90% RH. This slow second stage of the adsorption is thought to be due to swelling of wool with increasing relative humidity.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

It will serve as an in-orbit test bed for three innovative technologies. Delfi-C3 is scheduled for launch in August 2007 by an Indian PSLV launcher. This report focuses on the design process of the electrical power system. Because Delfi-C3 applies a constant voltage power bus, a power conversion system is introduced to transport power from the solar arrays to the power bus. Additional conversion systems are designed for power supply to the various electronics boards. Furthermore, designs are made for interfaces between the electrical power system and the other subsystems. These designs will be presented and discussed in this report. Because electrical power is a scarce resource in spaceflight, a power budget has been generated and maintained throughout the complete Delfi-C3 project. Interface control is applied to ensure efficient cooperation between the various subsystems. In this report, the power budget and interface control process will be presented. A second focus in this report is the simulation and verification process of the electrical systems of Delfi-C3. To generate an adequate impression of the behaviour of the Delfi-C3 spacecraft in orbit, several orbit simulations are performed. As simulation output, the orbital position is calculated. In addition, the control and disturbance torques are used to reconstruct the attitude profile of the spacecraft. These parameters are subsequently used to calculate the incoming solar power. It will be shown that the incoming solar power is sufficient to supply Delfi-C3 with electrical power. Electrical system verification is part of the spacecrafts testing process. It has to be verified whether the electrical power system is successful in converting solar array power to bus power. The power distribution system has to be tested to guarantee that power arrives at every subsystem in the correct conditions. It will be shown that the electrical power system performs in accordance with requirements and is qualified for spaceflight.","spacecraft design; orbit simulation; systems engineering; electrical power system","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Aerospace Engineering, Systems Integration/Space","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","A feasibility study has been started with respect to the joint-free exectution of quay walls in high-performance concrete. This feasibility study has the purpose of looking for faster means of building quay walls. The use of high performance concrete is an excellent material for a faster execution of the superstructure of quay walls. The strength development of the material is significantly higher then normal concrete, which allows for faster dismantling of the casing. To further improve the building speed it's been proposed to broaden the study with the subject of joint-free execution. This means there will be no contraction joints anymore in the concrete upper structure of the quay walls, which allows for a continuous execution of the superstructure. As a reference project the quay wall of ECT (Europe Container Terminal) has been chosen. A reference project is chosen to allow for a comparison between the new and the old design. The superstructure has been redesigned in high performance concrete without the use of contraction joints. The substructure stayed the same to allow for a comparison between only the superstructures. The first problem faced was the temperature induced deformation of the superstructure. The foundation (the substructure) was unable to withstand these new forces, causing them to fail in certain cases. The main item here was the increased length of the quay wall when the concrete got warmer. To disable the influence of the elongation of the superstructure with respect to the loads on the substructure a slide bearing has been designed between the superstructure and the substructure. This allows the superstructure to elongate without causing any harmful loads on the substructure. The only adjustment in the design was the relocation of the strain element (the MV-pole) from the superstructure to the substructure. Furthermore the superstructure has to be made from fibre-reinforced concrete. This has to be done to make the concrete strong enough to withstand the extra strains, caused by the joint free execution. When at the end the two designs (the old one and the new one) were compared it showed a slight profit for the new design of 200.000 euro. Compared to the overall costs of 24 Million euro of the project this was a small profit. More economical profit could be gained when the used concrete mixtures will be cheaper. The price of the concrete made up for a large proportion of the loss-factor, so cheaper concrete would increase the overall profit significantly.","quay wall; high performance concrete; joint-free","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","The use of microbial organisms in industrial production processes drives the desire to modify cellular processes in order to obtain a production process with high efficiency. For this purpose understanding of the mechanisms in the cell is crucial. The construction of models for metabolic control analysis is done in order to make sensible decisions for the modification of cells, and to determine the best targets for engineering of an organism. The goal of this study was to obtain a kinetic model of the anaerobic glycolysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on experimental data. The model makes use of linlog approximative kinetics. First a model is constructed based on previously obtained experimental data. In the construction, model reduction is applied to reduce the complexity of the model. The data is analyzed for the amount of information it contains and it is determined which model parameters can not be identified using the data. It is shown that the use of linlog kinetics allows the identification of parameter identifiability problems that can serve as a basis for experimental design. For the initial data set ATP and FdP were identified to be similar in their dynamic response to a perturbation which led to an identifiability problem of elasticity parameters for these metabolites. Subsequently, experimental design was aimed at solving the identified lack of information. After performing the experiments it is concluded that the experimental results solve the identifiability problems. The use of the new experimental data therefore allows the estimation of separate parameters for ATP and FdP. When parameter estimations are performed, sets of elasticities that are able to describe the experimental data are obtained. The fact that the experimental data can be explained shows that the interactions that are present in the model are sufficient to account for the observed response of glycolysis to a perturbation. The result was obtained by the application of only mass-action kinetics. A single elasticity parameter set that describes all the obtained experimental data could not be obtained.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Biotechnology","","Bioprocesstechnology","",""

To improve the way of building and the indoor climate, a cooperative association ‘Q’ was set up to realise this goal. The association ‘Q’ has invented a unique, innovative, and intelligent building system. In these so called Q-houses at least 90% of the materials used are renewable. These materials, such as timber and sheep’s wool, provide a healthy indoor climate. The building system of a Q-house is a core building. This core provides stability. The walls outside the core are only supporting elements, they don’t provide stability. Due to this building system, flexibility is created for the building of different styles of houses. At the moment, 18 Q-houses have been built in The Netherlands. However, the evaluation of the construction has not taken place yet. Evaluating an entire Q-house would take more time than the time set for one graduation period. Because the floor is made of innovative elements that have not been used in earlier projects, this part of a Q-house will be evaluated. The objective of this graduation project is the evaluation and reconsideration of the choices that were made in the design process of the floor, to be able to optimise the floor. The floor is made of pre-stressed laminated elements. The elements span in the longitudinal direction of the house and are pre-stressed in the direction, perpendicular to the grain. The main reason for prestressing is that all elements work together as one piece. Evaluation clearly showed the strengths and weaknesses of the floor. The most important strength is the avoiding of gaps between the elements due to the pre-stressing. The most important weakness is that, due to the pre-stressing method, operations have to be done by hand. This increases the cost price.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","Vanuit een groot aantal bedrijven is er een toenemende vraag naar snellere hardware. Het MOLEN-platform voorziet in die behoefte, doordat de architectuur bestaat uit een normale processor en een herprogrammeerbare chip. Hierdoor is een grote versnelling te behalen. Het omzetten van programmas naar deze architectuur is echter lastig en tijdrovend. De Delft Workbench automatiseert dit proces, waardoor het omzetten net zo eenvoudig wordt als het compilen van een programma. Bovendien is deze softwaretool te gebruiken voor verschillende soorten processoren en herprogrammeerbare chips. Een van de eerste zaken die gebeurt, is het analyseren van de programmas die binnenkomen. In dit rapport komt de analyse van c-code aan de orde, het zogenaamde profilen. In deze analyse wordt een schatting gemaakt van het mogelijk oppervlak dat een programma inneemt op een herprogrammeerbare chip. Ook wordt gekeken in hoeverre een programma is te parallelliseren. Deze waardes worden niet direct bepaald, maar worden geschat aan de hand van bepaalde eigenschappen, zogenaamde metrics. Er wordt gekeken naar verschillende metrics die een schatting kunnen geven voor de mogelijke grootte op de herprogrammeerbare chip. Er is gekeken naar het aantal aritmetische operaties (rekenkundige, bitwise of logische operaties) om een maat voor de oppervlakte te krijgen. Daarnaast wordt gekeken naar de bit-breedte van de input van een functie. Hieraan is te zien hoeveel exchangeregisters er nodig zullen zijn tussen de normale processor en de herprogrammeerbare chip. Dit is geeft ook een maat voor de oppervlakte. Ook wordt bekeken hoeveel variabelen er in een functie zitten en wat daarvan de bit-breedte is. Dit geeft aan hoeveel registers er ongeveer nodig zullen zijn. Er wordt ook gekeken naar metrics die een schatting kunnen geven voor de mate waarin een programma is te parallelliseren. Basic blocks is een aantal achtereenvolgende operaties die uitgevoerd worden zonder te verspringen. Zo'n verspringing treedt bijvoorbeeld op bij een jump. Daarnaast wordt er een schatting gemaakt van de algemene complexiteit van de code. Dit kan zowel bruikbaar zijn voor een oppervlakte schatting als voor een schatting over de mogelijke te halen versnelling. De metrics worden gebruikt voor het maken van een schatting van eigenschappen op een fysieke implementie op herconfigureerbare hardware. Hierbij wordt een schatting gemaakt van het aantal states, flipflops, slices en LUT's. Code die in de profiler komt, moet aan een paar eisen voldoen. In de c-code mogen zich geen function-calls, geen pointers en geen arrays bevinden. Als aan deze eisen wordt voldaan, levert het programma op basis van testen correcte resultaten op.","fpga","en","bachelor thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Computer Engineering","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

A general expression of flood risk is the probability of flooding times the consequences. This graduation research focuses on the probabilities of failure and leaves the consequences out of the comparison. The objective is to find the most interesting parts for a flexible and widely applicable reliability method. By describing existing reliability methods and applying those to a model dike and a dike ring in the German Bight area (Germany) more insight will be gained into the advantages and disadvantages of these methods. The reliability methods PC-Ring and ProDeich are described and compared with each other. PC-Ring is developed in the Netherlands and used in the VNK-project to test the Dutch dike rings. ProDeich is developed in Germany as a model to assess the overall failure probabilities for sea dikes. Both methods are designed to analyse the separate flood defences and systems of flood defences. Furthermore the approach of determining the failure probability is in general the same. The dike ring is divided in equal sections. A limit state function describes the strength and loading for the failure mechanisms and the failure probabilities are calculated using probabilistic level II or level III calculations. Differences can be found in the general background of the methods, the application area, the available fault trees and failure mechanisms. The use of stochastic and hydraulic input is rather different in PC-Ring and ProDeich. PC-Ring considers correlations and dependencies, while this is neglected in ProDeich. The amount of hydraulic input in PC-Ring is very extensive compared to ProDeich. Differences in the output are caused by the following aspects: The calculation methods lead to differences for all failure mechanisms. Piping is in PC-Ring preceded by heave. Differences in the limit state functions. Different use of model factors (which account for uncertainties in the used models). Different wave heights and periods, these are provided in a different way in each program and therefore lead to different results. The comparison of both methods leads to many differences and similarities and a new software tool should comprise aspects from both programs.","pc-ring; prodeich","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

In a space-time formulation space and time are treated in an uniform way, which leads to a high accuracy in both space and time. The downside of the formulation is however a larger system of equations, which increases the computational time. In this work two space-time methods are compared with four time-stepping methods. To verify the different methods, they are all tested on the one-dimensional and twodimensional linear advection equations for various initial conditions. For these problems the exact solution is known, so the error of the methods can be determined and compared.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

The rise of the cable stayed bridge since 1955 made this suspension type an obsolete alternative for a long period of time. The largest existing main span for a self-anchored suspension bridge is 300 metres and dates from 1999. Main difficulties for this bridge type to reach spans over 300 metres can be blamed on erection problems and the buckling stability of the girder. Erecting the deck structure prior to the main cable makes this bridge technically and economically less attractive than for instance the cable stayed bridge. A dimensional inventory has shown that the deck slenderness is limited to about ? = 1/95 and the sag ratio varies between 1/5-1/8. The deck slenderness is related to the required bending stiffness to have sufficient resistance against buckling. Also the relatively high sag ratios, compared to conventional suspension bridges, are mainly chosen to reduce the normal force in the deck that is imposed by the main cable. A parameter study into the structural behaviour has revealed that the most important bridge parameters are the bending stiffness EIdeck of the deck and the axial stiffness EAmain cable of the main cable. A well chosen ratio between the EIdeck and EAmain cable influences the maximum bending moments and the deflections in the girder. In the pre-design process of a suspension bridge type it is favourable to consider: -A slender stiffening girder, to reduce the maximum bending moment in the girder -A stiff main cable, to increase the global stiffness of the bridge and to reduce the maximum bending moment in the girder -A high sag to span ratio, to reduce the normal force in the deck and the maximum bending moment in the deck.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and construction","","","",""
