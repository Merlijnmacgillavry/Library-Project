(mentor); Deken, F. (mentor)","2011","Small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SME) have limited number of employees and assets; nevertheless, they make up a substantial part of a country’s economy given their capability to respond to market and technological changes. However, one of the main obstacles that hinder the exploitation of SMEs’ advantages in emerging countries is the difficulty they face in linking their products with their strategic business objectives. This impedes the development of long-term solutions. Various studies assert that design could support the vital link between product development and strategic business objectives. Unfortunately, in emerging countries the role of the design discipline is still very unclear, thus prevailing a perception that design is an unnecessary expense. This research investigates the application of design discipline in SME’s in the context of emerging countries. It aims to provide government and other industry-related organizations with a framework that enables and facilitates the understanding, adoption and use of design within small-medium enterprises in emerging countries such as Colombia. More specifically, this research aims to: *Promote and facilitate the successful understanding and application of design in emerging countries while making design part of the holistic business support framework in a given organization. *Increase the accessibility to design for SME’s in emerging countries. *Facilitate the understanding of design not just as an isolated activity but also as an economical factor in the development of SME’s; altering the viewpoint that it is an expense rather than an investment.","National Design Systems / Design Infrastructures; Value of Design; Design Support; Design Promotion; Design in emerging countries","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2011","In order to achieve the Millennium development goals of the UN, different initiatives have been established worldwide. One of these initiatives has been developed in Matagalpa, Nicaragua. Through the program Agua para Todos – Agua para Siempre different institutions work together, the common goal being to provide safe drinking water and sanitation to a large number of the people of Matagalpa and the surrounding areas. One of the ways in which this goal is pursued is by installing wastewater treatment systems for demonstration purposes in order to reduce the contamination produced by the coffee processing industry. This industry is, at present, the major cause of pollution of open water sources in the Matagalpa province. Therefore, a new hybrid anaerobic wastewater treatment system has been developed: an improved anaerobic lagoon (LAM, because of the Spanish acronym). One of the main objectives of this report is to throw light on the way in which such a system works and to also recommend to coffee farmers the set up size that is recommendable when installing a LAM system. In addition, the possibilities for locally integrating the use of biogas produced in the LAM system is a question that is discussed in this thesis. For this purpose, a LAM system has been installed in a medium?sized coffee farm called El Socorro. In the period between November 2009 and January 2010, measurements were made of key parameters in El Socorro which indicate the efficiency and working of the LAM system, together with pre?treatment and post?treatment. In previous harvest seasons other students have conducted work on the characterization of coffee wastewater and this data, together with the data obtained during the last harvest season will help in providing answers to the objectives stated in the previous paragraph. During the fieldwork unforeseen restrictions were encountered which were ultimately responsible for reducing the quantity of data below that which was anticipated. However, with the information gathered, it was obvious that in the last harvest season the lack of lime for neutralizing the coffee wastewater was a serious problem that inhibited the proper working of the biomass in the LAM system. Therefore, no biogas production took place at all. The biogas production, which should have been measured during the fieldwork, could not be measured due to prolonged delays. This is why many theoretical calculations and assumptions need to be made in order to come up answers to the questions posed by this thesis. Measurements of wastewater revealed an average pH value of 4.9. In order to elevate this value, a base is needed which elevates the alkalinity of the wastewater. In this report two bases are studied: calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate. From these two bases the conclusion is drawn that calcium carbonate, even when it has to be applied in larger quantities, has the preference due to the substantial difference in costs (US$ 0,49 cheaper per produced quintal oro). The estimated biogas production, which to a large extent had been based on assumptions concerning coffee wastewater, is much lower when measured values are used to calculate methane production. Therefore, instead of the anticipated 17.5 m3/d of CH4, only 2.4 m3/d could have been produced in the last harvest season. This production is not enough to run engines and can only at best be used to cook. If this application is not possible then the only option left is to flare the biogas. At the end of the report a graph is presented in which it is shown how different coffee farmers can get an impression of how likely the successful implementation a LAM system in their coffee farms is, which not only prevents fines (by treating the wastewater), but also renders profit from biogas production in larger quantities.","anaerobic digestion; coffee wastewater; Nicaragua","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2011","The publication of Linked datasets on the Linked Open Data cloud has been increasing. Only very few of these datasets are interlinked with each other. Lots of tools have been developed for making interlinking between linked datasets. Silk-A Link Discovery Framework is a tool that allows one to do interlinking between data items within different Linked Data sources. The Silk Linking Specification Language (Silk-LSL) allows the user to write a script for specifying conditions that need to be met in order for resource to be interlinked. The Silk- LSL file can be either written by manually or generated with the help of tools. The manual approach requires skilled users and hard work for manually discovering the classes and classes’ properties of the datasets that need to be interlinked. Hence, an automatic approach for solving this problem is needed. This thesis document proposes an application which guides the users through the process of specifying linking conditions during the creation of the Silk LSL program. The tool is called Silk Magic, and helps users in the process of creating an LSL file. The application provides various features for editing linking conditions. These features provide an interactive tree view for specifying the linking conditions that are required in order to generate the file. The Silk Magic application with its three main features: Similarity functions editor, Query Builder editor and Path Expression editor are the main contributions of this Master Thesis.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Web Information System","","Information Architecture","",""

(mentor)","2011","Space, in a way, is a limitless formation. The specification of a space is derived with the user’s interaction density. In order to clarify the interaction, it is possible to mention it as: Mutual activities of the users in the environment Individual reaction of the user to the environment Barrier is an obstacle that prevents a person to see, hear etc. Barriers are usually the physical objects in our lives. In architecture, for example, besides the special characteristics, a wall is a separation element for the spaces. However, in architecture, this barrier has also a definition, which takes its context from its users and their requirements. These requirements depend on the common and private use of the spaces. The use is directly related with the interaction in the space. The organization of the physical environment has a significant role in the quality of the interaction. Most of the time, physical elements create the routes, boundaries for the users. Besides the physical elements, it is possible to face the invisible boundaries in our daily lives. Although a physical element does not exist in the site, a separation can be differentiated in the space. Like in the neighborhood of Deurne, streets become the living rooms of the private users. On the other hand, they still take attention of the visitors. So they act as an open space, which brings private and public use together, but the significant point in this gathering is that the separation can still be witnessed. In the design process, it is aimed to create a continuous interaction between spaces while having a separation. (Dis)connection of the spaces, is the focusing point of the functions. The relations and the interactions between interior-exterior, interior-interior and exterior-interior generate the question for finding the quality for the users of the functions. The relations between the functions in the building and outside of the building have the quality to experience each other, but they have their barriers. This forms the idea of open barrier for the design approach.","library; kindergarden; social interaction; hybrid building; barrier; public space; private use; centrality; Deurne; exhibition; information accessibility; vertical flow; visibility; user diversity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-12-01","Architecture","Architecture","","Hybrid Buildings","",""

(mentor); Van Boeijen, A.G.C. (mentor)","2011","“Pamoja” is a Swahili word that stands for “oneness” and it exactly refers to a state of being unified or whole under different circumstances. The meaning of this word offers a rich overview of people living in a country like Kenya, where a community-based society is predominant and crucial for their everyday life. Even if this graduation project is about a personal concern such as Oral Health and related disorders, the designer could not ignored that such a unity, combined with education and prevention, might actually bring to a tangible social change. THE TOPIC Maintaining good oral hygiene is one of the most important everyday practice people can do for their own teeth and gums. Healthy teeth not only enable people to look and feel good but they make it possible to eat and speak properly. Therefore, good oral health becomes an important factor of the overall well-being and physical appearance in our lives influencing as well social and interpersonal relationships. Unfortunately, in a developing country like Kenya, a constant personal hygiene is obstructed by several factors that can be enclosed under an “umbrella term” called Poverty. People from vulnerable communities usually cannot rely on health structures both from a sanitary and economical point of view, feeling forced to take care of their health by their own. Furthermore, having a proper oral hygiene is becoming day by day a marginal priority: it requires hygienic tools, clean water and constancy while most of the times families cannot face such expenses mainly because of a low and unstable daily income and a current raising costs of the basic goods on the market. RESEARCH METHOD Before starting the fieldwork in Kenya, a preliminary literature research was conducted in the Netherlands in order to explore the topic and prepare all the material needed to gather information from the final users. A set of cultural probes were created taking into consideration two categories of users: mothers and children. Although kids are the final users of the design, their parents have been involved in order to map the context and have a global overview of the social dynamics happening in a Kenyan slum. The adults were asked to share their life conditions through a card games and a photo elicitation session where 4 disposable cameras were provided to a group of families. Furthermore, 8 HIV positive single mothers, belonging to an educative program run by Jukumu Letu called PMTCT (Prevention Mother To Child Training) were the participants of a further session aimed to understand and report the level of awareness about Oral Health and related disorders and risks. Once the designer became aware of the entire context selected for the graduation project, different cultural probes combined with a constant observational research were applied to get in contact with the final users of the design: children from 5 to 7 years old attending the pre-unit class within the kindergarten. The selection of the target user has been done taking into consideration cognitive and creative characteristics, physical skills, socio-emotional and dental development of the participants. In order to understand their life, activities and tastes the designer proposed to them 6 drawing sessions: different topics have been illustrated starting from something familiar (house and family) until something more latent such as personal preferences in term of toys and heroes. The probe surprisingly offered more than expected allowing the designer to select as well the final context of application of his future design proposal: the school. Some sensitizing materials such as nursery rhymes or story telling have always preceded all the sessions and the probes listed before in order to introduce the topic to the participants. RESEARCH FINDINGS Kenyan people mainly consider Oral Health as having white and shining teeth instead of a lack of diseases or infections in their oral cavity. The idea of prevention is quite far: people cannot afford a visit to a dentist and they can only rely on the poor equipped dental offices offered by the governmental health centers. In terms of products, the most part of the families have toothbrushes in their shelters but they usually keep them in very bad conditions for a long period of time. The main problem is definitely related to the difficulty in affording regularly toothpaste for a family use. Even if the price of it is not extremely high (0,50 for 25 ml), people look at it as a big expense during their shopping. Considering the few amount of dentifrice contained in the cheapest tubes and the large number of family members that characterized Kenyan families, toothpaste is almost an expense to face at least 2 times per week. This element represents the main obstacle for a constant oral hygiene also in the kindergartens where teachers and staff are in charge of purchasing and distributing dentifrice for more than a hundred children everyday. CONCEPTUALIZATION & EVALUATION On the basis of a list of requirements obtained by the findings exposed above, the designer developed different design solutions in order to fulfill the demand of his users. The first step was to create a natural toothpaste taking into account local and available resources: the formulation was ideated thanks to the supervision of a specialized doctor from the faculty of Pharmacy in Nairobi Hospital. After this stage, 3 different products and related mock-ups have been designed and evaluated within the kindergarten considering social dynamics and interaction of the users. At the end of the evaluation phase, a participatory design meeting with the teachers of the school allowed the designer to come up with a second list of design requirements aimed to empower and detail the final proposal. FINAL DESIGN & RECOMMENDATIONS The final design can be resumed in a new sustainable scenario for Kenyan kindergartens. The natural toothpaste previously developed is embedded in a design solution, a school dispenser, which allows children to make their own dentifrice everyday and keep their toothbrushes in an ordered and hygienic way. Almost all the ingredients will be planted in the school’s garden by the staff, saving money and offering at the same a “green” education to children. All the actors of the kindergarten are involved, starting from the younger ones that will have the role to transfer the knowledge acquired at home.","oral health; prevention; sustainable scenario; Kenya","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The project aims to develop a lighting solution that meets the latent desires and needs of urban middle class Chinese families in the living room. The user centered research and design approaches such as “Contextmapping” were applied during the process. Through the literature research and the company research, the strength and weakness of current home lighting solutions were identified. After that, the explorative user research was carried out to find out what needs and wishes they had when using light at home. During the session, the current problems and needs were asked. Light intensity and light color temperature are concluded to be the most important parameters that people want to adjust with limited amount of luminaires they have when it comes to ambience settings. They also have desires to have more advanced way of control like using certain sensors. Lacking of local light source for ambience or reading is another significant issue for daily use. Moreover, they have their own contemporary style and more and more emotional and rational needs in life. In addition, urban middle class Chinese family desire to be surrounded by natural things at home such as plants, flowers, scenes of sky and stars on the ceiling etc. since they live in the concrete cities. A baseline study was also conducted with the existing lighting control system in the company to identify the benefits and problems. Followed by the research findings, an interaction vision was generated from a brainstorm session. The vision is enable luminaires to act or co-response with each other and people as “soul mates”. Five ideas came up afterwards with the interaction quality. Three concepts from an abstract level were formulated based on the ideas. The final concept was to control all the lights from one luminaire that users can reach easily. Then all the functions that required from the users together with the insights on existing system were considered to be involved to the design development. The whole consideration during the design process was around how to apply the functions to the contemporary form factors of the luminaire. The system and control interface worked well in the final design. Due to the prototype was not complete with system embedded; further evaluations on the design are needed in the future to find out whether the design meets the needs of urban middle class Chinese families. From the user tests that were already done among the three families, users seem to focus more on the aspects of control than the function of illumination. So more tests are needed to define the position of the product next. The participants indicated that the system was intuitive to use. Generally the evaluation shows that the concept is appreciated by the participants. Therefore, it is a good start for Philips to develop lighting control in the future.","home lighting; experience design; urban middle class Chinese homes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

This research focuses on reproduction of such an experiment by mapping the infrastructural lines which connect Essen and Gelsenkirchen in Ruhrgebiet. Therefore more than just a ribbon, the connection line supposes to be a place for a multi-dimensional spatial experiment which creates a complex labyrinth as a new spatial state in the bordering conditions of the city. ‘Reading between the Lines’ is a thematic exploration of architecture which naturally deals concurrently with symbolic and practical aspect. In this approach, the building is not only a shelter to secure or an enclosure of functions, but is a place of connotation, substance, resource and typology. Moreover, referring to architecture as an interdisciplinary act, this project is working with several media such as photography, drawings, models and rendering. The architectural theory, to create the real space, is constantly explored in painting, sculpture, film, poetry, etc. Accordingly, in this project, the traditional sequence ‘program plus site equals form’ is intentionally inverted. So in every single step of the process the outcome of the previous step is interpreted by various methods. At the first step, some superimposed drawings, so called the final mappings, are produced which illustrate the labyrinthine spatial quality of the spaces of the lines such as ‘wandering and errors, passes and impasses, luminous breakaways and tragic seclusion’. As the second phase is a model scale based on interpretation from one final superimposed drawing result in a composition of volumes, surfaces and elements. As the final step, to develop real architectural spaces, a large number of possible orders of the fragments could be represented. Since the project is site less, thus no geographic limitation is considered. Therefore, there are infinite possible orders of the fragments without any spatial coherence. So, all the fragments become autonomous entities. In addition, focusing on specific themes and developing each fragment based on, leads spaces to be varied in scale, materiality and atmospheric experience. To distinct the heterogeneous spaces, each earn a particular name: Space of Wandering, The Wall (Space of Passage), The Tower (Space of Seclusion), etc. Various techniques of representation have been applied to narrate characteristics of these spaces vividly. Furthermore, within a series of fragments, that eventually generates its own context, understanding of scale is left to imagination of the reader, from one item to another, from mega structure to a cabin size room for one.","Lines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architecture","","Studio Border Conditions","",""

The Netherlands represents merely 2% of the hotel rooms in Europe and is considered to be a small competitor. In the year 2010 the investment volume for hotel real estate was around 100 million euro. That same year global hotel investments were around 7.5 billion euro. Therefore the Netherlands hotel real estate is considered not easily marketable. A hotel is an unique real estate that has product features that do not exists in other income generating real estate. Since the lack of hotel transactions in the Netherlands, the valuation approaches available for an appraiser are limited. Hotels are ‘exploitatiegebonden’ (bound to their operation) and therefore the value of the real estate derives from the operating turnover. The most suitable approach to value hotel real estate is using the business appraisal instead of the real estate appraisal. With that approach the most appropriate method to appraise hotel real estate is the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF method). This approach provides the best insight in the future operating cash flows of a hotel. However, because of the emphasis on determining the value according to the hotel operating turnover, the relation between the product features of the hotel and the value of the real estate remains vague. So if the approach is considered the best to determine the value of hotel real estate what method can explain the best the relation between this value and the product features? The research question, arisen from the vague relation between value and the product features (location, building and user) of a hotel, is: ‘To what extent it is possible to determine the influence that product features have on the market value of a hotel in order to support the appraisal of hotel real estate?’ In order to clarify the relation between the product features and the value of the hotel, knowledge of this relation is needed. To obtain this knowledge the present business approach appraisal of hotel real estate will be first examined. Furthermore an alternative method will be investigated to clarify the relation between the product features and the hotel real estate value. With this understanding it is attempted to construct a model that shows the tangible relation between the product features and the value of hotel real estate. THE VALUE OF HOTEL REAL ESTATE The business value of a hotel is divided into the value of the commercial operation, the real estate and the physical inventory. In order to calculate the market value of a hotel the appraiser has three main approaches to choose: the cost approach, the sales comparison approach and the income approach. The first approach, the cost approach, does not take into account the operating cash flows of a hotel. Therefore this approach is not suitable for hotels. The second approach, the sales comparison approach is neither suitable. This approach only suits easily marketable real estate where lots of real estate transactions are accessible. The two approaches are based on historical data and do not show changes in finance, income, costs and value growth. Concluding that the income approach, preferable the DCF method, is the most suitable approach to apply for hotels. This method provides understanding of future cash flows of a hotel. The DCF method is applicable in both business as in real estate appraisal. For hotel real estate the most favourable approach is the business approach instead of the real estate approach. The latter provides only understanding of the future rental income and the expected cost of the real estate. However, the rent is derived from the gross revenues of the hotel. Therefore, in order to determine the rent, it is still needed to gain understanding in future cash flows of the hotel operating. The Discounted Cash Flow method The DCF method involves estimating a net cash flow for the operating period of a hotel (10 to 15 years) and calculating the present value of the cash flow by discounting the net cash flow using a discount rate. By subtracting the value of the physical inventory and the value of the business (credited to the management and possible franchise agreements) from the total value of the hotel, the value that remains is attributed to the real estate. For this method a realistic estimate of the future cash flows is needed. Normally the room revenue is the most important revenue for a hotel. The occupancy rate and average room rate are the most important. This is also referred to as RevPAR, Revenues Per Available Room. The balance sheet is used as a guide line. Supporting the estimates of the cash flows has been done by looking at historically financial performances and through an analysis of the hotel market. Within the DCF method the holding period, discount rate and the end value of the hotel are the most important features for calculating the most likely value of hotel real estate. What is interesting, is that despite the real estate is being appraised there is no clear correlation between product features and the value of the real estate. The value for real estate is literally a residue after subtracting the other values. The business approach does not show how the value is constructed in terms of real estate features but shows how it is constructed in terms of future cash flow. In order to make this relation more comprehensible, alternatives will be investigated. The sales comparison approach Huizinga (2002), Beuken (2005), ten Have (2007a) and Geer (2006) state that the sales comparison approach is not applicable to hotel real estate to determine the value. However this approach is the most used method of appraisal for real estate and give insight in how the value is constructed. This research does not attempt to determine the value using this method but is merely interested in a clarification of the relationship between hotel real estate features and its value. Therefore this approach is once more examined. The sales comparison approach compares property's characteristics with those of comparable properties. The approach has four methods of appraisal of which the method of multiple regression analysis is the most interesting. Two main reasons why the sales comparison approach is not suitable for hotels in the Netherlands are: firstly hotel real estate is less marketable and more “heterogeneous” than traditional commercial real estate, making it more difficult to compare and secondly there are no sufficient transactions available making it hard to find data. However during this research several studies overseas have shown that the multiple regression analysis deals with the “heterogeneity” aspect in case of enough hotel transactions. In this approach the value of the combined product features of hotels will be decomposed into separate product features. Subsequently it might be possible to reconstruct the value of any hotel by rejoining the separate values of the product features. The combined product features represent the likely total value of the real estate. Now we have dealt with the aspect of “heterogeneity”, the problem of absent hotel transaction in the Netherlands still remains. An alternative is needed. Rushmore (2002), Huizinga (2002), ten Have (2007b) and Beuken (2005) proclaim that the operating turnover of the hotel are the best indicator for the market value. O'Neill and Mattila (2006) even claim that the RevPAR is the best indicator of the market value of hotels. If we assume that this relation is correct, than we have an alternative for the absence of hotel transactions. So therefore in this research it is assumed that the relation between the value of the real estate and the hotel product features can be clarified by using the RevPAR as an alternative. Value adding product features It is obvious first to explore possible relations between the hotel product features and the hotel operating turnover before a multiple regression analysis can be conducted. Factors that influence hotel operating turnover are divided in macro-economic factors, relevant industry factors and micro-economic factors. It is common knowledge that there is a clear relation between the global economy and the market of hotels. The volatile character of the hotel industry indicates that economic, political, demographic, technological, social and climate changes are important. Nonetheless the industry itself has no influence on important factors such as consumer price indices or inflation rates. Developments within the industry determine the ratio between supply and demand of hotel rooms, hotel room price differences or trends in hotel real estate. These are aspects on which hotels can take action by adjusting company objectives or reinventing marketing strategies. The micro-economic factors can be divided in location, building and user. They are more directly connected to the RevPAR and therefore need further elaboration. For location aspects the nearby facilities to attract guest are important. Aspects such as business districts, congress centers and nearby leisure activities can have a positive influence on the operating turnover. Furthermore, accessibility with private and public transport is an import location aspect, especially the proximity of the airport. Hotels are unique and none are the same. A hotel consists of three types of spaces, lodging area, public area and service area. The presence of hotel facilities, the rooms, the quality of the FF&E (Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment) and the (technical) condition of the hotel are important aspects in order to gain high occupancy rates and favourable high room rates. The user of the hotel consists out of the hotel operator and the hotel guest. Research shows that branded hotels with excellent management contribute largely to successful operating turnover. Guests are willing to pay more for a hotel with high standards. But how these guests perceive quality remains an abstract idea. Much has been written about hotel experiences but it remains marketing terminology that is hard to grasp. Social media is a helpful tool in order to make hotel guest experiences tangible. Reviews and ratings of hotels seem to become an important tool for hotel guests to communicate about the immaterial aspects of the hotel product. The multiple regression analysis In order to gain knowledge of the relation between hotel product features and the RevPAR of the hotel, a multiple regression analysis has been conducted. This analysis has been carried out on 100 hotels in the city of Amsterdam. By conducting a multiple regression analysis only on hotels in the city of Amsterdam, a level playing field is created in which the macro-economic and industrial characteristics are identical for every hotel. With this approach the analysis is limited to the location, building and user factors in relation to the RevPAR. The result is model that can predict 64% of the RevPAR: RevPAR = 8.878 + (.53 * booking.com) - (.66 * Schiphol) + (.31 * A10) + (.18 * Station) + (1.08 * Zuid As) - (.33 * Stationcentraal) + (.18 * vergaderfaciliteit) - (.92 * RAI) + (.40 * NHCmiddensegment) + (.28 * NHChoogsegment) This research demonstrates that if hotel transactions are not available, information about the RevPAR is an excellent substitute. By a statistical comparison of hotels on the basis of the RevPAR, further understanding is given into the hotel product features that are adding value to the RevPAR and with that the value of the hotel real estate. In an appropriate manner the value of hotel real estate is further explained. Assumptions made by appraisers about this relation are now supported by a more objective statistical analysis of hotel product features and their value.","hotel; vastgoed; exploitatie; producteigenschappen; waarde; multipleregressie","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-10-31","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","","",""

(mentor); Lindwer, M. (mentor)","2011","In the last decade, the importance of graphics capabilities have become very important in the mobile market. As a result low power embedded solutions for mobile devices have been eveloped to run computationally intensive graphics applications, which extensively uses floating point calculations. The work proposed in this thesis target the extension of the Silicon Hive processors capabilities for graphics applications. The Silicon Hive core generation flow that allows to introduce a very high degree of parallelism can be efficiently used to generate a processor for graphics. In order to achieve that, in this thesis, we present an hybrid VLIW/SIMD floating point processor derived from the base Silicon Hive VLIW architecture, Pearl Ray. The hardware mplementation of floating point functional units is realized using the Synopsys DesignWare building blocks, which are designed in a way that allows the efficient use of register retiming option in the Design Compiler flow, in order to introduce pipeline stages and improve the timing. The proposed architecture can process 8-way vectors, consisting of 32-bit vector elements. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed architecture a Ray Tracing algorithm, has been mapped on the developed processor. We have shown that the ray tracing algorithm efficiently exploits the full power of floating point vector instructions and also the instruction level parallelism provided by both the VLIW and the SIMD (Vector) nature of our processor. The results shown that a close-to-linear speed-up can be achieved for the Ray Tracing algorithm using the proposed architecture. Finally, the performance of the proposed extended VLIW/SIMD floating point processor has been compared with a very high-end graphic processing unit and a general purpose processor, in terms of number of cycles, total execution time and power consumption on the same Ray Tracing algorithm. The results show that proposed extended Silicon Hive processor can compete with both the GPU and the CPU in terms of execution times. Furthermore, it overperforms the 8 core machine after the execution time is normalized with respect to corresponding clock frequencies. The overall performance on the GPU is slightly better than the proposed processor. However, the advantage of our extended embedded processor becomes clear when the area and the power consumption values are taken into account. Whereas the GPU and the CPU consumes around 140 watt and 85 watt power, respectively, our floating point VLIW/SIMD processor consumes only 0.2-0.3 watt.","SIMD; Silicon Hive; VLIW; Processor; Ray Tracing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-11-06","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","With the increasing complexity of current embedded applications, and the mobility required in embedded devices, new approaches are being proposed to optimize the power and the energy consumed by an application, at higher levels of abstraction levels and in earlier stages in a design flow. However, one essential part of a structured and guided optimization process, is the early prediction of the power and energy consumption using only the available information at early design stages. These predictions are used as function costs in optimization algorithms to prune the design space exploration in different design stages. In this thesis we aim to improve the partitioning process of the Delft Workbench design flow, for this purpose, we propose a modelling methodology that can generate power and energy models. The models can provide quantitative data that can be used to guide the decisions made in the partitioning process. The partitioning process in the DWB uses as level of abstraction a function described in a high level language (HLL), such as C-code, and targets heterogeneous architectures. Therefore, the methodology we propose can generate models that predict the power and energy consumed by a kernel when is running in a processing element of heterogeneous architectures, such as a general purpose processor (GPP) or an PPGA. For the validation of this methodology we designed a set of experiment that create models of power and energy consumption for a StrongARM processor (using the Sim-Panalyzer simulator), and a Virtex 5 FPGA (using the xpwr tool of Xilinx). A maximum absolute rooted mean squared error (RMSE) of 60mW was obtained for the power models, and a maximum absolute RMSE of 8.69 x 10^-6 was obtained for the energy models.","system design; embedded; power; partitioning; fpga; power modelling; design methodology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Van de Geer, S.G. (mentor)","2011","Since 2000, vacancy in office buildings in the Netherlands rose to nearly 15% (over seven million square meters) of the total amount of office space. In comparison, the regular vacancy rate in a healthy office space market fluctuates around 5%. A certain amount of the vacant office space is structural, meaning it has been available for three or more years. Structural vacancy is seen as a societal problem, leading to downgrading and dilapidation of buildings and whole areas. Redevelopment of existing office buildings for other functions such as housing seems to be an interesting opportunity to gain new incomes. Stichting Tijdelijke Transformatie van Kantoren is an association of small investors and entrepreneurs which developed a concept to convert empty office buildings into housing for students, lofts or even hotels. The concept consists of a sanitation facility which contains a shower, sink, toilet and a kitchen. Together with Poly Products (a leading producer of customized, high quality fiber-reinforced plastic products, facings and constructions), this concept will be developed into a final product to enter the market with. STTK has set a goal to link the growing amount of unused office space to the great need of affordable housing. At the moment, there is a great shortage of student housing in the Netherlands. Knowing this, and the fact that student residences are most interesting for transformation of vacant office buildings as well as considered from yield potential, STTK has chosen to focus on temporary student housing; temporary, because of the lower demands within the building regulations and the faster legal arrangements. Legislation analysis showed that there are a lot of legislations applied on construction within existing buildings. These legislations can be found within the Dutch building regulations. Besides these legislations possible office buildings were inspected. This way was found out that the units need to be transported by elevator, which will limit and determine the sizes of the outer dimensions the parts can be. Knowing that these buildings still have sufficient toilets available that can be reused, the decision is made to exclude the toilet from the design. Also the sinks at these toilet blocks can be used easily. With the competition analyzed, it is stated that there are three competitors within the same market field, these are the Smartcube, the Cubi and the Woonmachine. All three were analyzed thoroughly to look for their weaknesses and strengths. All this resulted in a list of requirements, ready for sketching. Many different ideas were drawn up, clustered and the best three ideas were further developed into concepts and compared. One concept was chosen to be developed into the final product which is called the Honeycomb, named after its shape. Due to its honeycomb shape the units are very compact but give you a feeling of space inside. Besides, they can easily be connected together for the ease of electricity, water supply and disposal; but also to create a playful effect and minimize space consumption. Within the bathroom there is a shower with enough storage for your soap and shampoos. A small sink is placed for styling your hair, shaving or brushing your teeth. A frosted glass door prevents from feeling trapped due to its transparency. The frosted glass makes it impossible for you to see exactly who’s in there but you easily notice when it is in use. The design consists six main parts which can be connected together like big jigsaw puzzle and sealant to get it water tight. This way the bathrooms can be easily reused by cutting the sealant and removing it, and install it the same way at another place. At last an evaluation of the project with several suggestions for improvement is given.","prefab bathroom; vacancy; office buildings; student housing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-10-28","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Roscam Abbing, E. (mentor); Martens, S. (mentor)","2011","Philips Healthcare wants to enter the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) market with Ambient Experience (AE). This requires a well-thought out business plan that demonstrates why it is interesting for Philips to enter the NICU market with AE. There are different methods to determine why Philips should (not) enter the NICU market with AE. Design research is a method that approaches these type of questions from a user (context) perspective. Consumers are invited to illustrate and reflect on their experiences, for instance through collages or artifacts. This project has followed a context mapping method, because it is a powerful and proven design research technique to map the context of stakeholders and identify their needs. This information enables Philips to demonstrate why AE does (not) have the right ingredients to address these needs. The NICU contains four main stakeholders: the baby, the parents, the NICU staff and the hospital administrators. This project has specifically focused on understanding what is important for administrators in the NICU, because information about the needs of parents and the NICU staff has already been captured by Philips in a previous research study. The analysis and the context study have demonstrated that neonatal intensive care is a complex market with a broad range of opportunity areas for Philips AE. Administrators find three topics most important in the NICU. Obviously, delivering high quality care to babies and their parents is a top priority. Many hospitals seek for a position of excellence in a certain neonatal care discipline such as complex cardiology surgeries. This requires top facilities and dedicated, experienced NICU staff members that are well-educated. Secondly, the ability to anticipate efficiently to fluctuating patient volumes and different levels of care that most babies need is very important. Currently, babies are transferred from one care level to another, because each care level requires different medical and mechanical support. Eventually, administrators want to create flexible NICU rooms that can easily be adapted to the desired care level. This means that babies can stay in the same room throughout the whole care process. Administrators have addressed that the business role of the NICU is most important. The NICU is a very profitable service line, unlike many other service lines in a hospital. The NICU has an important role in attracting customers and retaining them for future services. Because of payment reforms the profitability of the NICU might be under pressure in the near future. To respond to this reform, administrators will focus on patient satisfaction scores, effective preventive care and process reliability in the near future. Administrators perceive dedicated family spaces and support services for NICU families (family-centered care) as two important investments to increase patient satisfaction scores and retaining customers for future services. To create promising and competitive propositions that address a major need of NICU stakeholders and that match the vision and brand of Philips, a design focus was defined. The design focus provides a well-defined and more concrete scope. Philips is advised to focus on two specific solution directions. Solution direction one focuses on support services for NICU families, which is a new market with great potential for Philips to gain market share and establish sales growth. Developing support services for NICU families enables Philips to target every NICU, regardless their design and configuration. Furthermore, support services for NICU families are an important differentiator for administrators in the future. Solution direction two focuses on a communication system for the NICU. This direction addresses the need for a solution that reduces noise levels in the NICU. Introducing a communication system that is results in more peaceful and quiet NICU rooms, supports hospitals in realizing a great experience for NICU families and stimulating a steady growth of the baby. Two concrete concepts have been developed to open a dialogue with experts, NICU stakeholders, Philips project stakeholders and designers about these selected solution direction. The first concept is an example of a potential Philips support service for NICU families. The Preemie-monitor is a tablet computer with a dedicated NICU application for parents who either have a premature baby or expect to have a premature baby. The Preemie-monitor application enables parents to access information about a variety of topics whenever they want. The aim is to present information in such a way that parents can easily understand what is going on. The objective of the Preemie-monitor is to optimize and increase the involvement of parents during the stay of their baby in the NICU. The Preemie-monitor application provides parents the option to send video messages or to ask questions about the care process or condition of their baby. Physicians and nurses receive questions and video messages from parents on a Preemie-monitor in the NICU. Video messages and questions from parents enable physicians and nurses to prepare the right level of information and to provide the best support during the next visit of the parents. In turn, physicians and nurses can send parents video messages to share information about the condition of the baby or to explain care treatments and communicate other relevant news and topics. The second concept is an example of a potential Philips communication system for the NICU. The Communicator is a remote communication system that aims at reducing sound levels and enabling physicians and nurses in the NICU to communicate with each other intuitively rather than using phones or pagers. For instance, nurses and physicians receive warning signals via the earpiece of the Communicator if the monitoring equipment measures a critical value. The Communicator supports hospitals to realize quiet NICUs and to increase the workflow of physicians and nurses. On the basis of the concept evaluation, Philips AE is recommended to move forward with support services for NICU families. To establish a feasible product-service system and a truly explorative interface, Philips is recommended to partner with a key account that can function as a pilot location for the Preemie-monitor application. Considering the fast growing market of smart phones and tablets, Philips should investigate to what extend it would be beneficial to only offer a Preemie-monitor software application to hospitals. Parents can easily download the Preemie-monitor application on a separate website of Philips. Philips is recommended to set-up a NICU excellence center in cooperation with leading healing environment architects, parallel to the development of the Preemie-monitor. This NICU excellence center is a physical building that will move Philips into the inner circle of the hospital not as a seller or vendor but as a partner, offering hospitals quality solutions, data and evidence in the early stages of NICU investment decision-making processes. The context study has demonstrated that administrators generally do not involve vendors such as Philips in analyzing possible solutions and gathering evidence to justify their business plan. However, it is very relevant for hospitals to involve a third party such as Philips early in this process, for instance when a hospital is reconstructing (parts of) the NICU. Philips has knowledge and expertise that could help hospitals to imagine and create innovations they never thought about. A business plan is required to estimates the potential profit of this so-called future concept strategy.","design research; context mapping; NICU; Ambient Experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-10-28","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

In this research, a number of main elements of EM, which require stakeholder commitment are identified. These elements may either be associated with the actual intent to pursue the ensisioned goal or associated with insight in the business and (business) requirements, which determines the ‘required level of commitment’. Based on the mechanisms influencing the required level of commitment, recommendations are made to enhance stakeholder commitment to each of the main elements in EM that has been identified.","Enterprise modelling; collaborative modelling; participative modelling; commitment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Afdeling Multi Actor Systems","","systems engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Mourik, F. (mentor)","2011","This thesis describes the design process of a temporary wayfinding system, Breathing Signposting, for the Dutch Design Week. The nine-day design event takes place yearly in late October and attracts over 150.000 visitors. The goal of this project was to develop a new concept for a temporary wayfinding system. The system should provide insights in the more than 400 activities and the related 65 locations, which are scattered throughout the city of Eindhoven. Wayfinding en signposting Signposting is not only directional information along the road; signposting is more. To understand signposting it is necessary to understand the theory of wayfinding. Wayfinding is the way in which people and animals orientate themselves in a physical space and navigate from place to place. Signposting is a product, which supports someone in finding his or her way. A signposting product must enable the user to navigate through cities, buildings or other environments to reach a desired but unknown location. Analysis The user of the signposting, in this case the visitor DDW, plays an important role. In recent years, DDW has developed different signage products. However, despite the background and reason of visit all types of visitors experienced problems with the signage of DDW. A survey analyses concluded that most problems were the result of inconsistent and missing signage products. During a re-experience of DDW 2010 it became clear that the visitor is minimal prepared. Often the visitor only knew the name of the (main) locations, and the participants they wanted to visit. They expected to get more information and help at arrival. The context has a major influence on the realization of signs. Eindhoven, one of the largest cities in the Netherlands, is during DDW divided into four areas, Strijp, Central Station, City Hall and White Lady. The areas, which form the basic layout of the event, vary in environment characteristics. Narrow streets and tall buildings can turn into open spaces and greenery. Approximately 400 activities are divided over 65 different locations in 9 days. This is what makes the DDW, and especially its way finding system complex. They extremely temporary character of some of the events, make it even harder. The visitor has troubles with keeping the overview and selecting activities. Participants use or arrange their own location in Eindhoven. Creating logical location clusters of events is thereby virtually impossible. Design of new information structure The assignment consisted of two parts: the development of a new information structure and the design of the associated signage products. The information structure contains the layout of the base of the event and an improved program set-up. For the new program set-up all activities and locations were reviewed and restructured. Also the layout was adapted, including: the definition of start and end points, area classification and the creation of routes. Literature and other temporary events were a good source for inspiration. The way finding products are based on the consumer needs, in this case; the visitor. Personas and scenarios were used to establish the signage information needs. These needs are translated into the following way finding products (forming the signage system); a map, an information point, a parking information, a location indication and routing. Design of products Since these 5 different products form a system, a consistent factor needed to be developed to create unity. Therefor the concepts were developed around certain themes. Eventually one concept was selected out of three. The insights gained with testing, simulating and model making, lead to a final design: ” Breathing Signposting”. Explanation concept Breathing signposting is a concept, which not only provides insight and structure to the event it also creates an experience. By focusing on sustainability and green a unique signposting concept is created. The five-signposting products have their own implementation and designs, but they form a unity as well. By using living plants an extra dimension is added to the product, which enhances the experience of the signposting. The concept becomes more playful with the routing inspired by a breadcrumb trail. There is also an idea to extent the routing of the DDW into the digital world; with an Exposition application. Testing & Evaluation The product range has been tested on the requirements (generated from the analysis). Improvements contain a more extended product-detailing phase, to optimize the cost. The information structure turned out to work almost flawlessly. However the way finding system, with its supporting products, have never been tested as a whole. Therefore it is recommended to make a simulation to test all elements and their interaction.","Temporary Signposting system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Separated groups of people are living together in one area, but without any feeling of a city community. The growing dominance of wireless communication and information has made it possible for people to be dynamic and always up to date. For some, the overload of information becomes hard to manage. While the city expands, personal mobility is under pressure. Local governments make the city livable for inhabitants, forcing personal transport such as the car out of city centres. This vehicle tries to set an example with the socially openminded people. Together they share vehicles scattered around the city and dynamicly use them to connect their mobility. It makes the users FEEL SYNERGY BETWEEN THEM AND THE CITY WHILE DOING SOMETHING BENEFICIAL FOR THE COLLECTIVE. The concept gives an opportunity to build and be part of a community. It gives inspiring insight to the city. And it takes away spacial boundaries within the city. The final design consists of three layers. The Car layer makes the vehicle mobile. It uses hub engines to propell the vehicle through the city in a clean and efficient way. The City layer forms a square space with four chairs that can be individually moved into or out of the interior space. The space is perfect for moving people as well as goods. The interior is divided in a ‘touch’ waiste layer and ‘no-touch’ floor layer indicating the shared utility aspect. The People layer froms the window to the world. It features doorcuts and pillars that enable the occupants to have a wide scope onto the cityscape. The windows feature parallax-barrier OLED displays for augmented reality. They project information onto the city to make the connection between the user and the city information more direct. The layer also features active safety and automated driving systems that ensure the safety of passengers as well as city inhabitants.","automotive; city; design; mobility; vision in product design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master specialisation Automotive","",""

(mentor); Rook, L. (mentor)","2011","The topic of company competences is approached by many theories in literature, each from its own perspective. In this thesis the focus is mainly on the competence-based view. The competence-based perspective claims that core competences are the source of sustainable competitive advantage, and are the unique capabilities which span over multiple products or markets. Competences are one of the several factors that can influence the competitive advantage of the firm. In its turn, competences may be dependent on many factors itself, such as the Technology Life Cycle (TLC) phase and the type of industry. In practice many of the companies involved in the process of development and diffusion fail even before their products manage to reach the mass market. Because of dynamic markets organisations are showing more interest in managing change processes within their firms. Responding to the environment by creating, leveraging, and managing competences has taken a greater role in firms’ strategic flexibility. This area in research raises many questions: Why do some firms succeed while others fail? Is the success of firms rooted in anything more than luck? Are there systematic patterns that discriminate those companies who are able to change and survive versus those that fail? How do firms adapt to their dynamic environments? And is exit and failure of a firm the same? The goal of this research is two-folded: A general list of company competences is developed and categorised which can be used in the future as a checklist; and an extensive study is conducted on how companies adapt to the environment which provides insight in competence-building. This is mainly done through literature research and qualitative meta-analysis. The developed list of company competences consists of the following main competences: Market-oriented competences; technology-oriented competences; network-oriented competences; and management-oriented competences. The literature on company’s competence adaptation leads to a division of the findings into three categories. First, there is literature claiming that firms are not able to evolve along time but replaced by new firms that better fit the changed context. Second, there is literature that claims that firms are able to cope with changing markets through evolving along time. And third, there is literature that claims that firms cope with changing markets by being ambidextrous which is a firm that both explores and exploits. There are different factors explained that influence competence-building or altering: The types of learning that a company adopts; the knowledge development and managing system; reordering and revitalising strategies; internal growth; external growth (acquisitions); strategic alliances and networking; industry-level changes; management cognitions; strategy; configurations of discipline, stretch, trust, and support; and modularity. This research will lead to theory expansion. Researchers benefit from this work as it provides an overview and analysis of the main organisational theories on this topic and in this way fills a scientific gap. This work can be used as a basis in future research which researchers can consult when for example they want to make sure they have taken the main factors into account in their research. From a managerial perspective the findings gathered in this thesis are also of value, as they provide more insight into organisational processes which will benefit the decision-making abilities of managers, and because potential tools are presented to lead firms in a dynamic environment towards enduring competitive advantage. This knowledge can be used for discussion and brainstorming on which competences their company should internalise.","competences; adapt; dynamic environment; high-tech companies; competitive advantage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, strategy, entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Lendek, Z. (mentor); Khalate, A.A. (mentor)","2011","Adaptive fuzzy observers have been introduced in the recent past, which are capable of estimating uncertainties along with the states of a nonlinear system represented by an uncertain Takagi-Sugeno (TS) model. Application of such an observer to obtain estimates of the uncertainties in the state matrices and subsequently use them in the control of TS fuzzy models is the subject matter of this thesis. To demonstrate the adaptive observer and the controller design we use a 2-DOF robot arm model. The parameters of the robot arm are estimated for a laboratory-scale setup. The nonlinear model of the robot arm, consisting of six nonlinearities is simplified to contain only two nonlinearities. Then a four-rule TS fuzzy model is constructed using sector nonlinearity approach. The simplified nonlinear model and hence the fuzzy model almost exactly represent the complete nonlinear model. The mismatch in the plant and the nonlinear model is attributed to unmodelled dynamics in the state matrices. Assuming constant uncertainties in specific locations of the state matrices, an adaptive observer is used to estimate them and the simulation results are presented. The possibility to use the information about the structure of the uncertainties in the TS fuzzy model in designing the uncertainty estimation experiment is also presented. The uncertainty estimates provided by the adaptive observer are used to update the fuzzy model of the nonlinear system. The new model is used in the design of a robust state feedback stabilizing controller. Since the estimates obtained from the adaptive observer are used in controller design, the uncertainty distribution structure used in the design of both adaptive observer and the robust controller need to be same. Hence, a robust controller design is developed that uses the same uncertainty distribution structure as the adaptive observer. From the experimental results, it is concluded that stability can be guaranteed with a higher decay rate when using the updated model in robust controller design.","adaptive fuzzy observer; robust fuzzy control; LMI; sector nonlinearity; nonlinear control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor)","2011","Software as a Service (SaaS) model allows subscription to a wide variety of application services that are developed specifically for and delivered over the Internet on an as-needed basis without the need to install and manage third-party software in-house. According to Salesforce.com Inc the wide adoption of SaaS model will eventually lead to the end of on-premise software era. Currently the success of SaaS model goes hand-in-hand with popularity of cloud computing. For instance, recently Google in collaboration with Samsung introduced to the mass-market their Chromebook with cloud-based operational system Chrome OS on board, which is also delivered as a service. Nevertheless, the idea of outsourcing the software or hardware is not new. Before SaaS there was Application Service Provider (ASP) model that in the past considered being very promising as well, but failed to meet the requirements of the wide market and serves a niche market today. The interesting fact is that ASP and SaaS models are very similar and some authors even don’t make distinction between them. However, we believe that there are differences between them that affected the adoption of the models. Thus, we have set two objectives for this study. First is to conduct comparison analysis of two software delivery models from business model perspective and study factors that possibly affected the adoption. Second is to identify components of the business model that require changes in order to make a shift from one software delivery model to another and barriers that hamper these alterations. Therefore this research raised the following main research question: “Why is Software-as-a-Service model more successful today than the model applied by Application Service Providers?” In order to answer the main research question above, we have formed four sub-questions, answers for which were used as a foundation for the final analysis. We have adopted two theoretical frameworks to answer research questions. Firstly, in order to get an overview of the past and current state of the cloud computing industry, the diffusion and development patterns theory was used. Secondly, for the purpose of software delivery models comparison we took the STOF business model framework through which it was possible to highlight differing components of SaaS and ASP. Subsequently, we have formed and validated six propositions through two completely independent methods – case studies and expert interviews. The results showed that business models of SaaS and ASP differ in four components: Technical Architecture particularly Software Architecture, Pricing, Cost and Market Segment. As predicted the most important component turned out to be the Technical Architecture that practically co-determined differences in other aspects. We confirmed that the Technical Architecture of the SaaS model is better in reaching ‘economies of scale’ compared to the ASP model, therefore the SaaS model was able to cut costs, drop service prices and serve wider markets which positively contributed to the large-scale diffusion of the model. 2 Evolution of the Software-as-a-Service model Furthermore, a set of recommendations for managers on ways of switching from one software delivery model to another were formed. We also conclude that although the SaaS has more advanced software architecture that makes it more successful on the market, it is still not a perfect solution for all types of companies. Mainly because of security issues that multi-tenant architecture entails, the enterprise application delivered over the ASP model could be a solution for certain market niches dealing with sensitive data, lacking IT expertise and willing to pay extra for the service. Therefore before committing to a certain model, providers have to carefully consider which type of companies they are able and willing to serve. It is also very important for companies that already have large installed base of customers and legacy software with single-tenant architecture. We found that virtualization technologies are rapidly developing and practically enable single-tenant applications to “fake” multi-tenancy and run on comparatively high levels of resource utilization as the SaaS model. Therefore the first recommendation for the traditional enterprise software providers would be to decide whether they are willing to maintain their current market segment or capture a wider market of SMEs and even individual end-consumers. Based on that decision, the most suitable architecture could be chosen. However, this study has some limitations among which the most serious is the lack of attention to external macro economical factors that could play an important role in diffusion and development of the innovation. Although, to partially cover that topic was done, it still requires more careful and extensive research. Therefore suggestion would be to consider it as an opportunity for the further research in this field.","Software as a Service (SaaS); Application Service provider (ASP); Cloud computing; Diffusion and development pattern of high-tech innovation; Business model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-12-01","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

To render the interpolated views, the depth information of the left and right views are commonly-used in view synthesis algorithm. Therefore, this thesis researches stereo matching algorithms, which generate disparity maps. We implement a state-of-the-art semi-global stereo matching algorithm(dynamic programming and cross based) with FPGA. Our solution also concerns several aspects include disparity map/sequences quality, hardware cost, and real-time performance. Afterward the stereo matching engine design is integrated into IMEC's 3D TV SoC prototype. Several peripheral components, include color space converters, video I/O adaptors and a dedicated memory hierarchy, are developed for supporting both stereo matching and view synthesis engines. Finally, the SoC prototype is evaluated with EP3SL150 FPGA chip. So far it can process dual channel XGA video format (1024x768 @ 60 FPS) in real-time performance and render an acceptable synthesized view quality for depth scaling application.

(mentor)","2011","The integrated circuit industry builds integrated circuits (IC’s) by placing many layers of semi conductive material on top of each other, the smallest details in such a layer are called features. Each layer has its own specific layout and will form together with the other layers three dimensional structures such as transistors, diodes or resistors. The final result is an integrated circuit which is called a chip of which a large number of them are fabricated all at once on a round silicon wafer. A position error between these two layers is called an overlay error, the final chip might not function correctly or not at all if this overlay error exceeds certain limits. It is important to minimize this error to obtain a high yield per wafer. As the features are getting smaller in size, the position of a ’new’ layer with respect to the layer below becomes more critical. High end position measurement equipment is required to minimize this overlay error. The lithography-machines involved with the production of these IC’s are expensive due their advanced technology and are therefore subject to high wafer throughput to reduce costs. These processes require thus a measurement tool which can measure with low measurement uncertainty to minimize the overlay error, while allowing for high target velocity. A laser interferometer is such a measurement tool which is able to measure accurate and fast enough to be used for these processes. The laser light required by interferometers to operate in current lithography-machines is guided along corners by mirrors, over meters long optical pathways. This method of light transport is sensitive for environmental disturbances and requires realignment once maintenance is carried out, this is a time consuming and thus costly process. The current interferometer systems also contain small periodic nonlinearities, this nonlinear error presence in the position measurements will become problematic for future systems which require increasingly smaller overlay errors. At the TU Delft a theoretical periodic error free type of interferometer has been build (see Figure 6), based upon spatial separation of optical measurement pathways. This system has shown to operate with sub-nm measurement uncertainty (see Appendices B.1 and B.2) using free-space source frequency delivery. Replacing the free-space beam delivery by fiber-coupled delivery allows for modular plug-and-play systems. No more sensitive to air turbulence, but the light transported by the fibers is unfortunately negatively affected by several phenomena and requires more in depth research. The Delft interferometer concept (Figure 6) knows multiple configurations, two of them have been build for this research: the Delft Corner Cube- and the Generalized Delft-configuration. Three measurement systems have been realized to research operation when the source frequencies are delivered by different types of fibers. The first system, System I, concerns the Generalized Delft configuration with free-space beam delivery with the purpose of reproduction of previous results (see Appendices B.1 and B.2). The obtained results serve as reference for the measurements obtained from the second system, System II. In this system the source frequencies are delivered by polarization maintaining single mode fibers (i.e. pmfibers) instead of mirrors. The second system was build study the sub-nm measurement uncertainty using these pm-fibers for beam delivery, instead of free-space beam delivery. The results obtained from this research are published in the first article of this report, Article I: Fiber-coupled displacement interferometry without periodic nonlinearity. The third measurement system, System III, was build to research the performance of graded index multimode fibers (i.e. mm-fibers) for source frequency delivery for the Delft Corner Cube configuration. These fibers allow for easier alignment and higher optical coupling efficiency compared to pm-fibers. However the ease in handling results in lower optical output quality: the fiber does not maintain polarization state, the initial optical wavefront will be deformed during transport and multiple optical modes will be present in its output. The results obtained with this system are published in the second chapter of this report, Article II: Displacement interferometry with fiber-coupled delivery. Conclusions from the research: Yes, it is possible to measure with sub-nm measurement uncertainty using pm-fiber delivered source frequencies for the Generalized Delft interferometer. We have shown that the periodic nonlinearity was not visible down to the noisefloor (40pm). The same conclusion holds for mm-fiber delivered source frequencies using the Delft Corner Cube interferometer. Both fiber-coupled systems show phase broadening behavior in their measurement results, caused by the birefringent nature of the fibers. This behavior can be seen best in the results using mm-fibers. At first sight this fortunately does not affect the measurement uncertainty. Experimental results confirm that fiber induced phase shifts caused by fiber deformation, are canceled out due the configuration of the Delft interferometer and the differential measurement between the photodetectors. The time varying polarization orientation of the light delivered by mm-fibers in System III, results in interference fluctuations as expected. Nevertheless, the interference signal was not lost during measurements and the fiber coupled system can still measure with sub-nm measurement uncertainty. Building the two fiber coupled systems (System II & III) has shown that pm-fibers require much effort regarding alignment and obtaining a sufficiently high optical coupling efficiency. The finally achieved optical output was of high quality. Multi mode fibers behaved opposite, they were very easy in handling but resulted in a less high optical output quality. Using fiber delivery for the Delft interferometers opens the way towards the design of a modular fibercoupled sub-nm interferometer measurement system. The optical symmetry of the design has shown to be very robust towards phase disturbances, but more research is required regarding system robustness and applicability.","Nano; Heterodyne; Interferometry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-11-25","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

This project is part of project ‘‘Heel gewoon, Handen schoon’’, a cooperation project of Erasmus MC and GGD Rotterdam-Rijnmond. The aim of that project is to reduce the number of infections among children by improving the hand hygiene of both caregivers and children. First of all information about the aim of this project was gathered in the analysis phase. Literature research was carried out to find information about soap dispensers and its surrounding issues. Field research was conducted to find out what the expectances of the stakeholders of this project were. With this information a specific design direction and design vision of this project were formed. It was decided to design a wall mounted soap dispenser with the main focus to improve hand hygiene of children at child day care centers. With this specific design aim various ideas were generated based on inspiration sources. Next to that a creative session has been carried out to get ideas from other people that look at the problem from a different perspective. Finally six ideas have been developed, each one created specifically for the needs of the key stakeholders. Three of these ideas were chosen for further development in the concept phase. The choice was based on the all-round potential the ideas showed and on the opinion of two caregivers of a child day care center in Sassenheim. In the concept development phase the three chosen ideas were elaborated to a level that shows they can result into feasible products. The functions, the aesthetics and the production of the concepts have been elaborated in detail. With this detailed information one of the concepts has been chosen to develop further. A Harris profile has been made to compare the concepts. The ratings of the concept were based on small tests, the opinion of caregivers and firm estimations. Finally the ‘‘Funny Fish’’ concept was chosen to develop as final product of this project. A digital model of the ‘‘Funny Fish’’ concept was made to optimize the details. Based on this model a prototype has been made for a final user test. This test was conducted at two child day care centers which have never used or seen the dispenser before. During this test some improvement points has been noticed, but generally the children liked the dispenser and it did what it was designed for; stimulating children to wash their hands (for a longer time). Finally the noticed improvement points have been written down as recommendations for the future.","hand hygiene; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

The aim of this study is to perform a detailed numerical investigation into the nearshore behaviour of infragravity waves. Specific attention is paid to the generation, propagation and reflection of IG-waves.","numerical modelling; SWASH; IDSB; infragravity waves","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Dynamics","",""

(mentor); Silvester, S. (mentor)","2011","Mobility is one of the key challenges of the 21st century and its continued development will be influenced by a wide variety of factors. Perhaps the most notable of these factors is sustainability. As society recognizes the increasing importance of sustainable development, it is clear that current mobility behaviors have to change. Private car use is perhaps among the most unsustainable of behaviors, as many private cars sit unused 20+ hours a day and contribute to noise and air pollution, congested traffic and limited parking, especially in cities. The role of cars in society is changing and thus the traditional approaches to car use should also adapt or change. A new model has emerged that allows conscious individuals to share their cars with other drivers around them. Peer-to-peer (P2P) car sharing has already been successfully implemented in a number of cities and Wheels4all intends to be first to introduce this concept to the Netherlands. New technologies, such as the use of smart phones, make car sharing even more feasible than ever and less unused cars will result in lower CO2 levels, fewer parked cars, more conscious car use and lower costs for all stakeholders involved. Since, on average, cars are unused 20+ hours per day, a new P2P car sharing model would increase their efficiency and utilization to ultimately benefit car owners, neighborhoods and society as a whole. A service design approach was applied to develop the MyWheels P2P car sharing system. The user interactions, business model and legal aspects were addressed, with particular emphasis on the role of trust in the system. The result is a comprehensive view of the function and aspects of the MyWheels service and how users will interact with the system and each other.","service design; PSS; car sharing; mobility services","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-10-26","Industrial Design Engineering","Delft Design Institute","","","",""

(mentor); Van Lint, J.W.C. (mentor); Wiggenraad, P.B.L. (mentor); Annema, J.A. (mentor); De Bok, M. (mentor)","2011","Globalisation of economy and changes in personal lifestyle have fuelled the importance of reliability in transport network and services. All travellers have experienced congestion and delays. Sometimes it can have consequences, for example missing an appointment or arriving late. Congestion occurs when demand exceeds capacity. This often happens in peak periods, and is often expected. However this can also happen in case of unexpected disruptions, for example in adverse weather conditions or when accidents occur. In order to eliminate disruptions to the highway network when congestion levels arise, it is sometimes intervened with implementation of transport and infrastructure projects and policy measures. The social and economic benefits of these measures are usually only related to reductions in average travel times in cost benefits analysis (CBA). However an important element could be missing from these estimates, as the total net benefits (or costs) could be incorrect when not addressing the reliability of travel times as well. Today, travel time reliability is accounted for implicitly in Dutch CBAs by adding a 25% surcharge on travel time gains. This method is questionable. It is expected that road traffic in the Netherlands will grow in coming years. To be able to manage impending development, it will be needed to intervene with extra measures. As one of the mobility policy goals for the year 2020 is to increase reliability of the road network, determining effects of policy measures on travel time reliability becomes a very important topic. The main scope of this research is to determine effects of policy measures on travel time reliability. First of all, a definition and method to measure the reliability was needed in order to conduct the analysis. As a means to do so, available literature on the matter was reviewed. There it became clear that there exist many indicators to measure reliability of travel times. Reliable travel times are considered to be travel times that show little variation and can be well predicted. Travel time reliability is though a relative concept as what is considered an acceptable travel time can be different from person to person. Indicators for travel time reliability are usually related to characteristics of the day-to-day travel time distribution. The indicators are different from one another and capture different parameters of the distributions. This is why it was decided to test a range of indicators for the analysis. The data behind the analysis consisted of route travel times of the Dutch highway network, from the period 2001 to 2009. This data enabled an expost study of the effects of different policy measures, implemented in the network, on reliability. The methodology chosen for the anlysis was before and after studies of specific implementations of policy measures. The reason for choosing that methodology was because the network is complex, and the routes are different from one another, making the effects of the policy measure dependent on location and prevailing traffic conditions. Five different implementations of policy measures were chosen for the analysis, they were;  Rush hour lane on A13  Permanent lane on A4  Enforced speed restriction on A10  Dynamic route information panel on A12  Ramp meters on A10 The chosen indicators for reliability were computed for periods before and after implementations of these measures. Time-space plots of vehicle speeds on the locations of these measures were also plotted. This gave a better understanding of prevailing traffic conditions. The results of the research showed that there is no clear-cut relationship between a certain policy measure and travel time reliability. It is all dependent on location and circumstance of each measure. The indicators for reliability also proved to be inconsistent with each other. The indicators tell different stories. The choice of indicator should be reflected in what definition is put into reliability, and what the expected impacts of the measure analysed are. The results also questioned the legitimacy of accounting for reliability in CBA by means of a 25% surcharge on travel time gains, as improvements were seen in mean travel time for some cases but not in the reliability indicators, and vice versa. In order to to compute the economic impacts of reliability, a value of reliability is needed. As of yet, no generally accepted values exist that are used in official national CBA. What this value should be is beyond the scope of this research.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Blom, E.M. (mentor); Saidi, M.A.R. (mentor); Herder, P.M. (mentor)","2011","The expected increase in future demand of biomass feedstock in Rwanda cannot be met because of constraints at the supply side. This has a negative effect on the energy security for Rwandese in the future and the income generated for the Rwandan population involved in biomass feedstock production. There are, however, opportunities to stimulate the typically informal private sector in such a manner that the biomass energy production is made more sustainable. This thesis conducts research into the REDD+ mechanism (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (UN, 2011)) and the role it can play for the Rwandan biomass feedstock market. Next, an exploration is made of the current charcoal and fuelwood value chains to be able to better promote sustainable production of biomass. Then, an adapted version of business model generation theory from Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010) of Vastbinder, Kroesen, Blom, and Ortt (2011) is applied to generate sustainable business models. It is shown through a charcoal and a fuelwood cooperative business model that existing, improved and economically viable techniques exist in Rwanda which can be exploited to improve the sustainability of practices within the charcoal and fuelwood value chains; and leverage private investment. It is also shown that REDD+ can provide the financial argumentation for private smallholders to provide a tangible benefit of being in a cooperative, but that there is a lack of data available to prove it. Based on the research findings, the Government of Rwanda is recommended to build institutional capacities at different levels of Government in order to: (1)Align laws and policies applying in the different sectors involved in biomass energy production so that competition for land between energy, agriculture and forestry is decreased; (2)Develop and implement laws and policies specifically addressing charcoal and fuelwood in Rwanda which can be monitored uniformly and are applied consistently across the various levels of Government; (3)Promote increased social, economical and ecological benefits of improved charcoal and fuelwood production cooperatives to reach more formal organization of the charcoal and fuelwood sector and more equally distributed income across the value chains; (4)Gain insight in what the economic characteristics of the charcoal and fuelwood markets in Rwanda are, so that intervention to create long-term economic sustainability is founded on better reasoning; (5)Operationalize additional value of their project-involved activities, so that sustainable benefits of practical intervention can be proven and continued funding for the longer term can more easily be derived. Based on the research findings, it is recommended to DGIS (the Directorate General for International Cooperation) to: (1)Reconsider their food security definition to include domestic cooking energy for developing countries which are densely populated and rely on traditional biomass. The current food security definition increases competition between wood production for domestic energy provision and agricultural food production - without the energy to cook there are no means to achieve food security; (2)Convince the international developing aid community that a reconsideration of the food security definition is needed; (3)Provide aid to the Government of Rwanda through bilateral agreements for: a.Capacity building activities (e.g. institutional or business); b.Gaining an insight in the economic characteristics of the charcoal and fuelwood markets in Rwanda; (4)Develop guidelines for the REDD+ mechanism on which data can be collected in what way to be able to prove additional value of certain projects. Currently these guidelines do not exist. Hence, sustainable benefits of practical intervention are short term. This is because involved parties lack the time and resources to consider long-term sustainability – potentially through carbon finance – since short-term results are needed; (5)Follow up on the previous recommendation so that current and future funding of projects requires not just a focus on practical intervention, but focuses on proven long-term additionality of practices as well; (6)Research opportunities to develop a mechanism by which such supply-side interventions in woody, traditional biomass value chains can be funded. Although these interventions are beneficial in terms of sustainable development, the old-fashioned image of woodfuels and the complexities with terrestrial carbon – including forest carbon – calculations hamper the possibilities for funding of wood energy interventions at the supply side.","charcoal and fuelwood in Rwanda; sustainability; business model development; REDD+","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

ZigBee is also critically limited by the low data rate standard when there are many source nodes in the network. How to fairly and efficiently access the network and delivery the packets should be considered as one of the crucial issues. The simulation results illustrate that packet delivery ratio and delay are the most important measures for performance analysis in ZigBee. To obtain a better behavior of ZigBee network, we propose three methods which can significantly improve the packet delivery ratio and satisfy the requirements for fairness. Firstly, packet aggregation is introduced to ZigBee networks to aggregate data in an energy efficient manner so that network lifetime is enhanced. When there are too many nodes in the network, not all the nodes get the same chance to access the network and successfully transmit the packets. Three fairness metrics are introduced to evaluate the fairness among all the nodes. Intra-cluster and inter-cluster fairness are two proposed methods to enhance fairness based on packet aggregations. With intra-cluster fairness methods, cluster head should delay the packets and process the packets from the other node when the number of received packets from one source node is more than the average level. After intra-cluster fairness, different clusters still have fairness issue. Inter-cluster fairness should be designed to achieve absolute fairness among all the end devices. The simulations results show that our new methods could make the way of accessing the network and transmitting the packets efficient and fair as we have expected.","ZigBee; cluster; performance analysis; packet aggregation; fairness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-11-24","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Wireless and Mobile Communications","",""

(mentor)","2011","Bridge sensors are widely used for accurate measurement of physical quantities such as temperature, pressure, strain or altitude. Such sensors require a low-noise, high-resolution and accurate readout system with high input impedance. In order to meet these requirements, conventional sensor readout systems use multiple stages which typically include a low-noise preamplifier, an anti-aliasing filter and a discrete-time (DT) sigma-delta modulator (??M). As a result, these systems involve several high-gain loops with total open-loop gain far exceeding the required closed-loop gain. This can lead to sub-optimal power dissipation and greater analog design complexity in design of a sensor readout system. In recent years, Gm-C continuous-time (CT) ??Ms have attracted a lot of attention due to their inherent anti-alias filtering, low power dissipation, high input impedance and high resolution. However, their use in precision applications such as bridge sensor readout is limited by the nonlinearity of the input stage. In this work, a new single-bit CT??M topology is proposed that employs an identical nonlinear element in the feedback path along with a low pass filter to enable nonlinearity compensation and achieve high linearity. A feedforward Gm stage further enhances the nonlinearity compensation by increasing the effective loop-gain. This approach enables more than 60 dB improvement in the nonlinearity of the input transconductor stage of the CT??M. A precision sensor readout circuit using the proposed CT??M architecture is designed and implemented in 0.7 µm technology. The modulator achieves a resolution of 20 bits with a 22 nV/?Hz noise floor and an accuracy better than 10 ppm in post-layout simulations. It consumes 240 µA current from a 5 V supply. The resolution and accuracy of the CT??M designed in this work is comparable to that of state-of-the-art readout systems but with lower power dissipation and lesser analog complexity. The proposed modulators achieves 10x better linearity and accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art Gm-C based CT??Ms, albeit at low frequencies, with significantly less noise and power dissipation.","Continuous-Time Sigma Delta Modulator; Sensor Readout; Analog to Digital Converters (ADC); Bridge sensor readout","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","","",""

Nature has created large cantilever structures of 150 m high in the form of eucalyptus threes. History show furthermore manmade structures as timber radio towers of 190 m high and wooden religious structures of almost a 1000 years old, towering 67 m in the air. The most recent modern tall timber building is about 29 m high, contains nine storey’s is located in London, UK, and is called “the Murray Grove Tower”. What is discussed above leads to the question: “What is the height limit for tall timber buildings”. To answer this question, the objective of this thesis is twofold. The first objective of this thesis is to determine the influence factors on the height of timber buildings. The second objective is to create proof through analysis of a case study design of at least 100 m high within a determined set of boundary conditions. A preliminary study was conducted to realise the first objective. This preliminary study contained a problem analysis in which the influence factors were determined and a definition was found for tall timber buildings. The main influence factors are part of architectural requirements, structural issues, fire safety and building physics. The influence factors are quantified to achieve the highest potential. This deduction of influence factors resulted in a set of boundary conditions and proposed solutions. First a universal floor plan was designed as a starting point. A minimum wall-window ratio of 15% and a building slenderness of 1:4 were set as architectural boundary conditions. The material applied to the load bearing structure was chosen to consist of timber laminations of strength class D70 which has a positive effect on the structural and fire characteristics. The proposed stability system consists of a braced tube-in-tube structure. The investigated types of bracing are the Diagid geometry, simple diagonal bracing and a solid timber shear wall bracing. To realize a fire safe design, relevant objectives are satisfied though the choice of a fire concept, in combination with fire suppression measures, resulting in compartment burn out. In the second part of the thesis these proposed solutions are investigated. Four variants where created consisting of a set, corresponding to the geometry of the proposed types of bracing and associated joint solution. Three-dimensional models where created with finite element software of these variants. Of these models, parameters are modified in order to investigate: the influence of the joint stiffness; the building core stiffness; and the support stiffness on the global behavior. The investigation on the global behavior of the systems focused on the deflection at the top, the development of bending moments within members and the dynamical behavior. An optimisation of the cross sections of structural members was also conducted in order to investigate the competition of feasibility between variants. The fire behaviour of variants was determined for a combination of structural solutions, fire safety concepts and fire suppression measures. The deflection at the top of the timber building satisfied the limits of the building code for all variants. It was derived that the deflection at the top of the building is for 14% to 20% due to the joint stiffness, for 39% to 56% due to the stiffness of the cross laminated timber building core and for 16% to 23% influenced by the stiffness of the foundation of concrete bored piles. The results of the dynamical analysis is strongly dependant on the used method. The dynamic behavior of some combinations of structural system and calculation method, did not satisfy the requirement stated in the Dutch standard, NEN 6702. It was concluded that a tall timber building structure of 112 m high is possible on a fundamental level. Several structural systems can be applied in combination with an appropriate fire concept.","tall buildings; timber; wood; firesafety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

The aim was to accomplish this, with the idea of monitoring the physical activity and use this to motivate children and the family to get even more active. The function of the Sensi will be to monitor the movement and activity of children and other family members during the day and motivate them to be more active. For this concept to be effective, the children and parents need to wear it as often as possible. Therefore the Sensi should be comfortable in use and wearable during several activities. The project focuses on the needs of children and their perception of the world: What they would want from a Motion Monitor. It included a lot of parts concerning the life of a child, like social elements, personal preferences, school and the home of children. The goal of the project was to design a product that reaches children and motivates them to get physically active and stay physically active. The design should encourage children to use it and become aware of the fun of physical activity. One condition was that the design should include the motion tracking of children for obtaining insight in the behaviour of physical activity of children. The result will contain a solution, meant to be on the national market in 5 years.","children; sensor; obesity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-10-21","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

Technical pre-conditions were gathered about the new biofilm management substance to know which requirements should be taken into account when rating concept ideas based on feasibility. In addition User information was gathered through observational research, a generative session and personal care interviews about their experience of doing oral care and personal care activities. The biggest problem is that consumers experience oral care as a time consuming activity with a preferred result of feeling fresh and clean. This resulted in a specific interaction vision, describing that the new product should focus on enhancing the freedom of brushing with a fresh and clean experience. Three concept idea categories were created and examined and lead to one single concept idea, the tongilicious. This concept focuses at a tongue-brush that smoothens the tooth surface and spreads the new biofilm management substance around in the mouth in order to clean the mouth. This concept has been validated with the user with the help of focus groups, resulting in recommendations for Philips to do additional research to the feel of control of the current toothbrush compared to a tongue-brush. This validation showed that the tongilicious concept was experienced as being refreshing, providing a freedom of movement and is seen as an additional tool to the present oral healthcare.","Biofilm; toothbrush; oral care","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2011","In 2008 presenteerde de Deltacommissie haar bevindingen om Nederland ook in de toekomst waterbestendig te houden. Aan van de aanbevelingen was het verhogen van het IJsselmeerpeil met anderhalve meter te verhogen, met verstrekkende gevolgen voor de verschillende aan het IJsselmeer liggende steden. Een van deze steden is Lelystad, dat in haar omgeving naast drie havens ook nog een primaire waterkering in het IJsselmeer heeft liggen: de Houtribdijk, beter bekend als de dijk Enkhuizen-Lelystad. Door de peilverhoging zal niet alleen de dijk moeten worden verhoogd - ook het huidige sluizencomplex, bestaande uit spuisluizen en schutsluizen, zullen moeten worden aangepast. Omdat de aanpassingen zodanig groot zijn, is besloten om een nieuw complex te ontwerpen met nieuwe schutsluizen in de vorm van een naviduct, een nieuwe spui-inrichting en een gemaal. Het besluit om zowel een spuisluis als een gemaal te ontwikkelen komt voort uit het kenmerkende waterbeheer van het Markermeer. In de winter is de aanvoer van water namelijk hoog door de relatief grote regenval en lage verdamping; er is dus noodzaak om water af te voeren naar de zee om ongewenste peilverhoging te voorkomen. Vanuit het Markermeer kan het water op twee manieren worden getransporteerd naar de zee: via het Noordzeekanaal naar de Noordzee of via het IJsselmeer naar de Waddenzee. In de praktijk wordt de voorkeur gegeven aan de afvoer via het IJsselmeer; bij een peilverhoging zal hier in de toekomst dus een gemaal voor nodig moeten zijn. Echter, in de zomer is er een netto verlies van water uit het Markermeer door de grote verdamping en lage aanvoer. Om de waterstand en –kwaliteit in stand te houden is het noodzakelijk om tijdens de zomer zoet water in het Markermeer te laten. Het kwaliteit van het water uit het Noordzeekanaal is niet hoog genoeg, waardoor het enige overgebleven alternatief water vanuit het IJsselmeer in te laten is. Bij een peilverhoging van dat meer is dat ook een logische keuze: door het continu aanwezige verval is de aanvoer van water ‘gratis’. Een grotere controle van het peil van het Markermeer is tevens een wens van de regering die is genoemd in het Nationaal Waterplan. Daarom is ook besloten om een spui-inrichting in de dijk te ontwerpen met de benodigde capaciteit van 90 m³/s bij een waterstandsverschil van 1,0 meter. De spuisluizen worden als een afsluitbare kokerconstructie door de Houtribdijk heen ontworpen. De binnenafmetingen van een enkele koker zijn 93 m x 4,37 m x 1,50 m, met een wanddikte van 0,40 m. De gehele inrichting zal bestaan uit vier van deze kokers, wat verder nog zal bestaan uit deurkasten, twee stortbedden en kwelschermen. De kokers worden gefabriceerd in drie segmenten per koker, die zullen worden afgezonken op de juiste locatie in een tijdelijk ontgraven Houtribdijk. Om het mogelijk te maken om de Houtribdijk te ontgraven zal er een tweede dijk naast de huidige moeten worden aangelegd die de waterkerende en verbindende functie van de Houtribdijk (tijdens de bouw) overneemt. Nadat de sluiskokers geplaatst zijn, kan de dijk weer worden hersteld tot de oude situatie, waarna de sluisdeuren kunnen worden geplaatst en de tijdelijke dijk weer kan worden ontgraven. Op dat moment zal de spuiinrichting een volledig operationeel sleutelelement in het waterbeheer van het Markermeer zijn.","spuisluis; ijsselmeer; markermeer; lelystad","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2013-09-17","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Molnos, A.M. (mentor)","2011","Graphics on a computer are often handled by a graphics pipeline. Rasterization is an important stage in this pipeline. It converts the basic elements of computer graphics, triangles, into the basic elements of a screen, pixels. This stage is very computation intensive and has a large memory footprint. The last decade a lot of research has been dedicated to tile-based rasterization. This technique divides an image into smaller images called tiles. These can be stored on a smaller memory, hence reducing the memory footprint of the rasterization process. Several software and hardware implementations of tile-based rasterization exist. They use a single general purpose processor, or make use of multiple specialized cores, such as Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). Although GPUs prove to be very fast in graphical applications, their effectiveness in running other applications is limited. This is a potential drawback in embedded systems where the available resources are very limited. In Embedded Systems typically Multiple Processors are used in a System on Chip, an MPSoC. This work will make a parallelization study to investigate the performance of rasterization on a MPSoC. To perform this study we modify a tile-based rasterizer to make efficient use of multiple embedded processors. This modified rasterizer is used to evaluate the impact of various configurations on the execution time of the rasterizer. For example the size of an image tile, the size of the communication buffer and the number of processors will be varied in our experiments. Increasing the size of an image tile proves to decrease the execution time only to a certain point, after which the execution time will start to increase. Furthermore, using a larger communication buffer increases the load balancing and decreases the execution time. It is concluded that with the right load balancing adding processors to the system will decrease the time needed to rasterize an image.","rasterization; MPSoC; embedded; tile-based; microblaze; FPGA; CoMPSoC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

These services work on a on-demand basis and use taxi vehicles that can service multiple jobs at the same time to reduce the operational costs. The problem however is that deciding how to schedule each taxi to pickup and drop-off a customer is very difficult, as there are multiple objectives involved such as operational costs, vehicle efficiency and service quality (which itself is composed of several subobjectives). Since these objectives are related to each other it is very difficult to balance them. Two major decisions in this problem are the clustering (assigning customers to taxis) and routing (computing the driving schedule of each taxi). In this thesis we introduce the Random Insertion Genetic Algorithm (RIGA) that solves both clustering and routing using only a genetic algorithm. We show that this algorithm may outperform other (genetic) algorithms that do rely on a specialized routing procedure.","dial-a-ride problem; DARP; DARPTW; genetic algorithm; cluster-first-route-second","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Algorithmics","",""

(mentor); Goossens, K. (mentor); Molnos, A. (mentor)","2011","Voltage and Frequency Scaling (VFS) has been shown to reduce energy consumption effectively on system level. Most existing work in this field focused on deadline-constrained applications with finite schedule lengths. However, in typical real-time streaming applications, data processing is constantly activated by infinitely long data streams and operations on successive data instances are overlapped to achieve a tight throughput. This necessitates new VFS policies to perform energy efficient processing. In this thesis, we solve throughput-constrained VFS problems for real-time streaming applications with discrete frequency levels on a heterogeneous multi-processor platform. We propose discrete scaling algorithms for a multi-clock domains platform with local voltage switches per processor and for a single-clock domain platform with a global voltage switch for all processors. We prove NP-hardness for the local VFS problem and maximal open for the global VFS problem. A mixed integer linear program (MILP) is formulated for our local voltage scaling algorithm, while for its global counterpart, a three-stage heuristic incorporating MILP is proposed. Furthermore, two extensions of the proposed voltage scaling policies are presented to handle transition overheads and to include application level Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) schedulers. Experiments show that for our modem application examples, the discrete local VFS algorithm achieves energy savings close to its continuous counterpart, and local voltage switching is much more beneficial in terms of energy saving than global voltage switching. For example, for our Wireless LAN (WLAN) application example, the continuous local VFS algorithm reduces energy by 29.62%, while the discrete local and global VFS algorithms reduce energy by 28.03% and 16.49%, respectively.","voltage and frequency scaling; real time; streaming applications; mathematical programming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

This thesis identified four perspectives: (1) A top-down perspective of the European Commission (DG Energy and DG Competition) who view gas hubs as economic nodes in the European network that facilitate spot, financial and transportation markets. (2) A bottom-up perspective of the users of gas hubs. The hub operator develops a variety of services and facilitates trading platforms with which hub users are offered a new way of doing business. (3) A regulatory design perspective of the regulatory authorities who view gas hubs as virtual balancing points in the network.

The project was performed from March to November 2011, six months in London for developing the service and two months in Delft for reflecting on the activities and writing. The thesis project was hosted by the self-funded organisation Homeless SMS founded by Will Brayne. Homeless SMS provided the initial concept of the service, which is transferring relevance information via SMS to the homeless. Numerous individuals and organisations are formally and informally engaged in the project. Their contributions are defined as mentors, partners, advisors and participants. The design activity put great attention on bringing a vulnerable and marginalised user group into the design process. Ethnographic research performed to understand the context and to establish contacts with the participants. As the outcome of the research, the purpose of service-system was evolved as the communication tool between the homeless, service providers, volunteers and former homeless, which will form the supportive on-line community. The design process involved relevant stakeholders of the service-system such as homeless people, service providers and volunteers. They contributed to the design decision through participating in workshops and prototype services. The prototyping was carried through three iterations with more than 30 homeless participants. Possible technological solutions were investigated and evaluated. In the third prototype, the high fidelity service was built on Twitter with more than 25 homeless users and the service was implemented at a homeless day centre in London. As a result, the thesis suggests a service system of sustainable supportive community for the homeless and a guidebook implement the service for other organisations.","service design; social media; participatory design; marginalised user group; homeless; mobile telephony","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Kooijman, A. (mentor); Tessiore, L. (mentor)","2011","Call My Bag is an innovation concept based on the use of ubiquitous technologies. The focus of this project is to assist snowboarders, to prevent and communicate injuries during the practice of snowboarding. The wearable device embedded in the snowboarders’ equipment aims to increase the security of such sportsmen through the enhancement of communication among the members of a group. Its scope is to establish a permanent connectivity among snowboarders allowing them to communicate with their group in any situation, and to establish a direct communication with the local first aid operators when the need crops up. The project is based on the Design Inclusive Research methodology. Such methodological framework is structured by an initial explorative phase in which the social demands of the selected target groups are studied during a user research. Observational research, interviews and questionnaires are the research methods adopted in order to obtain a design direction for this project based on the snowboarders’ needs. The analysis phase concludes with a literature study on the most relevant ubiquitous technologies. This research focuses on the families of ubiquitous technologies that are then taken into consideration during the device conceptualization. After the explorative phase, the project follows a stage of creative design actions. During this stage, three initial concepts based on the idea developed from the main users’ needs are shown. After a concept selection on the basis of the project requirements, the device functionalities are explained. Thereupon, the technologies needed for the development of the device functions are firstly analyzed, compared and finally selected. Summarizing the device functions and the needed technologies for its implementation, the concept offers: The creation of a Local Area Network among the group members connecting the Radio frequency modules of each rider. Voice communication via Radio frequency module. Forwarding call and SMS with the own coordinates to the first aid via GPRS and GPS modules. Distance alerting function through the use of GPS module for distance calculation. At the end of this project phase the analysis of the snowboarders’ equipment for the embedment of solution elements is carried out. This final step offers the possibility to conclude the detailing phase and to proceed with the device implementation after the selection of the snowboarding backpack as solution of embedment for the functional units. During the realization of two tangible prototypes, the development of software programming and hardware components is of fundamental importance. The knowledge and experience gained during the elaboration of a first wired version of the prototype offered the basis for the development of two final prototypes, set up on the realization of a Printed Circuit Board aimed to connect all the technology modules in a compact solution. The Software programming is carried out during the hardware development in order to develop the four principle device functions and to make them interoperable. Only at the end of this phase the hardware components are embedded in the snowboarding backpack in the course of a project step of system integration. After the prototyping phase, the Design Inclusive Research methodology foresees a final step of evaluative research actions. During this phase the functional performance of the device and the user experience are evaluated. The prototypes are firstly tested in five different testing sessions led in two environments: in the lab and in the countryside. The aim of this technical assessment is to understand if the prototypes work properly in terms of device operating, technologies sensitivity, correct components functioning and communication quality. The evaluations based on these criteria led to changes carried out directly on the devices in order to obtain a reliable final version of the prototypes ready for the confirmative user research. The confirmative user research conducted in the mountain environment is based on a qualitative research approach. Observational research and interviews are the two research methods used to conduct this final evaluation. During the final discussions with the users, suggestions and considerations about the products were obtained. The results gained from the confirmative research were of fundamental importance in order to conclude the project with a final evaluation of the said improvements the device might obtain. The device was considered as a meaningful solution able to increase the security of snowboarders by the entire research group. Also the embedment solution in a snowboarding backpack was positively evaluated by most of the participants. A failure analysis and a discussion of the device on the basis of the different snowboarding styles of practice conclude this project phase. After the validation of the device, the project provides the consolidation of the concept through a projection ahead of the product itself. At this stage, a proposal for a future version of the product is carried out. The criteria considered during this analysis are: additional application fields, technical improvements, functions advancement and comfort of use. This final research is fundamental in order to understand which are the weaknesses of the prototypes and what are the main points to focus on for the future development of the appliance. The design process concludes with a final analysis aimed to understand if the device has entirely fulfilled the design directions formulated during the conceptualization phase.","ubiquitous computing; wearable device; snowboarding; communication; safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Computer Aided Design Engineering","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Willemse, C.A. (mentor); Abspoel, R. (mentor); Beckers, J.N.P.T. (mentor); Beukers, S.J.H. (mentor)","2011","In the need for more green energy a prominent role is reserved for wind energy. Offshore wind energy in deeper waters capitalises on more efficient wind properties and increased public acceptance compared to onshore wind energy and wind farms close to shore. In the coming years the offshore wind market is expected to evolve rapidly, especially in the deeper water range of thirty to sixty meter. In a business case preceding to this study as first reference a jacket type substructure was designed for a 6 MW turbine in a water depth of sixty meter. The goal of this thesis is to reduce the cost of this reference design in total use of material and assembly. Also the transportation and installation of the substructure are taken in consideration. First a step back is taken to reconsider the structural concept of the reference design. Several substructure concepts, like tripods and straight-leg jackets, have passed the review and firstly qualitative weighed against primary criteria in a Multi Criteria Analysis and subsequently by FEM based in-place analysis. The outcome of the total substructure weight and natural frequency with respect to frequency of wave loading and turbine excitement determined the decision to further investigate a three-leg and four-leg battered jacket. Thereto a fatigue analysis was performed. The calculation method used at the original reference design to determine the total fatigue damage due to turbine and wave loading was proven to be too optimistic and therefore modified. In relation to the reference design several optimisations have been proposed, including applying a horizontal brace just above mudline level, applying double sided butt welds and adopting K-bracing instead of X-bracing. Here the four enclosed pictures can be placed. (number 1 upmost left, number 4 upmost right) Finally, four designs have been worked out; the reference design (without optimisations), an optimised four-leg jacket, four-leg jacket with k-braces and a three-leg jacket. The total assembling cost of each design is calculated by considering the handling time and the welding volume with corresponding welding time of each weld. Together with the material use the total fabrication cost is assessed. The jacket shall be transported offshore by a standard North Sea barge. The dimensions of this barge potentially enable the transportation of three four-leg jackets and four three-leg jackets. Depending on the wind farm location this may lead to reduction of one tug and transport barge case of the three-leg jacket. Further consequence of the three-leg jacket is that a foundation pile less needs to be driven. Thereto is the installation time of the three-leg jacket reduced, resulting in less installation cost. By combining fabrication, transport and installation cost it is possible to compute an overview for substructures cost in a complete wind farm. Final conclusion is that the fabrication cost are decisive compared to the installation and transport cost. The four-leg jacket with K-braces turns out to be the most inexpensive design, respectively followed by the thee-leg jacket, the optimised four-leg jacket and the reference design. It is expected that the four-leg jacket with K-braces brings total cost reduction of approximately nine percent compared to the reference design.","offshore; wind turbine; deeper water; substructure; steel; fatigue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); Wolters, M. (mentor); Daamen, W. (mentor); Van Hees, H. (mentor)","2011","Traditionally, water based public transport has a large contribution to the accessibility of rural areas in the Netherlands. Initiated by the industrial revolution a major shift from water based to land based public transport occurred. Until recent history water based public transport was considered unfeasible. Nowadays land based transport modes are threatened by their own success. The shortage of land available for land based public transport in rural areas creates congestion on highways and endangers the accessibility of many city centres. City centres which adopted their metropolitan status due to their location near the waterfront. This fact gives rise to investigate the feasibility of water based public transport in existing city centres and areas to be developed. The expansion of Almere, being part of the Amsterdam metropolitan region, outside the existing flood defence system in lake Markermeer is a strong example showing a large potential on accessibility by means of fast ferry navigation. An integral planning of water and land based infrastructure serving commuter related passenger transport, among other success factors, increases the success of tackling bottlenecks in the existing hydraulic infrastructure. For the water based public transport connection between Amsterdam Central Station and Almere the passage of the Schellingwoude lock complex is considered to be the most significant bottleneck causing previous attempts of shipping companies on this route to fail due to a lack of feasibility. Contradictory functional demands present at this lock complex in combination with the large yearly volume of commercial and recreational navigation passing this lock complex during the normative month (August) causes the lock operation process to involve an average passage time of fast ferry navigation outside the target conditions associated with water based public transport. In order to optimize the passage of fast ferry navigation at the Schellingwoude lock complex the feasibility of multiple lock system alternatives is investigated, being: - Alternative 1a – Priority arrangement; - Alternative 1b – Priority arrangement and separate locking method; - Alternative 2a – Reservation of one lock chamber; - Alternative 2b – Reservation of two lock chambers; - Alternative 3 – Priority arrangement and reservation of one lock chamber; - Alternative 4a – Additional minimal lock chamber; - Alternative 4b – Additional CEMT-class Vlb lock chamber; - Alternative 5 – Additional innovative structure. The performance criteria determining the feasibility of the proposed lock system alternatives are based on the target conditions associated with water based public transport derived from a travel time analysis on the preferred route between Amsterdam Central Station and Almere. The actual performance analysis is elaborated using the SIVAK2 simulation model. From the performance analysis it is concluded that reservation of one lock chamber (Alternative 2a) and the construction of an additional lock chamber with minimal dimensions serving fast ferry navigation (Alternative 4a) are the best performing alternatives. Both alternatives lead to an average passage time of fast ferry navigation within the target conditions associated with fast ferry navigation and within the prescribed target conditions applied for commercial and recreational navigation. The best performing alternatives are further investigated using a social cost-benefit analysis. This analysis shows that alternative 4a involves the least costs associated with direct effects compared to alternative 2a during a life span of 100 years. This is mainly due to the effect of large financial consequences of additional waiting time of commercial and recreational navigation passing the Schellingwoude lock complex.","lock; Schellingwoude; Rijkswaterstaat; Amsterdam; fast; ferry; SIVAK","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Ports and Waterways","",""

In most cases, one standard will remain and the other(s) fades completely or becomes a niche product. Companies have struggled to figure out what is really needed for their product to prevail in such situations and so far there are no clear guidelines on what to do to promote an innovation. This leads to the need of studies of historical cases of instances of such battles to try and theorize on what went wrong and what could be done differently on similar cases to ensure different outcome. Thus the objective of this thesis is to find ‘Which factors affect standard dominance in a standards battle and how do they relate to each other’. In order to do that, a literature review was undergone to detect what is the perception of the factors of dominance amongst researchers and what relations of these factors are already studied. Then two case studies were made based on secondary data build-up and the usage of two interviews for validation and filling the holes left by the secondary data gathering (DVD vs. DIVX and Minidisc vs. DCC). With the battles analyzed, the factors leading to their respective outcomes were listed out. Some interrelations were also detected but the very specific nature of each battle made it hard to create a framework that could be generalized. More battles should be further investigated in the future especially recent battles to ensure the relevance of the factors in modern battles.","Standards Battles; Factors for Dominance; Consumer Electronics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy, and Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

(contributor)","2011","Manado City is growing, its population is increasing. This demands the city to grow outside its borders and even into the sea by using land reclamation. Introducing new challenges or making challenges bigger, which are already present. Not only growth is present in the city, going forward and becoming better and better is an on-going fight for cities. The city came up with a vision “Manado, Model City of Eco Tourism” and a mission “Make Manado a City of Happiness” for their future. Introducing a study on this subject and to anticipate on the city’s goals, the research question is stated as; What are the options to supplement Manado’s vision and mission, making the city more safe and attractive for tourists and citizens? Within this research, two other challenges regarding Manado city will be investigated as well. In the year of 2003 a major flood occurred in the city, causing great damage to the city with many casualties. Nowadays, the risk of flooding is still present. Secondly, a challenge arises at the border of the city . The coastline of Manado suffers from erosion at specific locations, possibly caused by development of the reclaimed land in the past. Narrowing the research, an analysis will be made upon selected subjects. Analysing the coastal protection, river floods and the city’s Vision and Mission gives a clear view of the current state and what could be expected from the future. The goal is to come to a sound idea of the needs and possibilities related to coastal protection, Kota Manado and its Vision and Mission. Working towards advices, different time paths and desires are noticed. Besides recommendations, which can be adopted at any time, found solutions are divided in short, mid and long term time spans. On short term the rivers and garbage have to be handled and nuisance of either one increases day by day. At many places the river is blocked. Removing these blockages is a good start. In addition, the embankments and beds can be ‘smoothened’, to improve the river’s flow. Besides the river attention on the short term, garbage clogs up the city. Waste Management Control is already improving. Clean ups have to be supported by the government, giving a good example to its citizens. By these measures a start is made to work towards real solutions, coming to an Improved Garbage Service. As mentioned before, improving the Waste Management Control is a continuing process. Besides the short term, this solution has a mid-term basis too. By adaption of the 3R-principle, garbage will be even less. This principle represents the Reduction, Reuse and Recycle of materials. The amount of waste will reduce and the city will be cleaner, although it will take a while to adopt. Measurements need to be coordinated and monitored. Making so-called Pre-Project-Planning gives benefits to make them successful. This should not only be used in this case, but also for regular Civil Engineering projects. Erosion is another problem Manado City is facing nowadays. However, its effects evolve more slowly and are thereby less noticeable. The coastline of Manado can be divided in three sections. Section one consists of the Southern part of the coastline and the municipality is already undertaking action to stop the erosion. The adopted measures are well designed and thought through. Even on places where there’s little area to construct a protection, the chosen measure could also be used.Section two is located near the boulevard area. Large land reclamations are constructed along the shore. The reclaimed areas are well protected by big stones and do not suffer from any erosion. These large land reclamations, however, do have side effects. One of them is the change in the current, leading to a flow towards the ’Bunaken’ coral reef area. This flow transports a lot of sediment, dust and garbage and killing a lot of fish and coral. So, for future land reclamations, an investigation into these effects must be done if the city really cares about its environment and wants to prevent it from destroying. Section three is situated in the North of Manado. The protection of the northern coastline consists of vegetation and Mangroves. Due to certain changes in the past, among others construction of reclaimed areas, part of the northern shoreline started to erode. The continuing process of erosion can be resolved on a mid-term base. With solutions like, for instance Mangroves, it can stop the erosion and improve the environmental value of the coastline as well, leading to an eco-friendly solution. A sustainable future for the city of Manado is obtained by their vision “Manado Model City for Ecotourism” and mission “To Make Manado City a city of Happiness”. The government cannot do this on its own. Involving and, most important, convincing the local community of the vision and mission will speed up the progression. This combines the short and long term philosophy. On short notice the local community has to be convinced and at the same time, the long term vision and mission can be fulfilled too. Manado City has a great amount of opportunities to fulfil their mission and are they are well available. Even small improvements can make a change. A good example to use the opportunities and to anticipate on the mission and vision of the city is to construct several parks or a beach in the centre of town. A park or a beach can be created to attract not only tourists but also local citizens. For tourists, including divers, it will be a welcoming relaxing spot to comfort their stay in Manado. So in this way it will give the mission and vision of Manado a tremendous boost.","Indonesia; Sulawesi; flood protection; eco tourism; coastal erosion; erosion protection","en","student report","TU Delft, Section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Flooding problems are caused by intensive rainfall in the city, high river discharges and high tides on sea. Dr. Hoc, the vice-minister of MARD (Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) proposed to construct a hydraulic structure downstream of HCMC. This will solve both the flooding and siltation problem. A possibility is to construct a dam between Vung Tau and Go Cong. This solution has been worked out into a preliminary design, which includes a design for the cross section and an investigation into the closure method. The hydraulic system where the project will be constructed consists of the Saigon - Dong Nai river system and the East Sea, and can be classified as an estuary with a (mainly semi-diurnal) mixed tide. Waves are moderate in the area. A dam will be constructed between Go Cong and the Dong Nai navigation channel. Over the Dong-Nai navigation channel to Vung Tau a bridge is planned, to minimise navigation delays and changes in tidal and salinity range in the Can Gio mangrove forest. To make a closed basin, Can Thanh will be connected with the dam near the Dong Nai navigation channel. Ship locks and discharge sluices will be constructed at the sides of the existing navigation channel in the Soi Rap. The final closure of the dam will take place in the Soi Rap navigation channel. A road on the dam will connect Vung Tau with Go Cong. Because there is no subsoil information available at the location of the dam, the soil layering and parameters are estimated based on information from locations in the vicinity of the dam. Three different soil profiles were drawn up. Measures have to be taken to increase the bearing capacity of the subsoil and decrease settlements during the lifetime of the dam. If thick layers of weak subsoil is present, drainage in combination with pre-loading will be the best solution. In case of a stronger subsoil partial replacement with sand is favourable. To build the dam, the use of local material is a cheap and easy solution. Near Vung Tau a number of areas are present where sand can be obtained. Rock can be found in mountains in the neighbourhood of Vung Tau. Since there is already a stone quarry in this area, it is assumed that the rock is of good quality. By means of a Multi Criteria Analysis it was found that a building a dam with a sand core is the best solution in this project. Degradation or even failure of (elements of) the structure may occur as a result of loadings during the operational phase or in accidental situations. The principal failure mechanisms for the VT-GC dam are checked. Slope, crest and toe protections were designed to prevent failure. Two designs were made for the cross section of the dam: one with an outer slope revetment made of asphalt and one for an outer slope revetment made of rock. The biggest differences in these designs can be found in the crest height and layer thicknesses. The construction of the dam should start with the construction of the bridge and work islands. Next, the discharge sluices and navigation locks will be made in building pits. Then the dam will be constructed. This starts with the foundation and scour protection which will be constructed using barges. Waterborne equipment is preferred because of the easier logistics and larger capacities. The core material, filter layers, underlayer, toe and armour layer will be constructed layer by layer to be able to raise the relatively steep slopes. Where water depths are too low, cranes operating from pontoons or rolling equipment can be used. After completion of the core and revetment, the crest is constructed and the dam can be finished with the construction of the road. The closure of the final gap is a very important aspect within the construction of the dam. A storage area approach is used to determine the system behaviour during closure. High velocities in the final gap make it impossible to close the gap with sand. A bottom protection is necessary in the final gap to prevent a scour hole, caused by high velocities, from developing too close to the dam. The gap is closed with coarser material than sand. A combination of vertical and horizontal closure will be used. First barges dump stones to a level of MSL -5 m. When the water is too shallow, dumping will continue from the sides of the closure gap. The final dam profile in the closure gap will be similar to the regular dam sections. A general estimation of the cost for the total project, based on costs in reference projects, is 3.1 billion US dollar. The Dong Thap Muoi region is a very important agricultural area for the production of rice. Due to the low river discharges and the large influence of the tide, the salt concentrations in the Vam Co rivers are high, causing problems for the farmers. An estimation of the salt intrusion length was made using a predictive steady-state salt intrusion model, according to Savenije. Unfortunately it was not possible to perform salinity measurements in the Vam Co River, so data from three fixed measurement stations was used. With this data, it was possible to fit the model roughly but more data is needed to make the model more accurate.

Methods: Four porcine iliac arteries with atherosclerotic plaques were scanned with a T2 imaging sequence in a 7T MRI scanner. One high resolution scan with an in-plane resolution of 56x56mm and three low resolution scans with an in-plane resolution of 98x98mm were obtained. The pressure inside the artery for the high-resolution scan was 100mmHg and for the low resolution scans the pressure was 80, 100 and 120mmHg, respectively. For each artery one high resolution MRI slice was compared with two histology staining to see if the lumen, intima, media, adventitia, calcium, and lipid and collagen poor/rich regions could be indentified. The surfaces of the lumen and external elastic lamina (EEL) were compared for the three different pressures to see what the global deformations were. Also a pilot has been performed to see if local deformations could be indentified with the program Elastix [1]. Results: In all four MRI slices of the porcine arteries the lumen, intima, media, adventitia and calcium could clearly been seen. The lipid poor/rich and collagen poor/rich regions were not always indentified correctly. The surface area of the lumen and EEL seem to increase as the pressure increases. However, the increase in surface area for these diseased arteries seem to be smaller then expected. The local deformations obtained with the program Elastix showed a logical deformation pattern for the artery with the largest deformations, but for the smaller deformations the deformation field was contradictory to expectations. Conclusion: With the high-resolution T2 sequence it is possible to clearly delineate the lumen, intima, media, adventitia and calcium, but not lipid or collagen poor/rich regions. Global deformations can be measured from the low resolution MRI scans, but the local deformations are hard to indentify with the program Elastix if the displacements are close to the resolution of the MRI scans.","MRI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-10-19","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biom","","BME","",""

(mentor)","2011","Services are used a lot nowadays in order to deploy large scale systems that should never be shut down such as internet shops, online banking applications, and surveillance systems. Because services can be updated at any given time, testing is required during runtime by its clients to validate that the updated service still performs as required. However, testing during runtime may interfere with the nominal operations of the service and its environment. Furthermore, only the methods exposed by the service through its interface are available to the clients, which reduces the ability to control and observe the service for testing purposes, i.e. its testability. Built-in testing can be used to increase the testability, and to ensure that other clients are not hindered while the service is being tested. However, in order to increase the testability of the service, methods will have to be added to the service, which decreases the modularity and evolvability of the service. In order to maintain the modularity of the service, aspects can be used to separate the test facilities and test cases from the service. An approach has been devised to achieve built-in testing for services through the use of aspects. Our feasibility study and evaluation demonstrate that and how aspects can be used to achieve built-in testing for services. Further evaluation is, however, required to assess how our approach holds up when applied to a large real world service-oriented system.","built-in testing; service; aspect-oriented testing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-10-12","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Software Engineering","",""

Predictions indicate an exponential growth of mobile data traffic world-wide reaching 6.3 exabytes per month by 2015, a 26-fold increase over 2010. Unfortunately, the current infrastructure will not be able to meet these demands. Already now, a speed reduction or even lack of connection can be noticed in crowded places. Service providers are addressing the problem by deploying Femtocells and Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) around cities. However, due to their limited connection range, the projected redirected traffic, including free APs at home and office, is expected to be only 39% by 2015. The intention of this thesis is to extend the range of Wi-Fi APs as internet gateways through multi hopping. Furthermore, phone calls and data exchange between devices in proximity are supported and also offloaded from the 3G data network. Therefore, we offload part of the traffic from the mobile data network to Wi-Fi. An added benefit is a reduction in energy consumption. However, current Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) techniques are unable to scale or to handle high mobility. Therefore, we propose a novel approach called “Mobile Assisted Ad-hoc Networking”. MASS-ANET can be applied to any kind of mobile ad-hoc network where nodes can use both a global and a local transmission link. In this project, Wi-Fi local connectivity is used to create a mobile ad-hoc network. 3G links act as a global coordination medium with the help of a central server. The feasibility of the MASS-ANET is determined with the help of simulations. Subsequently modern commodity smartphones are used as prototypes in validation experiments. The proposed solution is verified using a real-world application: exchanging real-time voice traffic over several hops in a mobile ad-hoc Wi-Fi network.","MANET; mobile; network; mobile traffic; Android; ad-hoc Wi-Fi","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Software Group","","Computer Engineering","",""

This flood is described as one of enormous proportions, a disaster which severely influenced the life of hundred thousands of people in Nepal and millions of people in India. This study investigates the natural aggradation of the river system and the influence of the barrage on the river system. The occurring hydraulic and morphologic processes during the flood of 2008 and the influence of this flood on the river system are studied as well. Since reliable data about many aspects of the Koshi River are not available, it was decided to make a one-dimensional model, to simulate the large scale morphological and hydrodynamic processes and in addition to gain insight in the one-dimensional processes, such as retrogressive erosion and the propagation speed, during the flood of 2008. Insight in the hydrodynamic and the morphological processes in the Koshi River are also of great importance for understanding the shifting behaviour of the river and to perform suitable measures. Closely related to this shifting behaviour is the high sediment load of the river. A key factor in the flooding problem approach is a strategy to deal with the sedimentation. This is a very challenging task due to the huge amounts of sediment and since the sediment is infertile, it has no utility. Only a small percentage is used as construction material. An exploration for possible technical solutions is performed. The most promising measure is the construction of sleeper dikes, to reduce the risk of flooding and narrowing the Koshi River with recurrent measures, to manage the sediment. To be able to test the effectiveness of the recurrent measure to manage the sediment, a 2DH-model of the Koshi River is developed. Before this measure can be tested, smaller scale hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes of the Koshi have to be modelled and explained. Firstly, an effort is made to model the braided plan form of the Koshi River. Furthermore, different settings for important parameters are applied, to determine the sensitivity of the model. After this, the narrowing of the river with recurrent measures is tested; by the application of porcupines in certain channels. Also narrowing with permanent structures is performed. The results can be seen as exploratory.","Koshi; braided river; sediment management; flooding; morphology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-10-21","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","River Dynamics","",""

Typically, the model is placed inside the ow and the microphones locations are outside the ow. Hence, the sound waves emitted from aeroacoustic sources of the model have to pass through the open-jet shear layer before reaching the microphone. This sound propagation through a shear layer causes refraction, spectral broadening, and loss of coherence between signals arriving at different microphones. These effects depend on Mach number of the wind tunnel, frequency of the model, and both microphone and source position, and are presently only partially understood. This substantially hampers the interpretation of aeroacoustic measurements.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Simonse, L.W.L. (mentor)","2011","This thesis is a summary of all the results of the graduation project conducted at 3M Filtrete. 3M Filtrete, a brand by worldwide organization 3M, is specialized in producing electrostatic charged air filters. These filters are constantly charged (without external power source) and work as tiny magnets. This technology is mainly used in HVAC (Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning) systems. 3M Filtrete is one of the biggest brand of indoor cleaning filters in the US market. It has delivered cleaner air to millions of homes and is market leader in residential air filtration for the last 20 years. Furthermore, 3M Filtrete also seems to strike in Asia and has noticed growing market activities. As for the European market, 3M Filtrete is a relatively small and unknown player. However, the Eurpean market is showing potential and 3M Filtrete wants to take advantage of the opportunities. Therefore, a strategic analysis - with the focus on the market - is conducted to explore the opportunities of the European market. The main objective of this project is to provide an overview of the European air filtration market and explore opportunities for 3M Filtrete to expand and strengthen their position in Europe. In addition, a new product concept on how to apply the technology will be proposed. This new product concept will enhance the consumer experience of a mobile air purifier. It is developed through a strategic process involving market analysis and consumer research. Finally, a strategic plan is presented for the concept.","air filters; product strategy; market overview","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-10-10","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2011","Grafica Soset, a Brazilian producer of printed materials, is a company that needs to transition to the use of digital invoices for sale of goods and services. All Brazilian companies have set deadlines per type of industry, created by the Brazilian government, to transition from the use of paper invoices to the use of invoices that exist only in a digital form called the NF-e. The NF-e standard as devised by Brazil consists of a set of web services that must be implemented by taxpayers in order to have their internal IT architecture create, digitally sign and securely transmit XML archives containing sales and tax information to the state-level Brazilian Tax Authorities. The existing ERP system in use at Grafica Soset must be updated in order to comply with the new NF-e regulations. In order to achieve this a set of Open Source tools were chosen to form the basis of an implementation of the NF-e standard as mandated by Brazil. Specifically the foundation of the new implementation is the Grails framework that allows for the creation of Java-based Web Applications. The chosen toolset has led to the implementation of a software package that manages to read production data coming from Grafica Soset’s production database and display this information to users who can subsequently emit digital invoices. The created invoices are transformed into XML by the implementation and digitally signed with a X.509 certificate that has been obtained by Grafica Soset. The use of the digital certificate and the registration with the Brazilian Tax Authority of the state of Sao Paulo has allowed Grafica Soset to become an official emitter of digital invoices and as such the implemented software is able to produce these invoices and have them validated by the Brazilian Tax Authority, which results in their availability in the national Brazilian Digital Invoice repository, open for consult to all companies and private individuals for verification of the legal status of the sale of goods or services. Due to time constraints it has not been feasible to implement the entire NF-e standard and future work should be focused on releasing new iterations of the delivered software. These iterations should implement the remaining web services as mandated by the Brazilian Tax Authorities, provide increased testing and code coverage, provide client-side testing and provide a means for remote archival of digital invoices.","soap; xml; grails","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Media knowledge engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Hajian, M. (mentor)","2011","This report address the master graduation project of Michiel Maassen titled: “Increasing user comfort in the treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea” OSA (Obstructive Sleep apnoea) is a sleep disorder which effects 3-4% of the male and 2% of the female population. A blockage in the throat, caused by relaxation of the tongue, makes patients repeatedly stop breathing for over ten seconds during sleep. This can happen over thirty times an hour. A major problem of OSA is that patients are unaware of its existence; symptoms may be present for years without identification. Untreated OSA causes insomnia, higher blood pressure, oxygen shortage and triples the chance of fatal heart failure. It also causes a huge economic burden, since the medical cost of an untreated OSA patient are almost double compared to the general population. Next to that, indirect costs are substantial. For example, OSA patients have a three- to sevenfold increased risk of motor vehicle crashes. The most common treatment for OSA is Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). This is a machine that supplies pressurized air to the user via a hose and a mask to prevent apnoea’s during sleep. Although CPAP is improved in its 30 year existence, no fundamental changes have been made next to adding variable pressure and humidification. The treatment is very effective but still not very comfortable; 72% of the users suffer from problems and side effects. That is why one out of three patients quits the treatment, which reduces the life expectancy of the patient drastically. The discomfort is mainly caused by the mask of the CPAP device. Within Philips, CPAP belongs to the home healthcare sector, which is marked as core of healthcare division and a key focus for the company in general. Philips would benefit greatly of an improved version of the CPAP machine that reduces the discontinue rate of the current treatment. At the moment Philips Respironics is a major player in the CPAP market, but it is not the largest and their products are, compared to the main competition, priced below average. A new innovative high end product or product line in this market can be the example for the Philips Respironics brand to move towards a higher market segment. In the graduation project a new treatment for OSA is developed, according to the design methodology of the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at the Delft University of Technology. During the development the student had access to state of the art research facilities that are present within Philips Research. Based on papers, patens, users, numerous experiments and computer simulations an insight was gained in the difficulties, problems and imperfections of the current treatment. The main problem is the lack of comfort which is mostly caused by the current mask that causes irritation on the skin. New solutions were proposed during various design iterations, of which three invention disclosure have been filled to the Philips patent office which evaluated if the intellectual property was eligible for protection. The proposed design, SmartPAP, increases user comfort by innovating the current treatment in all major elements. The large mask, the major cause of discomfort, is replaced by memory foam nose plugs. The memory foam nose plugs are very efficient in sealing the airway pressure. Next to that they are easy to mount and they can be hold in place by a single head strap. The hose between the machine and the mask is made more flexible and halved in diameter. For the machine itself, a whole new way of air regulation is developed that leads to 55% energy reduction. This reduction allows to run the device the whole night long on a rechargeable batteries that will be included in the device. This design forms the foundations for an innovative device that has the potential to be a revolution in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea if it would be further developed by Philips.","Obstructive Sleep Apnoea; CPAP; Apnea","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-10-07","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2011","In tegenstelling tot conventionele radar -en radiosystemen kan de toepas- sing van een Software Defined Radio (SDR) grotendeels bepaald worden in software. Een SDR bestaat uit een RF-frontend, een paar ADC/DAC’s, een FPGA en een host computer. In de hostcomputer en de FPGA kan de functie van een SDR volledig worden geherdefini ?eerd, zonder dat daar een aanpassing in de hardware voor nodig is. Het USRP1 is een specifieke implementatie van het hardware gedeelte van een SDR. Het USRP wordt aangesloten op een dochterbord dat de bepaald op welke frequenties gewerkt kan worden. In combinatie met GNU Radio voor het software deel van de SDR vormt dit een aantrekkelijk onderzoeksplatform om de mogelijkheden van SDR voor radar -en radiosystemen mee te verkennen. GNU Radio is een uitgebreid softwarepakket waarmee alle opties van het USRP benut kunnen worden. Met behulp van relatief makkelijk te doorgronden pythonscripts is het mogelijk om SDR’s te bouwen. Met GNU Radio Companion kan bovendien zelfs zonder enige code te schrijven gebruik worden gemaakt van de meeste mogelijkheden van GNU Radio. In dit onderzoek werd een enkele USRP1 in combinatie met een RFX2400 dochterbord gebruikt om de basis te leggen voor een eenvoudig radarsysteem. Het hardware-ontwerp van het USRP1 legt hierbij een aantal beperkingen op aan de implementatiemogelijkheden. Het voornaamste probleem is de gebrekkige isolatie tussen de verzender en de ontvanger. Daarnaast schiet de bandbreedte van de USB-interface te kort. Uiteindelijk is wel de basis gelegd voor een Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar. Op een enkele USRP werkt dit systeem echter niet goed, vanwege de eerdergenoemde isolatie problemen. Het gebruik van meerdere USRP’s kan de isolatieproblemen oplossen. Het probleem van de beperkte interface-bandbreedte kan worden verholpen door het gebruik van het USRP2, een verbeterde versie van het USRP1.","USRP; Software Defined Radio; Radar; GNU Radio","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Circuits and Systems","",""

This theoretical knowledge is expanded with a mathematical description of the internal processes involving the cell voltage, current density, resistance and voltage drop. These variables are linked together through a single equation. Based on the known SOFC equation, a SOFEC variant is proposed. This is done by breaking down the steps performed within Cycle Tempo. These are analyzed individually, an alterations are made. Afterwards, the actual programming code is analyzed, and all alterations are summarized. They are changed according to the proposed theory. With a working program, the results are finally analyzed and compared to the theory. This is followed by a chapter covering explaining the basics of the hydrogen economy. The advantages and problems occurring from this are summarized and a possible future implementation of the SOFEC is given.

(mentor)","2011","Shell is developing a floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility to extract and process natural gas in the Browse Basin on the North West Shelf of Australia. This shelf break area is known for its strong tidal currents and year-round stratification. Tidal currents transporting stratified water over steep bathymetry can generate large internal waves called solitary waves (sometimes called solitons). A field survey in the Browse Basin showed that internal solitary waves have passed the FLNG location on several occasions. Solitons are known to have severely disrupted offshore operations in other areas in the past. In the case of the Prelude FLNG project, the production risers, steel tubular water intake risers and mooring chains can all be subject to fatigue or clashing due to internal wave events. The safety and effectiveness of the FLNG project can be improved if it is possible to forecast when solitons will occur and what their magnitude will be. For that reason, Shell wants to use a numerical model that is capable of predicting the internal wave activity in the Browse Basin. Finlab is a non-hydrostatic, finite element model that solves the full Navier-Stokes equations on unstructured grids. It was designed for small-scale flow problems with complex topography. However it has never been extensively tested for internal solitary waves. Therefore, the objectives of this project are to investigate whether Finlab can be used for the numerical simulation of internal waves in the Browse Basin and to gain a better understanding of internal wave dynamics in the Browse Basin through data analysis and numerical simulations.","solitons","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Dynamics","",""

(mentor)","2011","Volume visualization of photographic data is a relatively new domain for medical visualisation. In photographic volumes, voxel colour is predetermined, making colour selection through transfer functions less important, or even unnecessary. However, voxel classi?cation from photographic data is more complex than classi?cation from scalar datasets. Materials and structures in the human body overlap in the colour-space, and are therefore not separable solely by their colour values. In addition, low contrast between some of the adjacent materials and structures in the data complicates the use of boundary-based classi?cation techniques. In the ?rst half of this work we investigate the differences between volume visualization of scalar datasets and volume visualization of photographic datasets. We study a broad range of techniques which could be extended for photographic data, or replace traditional techniques in the volume render pipeline. In addition we study normal estimation for photographic data, which suffers from the non-linear colour spaces and previously mentioned low contrast. In the second half of this work we present an example-based visualization system which does not require its user to understand the mechanics of volume visualization. Our target group are non-visualization experts who want to use volume visualization to provide insight into their data. The system uses live rendered style previews which can be combined to form a composite render style. The system supports multiple photorealistic as well as illustrative render techniques and can apply any combination of these techniques to any object in the dataset, rendering comprehensible images. The effectiveness of our system is demonstrated by experimental results on real volumetric data.","visualization; raycasting; medical; photographic data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-10-15","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Graphics","","Mediamatics","",""

Like a CPU, I would like the user to have a central position and role in the “machine-vehicle”. All the information goes through the CPU and all the decisions are taken there. The better the CPU (more cultivated the user) the more possibilities the machine has. However, any processing power would be useless without a set of well connected and working periphericals. In a sense, the interaction of the user with the vehicle would work as a miniature of the interaction of a moving citizen in the wanted society type. The personal vehicle is designed around the user with the goal to emphasize his importance. This is achieved by projecting his individuality as a citizen on the move. The same vehicle allows to be driven in different driving positions that express each user’s character. The vehicle is able to lean its wheels during cornering and it is being stabilized during acceleration and deceleration by a system of two mechanical gyroscopes. This system has also effect on the wheels’ leaning angle. This way all the driving actions are translated in visual cues for the other citizens.

Electric mobility is however expected to impact the electricity grid, thereby requiring the grid to be reinforced. Costs for network reinforcements are social costs and it is in society’s benefit to limit those costs. Municipalities have no real incentive to limit grid impact in their charging infrastructure deployment strategies. Network operators have the incentives, but have limited means to minimise the impact. System analysis, network impact analysis and institutional analysis are done to come to technical and institutional options to limit the grid impact of electric mobility and deal with the skewed incentive structure. It is concluded that network operators should create a grid impact guideline for charging station deployment which indicates the grid capacity to deal with high power charging stations. This guideline can be used to create a municipal strategic charging station deployment map.","electric mobility; grid impact; municipalities; network operators; system analysis; network impact analysis; institutional analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy and Industry","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor)","2011","Jetties are designed by the guidance of the deterministic standards. These standards are based on the standardized values of safety factors (semi-probabilistic) and use the load and the capacity of every element as a standard value. The interaction of every separate element as a part of a whole is not taken in to account. The use of deterministic standards can result in a design that is not economically optimal. A probabilistic approach gives a better insight in the occurrence of an unwanted events and leads to more insight of the optimizing of the structure. The “Lyondell jetty” in the Europort in Rotterdam is used as reference structure. This jetty is constructed in 1997 and is in use by a manufacturer of chemical derivatives for all kinds of synthetic products. It concerns a continues berthing structure founded on piles and is covered with fender wood, with a double deck jetty, that offers space to berth two large sea vessel and two smaller barges. The failure of the berthing structure is a conditional chance for functioning of the jetty. The berthing structure is submitted to further examination by means of a Monte Carlo simulation. Using the Monte Carlo simulation a measure of failure of an event is expressed in strength and resistance. In this study this event consists of reaching the yielding stress in the structure or the exceeding of a determined boundary of deformation during the berthing of a vessel. The energy loading is introduced with the equation of Saurin. The soil is modelled as a spring and meets the requirements of the Winkler model. In analysing the deformations of the structure the soil needs to have elasto-plastic characteristics (p-y curves that were developed by Reese). The actual structure that was designed with the Blum method, the design was recalculated, using help of p-y curves. This becomes the Kool model that is used for comparison with the results of the Monte Carlo simulation. In this thesis only the berthing of the mooring point 2 (large sea vessel) is considered. First the question if the developed 3 dimensional simulation technique is applicable answered and second whether the application of the model leads to differences in capacity. The soil model developed in Scia-engineer has the same behavior as in M-pile and the structure shows the expected behavior according the rules of mechanics. In the model relating to the energy load the variables of length, width, depth, mass, angle of berthing and the coordinates of impact are described as a stochastic. In the resistance of the structure the volume weight, internal angle of friction, cohesion, yielding stress and wall thickness of the tubular segments are described as a stochastic. From the results it appears that the loads occurs only very locally. Consequently there appears an over capacity in the reference design relating to the length of all the piles and the diameter of the piles. The five most loaded piles in the structure are checked due to the energy loading of the bow at Mooring Point 2. It appeared that the diameter of these piles can have a smaller fitted diameter. In length a reduction of 9% is found. A trend can be distinguished that indicates a large reduction of capacity in length over the whole structure. The critical variable in the design is the velocity of the vessel. The critical element in the structure is the berthing beam self. The sensitivity analysis of strength indicates that the chance of failure in strength can be diminished by the strengthening of the berthing beam and reducing the thickest wall thickness’s of the piles.","Probabilistic; Saurin; P-y curve; Monte Carlo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-12-03","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Hartmann, L. (mentor); Kwee, Z. (mentor)","2011","Crowdfunding is an emerging financial instrument, which can roughly be described as a phenomenon where a large number of financial contributions are made to support specific initiatives or enterprises in an online environment. The form can be a donation, prefinancing a product or service or in return of a financial reward. The latter form is also known as crowdfinancing. A growing number of startup companies are looking into new sources of finance, such as crowdfinancing, as they experience low entrance to traditional financial resources. The goal of this research is to discover the motivations of entrepreneurs to choose for crowdfinancing and to define their preferred crowdfinancing value proposition, from the point of view of the entrepreneur and the crowdfinancing platform. First, a case study among five Dutch crowdfinancing platforms is conducted, using interviews with the founders of these platforms and internet data research. The aim of this is to sketch their view on the current value proposition of the crowdfinancing platforms towards entrepreneurs. Second, four entrepreneur using two of these crowdfinancing platforms are interviewed to uncover their motives to choose for this method of acquiring capital. Third, the results of former interviews were processed and used as input for setting up a questionnaire, which is filled out by a sample of 25 predominantly innovative for-profit startups. Fourth, the results are used to validate the crowdfinancing value proposition on a larger scale, and are compared with other research in this field. The main findings are: (1) Strong reasons use crowdfinancing are: an extra opportunity for capital, company PR, lower cost of financing, addressing new customers, obtaining engaged investors, market validation and participating in something innovative. (2) Conditions that discourage crowdfinancing the most are when the crowd gets direct influence in the company e.g. in the case of equity or when the entrepreneur is personally liable for the financing, which may be required in the case of debt. (3) Demotivators and dissatisfiers of crowdfinancing arise when entrepreneurs think that the customers of a company are not the same as the ones who might invest through crowdfinancing or when their intellectual property cannot be protected. (4) The preferred financial participations in a crowdfinancing context by the entrepreneurs are prefinancing a product or service in combination with either loans or revenue shares. (5) Three out of four entrepreneurs in the sample intend to make use of a crowdfinancing platform in the future; they expect facilitation of contracts, transactions and selection and screening of companies as a service.","crowdfinancing; crowdfunding; SME finance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-10-04","Technology, Policy and Management","TSE","","Entrepreneurship","",""

(mentor)","2011","This research focuses on the stimulation of shale gas plays of Jurassic Geverik member and Carboniferous Altena formations in the Dutch subsurface. The production of shale gas involves stimulation of the formation by hydraulic fracture treatment. Two typical types of stimulation are used in the industry. The viscous fluid treatment, which consists of small amounts of viscous fluid, high proppant concentrations and volumes and the slick water treatment, which contains large amounts of fluids and low proppant concentrations. Main objective for this study is to determine the best stimulation strategy for shale gas development in onshore Netherlands West Netherlands Basin and the Roer Valley Graben. The first step in the process is a thorough understanding of the shale’s petrophysical attributes. Core and cutting testing determine mechanical properties such as tensile and compressive strength, mineralogical content, Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio, hardness and petrophysical properties such as porosity and permeability. Mineralogy plays an important role in controlling shale properties. The more clay particles in the rock the more ductile the rock is. The Carboniferous Geverik member has relatively large amounts of quartz, high values for brittleness, elastic properties and hardness. The Jurassic formations are clay rich, with some intervals with a higher carbonate mineral content, and are typically more ductile, softer and have lower elastic properties. Rock matrix flow and storage capacities are quantified on core samples by the pulse decay method and the GRI method on crushed samples. The experimental study gives a variety of results for the different formations which are partly due to microfractures and large uncertainty caused by poor core quality. Coupling wireline-log information with laboratory measurements of core and cutting samples acquired in this study provides the basis for an artificial neural network. With the use of all the analyses and the neural network the hydraulic-fracture treatment and the completion intervals are selected. Completion intervals are selected on the basis of the brittle zones. The selection of the appropriate stimulation strategy is based on the shale brittleness, geomechanical, and geochemical properties.","Shale gas; Hydraulic fracturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-10-03","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Petroleum Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","In this thesis, I have investigated the self-optimization approach in order to solve a generic resource allocation challenge. The challenge is defined for a general ICT system serving two classes of jobs: low and high priority. The high priority jobs require a higher quality of service compared to the low priority jobs. In order to fulfill this difference in QoS levels, a part of the total resource capacity should be held reserved to serve only high priority jobs. Two different self-optimization methods are applied to solve the challenge and the objective of the self-optimization algorithms is to split the total resources in such a way as to minimize the overall Blocking considering the different level of QoS. The first applied method is a rule-based method and the other one is fuzzy-Q learning. I also have defined a performance quality matrix which is used to assess and compare the algorithm’s reactions in three sets of designed simulation scenarios. The first set of scenarios aims to examine the effect of the different parameter settings on the overall performance of the algorithms. The second set of scenarios simulates a partial failure in the total capacity which is subsequently repaired causing the system to return to normalcy, and observes the algorithm’s reactions in adapting to these changes. The final set of simulations changes the arrival process to batch arrival where in one group of simulations the arrival rate (?) has not changed while in the other it has decreased by the rate of the average arrival batch size.","self-optimization; resource allocation; rule-based; fuzzy-Q learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

The different process steps of Systems Engineering have been used as a guideline during the design. In short, the main goal of the Waterdraer is to transport fresh water into St Lucia without a long extensive back up of water in the Mfolozi. In the beginning of the report the following research question was defined: · What is the most optimal solution for restoring and enhancing some of the features of the original ecologic St Lucia estuary system, in relation to the short term possibilities? The St Lucia estuary and surroundings are part of the GEF project in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park. The GEF project involves many different stakeholders and complex problems. Even in the short term there are a lot of interests at stake. First, there is the need for fresh water into the St Lucia estuary, the Narrows, and lakes. Secondly, there are the sugarcane farmlands that should be “protected” against flooding. Thirdly, there is a need for biologic and ecologic exchange between the sea and iSimangaliso Wetland Park. Finally there is a need for an open St Lucia mouth connection for local fishery. The difficulty of these problems is that they are all interdependent. However, the four problems are also conflicting with one another. The current situation shows that the old Back Channel is not sufficient enough to provide enough water inflow without backing up water in the Mfolozi floodplain. Even when the Mfolozi berm height is sustained the discharge of the “natural” weir in the old Back Channel is too low. As a result the water levels could rise too fast and would lead to an artificially or even a natural breach. Even a small flood could not be sustained to prevent a (artificially) breach of the berm. An open Mfolozi berm results in the malfunctioning of the old Back Channel. In the past years a lot of knowledge about the problems and systems has been gained. Mismanagement during the past 50 years becomes gradually accepted and the iSimangaliso Wetland Park authority has changed the management strategy of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park. One of the preferred long term options is bringing back the combined mouth dynamics. Currently, this is not an option because management conflicts and uncertainties about such impact are unsolved. The improved Back Channel (the Waterdraer) anticipates to the customer needs by providing an easy implementable short term solution. The Waterdraer its main goal is to bring enough fresh and sediment free water into St Lucia to counteract the hypersalinity during droughts. In addition, it should limit the effects of flooding on the lower floodplains. The Waterdraer variant consists of the widening of the recently excavated new Back Channel. The bottom level is decreased towards 0m GMSL, which is assumed to be the current height of the “main” channel of the Back Channel. The threshold of (artificially) breaching the Mfolozi berm is set at +1.8m above GMSL. The proposed threshold level is depended on two factors. Firstly the amount of flooding allowed on the floodplains and secondly the largest flood wave that has to be retained. A new weir inside the new Back Channel is designed as the control notch of the system. The weir creates a “controllable” situation and minimizes the effects of sediment transport. The crest height and width of the overflow determine the size of the flow into St Lucia. The width of the weir is based on the maximum flow velocity at which erosion occurs in mangrove forests, and on the minimum flow required to fulfill the requirements. A stilling basin of soft materials (logs) is designed to dissipate the energy of the water that flows over the weir. Modelling in SOBEK shows that the improved Back Channel could have provided a flow of approximately 64Mm3 considering the discharge of the last 4. months. The latter is based on the condition that the maximum water level behind the Mfolozi berm would be increased to +1.8m GMSL. An interesting remark is that the water level has not exceeded +1.5m GMSL during this period. In addition, the artificial breach of the Mfolozi berm in July 2011 has been kept out the model in order to simulate the natural situation of the Mfolozi mouth. Lawrie and Stretch (2011) mention that hypersaline conditions in the St Lucia lakes can be prevented if the Back Channel provides a water inflow of at least 5Mm3/month, which is 60Mm3/year. The SOBEK model and a simple water balance model suggest that even small floods (single peak flood waves with a peak height . 75m3/s) are retained behind the berm. Finally, the Waterdraer could drop water levels in the Mfolozi from +1.8m GMSL back to + 1.5m GMSL in five days if such a flood occurs. Floods above 75m3/s result in a natural breach which means long flooding periods on the floodplains are no longer present. In short, the Waterdraer offers an easy implementable short term solution that counteracts hypersalinity in the St Lucia lakes. Furthermore, it minimizes the effects of flooding on the floodplains that lie above +1.5m GMSL. Due to the retention basin behind the Mfolozi berm sediment inflow into the Narrows is reduced to acceptable levels. The effect on marine distribution is considered to be minimal. In comparison with a combined mouth the new Back Channel does not provide enough inflow to breach the St Lucia mouth by itself.","St. Lucia; salt intrusion; hypersalinity; iSimangaliso; Mfolozi","en","student report","TU Delft, Section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""
