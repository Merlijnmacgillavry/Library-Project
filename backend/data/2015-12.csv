(mentor)","2015","Air tra?c has been growing rapidly for the past few decades and will continue to do so. Airports need to be able to coop with this increase, and thus increase their own capacity. However, due to the landing and departure operations, which take place at low altitudes, high noise levels are generated and a?ect the neighboring communities. This in turn limits the growth of airports that are located near inhabited areas, due to the restrictions on noise levels set by governments for airports. In order to reduce the aircraft noise, a number of solutions have been developed. Some of these solutions are on the aircraft level while the others are on the airport level. A number of solution implemented on the aircraft level are for example, noise e?cient engines and noise reducing fairings. The airport level knows the development of noise abatement operational procedures, such as the CDA. However, there are downsides to such a procedure, like the limitations that it only allows vertical optimization or ?ight at night. Therefore, a new noise abatement procedure has been developed called HeNAP, which stands for Helical Noise Abatement Procedure. As the name suggests it is a procedure where the descent approach is performed by means of a spiral. This allows the aircraft to perform a ?yover the inhabited areas at a higher altitude and perform a descent near the airport by means of a spiral. This would reduce the noise levels perceived by the inhabitants. Earlier research showed a decrease in noise levels but an increase in fuel consumption and time; however, it was never optimized with respect to these factors and at closely inhabited airports. Therefore: The aim of this project is to develop noise-optimal HeNAP approach trajectories using methods from optimal control theory. The noise bene?ts of the optimal HeNAP trajectories need to be assessed through comparison with conventional noise abatement procedures. In addition, an analysis needs to be made of the operational consequences of introducing HeNAP procedures. For this purpose, a GPOPS-based environmental optimization framework for HeNAPs was created. By performing the research on the HeNAP and validating it at the same time, a set of research goals are investigated during this thesis:  Develop a code for optimizing the HeNAP trajectories within GPOPS .  Assess the in?uence of changing multiple variables such as the altitude, the helical radius and number of spirals performed before landing on the environmental optimization of HeNAP’s with respect to noise impact, fuel usage and time. The framework that is created in GPOPS for the HeNAPs combines a number of models in order to generate noise, namely, a noise model and an aircraft model. This combination results in noise generation of the trajectory ?own, and is processed further in a model that calculates the impact of the noise on inhabited areas. By means of sleep disturbance doseresponse relationship, the impact is converted into the number of awakenings. All of the models interconnect such that a gradient-based optimization is performed to optimize the HeNAP procedure. With the usage of Optimal Control Theory, the cost function, consisting of a weighted noise factor and fuel contribution, is minimized by means of a dynamic process in order to ?nd the optimal controls of the problem. With the help of the Radau pseudospectral method, the dynamics of the problem is accurately approximated. This allows the continuous problem to be discretized to change the in?nite-dimensional problem into a ?nite-dimensional nonlinear programming problem. This can be solved with a numerical solver and results in optimal controls and states that form the HeNAP trajectory. To assess the di?erent changes in altitude, radius and number of spirals and impact of the resulting solutions on the environment, for the majority of the time a single-phase optimization is used. However, in order to assess sections of the HeNAP trajectory, multi-phase optimization is sometimes used as well. The help of these optimizations simulates di?erent HeNAP routes until the most favorable one is found. A case study is performed in a highly inhabited area around Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. During this case study, a number of routes are simulated and investigated. Di?erent altitudes, radii and number of spirals are compared while adhering to the di?erent airspace regulations. Over 300 simulations have been performed, as this was an intensive trial and error process, eventually resulting in a number of cases over four di?erent optimization problems. These problems are de?ned as followed, minimum time optimization problem, minimum fuel optimization problem, minimum time and noise abatement optimization problem and ?nally minimum fuel and noise abatement optimization problem. The cases that are solved for these problems are as followed:  Case 1: is a CDA procedure that is performed at an altitude of 7000 ft and minimum ILS approach distance of 6.2 NM.  Case 2: is the ?rst HeNAP simulation and is run with an altitude of 7,000 ft and one spiral.  Case 3 the altitude is changed from 7000 ft to 10,000 ft.  Case 4 the altitude of case 3 is still in e?ect and the number spirals is changed from 1 to 2. The results of these cases are all comparable throughout the di?erent optimization problems. All of them reveal that the CDA procedure is the most favorable procedure as it has the least number of awakenings, fuel consumed and time needed to land. However, when relocating the population around the airport to the ?rst part of the trajectory it yields better results. Case 3 is then the most favorable case, with promising results. The changes in altitude for the HeNAP showed that by having a higher initial altitude the number of inhabitant awakened is reduced, however when the number of spirals is increased this e?ect is dismissed. The following recommendations might help improve/show more of the HeNAP possibilities. The ?rst recommendation that can be given, is to use the results that are found within this thesis and use them as a basis for the same research but within another area that might be less inhabited than the area around AAS and where the night-curfew is also in e?ect. Another recommendation that can be made is to add the wind and weather conditions to the GPOPS tool in order to get results that are more realistic and increase the reliability of the results and feasibility of the trajectories performed. A ?nal recommendation is to introduce better methods to avoid local minima within the GPOPS tool, this result in unnecessary delays. Nevertheless, the HeNAP procedure has great future possibilities only not within the Netherlands.","HeNAP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","ATO","","","",""

(mentor); Van Kuik, G.A.M. (mentor)","2015","Offshore wind energy is expected to grow in the coming years: future plans for offshore wind farms total more than 98 GW. Financing is needed to realise these plans. Investment decisions partly depend on the uncertainty in energy yield predictions. It is therefore important that these energy yield predictions and their corresponding uncertainty are determined as accurately as possible. Current methods for determining annual energy production assume that there is a linear relation between input uncertainties and output uncertainty, allowing the use of simple methods for determining annual energy production and its uncertainty. It is however known that this assumption is incorrect: nonlinear relations do exist. This means that it is unclear whether the use of these simple methods can be justified. This thesis has developed a methodology that can be used to determine if, and how, the nonlinear effect of combining two uncertainty sources should be incorporated in the energy yield prediction. This has been done by investigating the case study of the nonlinear effect of combining array efficiency and availability. The investigation was split up in five main steps. First, the physical relations between array efficiency and availability have been explored, revealing that downtime of a turbine affects the array efficiency of a wind farm. Figuring out the state-of-the-art methods pointed out that this interdependency is currently not taken into account. By adjusting the current models, an adapted model was developed that is able to consider this effect. Simulations have been performed on both the current and the adapted model. The results show that for a typical mean availability value of 96.2%, the differences between the current and the adapted model are smaller than 1%. This means that the current methods used by industry can be justified. However, if availability values drop, the difference between both models becomes significant. Due to the high development and computational time of the adapted model, an approximation of the mean annual energy production was developed that uses existing tools. This approximation yields accurate results: the difference between the approximation and the results of the adapted model is lower than 0.5%. Since the approach that was used in this research has proven to be successful, it can be translated to a generic methodology. This methodology can be followed to determine the nonlinear effect of two other uncertainty sources.","Windenergy; array efficiency; availability; nonlinear effect; energy yield; offshore wind; uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","Amsterdam Airport Schiphol expects growing cargo volumes in the future. At the same time, due to the expansion of passenger terminals, the cargo handling terminals at Schiphol are relocated and bundled on a smaller area at AAS South-East. The question is: how to handle increasing cargo volumes on a smaller area? One of the opted means to reach a higher handling productivity is a fast-track facility which enables cargo (which is not in need of build-up or break-down activities) to bypass the current handler warehouses. A fast-track facility (FTF) is expected to increase cargo lead times and AAS handling productivity. This research focusses on the physicial design of the FTF as well as the institutional design. With a discrete event simulation model, the capacity of the storage buffer inside the FTF is approximated. Furthermore, aninstitutional design including the financial flows and actor configuration of the FTF is suggested which is acceptable for the critical actors at AAS. It is concluded that a FTF which tranships solely import cargo is able to greatly increase AAS productivity and be accepted by the actor environment. In order to completely cope with the expected the demand surplus, a small handler and warehouse efficiency increase is required besides the implementation of the FTF. A truck Milkrun configuration is required in order to ensure continuous FTF outflow.","Schiphol; airport; cargo; transhipment; transshipment; fast-track; cross dock; cross-dock; design; terminal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure & Logistics","",""

One explanation for these high costs arises from the large amount of uncertainties that come with such complex projects. As a result of this complexity, it’s difficult to foresee the course of events in advance. Decisions made during the preliminary design phase are often based on limited data while having a great impact on project outcome. A tool is needed to assist engineers during these early stages of design. This tool should deliver good results using limited input data and require little computational time. An example of such a tool is TeamPlay; an engineering model that evaluates offshore wind farm design using automated optimization techniques. In its current state, only a monopile type foundation is analyzed within this process. Since the current trend in the industry is to build larger farms further from shore, this foundation type will become less popular in the future.

(mentor); Hoogenboom, P.C.J. (mentor); Bani Shafie, N. (mentor)","2015","One of the most dangerous events that can occur on an offshore topside structure is an explosion. If blast analyses is performed without taking plasticity into account, then it may lead to very conservative design. On the other hand monitoring the weight by optimising the structural design is an important design aspect of such structures. Considering the time schedule restraints engineers face during the early phases of project, performing advanced non-linear blast analysis is not a practical approach in FEED phase engineering. CB&I, as a leading designer of topsides and processing equipment for offshore oil and gas production, plans to include the effect of advanced blast analysis in the early design phase by including plasticity effect in linear dynamic calculations and define a maximum unity check exceedance ratio which can be proved safe if the plasticity was taken into account. To this end, a study has been performed of the acceptable unity check exceedance for the preliminary linear dynamic calculations. Furthermore, the influence of the strain rate effect has been investigated. The acceptable unity check exceedance was analysed in SACS (FEM software package) by comparing the results of the elastic dynamic and plastic dynamic analysis of multiple frame structures. Analytic calculations were performed to verify the results. The influence of the strain rate effect is studied in SACS by using the strain progression over time of a simply supported beam exposed to various blast loads and the corresponding strain rate is determined. This was subsequently used in the constitutive equation of Cowper and Symonds to obtain the dynamic flow stress. The inclusion of the material sensitivity in linear calculations is achieved by comparing the increase of the dynamic flow stress to the static flow stress. It was found that a generic rule for the exceedance of the unity check was not possible to obtain with the used approach. However, due to the rapid exertion of the blast load a temporary increase of material strength of approximately 20%-27% can be achieved. This can be utilised in blast analysis by increasing the material strength by this percentage, both for linear and non linear dynamic analysis.","Plasticity; Early design phase; Blast analysis; SACS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-21","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Department of Maritime and Transportation Technology","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2015","Experimental techniques to measure rotorcraft aerodynamic performance are widely used. However, most of them are either unable to capture interference effects from bodies, or require an extremely large computational budget. The objective of the present research is to develop an XV-15 Tilt Rotor Research Aircraft rotor model for investigation of wind tunnel wall interference using a novel Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver for rotorcraft, RotCFD. In RotCFD, a mid-fidelity URANS solver is used with an incompressible flow model and a realizable k-? turbulence model. The rotor is, however, not modeled using a computationally expensive, unsteady viscous body-fitted grid, but is instead modeled using a blade element model with a momentum source approach. Various flight modes of the XV-15 isolated rotor, including hover, tilt and airplane mode, have been simulated and correlated to existing experimental and theoretical data. The rotor model is subsequently used for wind tunnel wall interference simulations in the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) at NASA Ames Research Center in California. The results from the validation of the isolated rotor performance showed good correlation with experimental and theoretical data. The results were on par with known theoretical analyses. In RotCFD the setup, grid generation and running of cases is faster than many CFD codes, which makes it a useful engineering tool. Performance predictions need not be as accurate as high-fidelity CFD codes, as long as wall effects can be properly simulated. For both test sections of the NFAC wall interference was examined by simulating the XV-15 rotor in the test section of the wind tunnel and with an identical grid but extended boundaries in free field. Both cases were also examined with an isolated rotor or with the rotor mounted on the modeled geometry of the Tiltrotor Test Rig (TTR). A ‘quasi linear trim’ was used to trim the thrust for the rotor to compare the power as a unique variable. Power differences between free field and wind tunnel cases were found from -7 % to 0 % in the 80- by 120-Foot Wind Tunnel test section and -1.6 % to 4.8 % in the 40- by 80-Foot Wind Tunnel, depending on the TTR orientation, tunnel velocity and blade setting. The TTR will be used in 2016 to test the Bell 609 rotor in a similar fashion to the research in this report.","tilt; rotor; CFD; RotCFD; wind; tunnel; interference","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-01-01","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","","37.427181, -122.061905"

(mentor)","2015","Indonesian new government (under new President from 2014 election) issues ‘Maritime-highway’ policy by developing 24 strategic ports to form mainline of national maritime transportation network (Indonesian Ministry of Development Planning, 2015). This policy aims to reduce transportation cost as well as economy (price) disparities between west and east region in Indonesia. However, as a new policy from the new government, it still needs more supporting studies to optimize maritime network between selected strategic ports for freight transportation. In addition, as a national level policy, it also needs to consider macro economy future perspective since it will be implemented in a long term period. Therefore, a comprehensive study is conducted to develop a design of Indonesia’s freight maritime network using a multi-objectives optimization model with main objectives to minimize total cost and total distance simultaneously. Literatures review and analysis of Indonesia’s freight maritime network current situation are required to identify important factors for the model implementation. An Origin-Destination (OD) demand matrix for year 2030 is generated as the main input for simulation model analysis. There are three scenarios in the model simulation. First scenario uses OD matrix based on growth factor for each province that is calculated from Growth Domestic Regional Product (GDRP) realization (until 2013) and GDRP target from Indonesian government (until 2019 and continue the 2019 target to the year 2030). In the second scenario, a more balance demand especially in east region is applied by increasing growth factor for provinces with very low GDRP value. Finally, third scenario uses more equal handling cost among ports in the network with the same OD matrix from the second scenario. Furthermore, analysis and selection of alternatives in maritime network design are performed based on the results of the model simulation for each scenario. The final result of this study shows that the recommended maritime network designs have noticeable differences compare to initial network in maritime highway policy especially in the second and the third scenario. In these scenarios, the number and composition of hub and feeder ports are significantly changed due to more balance demand between provinces and more balance ports handling cost in the third scenario. There are also some additional routes, hub ports, and feeder ports for the east region in the recommended design for these two scenarios.","Indonesia; freight maritime network design; OD demand matrix; economy growth factor scenario; multi objectives optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering Systems and Services","","Management of Technology","","52.002676, 4.369941"

(mentor); Vegt, N.J.H. (mentor)","2015","Deeply established into our culture is the conception that everybody succeeds or fails on the grounds of his individual efforts and capabilities. However, success is equally dependent on our relationships with others than it is on ourselves. In order to be successful, happy and healthy a person should not only focus on his personal capabilities, but also on building up relationships and sharing personal capabilities and contacts. This can be done by networking. Even though the skill of networking is such a valuable skill to learn, networking is currently not or barely included in the study program of high school students. It would be valuable for high school students to start with networking consciously at an early age, not only because it is an indispensable tool for future success, but also because it can greatly help the high school students in their career orientation and guidance (COG) process. Be Involved, a young and small company in The Hague has, in cooperation with StudieID, designed and produced a full COG method for high school students called Yubu. Yubu is an online career choice platform that offers high school students a personal development process consisting of serious games, online assignments and tests. Yubu’s content is divided into five categories, called the 5 pillars of COG, including: motive exploration, quality exploration, profession and study exploration, career planning and networking. These 5 pillars of COG are conceived by Kuijpers and represent the foundation of COG. This graduation project consists of creating content for the network pillar of the Yubu method. The content will contain a printable serious game, called a challenge, complete with instructions and reflection methods, which teaches and motivates the students (how) to utilize their networks for achieving personal goals. By utilizing their networks students can achieve goals they cannot achieve on their own. However, most students are not aware of the possibilities networking can offer. In order to achieve goals with the help of their direct and indirect contacts the students have to set up network plans, plans consisting of: 1. One or more names of direct or indirect contacts suitable for helping achieve this goal 2. A description of the contribution this/these contacts could deliver to achieve to help achieving the goal. 3. Substantiation on why these contacts are best suitable for helping with achieving the goal. In order to design a serious game that teaches and motivates the students to set up network plans for achieving their personal goals an analysis has been conducted on the working principles of serious games, the requirements and design possibilities for integrating the product onto Yubu’s platform, the characteristics of the target group and on the suitable game mechanics for the serious game. This analysis resulted in the requirements and wishes for the product and the design brief of the project, stating: “Design a serious game, implementable within Yubu’s platform, that motivates fourth to sixth year high school students from all different levels to utilize their networks in order to achieve personal goals and enables them to set up well substantiated network plans for achieving their own personal goals.” The process of setting up a network plan to achieve a certain goal can be illustrated with a network utilization scheme. As shown in the network utilization scheme a network plan can be set up in two different orders. The arrows in the scheme indicate the evaluation criteria of the network plan. In order for a network plan to succeed the contacts should be both willing (willingness) and capable (expertise) to offer the described help and the student should be able to achieve the goal using the described help (approach). An iteration process, consisting of designing concepts, evaluating concepts and adjusting concepts, has been conducted starting from the first version of the scheme and ending with the final concept: the School Party. The School Party is played during a mentor class by all students simultaneously. The class is divided in teams of 4 to 5 students which compete against each other to organize the best school party with the help of their contacts. The challenge is build up in 5 phases. During the first phase each team sets up network plans for each of the four sub-goals needed to have a successful school party. These goals are: Arrange music, a suitable location, guests through advertising and a fourth goal the students can fill in themselves. A filled in network plan contains the name(s) of the direct (and via via) contact whose help is required, a description of the contribution this contact can deliver and an evaluation of the network plan in the form of chances the contacts are willing and capable to help. These chances are determined with the use of personas. The chances determined by choosing a set of personas that best describe willingness and expertise of the contact. Each of the personas is linked to a chance between 1/6 and 6/6. In the second phase of the challenge the teams ‘call’ eight of their contacts to see whether these contacts are willing and capable to help. This is simulated by throwing dice. Whenever each dice throw is lower or similar to each of the corresponding chances the contact will contribute to their school party. In the third phase each team presents their organized school party and the students vote on which one of the parties other than their own they would buy a ticket for. The team with the most votes wins the game. After the game has been played the students classically reflect on the challenge by answering questions about their game experience and how the learned method of setting up network plans can be used for their personal goals. After the class the students set up a network plan for a personal goal, using an online reflection form. The challenge has been tested on two classes of the Luzac College. Based on this evaluation recommendations have been set up for future development of ‘the School Party’.","serious games; networking; be involved; Valentijn Visch; Niko Vegt; Laurens Mensink; Yubu","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","The Damen Crane Barge type CB6324 is a transhipment barge, designed to operate in harbours, inshore and in near coastal waters worldwide, mainly for the on- and offloading of bulk carriers. In the second generation of this crane barge, optimization of the equipment and overall design is sought, increasing usability of the barge and reducing overall costs. The same is sought in the design of a jib rest, as it is found to be heavy and cost reduction can be realized by reducing weight. Additionally, it is suspected that the jib rest can be hit by the crane grab during operation. The new optimized design is restrained by the need to be able to withstand the load of the crane jib in travel conditions overseas and during its complete operational lifetime. As the barge needs to be able to operate worldwide, identification of Ultimate Limit Loads is key. Lloyds Register provides a conservative method to determine the loads acting on the floating crane barge and its equipment, based on extreme weather conditions. As specific data on the CB6324 is available, a different calculation method is proposed, using motion responses, sea state data and design criteria as an input. The method is based on probability of encountering a sea state, the probability of non-exceedance of a wave in such a sea state, and the operability of the barge, to predict the maximum probable accelerations encountered. Finally, analysis of two first generation crane barges built, show some fatigue crack forming on the jib rests during transport to the operational locations. This signifies an interest of a fatigue analysis and estimation, adding up to three design objectives: A) Finding load cases using modeled motion responses and sea state probability B) Finding a new jib rest design that complies to the criteria set by Damen and with the load cases found with design objective A C) Finding an estimation on the fatigue lifetime on both the first and new generation jib rest For the determination of the accelerations, a tool is developed, which automates the calculations for the maximum expected loads in worldwide near shore operation and transport. The barge motion responses in regular waves are determined and used as the primary input. Secondary input is composed of wave data, direction and spreading. Wind speed, roll, pitch, flooding angles and (bending) stresses in the crane pedestal are used as additional criteria. As an output, it gives an overview of operability over the world, along with a selection of the maximum expected accelerations in the critical directions. Parallel to the load calculations and development of the tool, the design of the new jib rest is made. Starting with a concept and building up detail as more information is brought to light in every calculation step. The resulting design is composed of a 15 ton, hinged, steel A-frame with a weight reduction of approx. 5 ton compared to the first generation. Fatigue prediction shows a significant improvement on the fatigue lifetime, as a transport load case estimates the new design spending approx. 10% of its fatigue lifetime.

(mentor); Krings, G. (mentor)","2015","Complex networks are a special type of graph that frequently appears in nature and in many different fields of science and engineering. Studying complex networks is the key to solve the problems in these fields. Complex networks have unique features which we cannot find in regular graphs, and the study of complex networks gives rise to many interesting research questions. An interesting feature to study in complex networks is community structure. Intuitively speaking, communities are group of vertices in a graph that are densely connected with each other in the same group, while sparsely connected with other nodes in the graph. The notion of community has practical significance. Many different concept and phenomenons in real world problems can be translated into communities in a graph, such as politicians with similar opinions in the political opinion network. In this thesis work, a distributed version of a popular community detection method-Louvain method-is developed using graph computation framework Apache Spark GraphX. Characteristics of this algorithm, such as convergence and quality of communities produced, are studied by both theoretical reasoning and experimental evaluation. The result shows that this algorithm can parallelize community detection effectively. This thesis also explores the possibility of using graph sampling to accelerate resolution parameter selection of a resolution-limit-free community detection method. Two sampling algorithms, random node selection and forest fire sampling algorithm, are compared. This comparison leads to suggestions of choice of sampling algorithm and parameter value of the chosen sampling algorithm.","complex network; community detection; distributed computing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software and Computer Technology","","Master of Science Computer Science","",""

(mentor)","2015","A significant reduction in the levelized cost of electricity is necessary for offshore wind farms to become a competitive energy source. Amongst other methods, overall project cost reduction can be achieved by optimized support structure design. An upcoming trend is the use of `XL monopiles', which provide a cost effective foundation solution for offshore wind farms in deeper water and are able to support larger turbines. One of the most governing design criteria for offshore wind turbines is the fatigue limit state. Current practice is to check compliance of a structural design with this criterion by means of a large number of simulations. In these simulations a monopile is typically modelled using beam theory. For the large diameter monopiles, structural design has become less slender and more thin-walled. This implies that, in relation to the global bending deformations, shell deformations will have a more pronounced contribution to the total deformations in the structure as compared to smaller diameter piles. The goal of this study is to investigate if these shell deformations have a significant contribution to the stresses in these large diameter structures, during fatigue limit state design load cases. Beam theory is unable to capture this phenomena and thus a more advanced modelling method is required. A semi-analytical structural model of a monopile is developed using coupled circular cylindrical shell segments. Soil-structure interaction characteristics are incorporated based on a translation from three dimensional finite element modelling. With a transformation to generalized coordinates it is shown how the structural model can be connected to a model of a wind turbine's tower and rotor nacelle assembly in a manner that allows for computationally effective numerical calculations. Making use of the continuous description of the model, internal stresses at any location in the monopile's shell can be obtained directly from the deformation behaviour. Additionally, following the shell equations, the monopile's shell deformations can be isolated from its global bending behaviour, which allows for a transparent analysis. The dynamic behaviour of the monopile in various design load cases is analysed using time-domain simulations. These are performed using a state-of-the-art numerical code which accounts for structural-, aero- and controller dynamics. Wave loading is additionally incorporated as a distributed surface loading using diffraction theory. It is found that the shell deformations are sensitive to loading at high frequency bands where typically very little wave energy is present. Assuming Airy waves, as is the standard practice in the offshore industry, only a minor quasi-static contribution of the shell deformations on the monopile's internal stresses is found. The sensitivity to breaking waves, which excite the structure at a wide frequency range, and the sensitivity to the slenderness of the monopile are explored as well. It is found that an increase of the monopile's diameter induces additional shell deformation behaviour.","Circular cylindrical shells; Shells; Offshore; Wind Turbine; Monopile; Substructuring; Diffraction; Coupled; Continuous","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-18","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore Engineering","","Offshore Engineering","",""

(mentor); Wormgoor, R. (mentor); Van Beuningen, R. (mentor); Van Boxtel, D. (mentor)","2015","During this last half year this thesis was executed in order to obtain a clear and scientific underpinned exploration of what interferences in an office environment are and how they can be reduced. As a result of combining the performed literature study, internal analysis, and external analysis a new product proposal is developed: the Bay A historical overview indicated that the only stable factor in office environments is change. Furniture, office related technological advancements and office plans change rapidly. The New Working (TNW) does not have a fixed definition. Over years different parties gave multiple interpretations to TNW. Flexibility and autonomy in time, place and information distribution for individuals and companies is what is most overlapping in all opinions. Flexibility and autonomy are key to obtain Organizational Citizenship Behaviour (OCB) in an organization, which results in more satisfaction and happiness on the work floor. As a consequence of OCB employees obtain higher productivity and is therefor beneficial to every company. Unfortunately a blueprint to obtain OCB is not available, because every organization and individual is different. The Activity Based Office (ABO) is one of the most recent developments in the arrangements of offices. It aims to divide the offices in different activities that are practiced on the work floor. Research showed that ABO stimulated productivity and employee well-being, however implementing ABO must be carried out carefully. This thesis is executed in cooperation with Lande Productie Schijndel (LPS). LPS is a well-known production facility famous for their high quality furniture. The company mainly manufactures products for internal brands like Lande and Artifort. Lande’s focus is to provide creative office solutions and will therefor undertake the position as main stakeholder in this report. LPS is the main production facility and houses the Lande Group headquarter. The Lande Group includes multiple brands. All with different core values to serve a considerable large part of the furniture sector. Lande belongs to one of the 3 largest office furniture brands that can offer a complete furniture proposal for the customer. The portfolio analysis indicated that Lande acquires a wide-ranged portfolio. However, products that enhance interferences in an office environment are absent. Besides, Lande is known for their tailor-made solutions, in-house development, and distinguishable playful designs. Office visits and qualitative interviews administered what the actual problems were in offices. Again, acoustics was indicated as one of the main instigators for disturbance. The visits also showed that good execution and communication between all stakeholders before implementing new office arrangements is key for success. By conducting a brainstorm session activities in an office are segmented. Tasks performed in an office environment are divided in 5 types of tasks: focus, collaboration, communication, work specific and non work related. Every organization and profession acquires a different balanced mix of those activities. The office is a place that must facilitate all activities practiced by the organization. Teleworking, or homeworking tears apart the communication and collaboration tasks, which is not convenient for every organization. The threshold for communicating increases, resulting in internal communication decrease. Moreover, it makes unintentional encounters impossible. Locating the interference source activities next to each other can solve lots of initial problems. Focus tasks can be executed without being intervened. Acoustics is pointed out to be the main instigator for interferences in an office environment. This is partly due to that acoustics unites different kinds of aspects. Research shows that speech intelligibility is one of the greatest factors to be disturbed. When individuals can trace back the words, or sentences, they are engaged to withdraw focus. The Bay aims for reducing outgoing interferences generated by communication activities. The acoustical panels inside the module absorb direct sound waves that would initially reach other office users. Placing panels inside the model could evoke an enclosed feeling for the users inside. An experiment is conducted to obtain of the optimal level of enclosure to guarantee fewer distractions in the office outside the model. The Bay is developed until the stage of pre-production. In order to switch to production, certain components have to be optimized and therefor deserve another design iteration. With the ever-increasing line of basis needs, acoustics is likely to become standard in the near future.","interference; office; furniture; acoustics; OCB; TNW; Activity Based Working","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2015","Since there is a lack of functional active two degree of freedom wrist mechanisms for hand prostheses, one is designed in accordance to the needs of the user, such that it can be provided with hand prostheses and used by patients. A list of requirements is used to design a wrist mechanism, after which the prototype is tested to validate the design compared to the requirements. This is done with a test setup where, among others, torque and position of the mechanism are measured. A hydraulic vane cylinder is chosen as the rotation mechanism for both degrees of freedom, but only one degree of freedom is fabricated and tested as a proof of concept. The vane cylinder leaked and could not muster any significant torque. This leaking is probably caused by scratches in the surface of the cylinder wall. Other requirements could be validated despite this setback. The range of motion for instance could be achieved, only the stroke of the master cylinder had to be increased due to the compression of air. The weight, 21.2g for the fabricated working mechanism, and dimensions, 20.7mm height and 30mm diameter, of the mechanism have also been met. It can be concluded that this hydraulic vane cylinder is a promising wrist mechanism to use in hand prostheses, because it is a small and compact design, but with the recommendation to have a precise fabrication with a smooth surface finish so that the vane cylinder is not leaking.","wrist mechanism; hand prosthesis; hydraulics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-12-18","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2015","The current decentralized support schemes for stimulating renewable energy from electricity (RES-E) in the Member States (MS) of the European Union (EU) cause cost inefficiencies, distort the market and competition and exhibit unclear welfare effects. RES-E policy harmonization, a top-down approach that equalize, support schemes among MS, can improve cost efficiency, decrease market fragmentation and increase overall welfare. The master thesis explores the long term dynamic effects of policy harmonization on consumer and producer welfare, cost and the electricity market performance. This is tested under the scenarios of infinite interconnector capacity, a tender with technology-specificity, different ambitions of RES-E targets and countries with the exact same RES-E targets. With the aid of the model EMLab Generation, simulations of the electricity markets in two countries have been carried out from an Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) approach. ABM can deals with market uncertainty and is therefore a novel approach in the field of testing RES-E policy harmonization. Within this modelling environment a tender is conceptualized, which follows the EU Aid state guidelines that recommends to use a competitive bidding process to distribute subsidies for RES-E. The primary objective is to answer the main research question: What are effects of RES-E tender support policies on the electricity markets of an interconnected two-country situation in the long run under harmonization? Effects of harmonized RES-E tenders Is was found that RES-E tenders stimulates investments in renewable energy technologies that leads to lower electricity prices, creates higher welfare for consumers, but decreases welfare for producers. The lower prices are accompanied with higher volatility. Furthermore, a rapid development of RES-E creates high yearly generation costs, and high tender clearing prices result in high subsidy costs. Next to the objective of de-carbonisation, it is important for the regulator to deal with technologies that do not participate in the tender, to make sure no high clearing prices occur due to yearly increasing targets. Effects of high interconnector capacity The increase of interconnector capacity under high penetration of RES-E lowers the overall cost of outages. A country with relative high RES-E energy targets increases the subsidy costs for renewables in the neighbouring country under perfect market integration, and subsequently leads to increased cost burden for society in the importing country. The importing country can offset this by implementing low RES-E targets. However, the consequence is that high differences in RES-E targets between countries, leaves the less ambitious country to serve basically as a ’back-up-country’ for its neighbour. Effects of Technology-Specific Tender The research showed that a technology-specific tender leads to lower RES-E target fulfilment when one or more RES-E technologies do not participate in the tender. A technology-neutral tender is thus more effective in stimulating RES-E since the regulator is indifferent of which technologies are participating, as long as these are the lowest cost technologies. Effects of RES-E Targets A country can be too ambitious in setting its RES-E target, meaning that if a RES-E target is not met, it results in higher clearing prices and subsequently imposes a burden on society due to high tender subsidies. It also shows that the regulator can control the generation costs to a certain extent by setting the RES-E targets since RES-E is accompanied with high generation costs. Regarding the regulator, it is concluded that setting the right RES-E target is of paramount importance but prone to uncertainty due to expectations in renewable generation in the market. Overshooting expected generation leads to high higher tender quotas than necessary, which leads to over fulfilment of the pre-determined tender targets. Subsequently, it causes higher tender clearing prices which increases the yearly subsidy costs more than needed, which is passed on to society. Moreover, overshooting also affects producer welfare and cash balances negatively, costs in generation and outages rises and electricity prices increase accompanied with more volatility. While undershooting the expected generation, results in lower RES-E target fulfilments and thus more carbon intensive technologies in the market than demanded. This can be overcome to let the regulator predicts for a shorter interval such that he does not look further into the future than the lead time of a technology. It is concluded that setting the targets wrong will affect the success of the tender or that it imposes a larger cost burden on society than necessary. The secondary objective aimed to find what policy conditions and configurations are most beneficial from an EU and Member State perspective based on the results. It was found that soft policy harmonization and improving market integration i.e. increasing interconnector capacity are the best scenarios for the EU policy maker, while full harmonization is the best scenario configuration on the level of both Member States. This implies that a conflict can arise between the interest of the EU and the Member States. Moreover, one also needs to take into account that the importance attributed to a certain welfare or cost indicator, can be different among the two national policy makers. Full harmonization would be less feasible if countries do not agree on design variables of tenders, or the priority of certain indicators. Both could lead to different policy configurations, which is in most cases will be moving away from full harmonization. This concludes that full harmonization of RES-E policies is unlikely to succeed.","Electricity Markets; RES-E policy harmonization; Tenders; Agent-Based Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Veldhuis, L.L.M. (mentor)","2015","Recent trends in the automobile industry focus towards enhancing the operating efficiency of the road vehicle. One can achieve this by a combination of increasing the powertrain efficiency, reducing the weight and increasing the aerodynamic performance. The scope of this study is on the latter, i. e. enhancing the aerodynamic performance. Most cars are optimized for minimum drag in idealized conditions, driving engineers to design for the test rather than for to optimize for actual flow encountered in real world conditions. These realistic conditions include (un)steady cross-wind flows encountered by the vehicle, rather than a perfectly aligned flow as is the case in an idealized situation. Different researchers studied the effect of these real world conditions on the performance of a vehicle. Many of these studies focussed upon the vehicle stability rather than the potential to reduce aerodynamic drag. This is because typical drag reducing means (such as radiused edges) tend to have a detrimental effect on the cross-wind stability and comfort of the vehicle. \\ The introduction of the fully electric Tesla Model S created new opportunities within this conception. This 2500 {kg vehicle has an 800 {kg battery underneath the car, which results in a different - relatively flexible - position of the center of gravity, total mass and corresponding mass moments of inertia. As a result it is questioned if this difference in vehicle specifications allow for drag reducing shape modifications on a vehicle which is then still stable during cross-wind flows. After a careful trade-off it was chosen to use the recently launched open-source CFD software suite SU2 in order to find an answer to the following research objective: What design modifications reduce the drag coefficient of a simplified vehicle model which experiences a cross-wind flow, and how does this affect the lateral dynamic performance? An interesting follow-up question on this would be to identify which design variables are (most) sensitive to drag increments in realistic crosswind flows. This document describes the process of solving the research objective within the framework of a Master of Science thesis. A thorough vehicle dynamics study was performed in order to assess the most influential parameters which affect the lateral deviation of a vehicle. Within this study it was found that the cross-wind induced lateral deviation with a longitudinal velocity of 30m/s and a cross-wind flow of 3.15m/s or 6 degrees is roughly similar to the situation where the steering wheel angle is set to 1 degree. This implies that the lateral deviation during cross-wind flows is not much of an issue during steady cross-wind flows of up to 6 degrees. Experiments were designed for three different cross-wind flows; 0 degrees, 3 degrees and 6 degrees cross-wind flow for both conventional and electric vehicles. Here the effects of the following shape modifications have been studied: arrowing the front of the vehicle, tapering the aft of the vehicle, applying a side-window tumblehome angle, varying the front and rear window angle, and varying the A - and C - pillars. The resulting drag coefficients for each configuration has been averaged over the three cross-wind angles. Here it was found that the most important shape modifications for the drag coefficient occur aft of the vehicle. The optimal angles are listed below, where the original angle is shown in parentheses. The resulting cross-wind flow averaged drag coefficient is shown per shape modification. Arrowing angle (0) - 15 degrees: 5% Tapering angle (0) - 15 degrees: 27% Tumblehome angle (0) - 15 degrees: 10% Front window angle (30) - 25 degrees: 2% Rear window angle: (25) - 15 degrees: 16% A-pillar radius: (0.10) - 0.15m: 4% C-pillar radius: (0.15) - 0.15m: 0% When these design modifications are simultaneously applied it was found that the drag coefficient is reduced by 17% for symmetric flow conditions, 30% during 3 degrees cross-wind flow and as much as 43% during 6 degrees during cross-wind flow conditions. This combines into a cross-wind averaged drag reduction of 30%.","vehicle aerodynamics drag reduction vehicle dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy, Flight Performance and Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

Recent research studies have shown that modern smartphones have the ability to capture high frequency light patterns and increase the applicability of VLC links, enabling smart applications. However, creating flexible camera-based VLC links brings-up several challenges that are introduced by the diversity of the available devices. Firstly, existing VLC systems offer inflexible setups that are designed to operate at fixed distances. This fact causes problems when it comes to varying the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. This thesis introduces DynaLight: an adaptive line-of-sight VLC system for smartphones that dynamically adjusts and maximizes its channel capacity by estimating the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. Secondly, the wide diversity in smartphones’ hardware introduces problems when it comes to implementing a generic VLC link for market smartphones. In order to increase the applicability of our system, we chose to utilize inexpensive hardware, that introduce performance limitations, such as limited camera control. We present an image processing pipeline that identifies and overcomes effects that are caused by off-the-shelf hardware, and we further increase the amount of information, that can be extracted, by 40%.

(mentor)","2015","The last mile in a public transport trip appears to be one of the main deterrents in public transport to be competitive with other modes of transport. The reason for this bad performance of the last mile can be related to the slow and inflexible character of the last mile. Where PRT systems aspire to deliver an on demand, direct service to a passenger, they are bound to fixed separated infrastructure and would therefore face high investment costs for the application of PRT systems on the last mile. As automated vehicles can make use of any kind of road that is available the investment costs are considerably lower. The system presented in this thesis is a last mile transportation service operated by automated vehicles on existing infrastructure. Multiple operational strategies have been simulated using an agent based simulation model in AnyLogic. This simulation model has been applied on the case study Delft Zuid - Technological Innovation campus. For this case study a travel demand survey has been conducted, from which the results serve as one of the main inputs of the simulation model. The outcomes of the simulations indicate that relocating empty vehicles, intermediate charging have a positive effect on the performance of the system on the last mile without compromising any other system performance parameter. Pre-booking of vehicles (via a smartphone app) showed to be very beneficial with regard to the average waiting time for a passenger. However, as vehicles are locked for a longer period the system capacity decreases. The speed of the vehicles appeared one of the main determinants for the energy use of the vehicles and therefore the available system capacity. Speed variations have shown large reductions in the average travel time for a passenger.","last mile problem; automated vehicles; public transport; operation strategies; agent based; simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","","51.99149, 4.36398"

(mentor)","2015","A current focus in the quest for improvement in fuel efficiency in aircraft design is the simplification of complex high lift systems. A simpler high lift system in combination with flow separation control is potentially able to meet the current high lift performance requirements, while still reducing overall complexity. Passive flow separation control is promising for its inherent simplicity. This is in line with the main goal of simplification of the high lift system. This thesis covers an exploratory and experimental investigation of a novel type of passive vortex generator: the internal vortex generator. Its distinctive feature, an internal structure for the generation of vortices below the surface, is hypothesized to create strong vortices low inside the boundary layer. Due to this increase in effectiveness the internal vortex generator can potentially outperform external vortex generators. As no literature is currently available on this novel concept, different designs are evaluated using numerical analysis. The wedge type internal vortex generator, similar to a backward wedge external vortex generator, is found to produce the most stable and strong vortices, which are inherently close to the surface. Its close resemblance to the well-documented backward wedge external vortex generator allows for a detailed design that is based on a literature study. Moreover, it allows for an interesting reference case to be present during the experiment test. The internal vortex generator is experimentally tested against its geometrically equivalent external vortex generator. Both vortex generator types are equipped on the same single element high lift model and tested in the Low Speed Low Turbulence Wind Tunnel at the Delft University of Technology. Force measurements indicate a more than 3% increase in maximum lift compared to baseline, while the geometrically equivalent external vortex increases the maximum lift with less than 1%. When the boundary layer is artificially tripped at 0.067 chord length, the internal vortex generator increases maximum lift with 33% compared to baseline, while the external vortex generator increases the lift coefficient with 16%. Due to practical limitations the force measurements do not accurately represent a real-world condition. Critical analysis, strengthened by oil visualizations and XFOIL simulations, suggest that the wedge-type internal vortex generator is capable of achieving more lift than the force measurements indicate. Moreover, the internal vortex generator concept is found to inhibit unique qualities that can be exploited in future research.

(mentor)","2015","A geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) is typically used to inject spacecraft into the geosta- tionary orbit. There are many inoperative launcher upper stages and other fragments or- biting in GTOs. These parts collide and disintegrate, becoming even smaller fragments and thereby worsening the problem of space debris. The objects could also collide with op- erational spacecraft. For this reason, a cost-effective method to de-orbit launcher upper stages from GTOs after their end-of-life is needed. Passive de-orbiting using orbital pertur- bations is one such method. A previous work performed at the University of Southampton proposed the use of luni-solar perturbations and secular effects of Earth’s gravity field for passive de-orbiting from highly elliptical orbits (HEOs). A particular type of perturbation not yet investigated in the study of perturbations-enhanced de-orbiting is the periodic ef- fects in the spherical harmonics of Earth’s gravity field model. The thesis work is focused on studying the effect of the gravitational field of Earth (rep- resented by spherical harmonics) on the long-term evolution of upper stages. First, a reli- able and validated algorithm is needed to model the complete Earth’s spherical harmonics. For this purpose, different algorithms are discussed. It is found that Cunningham’s algo- rithm is more reliable for elliptical orbits, and also more computationally efficient, than Kaula’s algorithm. However, Kaula’s algorithm is more versatile and therefore codes based on Kaula’s algorithm were developed into different programs for different types of perturba- tions. These include the secular-only perturbations, zonal harmonics, tesseral harmonics, and averaged perturbations. Although Cunningham’s algorithm was chosen for mapping due to its efficiency, the implementations of Kaula’s algorithm provide an opportunity for future research on the propagation of orbital elements. After the perturbation models had been validated, maps were created for the purpose of investigating the effects of orbital perturbations on de-orbiting. Starting with luni-solar (third-body) and J2 perturbations, the secular effects from higher-order zonal harmonics were added. This increase in the order of spherical harmonics had no significant impact on the results (the difference in perigee altitude between J2 and order 6 zonal harmonics with only secular effects is in the order of 0.5 km). On top of these perturbations, it was found that the addition of periodic effects (as opposed to having only secular effects in the Earth’s spherical harmonics model) made a small difference in the simulated perigee alti- tude. Here, the difference in the perigee altitude between the secular and periodic effects is in the order of 5 km). Not including the non-secular perturbations would lead to a more conservative prediction of lifetime. Solar radiation pressure and drag perturbations were later added to the maps. Increas- ing the area-to-mass ratio of the spacecraft would increase the impact of solar radiation pressure and drag on de-orbiting, while allowing more time for the perturbations to act could ensure that the spacecraft achieves re-entry within the simulation period. For future applications, the mapping tool will allow for the determination of optimal initial conditions for an accelerated disposal of spacecraft from GTOs and other orbits.","deorbit; space; debris; perturbations; gravity; harmonics; lifetime","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Earth Observation and Space Systems","","Space Flight","",""

(mentor)","2015","Increased market deregulation and the accompanied rise of LCCs over the last decades has put profit for many of the old FSCs under pressure forcing them to merge and form alliances. This sparked the research into finding the most efficient structure for a single airline network in terms of profit and passenger mobility. Along with this, the social and economical dependancy on air transport grew and hence the need to assess the robustness of the network rose. Complex network theory offers a way to assess the efficiency of the networks using amongst other the degree (distribution), the betweenness, the average path length and the clustering coefficient. The main focus of current literature is on the analysis of global and regional airport networks, with limited coverage of separate airline networks and codeshare and alliance formation. Furthermore current research uses very standardized methods of assessing robustness and more realistic assumptions are needed. The first aim of this study is to get an insight into the differences in structure of FSCs and LCCs by analyze the topology and robustness of 17 European separate airline networks, using complex network theory. The second aim is to investigate the influence of codeshare and alliance formation on the topology and robustness of ATNs. Finally the third aim is to improve the methods used to analyze the robustness of ATNs. First the topology of the seperate airline networks of both FSCs and LCCs is analyzed in order to distinguish between the business solutions used by the airlines (PPs and HSs). Additionaly the influence of using codeshares and an alliances on the topology of the airline networks is investigated. This is performed by using complex network indicators to compare the seperate and combined (both codeshare and alliance) network layouts. The analysis confirms literature regarding FSCs, which turn out to use SFN associated with HS. LCCs however, are found not found to have RN associated with PP as suggested in literature, but a SFN with multiple interconnected hubs. The most important difference found between FSCs and LCCs is that LCCs tend to focus on diversity of destinations over frequency, whilst FSCs tend to focus on frequency over diversity. Combining networks into codeshare networks or the Skyteam alliance, increases the diversity of the network, the size and number of hubs and brings the behaviour closer to LCCs, however still with a focus on frequency over diversity. After this the synthetic static robustness of the seperate airline, codeshare and the Skyteam alliance networks is investigated in order to distinguish between the robustness behaviour of both FSCs and LCCs. The link between the complex network indicators and the synthetic static robustness of the ATN is also explored. This is performed by simulating error and attack on the separate airline networks and the codeshare and Skyteam alliance networks. Error is based on the random removal of airports from the network, while attack is based on the consecutive removal of nodes based on the heights of the degree, seat strength and (weighted) betweenness of the airports. The analysis confirms literature regarding FSCs, which shows low robustness against attack and high robustness against error. LCCs again show similar behaviour as the FSCs, contradicting literature, but confirming the results from Chapter 3. The shape of the curve of the cumulative degree distribution can be directly linked to the robustness independant of the size of the network. The higher the amount of hubs (with relative high degree), the higher robustness against attack. The robustness against error is much higher and similar for all networks. Combining networks into codeshare netrworks or the Skyteam alliance, will thus increase the robustness against attack. Finally the robustness analysis of ATNs is improved by introducing new methods of simulating more realistic error and attack scenarios. The link between the realistic robustness analysis and the synthetic robustness analysis is also investigated Three different phenomena are simulated: weather, strikes and volcano eruptions. Weather and volcano eruptions are simulated using the introduced geographic attack. Geographic attack is based on starting at an initiation airport and removing the other airports using geographic radial spreading. Strikes are simulated using the geographic degree, which groups the airport into FIR. The analysis puts the synthetic robustness in perspective. It shows that not only the number of hubs is important in order to improve the robustness of an ATN, but also the geographic spreading of the hubs.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Operations","","Air Transport and Operations","","51.98990939, 4.37532150"

(mentor); Vincent-Bonnieu, S.Y.F. (mentor); Jones, S.A. (mentor)","2015","Foams find many applications in the oil industry with their uses ranging from fracturing stimulation treatments to enhanced oil recovery processes. Many of these applications concern the reduction of injected gas mobility which can be induced by a strong foam. However, foam behavior inside a porous medium is complex and a fully predictive model has not been developed to date. This study aims to contribute to the understanding of how the variation of parameters such as surfactant concentration or the presence of certain chemicals, either injected as foam boosters or as part of the water treatment process, affect foam behavior in porous media. For that reason, four series of coreflood experiments were conducted by using pencil-sized cores. In addition, pH and surface tension measurements were conducted in order to facilitate the interpretation of the coreflood results. Lastly, bulk foam experiments were also carried out in order to assess whether easily obtained bulk foam behavior parameters can correlate to foam behavior in porous media. The first experimental series of this study examined the effect of surfactant concentration on foam behavior in porous media, with the ultimate aim to capture the surfactant concentration effect in a local equilibrium (L.E.) model. Given that foams in field applications and in laboratory coreflood experiments are created with different surfactant concentrations it is important to understand how foam performance varies with concentration. According to the experimental results, both the foam apparent viscosity and the limiting capillary pressure increase for increasing surfactant concentration. The L.E. model at its current state was not able to capture this effect, as observed during the modeling part of this study. More specifically, there was a vast deviation in the matching of the low surfactant concentration coreflood results with the F1 function which describes the effect of surfactant concentration in the current L.E. models. The second experimental series conducted in this study examined the effect of straight chain primary alcohols of six different carbon chain lengths on foam behavior in porous media, with the potential to identify foam booster chemicals for field applications. As observed in the experimental results of this series, the addition of very small amounts of four of the alcohols can increase the foam strength in the core considerably. Interestingly, the bulk foam behavior for as a function of alcohol carbon chain length varied with an opposite trend compared to the foam behavior in the core. Therefore, 1-dodecanol created the least strong foam in the core among the alcohols examined, while in bulk it resulted to the most volumetrically stable foam. The third experimental series assessed the foam boosting potential of three fatty acids. All the fatty acids examined at low concentrations increased the foam strength in the porous medium and the bulk foam stability. However, at higher concentrations this effect was inversed and the fatty acid additive reduced the foam strength in the core considerably. An interest aspect of foam behavior in porous media was also examined in this experimental series that being the effect of the stearic acid on the non-Newtonian foam flow in the core. Interestingly, for low total velocities the flow behavior in the low quality regime was found to be shear thickening, contradicting the theory. Finally, the fourth experimental series examined the effect of three representative water treatment chemicals, i.e. one oxygen scavenger, one biocide and one antifoam, on foam strength in porous media. These chemicals are added to the injection water according to the typical water treatment procedure in fields and thus they could potentially affect foam performance when they reach the rock formation. Interestingly, the addition of each of these three water treatment chemicals had a beneficiary effect on foam strength in the core. In the case of the antifoam formulation, a threshold concentration was observed, such that for antifoam concentrations below 10 ppm the antifoam increased the foam strength in the core.","foam in porous media; foam booster; water treatment chemicals; oxygen scavenger; antifoam; biocide; bulk foam; foam stability; foam strength; fatty acid; alcohol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Petroleum Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Lenseigne, B. (mentor); Kotiadis, D. (mentor)","2015","Over the last ten years car manufacturers have introduced numerous Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, such as Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane Departure Warning Systems. Currently companies’ and universities’ research foci are shifting towards developing systems that do not only assist the driver of a vehicle, but enable a vehicle’s full automation. However, perception of the environment remains one of the main challenges for the development of autonomous vehicles. Hence, a feasible system that enables robust and accurate perception is still lacking and research is predominantly aimed at solving this problem. As there is not one single sensor that can accomplish robust perception independently, an approach is suggested in this thesis that involves the fusion of data from multiple different types of sensors. Especially the fusion of data obtained from radar and data obtained from a 3D vision based system is currently a popular area of research, as it is expected to lead to potentially interesting solutions to the current problems related to automotive environmental perception. In this thesis a Weighted Least Square fusion approach is utilized to merge data generated by radar and two novel 3D vision based algorithms, namely Depth from Luminance and Corridor Estimation. This thesis proved that both of these 3D vision based algorithms were promising inputs for the data fusion algorithm; the Depth from Luminance method provides detailed information regarding depth differences resulting from shape variations of objects, while the Corridor Estimation algorithm is a new algorithm developed as part of this thesis and realizes the estimation of the general 3D structure of the complete scene. The Daimler Urban Data Set 2014 is utilized for a performance analysis of the different possible fusion combinations of the available information sources. The analysis illustrates that results of the fusion of data from radar and Depth from Luminance incorporate depth differences of details (e.g. vehicles), yet fails to provide depth differences resulting from the general shape of the scene. On the contrary, though the fusion of data generated by the radar and the Corridor Estimation algorithm manages to capture the depth of the general shape of the scene, no depth information of details is provided using this algorithm. In this thesis it is demonstrated that a satisfactory result, which incorporates depth information of both details and the general shape of the scene, can be obtained by fusing together data originating from all three aforementioned sources. In this way, a promising sensor data fusion based environmental perception system was created in this thesis that is expected to have great potential for automotive applications.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Daamen, W. (mentor); Molin, E.J.E. (mentor); De Lange, T. (mentor); Stroeve, S. (mentor); Grosmann, R. (mentor)","2015","In 2011, Schiphol introduced the self-service passport control (SSPC), which now functions as an alternative for the traditional passport control (TPC) at four different locations within the airport. Travellers thus have to make an obligatory choice between the two types of services. At the Schengen/non-Schengen border between Lounge 1 and lounge 2 (case study) the SSPC is not used as much as expected: although floor managers of Schiphol Group are actively trying to send people to the SSPC, still approximately 40% of the SSPC-entitled transfer passengers do not use it. The objective of this research is therefore to give recommendations on how to increase the percentage of SSPC-entitled travellers using the self-service passport control, by gaining insight into the pre-conditioned awareness, knowledge and perceptions of travellers regarding the self-service passport control and into the situational factors influencing the choice for the type of passport control. From the analysis of the results it is concluded that approximately 50% of the travellers does not recognize the SSPC. Furthermore the majority of travellers think they are allowed to use the SSPC, but in fact a minority knows all requirements to use the SSPC. However, it can be concluded that after having gained the information about the SSPC in the questionnaire, the majority of travellers is positive about the SSPC. Speed is on average of more importance to travellers than personal contact, approximately 90% of all respondents perceive the SSPC as the fastest type of passport control and 50% think the SSPC is the most pleasant service form. In general people with a different travel purpose, age, nationality and flying experience do not differ significantly in their awareness, knowledge and perceptions. However, a result that was not expected based on existing literature, is that the idea that elderly people do not like self-service facilities does not hold for older people who travel by plane. Besides, a Stated Preference (SP) photo choice survey at Schiphol is conducted in order to investigate, using discrete choice modelling, the effect of a change in layout or information provision on the travellers’ choice for the type of passport control. A first conclusion is that from the total sample 41% has a fixed preference for the SSPC and 9.0% has a fixed preference for the TPC, but overall there is a base preference for the SSPC compared to the TPC. Besides, it is concluded that the situational factors that influence the choice for the type of passport control are the presence of a window and signage at the TPC. Moreover, it is concluded that heterogeneity in preferences exists. Three classes can be distinguished, namely (1) the ‘self-service supporters’ (majority will always choose SSPC), (2) the ‘traditional passport control supporters’ (majority will always choose TPC) and (3) ‘the ‘window sensitives’ (choosing different alternatives in different scenarios). The scenario calculation indicates that an improvement from the current 60% (with an active floor manager) to approximately 70% could be reached by blinding the window next to the TPC, making clear that the SSPC is a passport control and by removing the overload of signage at the TPC. When instead of blinding the window next to the TPC, the SSPC would be located next to the window (and the window would not be blinded), an increase to approximately 80% could be reached (but this is more expensive). Furthermore, an advice to Schiphol Group is to show a movie about the SSPC already during the flights and in the rest areas at Schiphol. Besides, it is advised to clearly depict the requirements for using the SSPC. Finally, it is important to ensure sufficient staff at the SSPC, such that travellers can pass the SSPC as fast as possible.","service type choice; self-service passport control; knowledge & perceptions; Discrete Choice Modelling; Stated Preference; multinomial logit model; Latent Class Model; Schiphol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure & Logistics","",""

(mentor)","2015","The recent implementation of single electron quantum dots (QDs) in semiconductor hetero-structures as quantum bits (Qbits) [1] disclosed a promising route for the forthcoming creation of the first quantum computers based on a large set of Qbits. The scaling up of Qbits would indeed exhibit the full potential of quantum computation. Confinement of electrons in QDs takes place at cryogenic temperatures by applying specific constant voltages to the gates of the QD [1]. The goal of this thesis has been the design and the analysis of a circuit providing constant voltages, with accuracy of 5 ?V, to a set of 768 QDs kept at 20 mK. The proposed circuit would supply up to 2304 different voltages (3 biases/QD) employing only one DC bias, thus minimizing the thermal power dissipated into the cryogenic environment. Each Qbit is biased to its specific voltage (between -1 V and 1 V with accuracy of 5 ?V) by dedicated capacitors. The charge stored in a capacitor is dynamically maintained around a constant value by the charging-discharging cycle driven by a MOSFET switch. The input controlling each switch, in turn, is managed by a digital devices assembly, which coordinates the 2304 different cycles. This part of the circuit is in contact with the Qbits matrix only through demultiplexers; therefore it does neither interfere with the cryogenic environment nor with the delicate coherent states of the Qbits. The experimental section of this thesis focused on the fabrication and the characterization at room temperature and 4.2 K of MOS and parallel plate capacitors with thin (30 nm) SiO2 film. The measured capacities for the smallest area capacitors have a value of 6.6 pF. While, the mean leakage current density through the oxide layer between -1 V and 1 V is at most 6 nA/cm2. The average leakage current density at 4.2 K, between -10 V and 10 V, is 4 nA/cm2 for the smallest MOS capacitors. This observation proved that the structural integrity of the capacitors is preserved at extremely low temperatures. The quantitative analysis of the analog circuit dedicated to the charging-discharging cycles showed that a MOSFET switching frequency of 38 MHz is sufficient for the operation with 6.6 pF capacitor connected in series with 1 G? resistor. Moreover, the circuit stability analysis revealed that the system has a good resilience against random fluctuations of several variables. The results obtained in this work help us to sketch the future outlook to create a complete and efficient driving circuitry for large scale single electron Qbits computers.","qubit arrays; large-scale; addressing; quantum computer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","ECTM","",""

More specifically, neurotransmitter receptors are present on the cell membranes of neurons (nerve cells) and are important for the signal transduction at synapses, which are the specializations through which neurons communicate. The morphology of the cell membrane at these synapses is nontrivial and this shape strongly affects the receptor lateral diffusion process [1]. The typical shape of a single synapse and its impact on the diffusive process have been studied [1,2]. An open question however, is how this shape affects the crosstalk between multiple synapses connected to the same dendrite.

(mentor)","2015","After a stroke, patients often need gait rehabilitation training to regain a safe walking pattern to participate in daily activities again. Good gait rehabilitation training comprises high intensity, which can be achieved using support systems, such as treadmills. Research pointed out that there are insufficient support systems for patients with Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) score 2 and 3. The C-Mill, an existing treadmill used for patients with FAC 5, can be adjusted to the supporting needs of patients with a lower FAC score while maintaining high intensity using additional modules. A first module, the Active Body Weight Support (ABWS), supports the first prerequisite of walking by lifting the body weight, lowering the covering target group to patients with FAC 3½. The goal of this project is to develop a new additional module, the Balance module, which will support the second prerequisite of walking by supporting balance and lower the target group to patients with FAC 2. The C-Mill combined with additional modules will be one product that can be purchased by clinics for patients with FAC 2-5, instead of needing several individual products for this target group. A set of requirements is formulated to develop the Balance module with optimal properties for high intensity gait rehabilitation training. The mechanical requirements ensure that the correct forces are applied on the patient at the moment the patient loses balance. Furthermore, it is required that the mass of parts of the Balance module that are attached to the patient does not influence the natural gait of the patient. Biomedical requirements ensure comfort of the patient and therapist in posture and force excitation. Force excitation of 100 N is required in lateral direction and 50 N in anterior-posterior direction. It is preferable that the Balance module can support rotational activation, to support the swinging leg of the patient. Design requirements make sure that the Balance module will be appealing for both therapist and patient. Moreover, the product must fit within the current product line design of the C-Mill. With morphological charts, three concepts were created that are evaluated by means of function models. Using Harris profiles a concept is chosen, which is further developed into the Balance module. The final Balance module consists of two pillars which are attached to the C-Mill. The patient is wearing a harness which is connected with the Balance module using a minimal number of attachments to limit preparation time and prevent wrong alignments. The connection consists of ropes and tubes for force transfer of the motors. The four motors are DC motors, which can be activated for all needed and desired directions. The Balance module uses ‘assist as needed control’, which means that support is only given at the moment balance is lost. No force sensors are needed for desirable flowing movements, because the chosen motor type has a low projected inertia and can exert enough force in all directions. The moment and the amount of force needed is determined with the extrapolated Centre Of Mass (xCOM) which uses the position of the Centre Of Mass (COM) and the Centre Of Pressure (COP). The COM of the patient is determined using position feedback from the motors and the COP is provided by forceplates of the C-Mill. The attachments of the tubes and ropes are made flexible with ball-joints and movable pulleys to ensure the comfort of the patient and no limitation on DOF. Height adjustments of the Balance module are possible to satisfy the antropometrics of each patient. The design has an optimal space use and fits with the C-Mill’s design. Elegant lines of the Balance module will not discourage patient and therapist of usage. Touchable parts are clearly identified by means of colours and shapes. To evaluate the working principle of the Balance module, a prototype is build. Satisfaction of the requirements for the Balance module is checked. Several requirements will be reviewed during a subsequent project of testing, like the control system and methods, influence of inertia and design satisfaction. All other requirements are reached and the desired rotational stimulation can be done. One desired option of extending the anterior-posterior movement freedom was not achieved for the prototype. Improvements on control actuation must be made during an additional project. More improvements can be made on a program including feedback for therapists, to quantify the level of balance of the patient. Moreover, better integration with the new design of the C-Mill is preferred for unity appearance and a clean design.","gait; stroke; balance support","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-12-17","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Biomechatronics","",""

(mentor); Corno, M. (mentor); Happee, R. (mentor); Baldi, S. (mentor)","2015","Four Wheel Drive (4WD) vehicles are almost as old as the automobile itself, however for more than half a century the main use case of a 4WD system was to improve traction on off-road terrains. The advancement in technology over the recent decades resulted in more advanced and light weight solutions shifting the focus more towards sports cars and performance passenger vehicles. Furthermore, the advancements in electronic actuators paved the way for more attractive 4WD solutions for such vehicles. The trend continues to progress as top racing formulas, such as Formula 1 and Le Mans Prototypes, have embraced 4WD systems over the past few years and all major car manufactures recently brought road vehicles with 4WD systems to the market. In many of these vehicles, the drivelines are electronically controllable introducing new possibilities and engineering challenges. In this thesis a control system for an Active Central Differential (ACD) will be developed in order to improve the handling and performance of a 4WD vehicle. The central differential distributes the engine torque to the front and rear axle; the ACD is a controllable central differential for which the front to rear torque distribution can be varied electronically. Three different vehicle models are used in this work with varying complexity: single track model, two track model and multibody dynamics model. The single track model is used to study the influence of the actuator on the longitudinal and lateral dynamics in Quasi Steady State (QSS). Furthermore, this model is used for the sensitivity analysis of potentially varying vehicle parameters. The two track model forms the basis for the presented control system and vehicle state estimator. The multibody dynamics model is a close virtual representation of a real passenger vehicle and hence used for validation of the proposed control system. All models use a nonlinear tyre model (Magic Formula (MF) based), longitudinal and lateral load transfer (single track only longitudinal). The multibody dynamics model also simulates engine characteristics, drive train and differential inertia, clutch dynamics, suspension characteristics, pitch and roll dynamics, etc. These effects are neglected for obvious simplicity reasons in the single and two track models. The most relevant dynamics for the handling and stability of the vehicle lie in the vehicle yaw plane. Unlike differential braking or torque vectoring, the ACD can not directly generate a yaw moment; instead any yaw moment obtained from torque distribution changes is the result of combined slip effects (i.e. indirect actuation). Nonetheless, the torque distribution can significantly influence the performance, stability and understeer characteristics of the vehicle. To develop a better understanding of the complex dynamics involved, the system dynamics are studied by means of a QSS analysis and linearization. By studying the system at hand in QSS, key aspects (i.e. torque distribution) of the complete dynamic system can be isolated and analyzed without being affected by coupled dynamics. Furthermore, linearization of the nonlinear system is employed to study the dynamic system poles of the resulting linear parameter varying system. These system poles give insight in the stability of the system for a variety of torque distributions. A novel control system for the central differential is presented which improves the handling and performance of the vehicle for (combined) acceleration maneuvers. The control system is composed of a slip reference generator and a closed loop slip controller. Since only one control variable is available, the system controls the portion of the engine torque which is redirected to the rear axle in order to reduce the slip error of said axle in finite time. The controller type is a gain scheduled proportional integral controller with an anti integrator wind-up scheme to deal with actuator saturation. The classical problem of vehicle control systems, namely the inability to measure essential signals for the control system (i.e. tyre slip, stiffness and peak friction) is addressed with an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) based vehicle state estimator. The dynamic model of the state estimator is composed of a two track model and nonlinear normalized MF tyre model. The performance of the control system was assessed on a multibody vehicle model and the state estimator was assessed on experimental data.","vehicle dynamics; control system; unscented kalman filter; extended kalman filter; state estimation; traction control; vehicle stability control; velocity estimation; slip angle estimation; tire friction estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering (BME)","","Automotive","",""

(mentor); Klepper, M. (mentor)","2015","Since the advent of radio communications, radio spectrum has been increasingly getting crowded with different kinds of applications. Different radio communications systems have been developed for various purposes and multiple actors became interested in using these systems at the same time and space. Such situation inevitably led to the point when practically entire usable radio spectrum became occupied by different actors. To alleviate this problem, Dynamic Spectrum (Re)Allocation (DSA) has been proposed, which is a branch of frequency spectrum management that aims to improve spectrum usage efficiency and end-user experience by introducing more flexibility to spectrum usage. This thesis aims to provide additional insight into DSA applicability and effectiveness in a typical realistic cellular network, in intra-operator scenario, taking into account 2G and 4G radio technologies, with the aim of improving 4G performance without adverse impact to 2G. We use realistic dynamic system level simulations to assess DSA performance in the selected cellular network areas that can be classified as urban, suburban and rural. Our simulation results show that DSA is capable of improving 4G throughput without adverse impact to 2G performance in all simulated areas. Among the simulated areas, urban area benefits from DSA most, as significant throughput gains for 4G are achieved without adverse impact to 2G performance, while simulations show that spectrum refarming is clearly not an option for this type of area. However, throughput gains for 4G in urban area are limited during the busy-hours. Suburban and rural areas indicate benefits from DSA too, however the difference between DSA and spectrum refarming in these areas is diminishing. Hence, with reasonable half-rate timeslot tolerance for 2G voice calls, spectrum refarming could be an option in the simulated suburban and rural areas.","DSA; LTE; 2G; 4G; Dynamic Spectrum Allocation; Mobile networks; Cellular","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Network Architectures and Services","","Electrical Engineering","",""

This thesis presents the internal flow structures and operating frequencies of multiple small-scale fluidic oscillator types for a range of subsonic inlet velocities. Time-resolved visualization of the flow structures inside the fluidic oscillators has been achieved by tracking the shadow of cornstarch particles suspended in the airflow. The application of this particle shadow velocimetry technique to the complex internal flow of fluidic oscillators has resulted in a detailed overview of the different internal flow fields, aided by two-dimensional numerical simulations. These simulations were performed for a wider range of flow rates, thereby extending the parameter range beyond what could be measured experimentally. Using the numerical results an empirical model is formulated, relating the flow rate and internal surface area of the presented fluidic oscillators to an oscillation frequency of the exit jet.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-12-17","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics & Wind Energy","","Aerodynamics","",""

(mentor); Rao, A.G. (mentor)","2015","Both NASA and the EU have set ambitious goals in terms of aircraft emission reduction. Previous studies have indicated that these goals can not be met with evolutionary improvements of conventional technologies. For this reason there is a need for revolutionary aircraft concept and/or radical innovative systems. One such concept is the use of a hybrid-electric propulsion system. The aim of this project is to investigate the potential improvements in fuel consumption of a hybrid-electric regional aircraft which uses both batteries and conventional fuel as power source. Since no comprehensive design studies of such a concept have been performed so far, the design space is explored as well. For this purpose the “Initiator” design program is adapted in order to be able to design hybrid-electric aircraft. All designs are constructed for the year 2035, therefore, an estimation of the expected technological progress between now and the year 2035 is performed as well. In particular the battery - and electric motor technology has been investigated. The influence of many factors, such as the battery specific energy, degree of hybridization and range, on the total design have been investigated. It is found that significant fuel consumption reduction can be achieved by using a hybrid-electric power plant. Increasing the range will decrease the amount of fuel saving significantly. Up to a range of around 4000 km (depending on the battery specific energy) a fuel reduction can be achieved. After a certain point more energy is required to transport the batteries than the energy contained within, and using a hybrid-electric power plant will actually require more fuel. Even when using conservative estimates for the expected technological progress, a fuel saving up to 30% can be expected for a typical regional aircraft mission.","hybrid-electric; aircraft","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

Finite element simulation of the unsaturated zone tends to be computationally heavy. In this research, a 1D model of a partially saturated soil was designed and implemented in FORTRAN03, and in themodel, two time-dependent shape functions (SF) were implemented in the top boundary; the first of which is based on a general exponential preliminary SF, and the second on a general diffusion solution using a Fourier series. The performance of the overall model as well as the time dependent SFs has been tested, using existing multiphysics package COMSOL and a 100-point benchmark study. The exponential SF did not performbetter than a standard SF. This might be because of implementation issues, or a limited intrinsic applicability. The Fourier series SF behaved better than the ordinary SFs, in terms of convergence towards a benchmark solution. In both cases, efficiency with respect to time was not achieved, but implementation improvements and case design can make their functionality better with fewer elements, and might yield an elegant solution for an unsaturated boundary value problem.","Unsaturated Soil; Finite Element Method; Pore Water Pressure; Shape Functions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""

(mentor); Visser, W.P.J. (mentor)","2015","With the current trend towards flexible engine operation with high efficiency and low emissions, dynamic modelling of gas turbines has become critical to ensure safe and acceptable engine performance. Dynamic models are essential for design and development of control systems and for analysis of transient manoeuvres that are impractical to test. This M.Sc. thesis project is carried out in collaboration with OPRA Turbines B.V. The aim of the project is to develop a dynamic model of the OP16 gas turbine. OP16 is a single-shaft all-radial industrial gas turbine rated at 1.9 MW, manufactured by OPRA Turbines. The resulting model can be used to simulate and analyse transient performance of the OP16 engine during manoeuvres of interest to OPRA Turbines. The model can also be used for designing initial fuel control strategies. The Dutch National Aerospace Laboratory’s Gas turbine Simulation Program (GSP) is used as the modelling platform. GSP is a 0-D, component based modelling environment that allows for steady-state and transient performance simulation of any gas turbine configuration. Since transient simulation in GSP is follows the quasi-steady-state approach, the steady-state model of OP16 is first developed. In order to evaluate the influence of steady-state heat loss on engine performance, thermal network modelling is also included. The steady-state model is verified against measured data across the entire operational envelope of OP16. The model is found to accurately simulate the steady-state performance of OP16 near the full load operating point. The steady-state model is extended to simulate transient performance of OP16 by implementing engine-specific details. The transient model is verified by comparing model simulations to the measured data for a load step near the full-load operating point. The transient effects including rotor inertia, heat soakage and volume dynamics are analysed to determine their influence and importance for the transient behavior. Rotor inertia is found to dominate the transient behaviour of OP16 while heat soakage effects and volume dynamics remain negligible in comparison. The transient model of OP16 is used to simulate engine behaviour when performing load sheds. The influence of fuel heating value, fuel valve closing time and combustor volume is analysed. One important aspect to guarantee safe operation is to be able to shut-off the fuel supply as soon as possible in case of an engine trip. From the simulations it is found that lower LHV fuels tend to result in higher rotor over-speeds in case of a load shed. For a LHV as low as 5.8 MJ/kg, the fuel valve closing time during a load shed should not exceed 0.7 seconds in order to maintain the rotor over-speed within acceptable limits, whereas for natural gas type of fuels the fuel valve closing can be up to 0.9 seconds.","gas turbine; transient performance analysis; GSP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-16","Aerospace Engineering","Flight performance and Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); Zitman, T.J. (mentor); Tsouvalas, A. (mentor); Demeersseman, P. (mentor)","2015","Dynamic analysis of the stinger hang-off system cable forces using ship motion data of Audacia. Already for some time the desire exists to acquire insight into the phenomenon of stinger uplift. This is the situation where external forces and motions acting on the ship, stinger cause the hang-off cables to have no or barely any cable tension. Consequently, when the stinger “comes down” snap loads occur in the cables. This situation should be avoided. To gain quantitative insight into uplift occurrences, four load cells have been installed on the vessel Audacia to record stinger cable forces. However, the usability of these recordings was unclear. It was therefore decided to develop two dynamic models to predict measured cable forces on the basis of measured ship motions. This is the subject of the present study: A computational model is presented to predict time-varying cable forces for the operational setting that the stinger is lifted out of the water. Before the models were created, a direct comparison was performed between the measured cable forces and the motions at the centre of gravity of the ship. It appeared that, that the pitch motion is the most influential motion for the cable forces. However, a type of prediction of the cable forces directly by the time traces of the motions in the centre of gravity is not considered accurate enough. Additionally, it became evident that the roll motion showed no correlation at all. Therefore, maintaining the 2-D analysis in further stages of the thesis is considered justified. This thesis considers two dynamic models which are performance compared, i.e. the rigid links model (RL model) and the flexible links model (FL model). The RL model assumes the complete system of the ship, stinger and hang-off wires to be rigid. The FL model assumes the ship and the stinger rigid but it accounts for a hinged stinger connection to the bow of the ship and stretching of the cables. Additionally, the flexible links model is based on multiple approaches. The first approach is a direct time-integration method for solving the equations of motion. The second approach is using the modal analysis to solve the equations of motion. Audacia’s on board measured motion data is used as input for the computational models. For verification of the model results, the measured cable forces are used. The information of the measured displacement data is read-out, resampled, filtered and processed for reviewing. The RL model and the FL model were reviewed for their correlations and/or similarities to the measured cable forces using eight reviewing methods. Reviewing these results it can be concluded that the most accurate model to predict the cable forces in the hang-off system based on ship motions is the FL model. This model can predict the standard deviation of the cable forces with an maximum error of 3,7%, which is essentially the worst case scenario uncertainty due to input errors and the uncertainty due to errors in the measured cable forces. This accuracy of on a total predicted mean cable force with an error of 0.08% can be regarded satisfactory for the data time trace considered. When studying the FL model sensitivity the stiffness values appeared to play a dominant role. The first and closest eigenfrequency, considering the FL model, is 1.9 Hz (or 0.52 seconds period). Logically, the most sensitive excitation frequencies are the frequencies closest to this first eigenfrequency. Noise in the measured data used as model input may adversely affect the utility of model results. After research multiple causes for the high frequency noise are found and mitigation strategies are proposed. Reviewing the models it is apparent that the performance of the FL model is better than the performance of the RL model in prediction of the cable forces based on the ship motions at the centre of gravity, for the cases considered in this thesis.","Cable forces; ship motions; data analysis; uplift","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-17","Delft University of Technology","Offshore Engineering","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Sun, Z. (mentor); Xiao, Y. (mentor)","2015","At Tata Steel IJmuiden a part of the blast furnace dust is not recycled to prevent too high zinc levels in the blast furnace. Blast furnace dust is first separated from the off-gas into dry dust and sludge. The dry dust is collected in a dust bag and is directly transported to the sinyter plant. Then the sludge is separated by size through hydrocyclones in the water treatment plant. There are three fractions separated from the sludge. The smallest size fraction or the zinc rich fraction, the hydrocyclone cut size for this fraction is 10 ?m and is stored on site as hazardous waste. The two other fractions are zinc low and zinc middle (or zinc third step) and the zinc middle fraction used to be recycled based on the zinc balance in the blast furnace. However since the beginning of 2015 zinc levels in the blast furnace do not allow the zinc middle fraction to be recycled, which results in more hazardous waste that is dumped. Over the past years research is conducted in order to find a treatment for the stored high zinc blast furnace dust. The aim of a treatment process is the removal of heavy metals and to recycle carbon and iron species from the dumped material. It is expected that the high zinc blast furnace sludge can be recycled when it is treated by hydrometallurgical processing. Before a treatment is selected a literature study is conducted that is focussed on excisting hydrometallurgical processes that treat iron or steel making waste. Based on this literature study an ammoniacal leaching process is selected. Ammoniacal lixiviants are selective towards zinc, ammonia can be recycled and it is not yet used to treat this type of waste. The high zinc filter cake is analyzed at the CRC and ANA laboratories at Tata Steel IJmuiden. It is confirmed that both ZnO and ZnS (wurtzite) are present, however over 2/3 of the zinc is present on ZnS. ZnS has to be oxidized to ZnO before zinc dissolution can take place as the zinc ammine complex (Zn(NH3)42+). Laboratory experiments are conducted with the selected ammoniacal treatment, three lix- iviant types are studied: NH3-(NH4)2CO3, NH3-NH4Cl and NH3-(NH4)2SO4. From the studied parameters the highest zinc removal (69%) is reached at 30 oC, with NH3-(NH4)2SO4 and 20 L/h O2. It is found that without the addition of an oxidant (O2) the zinc removal decreased with only 10%. This indicates that the oxidation of ZnS is influenced by other ele- ments present in the high zinc filter cake. The pH is not controlled in these experiments, it is only monitored. It is found that the pH is not directly related to the reaction rate (kinetics). The dissolution of zinc shows a waving trend for all three lixiviant types. Zinc hydroxide formation and precipitation occurs in the same pH range as the stability of Zn(NH3)42+. When the pH in the reactor is outside the insoluble range of Zn(OH)2 then the removal of zinc will increases when the pH decreases. In future research the influence of other elements, present in the material, on the leaching mechanisms should be studied. And the mechanism responsible for zinc dissolution needs to be unraveled.

While, the final solution will be obtained under an LES scheme, the SGS model will contain information drawn from reference data in an overlapping domain. Since the VMM results in an SGS model which depends on the large-scale residual, the coupling will effectively vanish within sufficiently resolved regions without the need of additional controlling terms.

It has also been proved to be effective in today’s design, if applied appropriately. At the same time, there is a growing trend that higher and higher buildings are constructed in the crowded city area. Air velocity, temperature and other factors have already been found to change with height, and the difference in thermal comfort can also affect the architectural design. Therefore, we do need to know the thermal comfort distribution in high rise buildings. However, research about how to properly realize natural ventilation in a high rise residential building properly is still in early stage. In most cases, designers just choose completely mechanical system to deal with all the climate problems. This may be acceptable for commercial buildings, but in residential buildings natural systems are preferred by most people. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the thermal comfort distribution in a naturally ventilated high rise residential building, and find out if the suitable solutions can be implemented to improve it. To study this question, a case study was carried out in a high rise student dormitory in Delft, Netherlands in July 2015. Field study (questionnaires and measurement) and CFD simulation were applied simultaneously in the research process to validate each other. The temperature, air velocity, humidity and subjective behaviours were investigated. The results show how the thermal comfort level is distributed in both building scale and room scale.

(mentor); Anisi, F. (mentor)","2015","The design and operation of current industrial crystallizers is largely based on experience and practiced skills rather than sound understanding of the process. Crystallization equipment is selected from a number of state-of-art industrial crystallizers followed by optimization for that particular type of equipment. Various physical phenomena which are strongly entangled occur in these crystallizers. The current equipment-based design and optimization of crystallizers causes a lack of control over these physical phenomena. Within the TU Delft Process and Energy department, the development of a task-based design strategy has been initiated in order to obtain better control over the physical events governing the crystallizer product quality. This task-based design is a phenomena-based approach in which fundamental building blocks representing a physical process are used for design. A task based design library model was developed in gPROMS which can be applied to a wide range of crystallization processes concerning the nature of the chemical system, operation mode, flowsheet configuration and crystallizer type. However, the crystallization method is solely based on cooling crystallization. In this thesis research, the task-based design tool is extended with the crystallization method of 'membrane distillation-assisted crystallization'. The main objective was the development of a predictive model for membrane distillation-assisted crystallization with a focus on the process performance. The employed membrane distillation configuration is a 'sweeping gas membrane distillation' arrangement. A mathematical model is developed in gPROMS for the sweeping gas membrane distillation module, followed by validation with experimental obtained data. Validation of the sweeping gas membrane distillation model shows that the model results are adequate. A sensitivity analysis has been performed and compared to literature to obtain more knowledge about the performance of the employed sweeping gas membrane distillation module for this thesis. Subsequently, the sweeping gas membrane distillation model is integrated in the task-based design model library in order to develop the superstructure of membrane distillation-assisted crystallization. The developed superstructure has been validated as well with experimental obtained data in which comes forward that the membrane distillation-crystallization model performs as intended. As the membrane distillation-crystallization model performs adequately, it can be used as a predictive model tool. Since membrane distillation-assisted crystallization is a relatively new concept, case studies were performed in order to gain more insight in the process. In the case studies the membrane distillation-assisted crystallization model was performed under different circumstances. The results from the case studies can be used to aid in design and optimization of new experiments. Based on the findings of the validation procedures, sensitivity analysis and case studies, it can be concluded that the membrane distillation-assisted crystallization model contains predictive capabilities and forms a proper basis for further research.","crystallization; membrane distillation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Process Technology/Intensified Reaction & Separation Systems","",""

(contributor); Van Zuijlen, A.H. (contributor); Florentie, L. (contributor)","2015","Additional thesis with a size of 10 European Credits. The increasing demand for wind energy has led to the development of more efficient wind turbines. A common way to increase the performance of wind turbines is the use of vortex generators. Vortex generators are small devices that are mounted on the turbine blade and they create a stream wise vortex. The vortex transports high momentum fluid towards the surface of the blade, delaying the flow separation. Although vortex generators improve the efficiency of the blade by preventing flow separation, they also create additional drag. This drag can be reduced by using micro vortex generators, which have a height that is smaller than the boundary layer thickness. The positive effect of these micro vortex generators is more local, due to the weaker vortex they create. This means that their effects on the flow should be predicted with more precision to place them in the correct location upstream of the separation. The flow affected by a micro vortex generator can be computed by means of a RANS simulation. A three-dimensional RANS simulation has been performed on a micro vortex pair, using different RANS turbulence models: the standard k-epsilon model, the k-omega-SST model, the Launder Gibson (LG) Reynolds Stress Transport Model and the Speziale Sarkar Gatski (SSG) Reynolds Stress Transport Model. The first two models are eddy viscosity models, which are computationally less expensive than the Reynolds Stress Transport Models (RSTM). The results from the numerical simulations are compared to available experimental data, which include the mean velocity components and the Reynolds stresses. In terms of computational time simulation with the k-omega-SST model was the fastest, whereas the two Reynolds Stress Transport Model simulations were 40% slower. The mean flow field and the decay of the vortex as predicted by the k-omega-SST model and the two Reynolds Stress Transport Models were in agreement with the experimental data. The standard k-epsilon model predicts the wrong shape for the vortex. When the turbulent kinetic energy is compared to the experimental data, all models fail to predict the correct profiles close to the leading edge of the vortex generators. Further downstream the prediction for the turbulent kinetic energy made by the RSTM correspond better with the experimental data than the eddy viscosity models. The degree of Reynolds stress anisotropy is also considered, by looking at the two invariants of the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor. The eddy viscosity models underpredict the Reynolds stress anisotropy, whereas the RSTM slightly overpredict it, compared to the experimental results. The distribution of Reynolds stress in the flow domain is predicted best by the RSTM. It is concluded that when the mean flow features are of interest the best choice is the k-omega-SST model, because the computation time of this model is less than the RSTM, but the mean flow is predicted with almost the same accuracy. The RSTM predicts the Reynolds stresses the most precise, but there are still some differences with the experimental results that could be improved. The use of the k-epsilon model is not advised.","RANS; micro vortex generators; SSG; Launder Gibson; Reynolds stress anisotropy; k-omega-SST","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Huijsmans, R.H.M. (mentor); Pourquie, J.B.M. (mentor); De Jager, A. (mentor); Kruijswijk, A.B. (mentor)","2015","In this master thesis the flow behavior and the performance of a bow tunnel thruster at slow forward vessel motion is studied using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The study analyzes the flow and the turning ability for a cylindrical cross-section and the effect of changing the cross-section of the bow tunnel thruster. At Royal IHC it is noticed that trailing suction hopper dredgers experience a significant decrease in turning ability, using the bow tunnel thrusters, when trailing at a speed through the water of 5 [kts] in comparison to zero forward speed. Dredgers are often operating at those speeds, use the bow tunnel thruster to keep course and therefore often experience this effect in practice. To study the flow behavior the commercial CFD solver Numeca FineMarine is used. Computations are made on model scale using a simplified wedge model of a container ship (Nienhuis wedge) for validation purpose and of a trailing suction hopper dredger (Hopper wedge). For the Nienhuis wedge multiple numerical studies are performed that focus on the used set-up, non-linear iterations and convergence, time step, actuator disk modeling and first layer thickness. A grid study together with a verification and validation study close the analysis of the Nienhuis wedge. The settings from the Nienhuis wedge are used for the computations with the Hopper wedge. For the Hopper wedge a systematic tunnel cross-section variation is derived and three different shapes are computed at different ship speeds: a circular cross-section (S1010A), flattened cross-section (S0610A) and a streamlined cross-section (S0602A). The flow of the tunnel jet and the flow around the ship are comparable to the flow of a jet in a cross-flow. The flow is unsteady and fluctuates. Once the tunnel jet flow leaves the tunnel the flow interacts with the surrounding flow and is bend into the direction of that surrounding flow. A large wake region is visible behind the jet. The velocity ratio $m$ between the ship speed and the tunnel jet speed is an important factor and characterizes the behavior of the flow. At $m$=0.2 [-] a strong jet shows only little interaction with the ship flow, while a weak jet at $m$=0.4 [-] is largely influenced by the ship flow. For the Nienhuis wedge a grid study shows large numerical uncertainties. The verification and validation study shows that the computations are qualitative valid and quantitative invalid. Quantitative comparison between two different model tests shows discrepancy in the obtained side force on the wedge. However the quantitative results of this study do agree with a full scale CFD study. In both this CFD study and the full scale CFD study the hub and strut of the thruster are not modeled. It is expected that this has an effect on the side force and is a possible reason for the difference between CFD and model tests. A change in cross-section reduces the wake region behind the jet for the streamlined cross-section (S0602A) in comparison to the other cross-section. The absolute side force of the streamlined cross-section (S0602A) is significantly increased (more than 30 [\%] at $m$=0.4 [-]), while the resistance is slightly increased (4 [\%]) in comparison to the circular cross-section (S1010A) and the flattened cross-section (S0610A). The aim is an increase in absolute side force as it increases the turning ability of the ship, an increase in resistance however is negative on the fuel-consumption of the vessel. In general the cross-sectional variation shows promising results, however the numerical uncertainties of the computations are too high. It is advised to check the CFD model scale results with CFD full scale computations and to validate both with measurements. For a future CFD study it is advised to model the hub and strut of the bow thruster, because they can have an influence on the side force on the wedge.","bow tunnel thruster; Nienhuis wedge; trailing suction hopper dredger; jet in a cross-flow; Hopper wedge; cross-section variation; CFD; Numeca FineMarine; IHC; streamlined cross-section; forward motion; model scale; performance of bow thruster; systematic series","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-12-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime and Transport Technology (M&TT)","","Marine Technology - Track Science - Specialization Ship Hydromechanics (MT-SC-SH)","",""

(mentor)","2015","In the current plans of Delft Aardwarmte Project (DAP), it is considered to perform the drilling operation by using pipes which remain in the well after drilling thus acting as a casing, the so-called “Casing While Drilling” (CwD) technique. Due to the absence of drill pipe tripping prior to casing the well, this technique results in reduced drilling time compared to conventional drilling. Additionally, potential downhole problems due to drill pipe tripping are precluded. This thesis presents a simulation based approach to selecting casing steel of suitable grade capable of withstanding typical loads encountered while drilling of the well and during its producing life. The developed algorithm is then used in the design of the casing string for the proposed DAP geothermal producer well. The algorithm first considers the effect of uni-axial stresses on casing due to defined burst and collapse pressure loads encountered due to loss of well control while drilling or in the production phase to make a preliminary selection. The effect of axial stress due to buoyed weight of casing and the bending stress due to wellbore curvature is then used to re-evaluate the design against the same collapse and burst loads. This is performed by using a bi-axial approach for the former and the Von-Mises triaxial stress criteria for the latter. A ‘Johancsik’ torque and drag model developed in MATLAB is used to predict drag values during tripping. The bi-axial and Von-Mises stress analysis approach is repeated to include the effect of the computed pull-out drag forces. The associated torque values are used to compute torsional stresses and to identify casing connections of appropriate torque capacity. The final step in the algorithm is to simulate the loads occurring during drilling and calculate the equivalent Von Mises stress values throughout the casing string. Typical drilling loads considered include torque and casing lateral vibration which induce torsional and bending stresses respectively. It was identified that rather than bending stress due to whirling or buckling, torsional stress was more likely to cause casing string failure. This is due to its relatively higher magnitude and the weaker maximum torque capacities of conventional casing connections. Additionally, the MATLAB tools developed for analysing buckling and whirling are used to compute the critical load for inducing sinusoidal buckling as a function of wellbore inclination and the critical rotary speed at surface to induce lateral vibration for varying weight on bit (WOB) respectively. From the generated mode shapes, the bending stress magnitude at each node and therefore the points of maximum stress occurrence for bucking and whirling are also identified.","casing; drilling; bending stress; torque and drag; whirling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2015","Nowadays, modern Integrated Circuit (IC) technology allows processor manufacturers to produce complex designs with up to a few billions of transistors.Technology limitations and the end of voltage and frequency scaling forced computer architecture to multicore designs and more specialized solutions on hardware. These technology trends increased memory bandwidth pressure, exposing modern computer systems to bandwidth limitations. Therefore, a large and increasing fraction of the area is occupied to efficiently manage the available memory bandwidth, especially the off-chip bandwidth. In addition, the failure of Dennard Scaling along with the end of multicore scaling gave rise to the Dark Silicon era, in which the percentage of transistors in an IC that can be simultaneously powered-on is decreasing. Thus, under a fixed power and thermal budget, decreasing the main memory accesses of a processor relieves operational costs and rises the potential for increased computing performance. In order to tackle this problem, we investigate the possibilities to offload functionalities of the software to hardware due to the drop in the cost of hardware. Based on our observations on modern programming languages, we formulate the hypothesis that object caching presents potential to advance the main processor's functionalities in handling objects which are the most commonly used memory structure in modern languages. After formulating the concept of a Local Object Store (LOS), this master thesis presents our progress on developing the framework for our proof of concept. A LOS is expected to decrease the number of main memory references by leveraging the ""infant mortality"" property of objects in real-life applications. Our proposed design provides support for the basic object manipulation operations while maintaining reference counters for the local objects.Therefore, comparing LOS with a cache memory, it permits the construction and destruction of short-lived objects without polluting the rest of the memory hierarchy. Our framework consists of a Smart Pointer library, two modified tracing tools that allow us to obtain traces from microbenchmarks, and a basic simulator for a Cache-LOS memory unit. Moreover, we develop and trace 3 microbenchmarks and using our framework simulate a 39% average reduction in the main memory accesses for a Cache-LOS memory architecture compared to a cache-only memory configuration. These promising results show the benefits of an integrated Cache-LOS to manipulate object structures.","Local Object Store Design; scratchpad; cache memory; management unit cache","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-01-15","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

Traditional and passive mobility systems, which only rely on human control inputs are no longer safe and suitable to operate in these highly unpredictable environments. This increasing complexity in combination with physical and cognitive limitations of humans, have caused significant efficiency and safety problems. In the other words, humans are increasingly less qualified to deal with the manual control challenges of a road car. Recent statistics shows that more than 90% of the road accidents are caused by human control errors and failure in providing appropriate responses on time. Real-time assistance from computers and intelligent systems can effectively compensate for these errors. Advanced Driver Assisting Systems (ADAS) and implementation of Autonomous Driving (AD) can potentially save lives and reduce the financial damages of road accidents. In the year 2040, AD will reach a technology maturity phase and self-driving cars will become commercially available for the consumers. In this period, a high performance Porsche sports car, equipped with an AD assist will be introduced to the market. This advanced sports car will be able to prevent fatal accidents. In the other words, this vehicle will regulate its motion in the urban environment in such way that passengers will remain safe. Therefore, with this high level of active safety protection, the majority of the contemporary passive safety systems will be removed from the interior of this vehicle. This aspect will provide significant freedom for industrial designers to create a reduced, open and adaptive interior architecture for a Porsche sports car. Furthermore, this AD assisted sports car will be able to provide a highly emotional driving experience on a racetrack and also a gentle and comfortable autonomous ride in an urban environment.

Our most successful method decouples geometry and voxel data via a novel mapping scheme, enabling us to apply the DAG principle on the geometry while compressing the voxel attributes using a specialized algorithm. This leads to a drastic memory reduction. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques and is well-suited for GPU architectures, resulting in real-time performance on commodity hardware for colored scenes with up to 17 levels (131,072^3 resolution) treated in core.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Computer Graphics","",""

(mentor); Pennings, P.C. (mentor)","2015","Over time much research has been performed on the subject of cavitation. A recent development in this field is the investigation into the behaviour of the cavity within a propeller's tip-vortex. It is found that this cavity can produce a very distinct broadband sound-spectrum which can cause trouble on-board ships either by the sound itself or due to the coincidence with the natural frequencies of a ships structure, causing resonance problems. Recent research by Bosschers and Pennings have resulted in an engineering approach to the calculation of a center frequency of this specific type of cavitation sound. To validate this engineering method, measurements were performed by Pennings[2016] on a 2-bladed propeller in the cavitation tunnel at the Delft University of Technology. The purpose of these measurements was finding the resonance frequency of the tip-vortex cavity. From early measurements it was found that the self-exciting behaviour of the cavity, as it was found by Maines & Arndt[1997], could not be reproduced. To get the cavity to generate sound, an artificial wake was introduced which resulted in the distinct broadband sound-spectrum associated with tip-vortex cavitation. To investigate whether the velocity gradient introduced by the wake is sufficiently steep to excite the natural frequencies of the vortex cavity, velocity measurements have been performed from which a steep dip in the flow velocity was found near and behind the wake generator. Also a highly fluctuating behaviour of the flow, with large deviations from the mean flow, was found. These large spreads are associated with the broadband sound spectrum that comes with tip-vortex cavitation. From this it is concluded that the wake generator, as it is used in the measurements by Pennings[2016], gives a good approximation of a real wake. To be able to use the engineering method as a tool to predict the center frequency, a method is needed to accurately calculate the cavity radius and the associated circumferential velocity without the need of full scale tests. When such a method is available the resonance frequency associated with tip-vortex cavitation for a specific propeller can be calculated in the design stage of the ship and/or propeller. With this information available an educated trade-off can be made between the alteration of the propeller and the construction of the ship in order to prevent coinciding natural frequencies. To obtain the necessary cavitation information a numerical simulation is performed of which the results show good agreement with measurement data. With this simulation method a relatively fast and accurate prediction can be made of the center frequency of tip-vortex cavitation with the use of the engineering method. However, to grow the confidence in the results produced, further research should be performed. The current numerical simulations have been performed for a very small propeller. It would be interesting to see whether the method, as it is described and tested in this thesis, also produces good results for a regular scale propeller. Next to that, because the cavity shows no chordwise region over which the parameters of interest are constant, a further investigation into the decay rate of the cavity is advised in order to increase confidence in the choice of location at which the cavitation parameters should be evaluated.","tip vortex cavitation; center frequency; numerical simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime Engineering","","Hydromechanics","",""

Meanwhile, as turbines grow bigger and more are placed offshore, performance monitoring costs are increasing, making it more interesting to consider novel devices to measure turbine performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the applicability of these devices in power performance monitoring and evaluating the potential gains which can be achieved. A comparative study of the measurement accuracies was performed of the nacelle-based Lidar (WindIris) and a spinner anemometer (iSpins) against an IEC-compliant met-mast. Accuracies of both devices in measuring wind speeds, yaw misalignment and power curves were found to be comparable to a met-mast and therefore could be worthy replacements of met-masts for power performance measurements in the future. The impact of non-ideal wind conditions, like yaw misalignment, turbulence and wind shear, on power performance was also investigated using both experimental and Bladed simulated results. No conclusive results were found on the relationship between yaw misalignment and performance loss. The ideal yaw error was found to increase with increasing wind shear, caused by higher angles of attack in the top of the rotor area. The direct impact of turbulence intensity and wind shear on power curves was found to be wind speed dependent and not that significant on overall energy production. Finally, combining the knowledge acquired about yaw misalignment and device accuracies, a financial feasibility study was performed to evaluate future implementation of the novel devices for yaw misalignment correction. Since no conclusive evidence was presented that correcting for yaw misalignment could increase power performance significantly, current implementation of such a correction campaign is not recommended. If a deliberate yaw misalignment campaign were to be performed, however, the impact of yaw misalignment on turbine performance should be quantifiable and expectations are that implementation of novel devices should be financially feasible.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The first goal was the development of a geometry creation algorithm based on a Non Uniform Rational Basis Splines (NURBS) algorithm developed by Ferede [14], with a more complex spanwise/chordwise discretization technique in order to more accurately design a discretized HAWT blade. The second goal was the alteration of the material creation algorithm developed by Scheldbergen [25], so that different stacks at various blade locations can be assigned. Moreover, the aerodynamic loads generation algorithm of Scheldbergen [25] was modified to apply for different airfoils along the blade span. Also, Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory was used for the calculation of the aerodynamic loads and the software XFOIL was used for the aerodynamic analysis of the airfoils (pressure distribution on the airfoil at corresponding angles of attack and Re numbers). An initial HAWT blade design was created, matching the SANDIA 5 MW wind turbine blade [23] geometry and materials. Furthermore, the apwise/edgewise stiffness, moments of inertia, mass and mode shapes were also validated. Additionally, the SANDIA blade was analyzed in DNV GL Bladed in order to validate the aerodynamic loads on the blade. Following, the tool was designed to process the geometry, the materials and the gravitational/ centrifugal/aerodynamic loads of the blade and translate them to an input for the FEA software MSC Nastran for Linear Static Analysis (SOL 101), Buckling Analysis (SOL 105) and Modal Analysis (SOL 103). The post processing algorithm of Scheldbergen [25] was modified to apply for a HAWT (instead of a VAWT), transforming the results of the FEA analysis into optimization constraints (ultimate load, buckling, tip deflection and fatigue). The final part of the algorithm involved the minimization of the blade's mass by altering the thickness at various locations, using the MATLAB function fmincon. Concluding, a case study of a smart rotor blade equipped with trailing edge ap (TRF) was examined. A _ 2 flap was used at 90-100% of the chord and 78-98% of the span. Two kinds of optimization were performed for the HAWT and smart rotor scenarios; one that included ultimate stress, tip deflection and fatigue constraints (UL-TD-FA) and one that also included buckling constraints (UL-BU-TD-FA). It was found that the buckling constraint was the limiting factor of the optimization and the fatigue constraint was the least dominant. The initial design of the smart rotor blade showed a 16.5% decrease of the maximum fatigue damage and a 2% decrease in the maximum stress. The optimized smart rotor blade mass was 0.5 % lower in the UL-TD-FA scenario and 2.5% in the UL-BU-TD-FA scenario compared to the HAWT blade. The tool created is capable of creating a flexible and fairly accurate representation of a HAWT and smart rotor blade. It also provides the ability to structurally analyze the blade under the most significant structural criteria and minimize the blade's weight under specific loading conditions. The tool constitutes a good starting point for more detailed structural analysis of smart rotors and more complex structural optimization of HAWT and smart rotor blades.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Morales-España, G. (mentor)","2015","Until recently the European electricity system has been operating as a set of isolated national markets with divergent regulatory norms. Today, the day-ahead markets between South-Western Europe and North-Western Europe are fully coupled, enabling the trading of electricity all the way from Portugal to Finland. Moreover, policy-makers in the power sector are currently preparing the design of what it will be called the Internal Energy Market. Europe's power sector aims for an integrated, more competitive, secure and sustainable power system. Meanwhile, ambitious renewable targets aim for a decarbonization of the electricity sector by 2050. This will lead to a large deployment of renewable technologies into the system, with almost 50% of them being the most intermittent, uncertain and unevenly distributed sources in the continent, wind and solar. The introduction of the projected large amounts of intermittent sources will impact both the functioning of the electricity markets and the operation of the transmission grids. Cross-border congestion profiles are expected to suffer changes, transmission constraints will appear and an effective congestion management approach will be needed within the framework of the market's redesign. Currently, the congestion management mechanism in place in many Member States is based on a redispatch phase after market clearance, which results in inefficiencies and additional rebalancing costs. This congestion management approach falls within the zonal market design. A consistent integration of electricity markets across Europe enabling the access of large capacities of renewable generation would have the potential to maximize overall welfare to all agents. Generators would enter a more competitive market with a lower risk, consumers would benefit from lower electricity prices and transmission system operators would benefit from reduced operation costs of balancing and reserve. Locational marginal pricing, also known as nodal market design, would be able to provide an integrated approach of national and international congestion management, a joint allocation of international transmission rights, the integration of congestion management with day-ahead, intraday and balancing markets and finally a transparent approach to facilitate secure and effective cooperation and information exchange among European system operators. However, a committed high-level support on a European level would be required for its further implementation. The objective of this thesis is to gain a better understanding of the European power market in presence of large amounts of renewable energies and under different power market designs, and find out by how much can the market design and its features affect the provision of cost-efficient electricity, this is the system's variable generation costs of electricity. In order to study the influence of the power market design in the integration of large amounts of renewable energies, an optimization model is used. The model solves a weekly unit commitment problem and the transmission constrained economic dispatch for the day-ahead market of a conceptual network of Europe and from a centralized decision making point of view. The model uses a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation of the unit commitment and minimizes total variable generation costs of the system. The two market designs studied, nodal market and zonal market, are modeled according to how congestion is managed in each case. The aim is to analyze the impact of the power market design on the power system's variables: total variable generation costs, RES curtailment, energy production by technology, non-served energy and hourly electricity prices while subjected to several scenarios of increasing degree of RES integration. For this, different degrees of future RES scenarios based on ENTSO-E market studies are used. The research shows that in a high renewable scenario the total variable generation costs of the power system when it operates under a zonal power market are around 0,32% higher than under a nodal market. These potential savings under a nodal market could even be larger especially if the large expected projections of renewable sources of generation finally materialize and provided that the required network capacities are delivered effectively on time. Moreover, the degree of curtailment in both nodal and zonal markets rise notably in a high renewable scenario compared to the current situation, up to a weekly curtailment of 7,83% and 8,01%, respectively. Such notable amounts of curtailment could be due to the insufficient development of the transmission network assumed which leads to the incapability of supplying cheap renewable energy across wide regions and instead having to commit or reschedule local and more expensive technologies. On the other hand, costs of unserved energy represent 2,95% and 3,08% of the total system's variable generation costs in the nodal and zonal market, respectively. It is again highlighted the importance of a timely delivery of the network infrastructure investments to gradually integrate the large deployment of renewables in the system. Overall, a nodal market in Europe could have the potential of improving efficiency in the system by reducing variable generation costs by 0,32% compared to a zonal market. Benefits could increase even more if an adequate network expansion plan that takes into account the growth of renewable energies would deliver its investments on a timely manner.","power system; power market design; renewable energy integration; nodal market; zonal market; locational marginal prices","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","MSc Engineering & Policy Analysis within EMIN Erasmus Mundus Programme","",""

(mentor)","2015","Participation in cyberspace is of key importance for large organisations (and the functioning of our society), but to participate responsibly a comprehensive cyber approach is needed. Cyberspace is a dynamic and complex environment due to the hyper-connectedness and therefore such an approach should aim for cyber resilience to cope with this complexity. Standards can form good inspiration for the creation of a cyber approach. However, due to the differences between traditional information security and cyber security the standards do not cover the cyber domain completely. At this moment there is a knowledge gap on (1) what elements a cyber approach for large organisations should cover and (2) what role standards can play in such an approach. Furthermore, aiming at resilience is not (yet) common practice. This research therefore has as main goal: To design a cyber framework that helps large organisations to develop a cyber approach. An analysis of the cyber security landscape has shown that a diverse set of actors create in a garbage can-like model a diverse set of standards with different aims and scopes. Six standards are further analysed resulting in elements of standards that are important for a cyber approach (requirement for cyber framework). The analysis further shows that the main standards are still mostly based on traditional information security and do not yet (all) cover the main aspects of cyber and/or resilience. Semi structured interviews have resulted in the identification of five issues that needs to be dealt with when dealing with cyber security: (1) Parties in cyberspace are highly dependent on each other, (2) Dynamics of cyber are larger compared to traditional information security, (3) Assets to protect are constantly getting more diverse, (4) Incidents in cyberspace can have huge consequences in the physical world and (5) The general level of cyber resilience is rather low. These issues form requirements for the cyber framework. Based on literature research, the analysis of the standards landscape and the conducted interviews, design principles for a cyber approach are formulated. The design principles have two roles; (1) they serve as input for designing a cyber approach to help dealing with design dilemmas and (2) they are requirements for a cyber framework, because that needs to be compatible with these design principles. Based on the requirements, a cyber framework has been designed with Hevner’s design science methodology. The framework covers the three dimensions (1) cyber governance, providing the goal/mission of the organisation, boundary conditions for and evaluation of the other dimensions and (2) Risk management, covering the long term risk balance with a cycle covering assessing the risk, control and monitoring. These two are completed with (3) situational awareness, providing the incident detection (monitoring), short term response and recover completed with the monitoring of (strategic) developments in the environment. With the addition of situational awareness the framework provides the needed addition to participate in cyberspace responsibly. The framework serves as (1) tool to gain insight in the elements and their relation needed in a cyber approach and (2) as a ‘check-list’ for a designer when designing an approach. Due to the important role of situational awareness in the framework, it helps to develop a cyber approach that results in a better cyber resilience of the organisation. These results have been evaluated with six of the respondents from the other interviews based on a questionnaire and a case based on DigiNotar. Besides these contributions, the most interesting conclusion of this research is the changed role of standards; because of the complexity of the (risks) of participating in cyberspace, a ‘silver bullet’ solution cannot be made. Therefore standards are still useful for high over requirements and technical implementation, but for the layer in between a more tailor made approach is needed. Standards will still play a key role in cyber security, because part of the way to deal with the complexity of cyber is to cooperate with partners and standards can help to communicate between partners. The results of this research could be further evaluated with expert workshops on specific cases. Further research could be done to test the developed principles and the framework in practice, to develop of a decision support framework to help select specific elements of standards for large organisations and the measuring of cyber resilience.","cyber security; standards; cyber resilience; cyber governance; risk management; situational awareness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Information and Communication Technology","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis & Management (SEPAM)","",""

Vision is important for flight stability, but generally believed to be too slow to explain fast reflexes during maneuvers and hovering for species such as the Manduca sexta. Insects in the Diptera order (the true flies) acquire angular velocity information with their halteres, club-like organs that once evolved from their hind wings, with strain sensors at their base to detect deformation during turns. The hawk moth wing is richly equipped with strain sensors, but the function of these sensors is still unknown. Could these wing-based strain sensors be used to detect deformation caused by body rotation? To investigate this hypothesis, an Euler-Lagrange model, a Finite-element model, and a robotic model of a flapping at plate were subjected to inertial rotations. The difference in strain between the left and the right side of the wing base indicated wing twist in all computational models. Bending strain is two orders larger than the strain due to twist, making experimentally detecting twist challenging. Wing twist was confirmed for three out of four rotation conditions, be it at different frequencies than expected from simulation. Two strain gauges measuring twist at the wing base proved to be capable of detecting wing twist, but not sufficiently robust to act as an angular velocity sensor. Future work could shed light on whether it is in fact the large array of sensors found on insect wings that allows a more robust sensing of wing deformation as a result of inertial rotations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

From reading literature I conclude this condition is the main reason that intentions to create EIPs fail. The main research question of this research project is: What is a coherent set of Requirements for the successful development of resource sharing business parks? This research question is answered by first explaining which factors are required for the successful development of resource sharing business parks according to literature. Then it is explained to what extent the factors for the successful development of resource sharing business parks found in literature correspond with the factors that were identified at two cases. Finally experts are consulted to find out if the improved set of requirements could really be used to successfully develop resource sharing business parks? The literature review showed little overlap between EIP literature and cluster literature. That is striking as EIPs are a sub-category of clusters. The literature review produced the following Preliminary Set of Requirements for the successful development of resource sharing business parks: 1. Resource Availability: there need to be enough resources available at the location 2. Agglomeration Effects: positive externalities serve as a force of attraction 3. Cluster Governance Policy: this policy should focus on creating the right conditions and should allow for freedom and decentralisation for the park participants 4. Network Activities: Having a well-functioning network with many activities is important for knowledge sharing and to uncover opportunities 5. Mutually Profitable Transactions: having transactions between companies that is profitable for both parties is important for the successful development of a resource sharing business park 6. Business Opportunities: if there are not enough business opportunities the initiative will fail Two cases were studied to see if this Preliminary Set corresponds with reality. HOST Park on Hawaii and Biopark Terneuzen in the Netherlands were selected because these are both successfully developed resource sharing business parks and the access to information in each case. At HOST Park warm and cold seawater are pumped up and distributed to tenants on site. These tenants use this water and solar energy as input for their activities. These activities include: water bottling, desalination, energy generation, and food production. Biopark Terneuzen is an initiative that was started in an existing port area. Opportunities to share resources between the companies are identified and these companies then decide to collaborate. From the results it was concluded that the Preliminary Set of Requirements did not adequately prescribe how resource sharing business parks should be developed. The results showed that: - The availability of resources is crucial; there are key resources that enable the use of other resources; - In each case Agglomeration Effects were not crucial; - The cluster governance policy indeed should focus on creating a good environment for doing business by for example, removing business barriers or by facilitating and initiating collaborations between companies. How strict the policy is depends on how independent the park management can operate from the park participants; - The importance of Network Activities depends on the need for collaboration; - Mutually Profitable Transactions should be considered as a form of Business Opportunity; and - A strategy document containing a vision for the development of the cluster should be developed to gather support from businesses, knowledge institutions, governments, and society. Based on these results the Revised Set of Requirements was created which improved the Preliminary Set and included what was learned from the case studies. The Revised Set of Requirements consists of: 1. Compelling Vision; 2. Availability of Critical Resources; 3. Fitting Park Governance Policy; 4. Business Opportunities; and 5. Fitting Level of Network Activities To find out if these Revised Requirements are the answer to the main research question and would really be usable in practice, the Revised Requirements were presented to experts. The experts added the following remarks: Compelling Vision - The vision should not only be created, it should also be executed. Many strategy documents are shelved. - Agreement should be reached on a technological ambition level that is reasonable and attainable. A technological ambition level that is too high introduces huge risks and adds to the complexity of the project. Availability of Critical Resources - The continuity of the availability of critical resources should be guaranteed for the life time of the project to earn back investments - Besides financial capital, human capital, and infrastructure, logistics should be added as critical. - Some critical resources might not be present from the start of a project. Possibilities to develop these resources should then be investigated. Fitting Park Governance Policy - It should be clear on how the park is going to be managed and who is responsible for what. - The policy should be consistent and should be developed for the long term. Changing policies creates risks for the cluster participants. - Trust is crucial for collaboration. - There should be a focus on business creation. Business Opportunities - New business opportunities are also potential risks. Fitting Level of Network Activities - Collaboration does not just emerge. It has to be initiated and companies have to be willing to collaborate. These Revised Requirements were adapted to include these remarks and thus created the Final Set of Requirements for the successful development of resources sharing business parks. Using the Requirements cannot guarantee success but the experts generally agreed that if their remarks were included, the Set of Requirements greatly increase the chance of a successful development and are indeed a coherent set that can be used for the successful development of resource sharing business parks.","Clusters; Eco-Industrial Parks; Business Parks; Resource Exchange; Key Requirements; Development; Success Factors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Management","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Pasman, G.J. (mentor)","2015","The department of Critical Care Medicine at SickKids Children’s Hospital is an ever changing environment. In the department’s units one finds the most vulnerable patients, surrounded with many monitoring devices, intravenous pumps and life support devices. Sudden changes in their physiological states require clinicians to make quick decisions concerning treatment of the patients. However, the large variety of monitors makes it more complex to see, analyse and interpret the right data. Clinicians are often required to make calculations in their head and make quick and efficient decisions, mainly based on expertise. To facilitate clinicians in decision making, the hospital adopted a system called T3. This so called clinical decision support system integrates the data streams from the different monitoring devices into one user interface. In addition, it contains algorithms that can predict events. This should shift decision making from prescriptive to predictive, which implies that clinicians can now prevent events from happening when the right treatment is given. T3 was implemented to support clinicians. However, in practise, the majority of clinicians do not use the system. One of the assumptions regarding why this is occurring is that the system is not user friendly. This produced the initial assignment of this thesis: to redesign T3 in such a way that it is easy to use. Ultimately the assignment was supplemented with the goals of adding more functionalities to the current system and eventually exploring conceptual scenarios for its future use. A total of five iterations, based on a tablet-first principle, led to a new design, built around three main use scenarios. Extensive decomposition and analysis of the current T3 system, together with the application of a heuristic evaluation formed the basis of all iterations. To reinforce the system’s usability, new functionalities were extracted from trend analysis literature. The last two iterations, the concept and final design, elaborate on the first three iterations and add new perspective on T3’s potential use in the future. Ultimately, the final designs pursue a future where the critical care field makes a big shift from experience based to evidence based decision making. The vision describes a T3 that does not only predict events, but it also recommends evidence based suggestions for treatment. Ideally, T3’s standards will eventually be adopted by other health technology companies. This would facilitate and improve the development of evidence based healthcare. Moreover, this integration would create more consistency among various medical devices. This would improve the general usability of medical equipment. The future vision creates an ideal scenario for the future, but as the word implies this is only a vision for now. Before this vision might become reality, multiple iterations of thorough research should be conducted. Only if the research results are watertight, could the creators of T3 start implementing algorithms for treatment advice. Two other present- oriented scenarios distinguish the use of T3 at the bedside and away from the bedside. The corresponding designs are much more likely to be feasible for implementation on the short term.","decision making; big data; intensive care; user interface; user experience; children's hospital; SickKids; Canada; T3","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Human Information and Communication Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2015","The leading edge inflated (LEI) surf-kite is a suitable wing design for airborne wind energy (AWE) power generation because the bridling and leading edge design allow the wing to be de-powered while retaining good steer-ability. Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) modelling is required to capture the flight behavior of an LEI kite, due to it's extreme flexibility. Unfortunately, the current kite aerodynamic models do not meet the requirements for LEI-kite FSI modelling: they are either fast but insufficiently accurate, or accurate but computationally expensive. In particular, the current fast aerodynamic models are not able to represent the effects of the multiple flow separation regions - such as behind the LEI tube and above the canopy’s trailing edge - inherent to a LEI kite flying at a large range of angles of attack. This master’s thesis is intended to evaluate the hypothesis that a quasi-steady multiple-wake vortex lattice method can quickly and accurately model surf-kite aerodynamics to generate aerodynamic surface load distributions. This model uses multiple vortex lattices to represent the separation stream-surfaces in the flow, as well as the geometric surface itself. The vortex model chosen is the Vatistas Core Model, with a combined free- and fixed-wake wake deformation model. The method is applied to an arc-shaped wing with a Clark Y profile, a unity aspect ratio flat plate, and a demonstration LEI kite in order to assess the model's strengths and limitations. It appears that the usefulness of a multiple-wake vortex lattice method is strongly limited for membrane-wing kites, by an inability to enforce the Kutta condition on a reattachment-line when this reattachment-line crosses a separation-line. However, in certain high angle of attack cases, a single-wake and pressure-surface-separation double-wake vortex lattice method have the same order of uncertainty with respect to RANS results as is generated by the geometric approximations made in the TU Delft AWE group’s RANS studies of 3D LEI kites.","Windenergy; LEI separation; multiple wake vortex lattice method; VLM kite","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-15","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy, Flight Performance and Propulsion","","Wind Energy","",""

(mentor)","2015","Electronic companies are increasingly using field-programmable gate arrays in various domains such as application acceleration, complex digital designs or ASIC prototyping. The Verification phase holds a significant place in the FPGA design development process. A key challenge during verification is observability. This is defined as the ability to view all internal states of a circuit. Due to poor observability, a significant portion of designer's effort is spent in this phase, specifically performing the debugging task. A common solution to improve observability is using embedded logic analyzers (ELA) that inserts trace-buffers into the design to record on-chip signal values. When on-chip memory is used for observation it is termed as trace-buffers. This approach has limitations such as slow debug cycles, pre-determining the signals to be traced or using logic resources on FPGA. This work proposes a new debug system for improving the observability while overcoming the limitations of ELAs. The proposed debug system extends a recent technique referred as virtual overlay network (VON) for commercial FPGA device. This network can be perceived as built on top of initial circuit mapping and multiplexes all circuit signals to the on-chip memory for observation. It overcomes the limitation of commercial debug tools based on ELAs. We investigate the factors that inuence the performance of VON for Xilinx Virtex, as it constitutes the core of debug system. We demonstrate that a new bit-stream to program the FPGA connecting hundreds of signals to the on-chip memory can be generated in less than 630 seconds, during debug cycle, for a fairly large circuit having normal re-compilation time of more than 5 hours. The proposed system proves to be a promising way of improving observability and potentially reducing the debug turn time with zero area overhead. Currently, the system is limited to work with Xilinx Virtex family of devices.","FPGA Verification; Debugging; Overlay Network; Trace-Based","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Blom, C.B.M. (mentor); Spruit, R. (mentor)","2015","For a safe structure design standards mainly emphasize on calculations based on the uncracked and fully cracked stiffness of concrete structures. In the common design practice an uncracked stiffness (EI0) is applied for the SLS and a fully cracked stiffness (EI?) for the ULS, where the reduced stiffness EI? ? 1/3EI0. However, in reality it is unlikely for a structure to remain uncracked or to become fully cracked; it is more common to find members consisting of cracked and uncracked zones. This implies the existence of a realistic variable bending stiffness (EIvar) along the reinforced concrete member. The Eurocode 2 states that members which are expected to crack, but may not be fully cracked, will behave in a manner intermediate between the uncracked and fully cracked conditions. Insufficient elaboration on the impact of EIvar on the safety of concrete structures and whether the applied design models using EI0 and EI? are indeed conservative models, led to the formulation of this research project. By means of the ‘Waalbrug-project’, this thesis investigates the impact of a realistic bending stiffness on the structural behaviour. For this particular project the safety of the packing structure, consisting of diaphragm walls and a roof structure, is analyzed. The bending stiffness of diaphragm walls is not constant over the height, but it varies as a function of the magnitude of the occurring bending moment and the amount of reinforcement. As soon as the wall is cracked the wall stiffness decreases at an increasing bending moment, which is explained in literature by means of the M-(N)-? diagram. A reduced wall stiffness results in greater wall deformations, but on the other hand the deformations on their turn influence the wall stiffness. For the influence of the soil behaviour on the stiffness of the diaphragm wall the ‘interaction’ model Plaxis 2D was used. Different calculation models were set up to determine whether the structural behaviour at EIvar lies indeed within the behaviour of an uncracked and fully cracked structure. The impact of the boundary condition (hinged or clamped connection) was also studied. The Half Model and Total Model in the calculation programs PCSheetPileWall and Plaxis 2D were used for structural analysis. The structural behaviour was expressed in terms of the bending moment (MEd), settlement (?v) and lateral wall displacement (Ux), which were calculated at the bending stiffnesses EI0, EI? and EIvar as a function of an axial compressive force N = 0 kN and N ? 0 kN for the following calculation models: - Walls only; hinged - Walls only; clamped - Walls and roof; clamped. EIvar based calculations turned out to be an iterative procedure. During this research two iteration procedures were developed to find the actual EI-distribution over the diaphragm wall height. An evaluation of the load distribution and cracked zones according to both iteration procedures, finally led to the conclusion that the results of iteration procedure 2 were valid for EIvar and that too for every calculation model. In iteration procedure 2 the actual EI-distribution over the wall height is obtained by considering the average M-line and average cracked zones based on EI0 and EI?. In this research a safety analysis was performed for: - The basic case (‘basic reinforcement ratio’ for the hinged and clamped case) and for; - The hinged case in particular, where a variation was made in the soil stiffness and the reinforcement ratio of the diaphragm wall. In the calculation models a ‘basic reinforcement ratio’ was the main input for determining EIvar. For the ‘Walls only; hinged’- model it was found that the packing structure was totally safe if the walls were designed based on EI?, while for the ‘Walls and roof; clamped’- model a safe structure was reached if the walls were designed based on EI0. The ‘Walls only; clamped’- model showed that a fully clamped connection is only an academic case, which is not realizable. The chosen connection type was found to have a major impact on the structural safety. Due to limited freedom of movement with regard to the reinforcement in the clamped case, variations were only studied for the hinged case. If stiffer diaphragm walls, achieved by applying a high reinforcement ratio, were used in the hinged case a model based on EI? still proved to be conservative. At a higher reinforcement ratio the behaviour tended even faster towards EI? (occurrence of greater cracked zones). When the soil properties (lower soil stiffness) were changed for the hinged case, EI? still proved to be a safe approach for the bending moment. However, for the deformations an EIvar based calculation was a safer method, because the actual deformations proved to be larger than what followed from the lower bound stiffness EI?. All analyses taken into account, it can be concluded that considering both the outer boundaries EI0 and EI? is not always a guarantee for a safe structure. Therefore, EIvar based calculations are necessary. It has been proven that the axial force (N) has no significant impact on EIvar. Especially, when designing the reinforcement a load distribution according to EIvar should be considered. Otherwise, there is a great risk of placing less reinforcement over a certain part of the wall, in particular for the hinged case. An EI0 based calculation for reinforcement design is only conservative if the maximum occurring bending moment of both walls is considered over the total wall height. However, this is a too safe approach. Of more practical relevance for (similar) future projects would be to design the reinforcement based on the ‘dekkingslijn’-principle using (1) the bending stiffness EI0, but then with 30-50% extra reinforcement at the bottom part of the wall or (2) the bending moment envelope based on different simulations with EIvar.","realistic bending stiffness; diaphragm wall; uncracked stiffness; totally cracked stiffness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Design & Construction / Concrete Structures","",""

(mentor); Veltena, M.C.C. (mentor)","2015","In research, training and entertainment industries, simulators are used to replicate human perception of vehicle motion in a safe and customizable environment. The perception of self- motion of the driver inside the simulator is improved by the presence of motion cues generated by a motion system. However, direct feedthrough of these vehicle cues require movements of the system that exceed the physical capabilities of its actuators. Therefore, a control process must be realized that translates these movements, this is typically the objective of a motion cueing algorithm. In this thesis a Model Predictive Control (MPC) based cueing algorithm is developed which transforms simulated vehicle cues into motions exerted on a motion system, while maintaining a realistic driving experience. It balances a trade-off between the perception fidelity of the generated cues and the usage of workspace, where models of the vestibular system are used to simulate the driver’s perceived motions. One of MPC’s benefits is the use of a receding horizon principle, which is characterized by a repeated optimization of control actions over a future prediction interval. The algorithm uses a Single DOF Excursion (SDE) analysis to be aware of the available size of the workspace and adapts its generated cues accordingly. Hence, adaptive weights and constraints are applied in order to manage the motions within the changing workspace, where an adaptive converging constraints method finally matched the research objectives. This method is verified with different case studies, the robustness to different input signals, the washout of the workspace and the influence of known future vehicle motions on the response are investigated. Furthermore, the method is compared to cueing algorithms from both literature and industry. It shows a workspace washout with minimized motion perception, an accurate reference tracking for different input signals and a full exploitation of the workspace. Moreover, knowledge about the future vehicle accelerations resulted in an improvement of the reference tracking, a reduction in false cues and it triggered the use of preposition techniques. Finally, comparisons with acknowledged cueing algorithms show a less smooth response with spurious jerks, however larger onsets, better reference tracking, longer sustained accelerations, and more efficient workspace exploitations are observed for the MPC based method.","motion cueing algorithm; model predictive control; workspace management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); Lutgert, J. (mentor); Yavuz, F. (mentor)","2015","In the Netherlands, a significant number (25+) of small tight natural gas fields are stranded. They are classified, according to the PRMS definition, as ‘contingent resources’. The combination of low GIIP and low permeability currently do not allow these fields to be developed economically without stimulation, which is usually required to produce tight gas reservoirs. The recent change in legislation on hydraulic fracturing increases the need for a more cost effective and politically accepted alternative. Since natural gas has played, and will continue to play an important role in the energy security of the Netherlands, alternative methods are considered to extract these stranded resources. Radial jet drilling could be such an alternative method to develop these reservoirs in a cost effective, environmental friendly and socially acceptable manner. In this report, a numerical reservoir simulator is used to compare the production performance of a synthetic low permeable homogeneous reservoir based on three development options: a conventional vertical well, a vertical well stimulation through radial jet drilling and one case where the vertical well is stimulated through hydraulic fracturing. The static and dynamic models are based on typical tight gas reservoir properties as found in the Netherlands. The objectives are: to determine the operational scope / boundary conditions for the application potential of radial jet drilling, to identify the reservoir- and well variables that control the effectiveness and production performance, and to evaluate the economics. The comparison of the development option includes a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the well and reservoir performance and the impact it has on the economic viability. The simulations demonstrate that the laterals appear to be most effective in low permeable (~0.1 mD) reservoirs, reservoirs with near-well bore formation damage, with lower initial water saturation's, depleted reservoirs and thin reservoirs. The laterals appear less effective in more permeable reservoirs and reservoirs with high horizontal-to-vertical anisotropy. The application of small diameter laterals generally results in a recovery improvement factor of 2-3.5 compared to a vertical well. The initial gas production improves with a factor 4-7. The small diameter laterals become effective for reservoirs with permeabilities lower than 10 mD. In reservoirs with a permeability lower than 0.1 mD the application results in a recovery factor improvement of at least 2. The lateral length is the well design parameter that has the most profound impact on the recovery factor. The economics demonstrate that the onshore application of radial jet drilling as a stimulation method is economically feasible and robust whereas a vertical well is economically very marginal. The offshore application of radial jet drilling is only feasible for stranded volumes $>$ 1 BCM in combination with a re-entry scenario.","Radial Jet Drilling; Tight Gas Reservoirs; Production Performance; Simulation Approach; Economic Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

Due to the complexity of submarines the design is a long process. The interaction between the various systems on board means that late changes have a major impact on the design process resulting in an even longer gestation period. As a consequence the introduction of new technology, developed in the gestation period of the design must be halted well before the first submarine of a new design hits the water. Set-Based Design (SBD) is a design methodology where the design is kept flexible during the design process. By eliminating the worst solutions and keeping a set of best solutions, instead of the choosing only the best, the flexibility for changes in the requirements is accomplished. For applying SBD the following three principles must be used. 1. Mapping of the design space: Define feasible regions, explore trade-offs by designing multiple alternatives and communicate sets of possibilities. 2. Integrate by intersection: Look for intersection of feasible sets, impose minimum constraints and seek conceptual robustness. 3. Establish feasibility before commitment: Narrow sets gradually while increasing detail, stay within sets once committed and control by managing uncertainty at process gates. Because of the high complexity and the small design margins of the design process of submarines application of SBD could be beneficial. By keeping the design flexible the integration of all system can be done with a higher knowledge level. In a Point-based design process the influence of the manager is greatest when the best concept must be selected. After that decision the influence of the manager decreases because the design is fixed. This causes an inflexible design with limited changes in the design. With SBD the selection is delayed and the final concept is chosen at a later stage. This allows more management influence over the length of the process.","Set-Based Design; Submarine Design; Design Method; Ship Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","Design, Production and Operation - Ship Design","",""

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have considerable mobility benefits over ground robots, however they are currently only used for providing aerial views and often lack any manipulation capabilities, despite their proven ability to perform small force tasks. Research in ground robots has repeatedly stated that there is need for better human-machine interaction, while interface design for aerial robots is an unexplored area where generally primitive interfaces are used. The objective of this study is to understand what type of interface design is most beneficial for telemanipulation with a UAV. In a human factors experiment, subjects (N = 14) were instructed to open and flip a safety switch in a virtual reality environment using a bumper surrounding the UAV and to do so as fast and careful as possible. Five different interface designs were compared in this study. First, a 3 degrees-of-freedom (DoF) manipulator with position control was compared to the typical baseline interface: a gamepad with rate control. Second, the effect of having haptic feedback on the manipulator was tested. And finally performance on both the manipulator, with and without haptic feedback, was compared to having a fully actuated, grounded slave, with and without haptic feedback. Results show that a 3-DoF manipulator with position control substantially outperforms a gamepad with rate control. Haptic feedback had no significant influence on the task execution of the operator. Using a grounded slave was significantly more effective than using an aerial slave though there was no relative effect of haptic feedback between the grounded and the aerial slave. This study has shown that interface design can have a significant effect on performing remote manipulation tasks with UAVs.","aerial; telemanipulation; interface; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; haptics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-14","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Gangoli Rao, A. (mentor); Bhat, A. (mentor)","2015","Emission prediction is a complex problem involving the coupling between the flow field and chemistry. Most of the time CFD is the preferred modeling approach, yielding predictions with varying degrees of accuracy. But because of a high computational cost, CFD investigations are often limited to the use of reduced chemical mechanisms. In this work the specific features of chemical reactor networks are exploited to build a fast and reliable emission estimator. The main advantage of this modeling approach is a much lower computational cost than CFD, hence offering the potential for relatively fast predictions while allowing the use of detailed chemistry. This methodology has been applied to three different combustion systems, with mixed results. It may not be the most suitable modeling technique to obtain emissions from a lifted jet flame, but a successful estimator has been designed for flameless furnaces. It is based solely on analytical sub–models, giving it the potential to predict the emissions from any type of flameless furnace installation. For three different experimental setups, the correct trends were reproduced as well as the right order of magnitude for ??x and ?? emissions, if not within experimental measurements uncertainty. Finally the emissions from a lean-premixed gas turbine combustor burning cryogenic fuel have been successfully modeled and this investigation has brought out the major sensitivities of this system. Lastly, despite some promising results, several developments have been suggested to improve the accuracy and stability of the flameless furnace estimator. The combustor estimator, for one, can be used as basis to investigate the behavior of the more comprehensive hybrid combustion system it has originally been designed for: the dual combustion chamber of the AHEAD hybrid engine (Advanced Hybrid Engines for Aircraft Development).","emissions; reactor network; flameless combustion; Strong-Jet / Weak-Jet; lean premixed combustion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Sustainable Processes and Energy Technologies","",""

The small thickness of the photo-active layer in thin-film silicon solar cells is an advantage for reducing raw material consumption and increasing industrial throughput, but results in poor light absorption at long wavelengths. A textured back reflector is used to increase the absorption of light that would otherwise escape the solar cell. The aim of this project is to fabricate a high-performing back reflector by analysing the influence of its surface texture on the light scattered by it. A structure, called the optical stack, was fabricated on a wide range of random textures to compare the light absorption in a hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) absorber. The plasmonic absorption at the silver back reflector in the optical stack was observed by 3-D optical modelling, for different surface textures. A qualitative analysis of the absorption in the optical stack and the plasmonic absorption in the back reflector, identified textures that are promising for increasing the light absorption in a nc-Si:H solar cell. Better light scattering and increased short-circuit current density (Jsc), compared to the reference back reflector, was demonstrated using the selected back reflectors.","back reflector; nanocrystalline silicon; thin-film; light trapping; light management; random textures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor)","2015","Peer-to-peer networks are often large, collaborative networks where peers can join openly. The essence of a collaborative, distributed system is that every node performs tasks for other nodes. The peers often help in singular interactions and without direct reciprocity. Malicious peers can abuse and freeride the public goods. The network without countermeasures can fall into a tragedy of the commons where no one helps another and everyone takes advantage of the generosity of peers. Only when the reputation of a peer is publicly available at scale and peers trust this reputation can the network escape the problems of freeriding and attain high utility for all participants. This thesis focuses on designing and implementing the first step of a tamper proof reputation system within Tribler. Tribler is a peer-to-peer BitTorrent system developed at the Delft University of Technology. This first step, made by this thesis, is to create MultiChain, a proof-of-concept bookkeeping system. MultiChain tracks the upload and download amounts of peers to eliminate freeriding. Multi-Chain is cryptographically protected and validated. The bookkeeping system has to be scalable to be publicly available and be able to process enough transactions. The system has to work in an asynchronous network. A new design of a distributed data structure that can be used as a ledger is introduced by this thesis. This first step with MultiChain is already more resilient to tampering than previous work, like BarterCast. BarterCast has no security measures against tampering records. The design of MultiChain is to have a chain of blocks for every peer as a ledger. Peers are participants of a peer-to-peer network. A block contains a transaction between two peers. This block is shared and added to both chains. This makes both chains of the peers intertwined and entangled at a shared block. The proposed design abandons the typical global, full ledger. The protocol of creating these blocks between peers is described. The problems faced by MultiChain in an asynchronous network are explained. The thesis proposes how the design can overcome these problems by only allowing atomic operations to be performed on the chain and to introduce unfinished blocks in the chain. The implementation of the design is tested and experimented with within this thesis to validate it to work correctly. Furthermore, a number of weak points are discussed. These weak points have to be addressed in the future to create a tamper proof reputation system.","tribler; anonymity; reputation; digital currency; currency; peer-to-peer; p2p; MultiChain; collaboration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","PDS","","CS","",""

Disruption management is currently performed manually by dispatchers and can be improved by using dispatching support systems that can calculate optimal solutions using a model and information on the current condition of the network. In this thesis, an existing macroscopic constraint model for railway networks is extended to include the properties of a disruption. It is found that a disruption can be modelled in a constraint framework by an assignment problem that allocates arriving trains to planned departures. The assignment constraint model is further extended to include rolling stock actions that can be performed at stations to manage the disruption. The constraint model is applied in a mixed integer linear programming problem (MILP) that describes the rescheduling of railway traffic during a disruption. The objective of the MILP aims at minimizing the sum of delays and the number of cancelled trains in the network. A Matlab program is written to simulate disruption scenarios for a case study considering a full blockade at a track section in the south-west of the Dutch railway network. New feasible timetables for a horizon of two hours considering all trains in the network could be found within a minute. A model predictive control (MPC) scheme was developed and implemented in Matlab that can calculate and apply control actions on-line taking into account new delay information from the network. The resulting model predictive controller was used in the simulation of delay scenarios in combination with the disruption from the case study. Solutions for every instance could be found within half a minute, thereby proving the potential of a MPC approach for the management of railway networks during disturbances and disruptions.","railway rescheduling; mixed integer programming; disruption; model predictive control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","DCSC","","","",""

The Magdalena River near San Pablo experiences two major issues which are related to navigation and erosion. The major problem for inland navigation is the sharp bend of the Magdalena River at San Pablo, which has too small a radius, causing problems for navigation. Furthermore, there are some parts in the considered river reach where the water depth is insufficient according to the requirements for navigability. Regarding the erosion problem near San Pablo, the main driving force is assumed to be high flow velocities and large near-bank water depths due to spiral flow in the outer bend. The main flow passing by the river bank of San Pablo gradually takes soil particles away, resulting in a continuous erosion process. In addition, the developed steep slope and height of the river bank results in mass failure mechanisms, increasing the erosion problems even further in the future. Several possiblemeasures have been analysed to solve this navigational problem, such as river training works consisting of groynes, longitudinal dams and a spit, where the latter one consists of a land tongue and a longitudinal dam connected to it. Measures with an even bigger impact are also considered, such as a bend cut-off and a river bypass. There are several possible measures to solve the erosion problem, such as a revetment, groynes and geogrids. Both the navigability and erosion problem can be solved in an integral way by a combination of different measures. In this study five alternatives are proposed, which are groynes, a spit, longitudinal dams, a bend cut-off and a river bypass. With the help of a multi-criteria analysis the most promising alternatives have been selected, which showed the spit to be the best in terms of reducing erosion and increasing navigation possibilities. With the help of the Delft3D model the general up- and downstream consequences have been explored of the most promising alternatives. The large river training structures, such as longitudinal dams and a bend cut-off, do not result in the desired behaviour of the river reach. Therefore, it is not advised to completely restrict the river in its flow conditions since this in general leads to more difficulties as the restriction does not allow the river to get to its equilibrium within a short period of time. However, both the groynes and the spit pose fewer restrictions to the river flow and show large improvements of the current situation in terms of navigability and erosion. The groynes are especially successful in reducing erosion problems at the river bank of San Pablo. However, the spit is more effective in driving the main part of the flow through the current navigation channel, which results in a deeper and wider channel. Therefore, it is recommended to combine the spit and the groynes to obtain an integrated solution for both erosion and navigation problems. However, for both river training works, erosion problems are encountered downstream of San Pablo. This should be a major part of future research since problems should be solved instead of shifted up- or downstream.","Magdalena; River; Rio; San Pablo; Cormagdalena; Cirmag; Navigation; Erosion; Delft3D; river training","en","student report","TU Delft, sections Hydraulic Engineering and Water Management","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","7.476951, -73.922348"

(mentor)","2015","Great amounts of hazardous materials are transported both inside and outside the countries, either in a single-mode or multi-modal way. This situation, in combination with the dangerous nature of hazardous materials and the severe consequences of an accident involving them, consist the transportation of hazardous materials a complex problem for which decisions, which will also consider the aspect of safety, must be made. Thus, the involved stakeholders to the transportation of hazardous materials need to incorporate risk assessment into the decision-making processes related to the international and multi-modal hazardous materials transportation. This stands especially for shipping companies, which are the actual responsible for the coordination of transport activities of hazardous materials. So far, a great number of regulations have been developed that govern the transportation of hazardous materials and a great number of risk management practices are used, particularly by shipping companies, in order to reassure the safe transportation of dangerous cargoes. Nevertheless, the role of the above mentioned regulations or the way the different risk management practices are involved in the decision-making processes related to the transportation of hazardous materials is unknown. Hence, this research seeks to develop a safety concept that will facilitate shipping companies in their decision-making processes related to the multi-modal and international hazardous materials transportation, by identifying the relation between risk assessment methods and decisions that need to be made by shippers. To reach this objective the following research question has been developed: “What safety assessment concept facilitates the decision-making of international and multi-modal hazardous materials transportation by shippers?” In order to answer this research question, both a literature study and an empirical case study take place. The literature study seeks to define the decisions that are involved in the decision-making process of shippers related to hazardous materials transportation, the role of the regulations in this process, the risk assessment practices that are currently used by shipping companies along with important indicators to them when safety related to the transportation of dangerous substances is assessed. Regarding to the empirical case study the decision-making process of Liquefied Gases shipping companies with regard to Liquefied Petroleum Gas and Liquefied Natural Gas in the Netherlands and Belgium is researched, in order to identify the same elements as the literature study. After the conduct of both the desk research and the empirical case study, the data gathered are analyzed and the results led to the identification of four elements of the concept, namely, Type of the Decisions under consideration, Criteria employed to evaluate Acceptability of Decisions, Type of Risk Assessment Methods and Results, Input data, and Characteristics of the System under Consideration. Moreover, the relation among these elements is identified and the safety concept is developed and described. Finally the development of the concept is followed by its validation through a series of interviews with the shipping companies interviewed in the first place. The analysis of the feedback interviews resulted in the validation of the concept and also leads to the identification of other factors that are important to the decision-making under research. These factors are mainly restricted to economical aspects. Finally through the feedback interviews missing elements of the concept are identified, thus providing recommendations for the future development of the concept.","hazardous materials transportation; decision making; multi-modal transportation; international transportation; risk assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Safety & Security Science Group","","Management of Technology","",""

The increasing pressure on airlines to decrease fuel costs demands the design of more efficient aircraft. This requires aircraft manufacturing companies to design lighter structural components. The result is the need for more realistic and accurate modelling of critical structural components. Over the years, more powerful finite element discretization methods and improved numerical methods and programming techniques for dynamic analyses of structures have been introduced. Despite these advances and the increase in available computer power, the analysis of nonlinear dynamic problems is yet a computationally demanding task, implying it is very expensive. To reduce the computational time of nonlinear finite element analyses, reduction methods have been developed. These methods have as aim to reduce the number of degrees of freedom, while retaining sufficient accuracy of the solution.<br/><br/>Recently, a new reduction method, applicable to nonlinear static stability problems, has been developed at Delft University of Technology. The aim of this thesis is to extend the reduction method for statics to nonlinear dynamics. This is achieved by using the Hamiltonian formulation to describe the motion of a system. A reduced order model (ROM) is constructed for free vibrations, forced vibrations and damped vibrations, using Hamilton’s equations of motion. These are integrated to obtain the response of the ROM, in terms of displacements and momenta. The displacements of the full finite element model are computed by back-substituting the reduced response into the displacement expansion. The ROM is implemented in a finite element framework.<br/><br/>The ROM is applied to beams, to plates as well as to shells. Overall, good agreement is found between the ROM and Abaqus. The big advantage of the ROM is found when the computational times for beams and plates are compared to that of Abaqus. A drastic reduction in time is observed for the ROM, while still maintaining accurate results. The ROM thus saves valuable computational time.<br","Reduced order model; Nonlinear dynamics; Finite Element Method; Hamiltonian mechanics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Structures and Materials","",""

The report aims to analyze the profitability of cut flower transport using multimodal transport in short/medium-distance by building a time-dependent route choice model to choose an optimal route between the origin and the destination by comparing the route costs of multimodal and unimodal transport from the perspective of buyers of the FloraHolland Company. The first chapter introduces what and how the report is going to research the topic based on relevant studies having been done. The second chapter illustrates the background of the flower industry, including the introduction of different species of cut flower, the supply chain of rose of the cut flower and analysis of stakeholders of transport section of the supply chain. The problem statement, research objective, scope and research approach are demonstrated in chapter three. The report reviews the literature in freight planning, route choice approach, static and dynamic traffic models in chapter four. Time-dependent model is constructed in the fifth chapter, and the computational process of Matlab software is explained. Chapter six is a case study of the model. The input data of the case come from references, interviewing with stakeholders, Google map, and assumptions. Sensitivity analysis of constants is applied for validation. In the following analysis of the results of the case, the influences of factors of the model are analyzed. Then, an ideal scenario for multimodal is concluded from previous analyzes. The choice of departure time at the origin results in different schedule delay costs and different congestion level on the highway. Then, transport time of one route from the origin to the destination is changing with departure time. In the cost function of the model, transport time is an important variable.Thus, the choice of optimal route from the origin to the destination is changing with the choice of departure time. This deduction is simulated and analyzed in the case study. In the preliminary results of the case study, the time-dependent optimal routes are mainly in unimodal transport. The routes in multimodal transport can be the optimal choice when stakeholders introduce policies benefit to main modes of multimodal transport. In the conclusion of the report, multimodal transport is not more beneficial than unimodal transport for buyers from the initial results of the model which represents the current situation. However, multimodal transport can be profitability in flower industry from the perspective of buyers of the FloraHolland Company if the stakeholders formulate policies beneficial to multimodal transport.","multimodal and unimodal transport; time-dependent route choice model; flower industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime & Transport Technology","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Hendriks, B.H.W. (mentor)","2015","The aim of this graduation project is to assess the feasibility of the photonic technology called diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) to aid in intraoperative margin assessment with the goal of obtaining clear margins for liver, breast and soft tissue tumors. The idea is to integrate optical fibers in the existing and widely used electrosurgical knife, which consists of a pencil holder and a blade electrode. The work consists of workflow analyses and experiments. Based on the former the role of DRS in clinical practice can be specified. The main object of the experiments is to find out if DRS is still usable when a layer of coagulated tissue due to electrosurgical activity is present. Lumpectomy workflows using four techniques are investigated. For palpable tumors intraoperative ultrasound (US) and palpation are used, while non-palpable tumors require iodine seeds or placement of a guidewire. The most important limitations of current methods include: no information about the actual margin for iodine seeds and guidewire procedures, complex patient preparation, expertise required to understand US images and lack of reinforced learning for palpation. One advantage of all techniques is that they provide extra information, allowing the surgeon to create a more detailed mental image of the tumor. Ultrasound provides continuous information on the margin, while palpation is very intuitive. DRS integrated into the electrosurgical instrument provides distinct benefits in the local assessment phase, including direct feedback on whether or not to make a cut without losing information. DRS sensing should be directed forward, parallel to the axis of the pencil. In the experimental phase the shape and size of the tissue area influenced by electrosurgical treatment is inves- tigated first. It is found that layers of coagulation up to 1.4 mm may occur in surgery. Next, experiments are performed to identify the effect of coagulation on DRS spectra. Protein denaturation and reduced water con- tent are clearly visible in the diffuse reflectance spectra, resulting in a decreased slope and increased intensities of peaks in the near-infrared (NIR) range. Spectral alterations are severe, requiring further investigation using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Two-layered MC models that consist of coagulated tissue on top of normal tissue are build for coagulation up to 1.5 mm. Using the slope and peaks described above a predictive model is created, based on a sigmoid fit of these so-called predictors. Coagulation depth is predicted with R2 values up to 0.99, indicating a valid model. Two-layered MC models of normal and tumor tissue show that breast tumors can be detected up to 4 mm, liver tumors are visible at 2 mm and lipoma in skeletal muscle can be seen at 5 mm when the fiber distance (FD) = 6 mm. Finally, three-layered MC models of coagulated, normal and tumor tissue yield predictors that strongly differ from tissue without tumor presence. No predictive model for tumor depth is created. The results from this project show that accurate depth determination of coagulation is possible as well as sensing the presence of a tumor within the sensing zone. The latter ensures that DRS may bring at least the same qual- ities as iodine seeds and the guidewire. An important benefit is that DRS provides information on the complete margin, rather than a discrete point. Quantitative depth prediction is required to compete with intraoperative US for invasive tumors. Overall, it was shown that if DRS is successfully developed it can bring important benefits to clinical practice. The effect of tissue coagulation on diffuse reflectance spectra is large, but can be accounted for with a mathemat- ical predictive model. The next crucial step is further investigation of tumor depth sensing and investigation of a complete predictive model. The depth sensing requirements are only completely met for breast tumors. For liver resection, tumors are only detected up to 2 mm. This means that the desired 1 cm margin cannot be safeguarded with DRS. Close margins however are often accepted in clinical practice and do improve patient outcome. DRS integration should not be considered as a replacement for current margin assessment techniques but rather as a complement. Overall, integration of DRS into electrosurgical instruments seems promising. More research is required to see if DRS can truly perform in the OR.","diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; tumor margin; workflow; monte carlo; electrosurgery; coagulation; tissue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Bio-Inspired Design","",""

The project was initiated by the start-up Googreen as a means to explore suitable business opportunities for the company to enter the solar energy industry in the Netherlands. The findings of the extensive analyses of the current context, the trends and developments in the Dutch society have led to the emergence of a new context for the design: People’s energy replenishing moments and the selection of the target segment: the young professionals. After having investigated this new context and the defined target segment, an elaborate ideation and conceptualisation process was conducted and led to the design of Sunight. Sunight is basically a solar powered lighting fixture for the indoor environment with a DIY concept and modular system. The product can be easily mounted on surfaces such as the walls and ceilings or be used as a flexible and portable light source as well. In addition, Sunight is also equipped with a remote control function, allowing users to for instance turn the modules on or off with their smart devices. The current state of the design is still very conceptual. Further developments are needed to make the DIY construction as smooth as possible in order to minimise failure rates and to review if the construction now is strong enough or not. The current way to mount the light fixture on the walls is not optimal and should be studied further as well. After a rough cost price estimation, it is evident that the start-up should further examine the design to reduce the production costs.

The aim of this thesis is to create an aeroelastic model that can be used during the design phase of these rotor blade projects. An aeroelastic was created consisting of a Ritz-Hamilton structural model, a lifting line quasi steady aerodynamic model with two inflow models. The aeroelastic model includes effects due to centripetal and gravity forces and conservation of angular momentum. A fourth order Runge-Kutta integration method is used to numerically integrate the aeroelastic model to obtain the response of the system. The aeroelastic model was validated by comparing results calculated using the aeroelastic model with theoretical results and results obtained by measurements. A uniform beam and several rotor blades were modelled for this validation. The calculated steady state deflections and natural frequencies of the uniform beam were compared with values obtained from literature. The calculated steady state deflections and natural frequencies of the rotor blades were compared with values obtained from measurements on the rotor blades. The calculated drag for the rotor blades was compared with values obtained in a series of whirl tower tests. The predicted steady state response and natural frequencies of a uniform beam are very close the values from literature. The error for the steady state response and natural frequencies of a rotor blade is larger than that for the uniform beam. This error reduces if more elements are used. The power required predicted is higher than the power required measured at low angels of incidence and within the bounds of power required measured for high angles of incidence. Using this model KVE is able to predict initial loads, deflections and the consequences of changes in the design of their rotor blade.","rotor; blade; aeroelastic; modelling; aeroelasticity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-02-15","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

To keep ahead of competition in the future, It is vital for the company to figure out how to combine emerging digital technologies. Therefore, the goal of the graduation project was to research the current roles of human and technology services in customer experience in IKEA stores and design the in-store service which constructs redefined customer experience in the near future. In the beginning of the report, initial researches was introduced to understand the context of the project and formulate the assignment. Then field research was conducted,which applied a combination of qualitative research methods. There are interviews for customers, context mapping for co-workers and observations in store. The field research was targeted to understand the context of current service context and customer experience in store, and then figure out the relationships among human service, technology service and retail customer experience. The current service context and customer experience was illustrated into three info-graphics, including a customer’s and co-worker’s activities, their tools and devices, customer’s emotions and customer expectations. Last, the relationships were mapped out into the fourth info-graphic. Some context factors were selected, which came from initial researches and field research results, to formulate a design statement of customer experience in the near future. Base on the design statement, the interaction vision and design qualities of the future in-store service were generated. And then, strategy plan and tactical plans of in-store services were developed. Again, they were communicated in five visuals, including a service blueprint, two work flows and two storyboards. Finally, both research results and design results were evaluated with company and university mentor, and the influence of cultural variations was evaluated by two culture groups (Chinese and Dutch). In the future studies, it is recommended to study the customer experience of multiple channels at a time.

Accurate information about the expected downtime during a marine project is important information in the tender phase of such a project. The purpose of this thesis is therefore to give insight in the available methods for downtime analysis in different categories of marine operations and to examine the applicability of a new stochastic model to use in downtime simulations for complex projects. The proposed `modular Markov model' with linked Markov chains abstracts the actual metocean conditions by producing binary `workability sequences' for each operation (i.e. states representing whether a time step is `workable' or `not workable' given the operational limit of the operation). This model is able to generate workability sequences for individual operations and both coupled and uncoupled sequential operations, with operational limits determined by any number of metocean parameters. A small-scale validation on 6 operational limits and an application on a case-study project (offshore wind farm foundation installation) showed that workability sequences of individual operations are described realistically (i.e. including seasonality and persistency) and that the model yields promising results for it to be suitable to analyse the downtime risk of complex marine projects. It is however recommended that the validation is extended and that an uncertainty analysis is performed (to quantify the parametric and model uncertainty).","downtime analysis; marine operation; marine project; operational limit; sequential operations; parallel operations; workability sequence; Markov chain; linked Markov chains; offshore wind farm; simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-12-11","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","Jet impingement is a subject of extensive research over the years due to its industrial importance and the fundamental physics of heat transfer and turbulence. These jets generate high heat transfer rates with better uniformity on the surface which is to be heated or cooled compared to other heat transfer techniques. However, to study the flow phenomenon and heat transfer rates, conducting experiments overtime for change in design has become expensive. Hence, to reduce the cost and time, the best possible way to study the jets behavior is to perform numerical simulations. With numerical simulations, one can predict the flow physics inside the domain, which is difficult to obtain from the experiments. In the recent times, there have been tremendous developments in terms of computation power and numerical models that have proved to produce good and accurate results for many applications. With these approaches, the flow characteristics can be studied in depth at each and every time step which provides better understanding about the jets behavior inside the array. However, these new models have to be tested and should be compared with experimental data to see how good these approaches can fit with the experimental results. Moreover, Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) have not been carried out in the past to investigate the flow features in an impinging jet array. So, this master thesis is focused on performing LES and Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes Simulations (URANS) for multiple impinging jets and validate these CFD results with the experimental data. The primary objective of the thesis is to predict the pressure drop characteristics across the nozzles and the flow channel as the pressure drop directly affects the efficiency of the system. Simulations with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) is a good method to analyze these quantities, but it was found that through RANS approach, the results obtained from CFD simulations are over predicted than the experimental values and this deviation increases with increase in Reynolds number. So to analyze these quantities, transient simulations are performed to predict the flow physics and heat transfer characteristics. From the unsteady RANS and large eddy simulations, it was understood that the major pressure loss oc- curs inside the nozzles and due to contraction effect at the nozzle’s inlet. It was also observed that inside the nozzles the pressure drop occurs differently for the particles near the wall and particles which are in the mean flow. The pressure drop values obtained from the CFD simulations are validated with the analytical and experimental results. It was found that, the results are in good agreement with the analytical results. Fur- thermore, the heat transfer characteristics obtained from these transient simulations also show a substantial improvement compared to RANS models. The deviation in the results were found to vary between 7% - 10%. To study the effect of geometrical parameters on the heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics, a sensitivity analysis was performed by varying the nozzle to plate distance and hole diameter. It was noticed that, with the change in nozzle diameter by 10 microns, the total pressure drop of the impingement system is affected significantly. Therefore, when designing these precision systems, it is important to manufacture them accurately as, a minor change in the jet diameter would affect the system performance on a large scale. Finally, It can be concluded that, the unsteady RANS simulations would be a good approach to study the heat transfer characteristics and flow physics inside the array. However, it would be a difficult task for any turbulence model to accurately predict the pressure drop characteristics in the impinging array, as the pressure drop inside the array is extremely sensitive with the change in geometrical parameters.","LES; Jet Impingement; Unsteady RANS; CFD; Multiple jets","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); Dachwald, B. (mentor)","2015","Solar sails are big and lightweight structures that exploit the radiation from the Sun to propel the vehicle. They are very different from usual satellites since they yield a large moment of inertia, highly flexible parts and coupled attitude dynamics, orbital dynamics and structural vibrations. To these days studies that confirm the importance of investigating the elasticity of the sail in gossamer structures are available, but a full dynamics modeling that considers the coupling among the structural elasticity, orbital motion and attitude motion is still absent. The thesis is going to cover this subject. The thesis concentrates on Gossamer-1, a technology demonstrator that aims to test the deployment mechanism of a sail in LEO. To keep the satellite as light, simple and cheap as possible, no ADCS is mounted. The main question is then whether a completely arbitrary initial attitude and rotation will ensure that the sail can indeed complete its mission or whether there are some configurations to avoid. Within this work, the structural coupling is tested by means of a 3D model for the sail, to understand whether the modelling of the elasticity is necessary or negligible. To obtain significant results a 6-DoF model has been considered with drag, SRP, J2 and gravity gradient as perturbations. A grid search technique is used to investigate different initial values for the rotational behavior. There are three main results to be underlined from the outputs of the simulation: the non-negligible influence of the elastic behavior of the sail on the rotational motion of the satellite, the rotational rate evolution during de-orbit and the lifetime of the satellite that underlines the presence of a region of initial values that prevents the sail from re-entering in a small amount of time. Finally the problem of the self-shadowing, given the concave shape of the structure, is also addressed. Lastly, non-nominal deployment of the sail, resulting in particular shapes is also analysed to understand the influence of the shape on the satellite motion.","Gossamer; Elastic; Attitude and Orbital motion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Astrodynamics and Space Missions","","","",""

In a previous study initiated by the UMC Utrecht 85% of the patients got at least one pin tract infection during this treatment. A pin tract infection is caused by bacteria (mainly staphylococci) that form a biofilm on the surface of the external fixation pin. Currently, antibiotics are used to treat pin tract infections. High doses of antibiotics are needed to resolve a biofilm. Prevention of biofilm development is necessary to minimize the antibiotic use. The literature suggested that a small electric current could have an influence on the biofilm formation and therewith the chance of infection. The first aim of this study was to investigate the effect of three different current heights (20, 100 and 500 µA) on the bacteria on the surface of external fixation pins. The secondary aim was to develop a wearable device for the knee joint distraction treatment that could deliver this current to the pin tract. Results from the experiments showed that: it was possible to form a starting biofilm in 24 hours with Staphylococcus aureus on an external fixation pin and an electric current decreases the amount of viable bacteria on the pin and in the fluid surrounding it. The amplitude of the current had an influence on the extent to which the bacteria were killed. The ratio of viable bacteria on the surface of the anode pins was: 1 out of 18 (20 µA), 1 out of 200 (100 µA) and 1 out of 11 (500 µA). On the surface of the cathode pins this was: the same as control (20 µA), 1 out of 12 (100 µA) and zero (500 µA). In the fluids the ratio of viable bacteria were: 1 out of 9 (20 µA), 1 out of 10.000 (100 µA) and 1 out of 100.000 (500 µA). A different process was observed on the anode pins than on the cathode pins. A current of 500 µA was used in the developed prototypes of a wearable device. One of the two prototypes tested in-vitro, successfully killed bacteria and prevented biofilm formation on the surface of the external fixator pins. The developed wearable device has the potential to make pin tract infection a rare complication during the use of external fixation for the knee joint distraction treatment.","pin; tract; infection; prevention; external fixation; electricity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Biomechanical Design","",""

Tandem offloading is an offloading principle that is widely used and tandem offloading does not require additional components what is the case with offloading with the use of a remote buoy. However tandem offloading is vulnerable for safety hazards, one of these safety hazards are squalls. Squalls are rapidly changing wind events. Squalls begin suddenly with an increase in wind speed and a change in wind direction and have often a duration of around 30 minutes. Furthermore squalls are very difficult to forecast. In a squall event the offloading has to proceed because proper disconnection takes multiple hours. Therefore is it crucial to know what the responses of the tanker will be during tandem offloading in a squall and which of the different parameters will have an effect on the responses. Furthermore because the FPSO and the tanker are positioned in close proximity it is important to understand what the effect and the consequence will be of the interaction of wind and waves between the two vessels.","offloading; squall; interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore Engineering","","","",""

This is an assignment of Van Oord Dredging and Marine Contractors BV. An analytical model has been developed to simulate the upending of a monopile in MapleTM, based on the general theoretical principles and the experience of Van Oord. An experiment was then done to validate the analytical model. The MapleTM script can be used to calculate the forces of the crane for future projects. The monopile, sealed with two end-caps, is towed by a tugboat from the storage site to the installation site and is then upended by the jack-up vessel of Van Oord, the Aeolus. The end-caps guarantee buoyancy during transport and upending. After upending the end-caps are removed, either internally or externally. A conceptual design has been developed for both removal methods. With upending the vertical position of the monopile can be reached with a nett weight of the pile greater than the safe working load of the crane using the buoyant force. The minimum draught needed for the buoyant force to remain within the safe working load of the crane, determines the minimum hydrostatic pressure needed for the external removal of the bottom-cap. The top-cap can only be removed once the pile has been placed on the seabed, since the buoyant force is the auxiliary of the crane. As shown in figure 1, the upending of the monopile is performed, by vertically displacing the connection point between the pile and the crane. Because the crane hook is attached to the pile with a hinge, the monopile can rotate freely around this point. For the analytical model in MapleTM it is assumed that the upending process is quasi-static because the influence of the inertia is negligible. The experiment has confirmed that the inertia may indeed be neglected by showing the similarity between two scaled upending tests at different continuous hoisting velocities and the corresponding quasi-static simulation. Therefore the scaled upending correlates to the quasi-static model. It is found that, only when the lifting starts and stops, and respectively the acceleration and deceleration are relatively large, the inertia influences the upending process. Further research to refine the upending process, as well as the design of the end-caps is recommended. The hoisting speed of the crane can be optimized if the expectations of the experiment and the analytical model are confirmed in practice. The design depends on the airflow when releasing the end-cap and the internal pressure when lowering the pile towards the seabed. The internal pressure can be controlled using a pressure valve. These recommendations will lead to the optimized upending process of monopiles for offshore wind turbine foundations that are transported by towage using end-caps.","offshore; monopile; foundation; upending; installation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","Bottom Founded Structures","",""

Apart from the complex numerical models for masonry and the effect of earthquake loading on these structures, a lot of research is currently performed on the soil properties and its effect on the wave propagation. However, the influence of these human induced earthquakes on pile foundations and an easy and time efficient FEM calculation method is not yet available or well described in Dutch literature. There are several ways of approximating the soil-pile behaviour during an earthquake. The main one, which is also applied in this master thesis, is by performing 2D FEM analyses on the soil and subsequently the pile behaviour. In this aspect a study on the possibilities and limitations of the embedded beam (row) within PLAXIS 2D will be performed. Static pushover analysis, free field site response analysis of the Groningen situation and the kinematic loading of the embedded pile will be addressed. The embedded beam (row) within PLAXIS 2D is in fact a 2.5D situation, where the pile (or beam) is connected to the soil elements of the FEM by special interfaces. These interfaces (springs) are defined by the interface stiffness factor, which are determined and validated in previous master thesis projects for mostly axial loading. They depend mainly on the pile to pile distance specified for the embedded beam. In the latest version of PLAXIS (2015) a limiting lateral soil resistance can be defined. With this option, plastic behaviour is now incorporated into the 2D pile behaviour. This should give a better approximation of the pile response when compared to 3D calculations or measurements. Based on soil investigation from Groningen, a silty clay layer was defined and used as a one layered soil profile of 20 m depth. During an earthquake, the soil behaviour is assumed to be undrained. In order to define the right effective strength parameters for this model, based on the undrained shear strength, a small investigation was performed. The results from the static pushover analyses were compared with a 3D volume pile in PLAXIS and D-Pile Group calculations. From this comparison the best way of specifying the limiting lateral soil resistance for this thesis was determined. It also became evident that the default lateral interface stiffness factor should be improved, either by making it stress or strain dependent. Based on KNMI data, which is the Royal Netherlands Meteorological institute, a deconvolution and scaling of the Huizinge earthquake signal was performed based on reports from amongst other Deltares. This signal was then used for the free field site response analysis in both EERA and PLAXIS. After the implementation of the earthquake loading in the PLAXIS model, the behaviour of the embedded beam was evaluated and compared to analytical design methods for kinematic bending moments and pseudo-static calculations with both D-Sheet Piling and PLAXIS 2D. Also the cyclic loading behaviour of the embedded beam in comparison with the 3D volume pile was elaborated. The main conclusion of this thesis is that the embedded beam (row) in 2D does show capabilities for modelling (dynamic) lateral loaded pile behaviour. However, the option of the limiting lateral soil resistance should be optimized in combination with an alternative way of defining the interface stiffness factors. The plastic behaviour of the pile-soil system should be improved of the embedded beam(row) in order to show similar damping behaviour as was obtained in 3D.","earthquakes; PLAXIS; 2D Pile modelling; Embedded beam (row)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2015","Methane is a promising propellant for future liquid rocket engines. In the cooling channels of a regeneratively cooled engine, it would be close to the critical point. This results in drastic changes in the fluid properties, which makes cooling analysis a challenge. This thesis describes a two-pronged approach to tackle this problem. Simple and fast engineering tools allow for the development of insight in the design space using rapid iterations and parametric analyses. However, they are often rather inaccurate. In contrast, detailed multi-dimensional tools for numerical analysis are more accurate, but they require more computation time. Both approaches are developed for the analysis of regenerative cooling channels of oxygen/methane engines. Each approach uses complex but accurate models for the thermodynamic and transport properties of methane. OMECA (short for One-dimensional Methane Engine Cooling Analysis) is a one-dimensional tool that was developed in Python from scratch. This tool divides a nozzle into stations and analyses the one-dimensional thermal equilibrium at each station. It makes extensive use of semi-empirical equations to calculate the heat transfer at both the hot gas side and the coolant side. The tool is compared to a coupled multi-physics analysis tool, showing that the accuracy of the wall temperature is rather poor, with discrepancies of up to 150~K. Both at the hot gas and coolant side, large deviations are present. However, if the input heat flux is correct, OMECA predicts the coolant pressure drop and temperature rise with a 10% accuracy. To obtain a higher accuracy at the coolant side, the open-source CFD package OpenFOAM is adapted for analysis of supercritical methane. Of particular note is the custom library that interpolates the fluid property tables at runtime. The selected solver is applicable to steady-state compressible flows. The software is then systematically validated using three validation cases. With experimental validation data obtained through cooperation with CIRA, an accuracy of 15 K for the wall temperature prediction is demonstrated. The pressure drop is predicted within 10%. Traditionally, the launcher industry uses copper alloys as wall material in regeneratively cooled combustion chambers. They offer a high allowable temperature and high thermal conductivity, but are also heavy and expensive. Recently, several companies have demonstrated aluminium combustion chambers. Aluminium alloys have weight and cost advantages, but have lower allowable temperature and thermal conductivity. The developed tools for cooling analysis are therefore employed to compare aluminium and copper for a generic 10~kN combustion chamber. It is discovered that a thermal barrier coating must be employed to protect the hot gas side of an aluminium combustion chamber, otherwise regenerative cooling is not feasible. Even with such a coating, the pressure drop required to cool the coated aluminium chamber is three times higher than the pressure drop required for a copper chamber. A difference in pressure drop has effects on the vehicle level. A larger pressure drop in the cooling channel of a rocket engine necessitates a higher feed pressure. For a pressure fed engine, this means the tank must be stronger and heavier. It is found that even at modest fuel mass, the increase in tank mass is eight times as large as the decrease in engine mass offered by aluminium. This shows that using aluminium for the chamber wall is not advantageous with respect to copper for a pressure fed, regeneratively cooled, oxygen/methane rocket engine.","rocket engine; regenerative cooling; methane; CFD; OpenFOAM; aluminium; copper","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Space Systems Engineering","",""

In order to fit the prosthetic components, the bones are shaped by making bone cuts. Patient specific surgical guides (PSSGs) are guides made from CT or MRI images to fit the patient’s anatomy. They guide the bone cuts. When bone deviations disturb the fit, commercially available PSSGs cannot be adjusted. Our goal is to design a reusable PSSG for TKA which can be configured for a planned alignment and corrected during surgery when unplanned bone deviations occur. Concepts for the functional problems are developed and combined into a final design consisting of three components: the guide, contact points and setting tool. The setting tool configures the contact points. The contact points are magnetically fixated to the guide’s base and can be removed when the fit is disturbed. Pins protrude from the contact points, indicating contact with the bone to evaluate the fit. We assess the ability of inexperienced and experienced subjects to recognize surface disturbances using the protruding pins. Subjects position the guide and are tasked to recognize if and where disturbances occur. With inexperienced users, the disturbed contact point is correctly recognized for 7 out of 26 disturbed experiments. A significant increase is found in the rotational error for placements with a disturbance. No significant increase is found for the translational error. With experienced users, the disturbed contact point is correctly recognized for 18 out of 26 disturbed experiments. No significant increase is found in the rotational and translational error for placements with a disturbance. Inexperienced users cannot recognize disturbances and reconfigure the guide. Experienced users can better recognize disturbances and reconfigure the guide. When disturbances were not correctly recognized by experienced users, the disturbance had only a small effect on the alignment. We recommend to correct the perceived backlash of the contact points and stiffen the guide design. Training of the test subjects is suggested when new experiments are performed.","TKA; knee; arthroplasty; patient specific; guide; configurable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-10","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor)","2015","Rapid and substantial voltage changes can occur in distribution networks with a high pen- etration of photovoltaic (PV) systems, due to their unpredictable nature. Electronic power inverters are capable of delivering fast reactive power support to maintain customer voltages within operating tolerances and reduce system losses in distribution feeders. While optimization based paradigms have been proposed to control the reactive power output of inverters, these methods typically rely on the presence of an extensive and fast communication infrastructure which is currently not in place and would be expensive to build. On the other hand, approaches that utilize completely local data require the design of a relation between local measurements and inverter output (i.e. a Volt-VAr curve). These relationships are often naively designed and typically do not yield optimal results. In this work, a systematic and data driven approach is presented to determine PV inverter output as a function of locally obtained measurements in a manner that obtains near optimal results. First, a network model and historic information are used to compute globally optimal settings a posteriori for all controllable inverters in the network. Subsequently, a regression approach is used to find a function for each inverter that maps the solely local historical data to an approximation of the globally optimal inverter output. The resulting functions are then employed as decentralized controllers of the inverters and approximate the globally optimal reactive power outputs based on local measurements only. Simulation results on real feeder models demonstrate that this method achieves near optimal results when performing voltage- and capacity-constrained loss minimization and voltage flattening. This method paves the way to an efficient voltage optimization scheme in which legacy control equipment collaborates with existing inverters to facilitate safe operation of distribution networks with higher levels of distributed generation.","Inverter control; Grid integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems and Control","",""

(mentor)","2015","Optimization in the mining industry is often only done on a discontinuous and long-term basis. The RTRO-Coal project aims to improve the mining efficiency by introducing a continuous optimization cycle. As a part of the RTRO-Coal project, an experimental simulation model, validated in the lab (TRL 4), for short-term mine optimization was developed. In the first part of this research, the experimental simulation model is extended and validated. Before validating the simulation model, historical production data from the Profen open-pit coalmine in Germany is analysed and processed for simulation model calibration and benchmarking during the validation. The simulation model input parameters, such as resource model, excavator digging rates, excavator scheduling and stochastic failure data are derived and calculated from this historical data. To prepare the simulation model for usage with an optimizer, the simulation model is embedded in a framework with an interface to the simulation controller, which sends the input parameters to the simulation model and processes the results. With the simulation parameters set up, a validation strategy is developed and three experimental setups are set up with varying parameters to validate the model and establish its accuracy under various circumstances. The three experiments show that while the simulation model generally provides a good match with the reality when its parameters are derived from historical data, it deviates from the reality when these parameters are replaced with stochastic variables. Especially the equipment failures are shown to vary greatly between the considered experiment scenarios, which makes it hard to model them without increasing the uncertainty. While this causes the model to deviate on a daily level, over a longer period the predicted production matches the reality relatively well. By validating and demonstrating the simulation model in the industrially relevant environment, TRL 6 is achieved. The second part of the research focusses on simulation based optimization using the verified simulation model. Several algorithms are considered that meet the required conditions for the computationally expensive simulation model and the large solution space. The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for optimization are decided and a penalty function which calculates the input parameter fitness based on the simulation model results is defined. For two optimization algorithms, a Simulated Annealing and a Genetic Algorithm, custom implementations are developed based on the desired properties of the optimizer considering optimization time and convergence speed. The performance of the two developed algorithms is examined by running several experimental optimizations with different configurations. Because these experiments show that the Simulated Annealing has better performance on a local scale and the Genetic Algorithm on a global scale, a hybrid Genetic and Simulated Annealing algorithm is developed which combines both methods to an algorithm that is able to find a good solution in a reasonable time given the complex optimization problem. It is thus concluded that simulation based optimization can increase the efficiency of a continuous mining operation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Resource Engineering","",""

(mentor); Vink, P. (mentor)","2015","Growing passenger dimensions and the demand for more comfort in the economy class cabin is a trend that is becoming more important during aircraft conceptual design. Based on recent investigations, it is known that current aircraft seat dimensions are not suitable and safe for a large part of the world population. Therefore, a change in aircraft conceptual design thinking, by taking human anthropometry into account, is required. This thesis investigates the opportunity to change the aircraft during conceptual design as well as the opportunity to change current aircraft in order to provide a higher level of passenger comfort and safety. To measure the latter, a comfort model is created, based on scientific research and human dimensions, allowing for the measurement of comfort related to seating configurations, seat characteristics, and cabin dimensions. By establishing the ideal seat dimensions, it is shown that conceptual aircraft designs for the worldwide 95 percentile passenger require wider, but shorter, fuselages. Using the Initiator as a conceptual design tool, four short-haul and four long-haul aircraft are modeled for a range of seat dimensions. Based on an inside-out aircraft design approach, it is shown that similar aircraft performance characteristics are obtained when designing for the worldwide 95 passenger percentile. Moreover, a similar level of direct operating costs, and hence profitability, is attained. However, designing for the worldwide 99 passenger percentile yields considerably higher fuel burn rates and operating costs. An average increase of 3.9 % among all modeled aircraft is seen for the harmonic fuel burn, leading to an increase of 4.2 % in direct operating costs. Considering existing aircraft, use is made of an outside-in aircraft design approach to assess a set of performance characteristics. Based on an average utilization of 37 % of the cargo space in commercial transport aircraft, a potential is shown for a different utilization of the aircraft lower deck, allowing the airline to provide more passenger comfort while retaining a similar level of profitability. Using the Airbus A340-300 as reference aircraft, it is shown that the placement of passengers in the lower hold is feasible from a regulatory, ergonomical, economical, and structural point of view. Based on a reference three-class layout with 267 passengers, it is shown that a lower deck seating compartment provides an increase of 14.6 % in the number of passengers when similar seat properties are used as on the main passenger deck. The installment of additional furnishing and required structural reinforcements results in a decrease of 12 % in maximum structural payload weight. Nevertheless, it is shown that the placement of passengers in the lower deck yields higher profitability rates for the airline when compared to the carriage of additional freight. Secondly, the placement of lavatories and galleys in the aircraft lower deck is investigated, allowing for a maximum increase of 13 % in passenger seats. To allow for the installment of galley lift systems, staircases, and required safety measures, a decrease of 6.27 % in maximum structural payload is attained. By subsequently increasing seat characteristics on the main deck, an increase of 12 % in passenger comfort is achieved for the worldwide 95 passenger percentile. The airline profitability level associated to this comfort layout in turn relates to an average carriage of 5300 kg of freight during the aircraft service life, being equal to the current average. For both the lower deck seating and service utilization, it is concluded that the flying experience of the passenger is increased, while a similar level of airline and manufacturer profitability is obtained. Aircraft lower deck utilization can therefore be seen as a feasible replacement for conventional aircraft configurations.","lower deck; passenger comfort; comfort model; aircraft; wide-body","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Meer, F.P. (mentor); Aragon, A.M. (mentor)","2015","Recent advancements in computational methods has led to improvements in the computational modeling of tensile failure of composite laminates. Models for compressive failure however, have not yet reached the same level of maturity. Particularly in the case of fiber kinking there is a need for improved modeling techniques. Fiber kinking occurs when fiber imperfection combined with matrix failure lead to localized deformation in a band of finite width (kink bands). Current computational models have focused on micro-level, where matrix and fibers are modeled independently. The various experimental and analytical research on fiber kinking has lead to numerous failure criteria and analytical models for kink bands. The collapse response of kink bands however, has yet to be incorporated in a meso-level computational model. A step is required to translate these micro-mechanical and analytical models to a meso-level framework and improve the state of the art of compressive failure modeling of composite laminates. In this thesis an attempt is made at transitioning from a micro to a meso-level failure model for fiber kinking. A discontinuous approach is proposed for modeling kink bands. The kink bands are represented as strong discontinuities in the displacement field using the phantom node method. With this method the angle of failure propagation can be easily controlled. The discontinuities are introduced after violation of a stress-based failure criterion and therefore necessitates the use of an initially rigid cohesive law to incorporate the kink band response. To construct such a law a shifted formulation is used, meaning, the law is derived with a finite initial stiffness and shifted to achieve the initially rigid behavior. Strong discontinuity analysis and a discrete micro-mechanical model are used to derive two separate cohesive models in the local kink band coordinate frame, while a simplified approach is also applied to derive a third model in the discontinuity coordinate frame. The nonlinear characteristics and bifurcation of the models necessitate the use of a capable solution algorithm that will follow the true equilibrium path. Therefore the crack opening displacement arclength method is used to; indirectly control direction of crack growth, pass the bifurcation point and capture possible snap-back behavior. Additionally an adaptive time stepping strategy is applied to increase efficiency and robustness. The model and algorithm have been implemented in a one dimensional framework using Timoshenko beam elements and verified against an analytical solution. The local models have shown to capture the trends derived using the analytical solution well, with the strong discontinuity model being the most accurate. The simplified approach however fails to properly account for these trends. The current work has resulted in an initial step towards a meso-level computational model of fiber kinking. It is shown that the discontinuous approach provides a good representation of kink bands provided that a proper cohesive model is used that incorporates both material and geometrical parameters influencing kink bands.","Fiber Kinking; Composite Laminates; Kink Band; Phantom Node Method; Computational Modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Mechanics","",""

(mentor)","2015","Hydrological models are used for several purposes, from reservoir management to stormflow prediction. However, their predictive power is often questionable. As most rainfall-runoff models are highly dependent on calibration, models often show deteriorated performance during the validation period. This is caused by too much focus on and trust in the model calibration. But to get the right answers for the right reasons, a different approach is necessary. Earlier research showed that automated model calibration should be balanced with a more expert-knowledge-driven strategy of constraining models. Therefore, the following research question is the main subject of this thesis: “How do model complexity and expert-knowledge influence consistency and realism in a conceptual rainfall-runoff model?” The hypothesis is that more consistency and a more realistic catchment representation can be achieved by increasing the complexity of the model, counter-balanced by adding constraints. Increasing model complexity makes it possible to implement additional dominant hydrological processes in a model. The constraints make it possible to eliminate unrealistic parameter sets and parameter sets leading to unrealistic model behaviour. This is expected to lead to more consistency and improved realism of the processes. Besides evaluating models in terms of calibration objective functions only, hydrological signatures are used. These signatures show the ability of the models to reproduce specific hydrological behaviour of the catchment. Four European catchments are studied in this thesis, of which one catchment is located in Germany, one in Sweden and two in Italy. These catchments all have different characteristics, varying from a relatively flat catchment with large areas of grassland and pastures, to mountainous catchments with large areas of forest. Several models are developed and applied to each catchment. The results show that even though improvements are not always directly clear from the calibrated objective functions, in some cases the models have an increased ability to reproduce specific hydrological signatures. This thesis shows that by increasing model complexity, together with the addition of parameter and process constraints, more plausible model results can be obtained. The approach used in this research makes it possible to obtain a model which behaves well according to the modellers’ perception of the catchment. Besides, the constraints have a constraining effect on the possible parameter space and therefore, reducing the effects of equifinality. The results show that evaluating a model based on calibration performance solely is insufficient. Hydrological signatures give useful information about specific strengths and weaknesses of a model and should be also taken into account during hydrological research.?","hydrological signatures; realism; conceptual model; consistency; objective functions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor)","2015","Around 1610 Galileo Galilei made his discovery of the four large moons orbiting Jupiter which are referred to now as the Galilean moons. The moons Europa and Ganymede attract a significant amount of scientific interest due to potential present subsurface oceans. As consequence, the design of missions to go there and explore the moon system are increasing. This culminated in the sixth edition of the Global Trajectory Optimisation Competition (GTOC6) which is focussed on solving low-thrust multiple gravity-assist trajectories to map the Galilean moons. The aim of the thesis is to understand the complexity of the GTOC6 problem and to explore and evaluate the quality of various optimisation strategies to solve flyby sequences with low-thrust arcs. First, insight to the complexity of the problem was gained by analysing the best solution to GTOC6 so far by the Chinese Centre for Space Utilisation (CSU). From the results a clear picture was drawn from what the trajectory model should be capable of. The low-thrust trajectory model is based on the spherical shaping method that is part of the Tudat astrodynamics toolbox. A full analysis of the shaping method was performed to identify the capabilities and shortcomings of the algorithm. One of the main shortcomings is the limited accuracy for trajectories where the departure and arrival conditions differ with several degrees and more for the right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN). For optimisation use was made of differential evolution (DE). An extensive test was performed to determine the optimal settings. The result was that defining the control parameters randomly during the evolution was the best option with respect to quality and convergence. What followed was defining the optimisation model for a variable number of flybys. Furthermore, a framework was developed with six different optimisation strategies. A sequence of maximum five flybys was set to test the strategies. The strategies define the amount of freedom around the epochs of the flybys for the optimisation. Also the number of flybys that are influenced by this freedom is defined by the strategy. The goal was to optimise for ?V for a main sequence of five flybys. Here the main sequence was divided into smaller problems (subsets with less flybys). The optimisation of the main sequence was guided by the solutions of the preceding smaller subsets. Results showed that the initial subset of two flybys did not influence the optimisation of the subsequent subsets at all. Furthermore, two sequences were tested. The first sequence showed large ?V due to thrust constraint violations and limited accuracy of the spherical shaping method. On the other hand the second sequence showed ballistic solutions to go through all five moons in the sequence. Finally, from the previous test resulted an optimal strategy that was applied to a sub-problem of GTOC6. Optimisation was set to map the most interesting surfaces of the moons and to minimise ?V. The resulting trajectories were able to map the surfaces of interest. However, at the cost of more ?V compared to the previous test which only optimised for ?V.","low thrust; shape-based method; spherical shaping; multiple gravity assist; flyby; interplanetary mission; GTOC6; optimisation strategies; Global Trajectory Optimisation Competition; Differential Evolution; Galilean moons; moon mapping; trajectory design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Astrodynamics and Space Missions","","Space Exploration","",""

(mentor); Van der Schrieck, G.L.M. (mentor); Miedema, S.A. (mentor); Kollen, J. (mentor)","2015","There are many locations where the accumulation of mud poses a problem. In lakes it can have a negative influence on the ecological situation and in port basins it can hinder traffic. Usually these mud deposits are removed periodically with regular dredging vessels. Looking at the continuous nature of the mud deposition and at the trend of an increasing autonomy of machines, an interesting question is whether and how this mud can be removed by autonomous dredgers. A literature study on dredging processes and their application in both existing and conceptual machines was conducted to find potential solutions. The most viable concept is based on water injection dredging (WID), which is a dredging technology that uses water jets to fluidize the soil. This is done by injecting a high volume of water at a low pressure into the soil. The created soil-water mixture flows away under the force of gravity. A model was set up to describe the full WID process. In this model parts of available models are combined with new insights and approximations. Firstly, the jetting and loosening of mud is described. The jet intrusion depth is estimated using a perpendicular intrusion model. It is assumed that a jet intrudes into the soil up to a depth where the thrust pressure is equal to about 6 times the cohesion of the soil. Using the hauling velocity of the dredge the discharge, density and velocity of the mixture are estimated. Secondly, a transition from a supercritical to a subcritical flow takes place. In previous reports it was thought that entrainment and a hydraulic jump take place after the jetting process, although these effects are not clearly visible in experiments. Probably the only way to get more insight into the processes at this location is advanced fluid modelling. Therefore, the previously used methods to calculate entrainment and the hydraulic jump are not applied in this report. Since it can be assumed that at least some entrainment takes place during this phase, a multiplication factor is applied on the jet discharge to model the entrainment of water. The third and last sub process deals with the outflow of the density current. To come to an estimation for the travel distance of the density current, the Chézy formulation is applied, altered with a term to account for the reduced effect of gravity under water. Using an estimation for the settlement velocity, the decrease of mud discharge is taken into account. This gives reasonable results for the properties of the density current and the distance over which this current propagates. For the AWID (autonomous WID) device itself several options for the propulsion, energy supply and form factor have been considered. A small and floating device seems to be the most realistic. A device with a jet beam of 4 m, 500 kW installed power, a 2000 kWh battery pack and therefore a working time of four hours is a realistic option. A case study has been done on the Botlek harbour in the Port of Rotterdam. Using available data on the yearly volume of dredged material and the distribution of this material over the basins, an estimation has been made for the production of the AWID in this harbour. Extrapolating the results to the full Port of Rotterdam results in a system of six AWID devices that each serve their own area around one of the six docks that are locations throughout the port.","dredging; autonomous; water injection dredging; WID; mud","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Dredging Engineering","",""

Generally microemulsions are studied under static conditions by means of phase behavior tests. However, oil mobilization fromreservoirs is a dynamic process and therefore it is important to understand how microemulsions formunder dynamic conditions. The microemulsion was formed in situ in T-junctions and dead end channels whichwere etched in glass microchips. Using a solvatochromic fluorescent dye (Nile Red) real time visualization of the aqueous phase, oil phase and microemulsion was possible. The T-junction geometrywas used to study initial mixing and consequential formation of microemulsion while both the aqueous phase and the oil phase were mobile. The dead end channel geometry allowed us to study the emulsification when only the aqueous phase was injected into an initially oil saturated microchip. The surfactant concentration and injection rates were found to have an effect on the emulsification rate and the flow dynamics in the T-junctions. In the dead end channels, the emulsification was mainly driven by diffusion and the gradients in the concenration of the chemicals. Some of the results of the dynamic experiments deviated from what would be expected fromthe phase behavior tests. Results of the experiments were reproduced where possible using commercial software (ComsolMultiphysics) which helped to get a qualitative understanding of the flow dynamics. An analyticalmodel was implemented using the saturation profiles observed in the experiments. Possible emulsification mechanisms were identified.","microemulsions; enhanced oil recovery; microfluidics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-07","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Petroleum Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

Replacement of the foundations is expensive and often unnecessary if the new bridge superstructure is lighter than the old one. With stricter design guidelines being in effect nowadays, a conventional orthotropic steel deck design will end up being heavier. A lightweight fiber reinforced polymer deck supported by steel girders is proposed as a solution. In this thesis the potential mass reduction resulting from a lightweight FRP deck is analyzed. Analyses are initially performed under the assumption that realizing composite action will generate the best results. However, a finite element model of a bolted connection between an FRP deck and steel girders indicates that the strength of such a connection is too low to efficiently realize composite action. An alternate solution where the deck is draped over the main girders with a thin FRP layer is considered and outperforms the composite action design. The design with FRP but without composite action is compared with a standard orthotropic steel design. The FRP design weighs order of magnitude 10% less than its orthotropic counterpart. However, it is still significantly heavier than the original component in need of replacing.","Fiber Reinforced Polymer; FRP; Bolted Connection; Composite Action; Glass; Fiber; Fibre; Tsai Wu; Tsai-Wu; Julianabrug","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

Regardless of which payment method you select, chances are big that the schemes of one of the few players within the payment industry - i.e. MasterCard or Visa - are used. We refer to this part of the industry as the card network. In order to create more competition for the card network, the European Commission is working on Payment Service Directive II (PSDII) which introduces the third party payment (TPP) network. Although there seems to be quite some potential for the TPP network, challenges are present. The new TPP network is less mature than the established card network that has dominated the payment industry for decades. Whereas one of the main challenges in the card network is the cost effective management of chargebacks, a similar challenge is present in the TPP network. Practice has shown that merchants that make use of payment methods in the TPP network are confronted with reversed payments - i.e. the TPP has provided an authorization, however no settlement has been received. We refer to these transactions as non-payments. There is a lack of knowledge about the reasons of the occurrence of the non-payments. In our research we have aimed to understand how big the financial risk of the occurrence of non-payments is and what could be strategies a payment service provider (PSP) can use to manage this risk. With our research, we have made four contributions. First, we described the payment process as it is organized in the TPP network and contrasted it with the card network. Second, we identified patterns in transaction data from the TPP network, that let us distinguish payments from non-payments. Third, we designed and evaluated risk management strategies that can be used to manage the non-payment risk. And fourth, we compared the merchant's transaction costs in the card and TPP networks to verify if the TPP network can become a cost competitor of the card network. The results of our research show that the TPP network is a cost competitor of the card network when considering the merchant's transaction costs.","Third Party Payment Network; Risk Management; Non-payment; Payment Service Provider","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-01","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of Cybersecurity","","","",""

(mentor); Haanstra, J. (mentor); De Wilde, W.J. (mentor); Busink, J. (mentor)","2015","Growth in air traffic demand and increasing attention for environmental impact of the air travel industry and airports has spurred the innovation of the Electric Taxi System (ETS). The ETS incorporates an electric motor in the main or nose landing gear of an aircraft, powered by the auxiliary power unit (APU) of the aircraft. The system allows the aircraft to maneuver and taxi without the use of its main engines or a tow truck. Thereby, the ETS reduces fuel usage and the environmental impact during the taxi phase of flights. Additionally, the system aims to increase the gate pushback efficiency. The ETS eliminates the need for a tow truck during the pushback process as it allows for autonomous pushbacks. The studies performed on existing ETSs (the EGTS and theWheelTug systems) indicate that time can be saved with autonomous pushbacks using the ETS. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AAS) have instigated research to investigate the impact and potential benefits of the implementation of the ETS. This Msc. thesis research work continues the exploration of the ETS’s impact at AAS by posing the following research question: What opportunities does the ETS offer for gate capacity and buffer utilization optimization, and what is the value of the impact of the ETS on apron operations at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol? Thus, the research attempts to draw light on the value of the ETS for operations in the apron environment. With increasing air traffic demand, the gate capacity at Schiphol Airport is nearing its maximum during the airport’s peak hours. Therefore, the potential gate capacity enhancement procedures enabled by the ETS are explored in detail in this research. Additionally, the value of the ETS for the overall apron environment is investigated. The reduction in the need for tow trucks due to the ETS implementation also provides benefits for the apron environment. The ETS presents the possibility for of two gate usage optimization concepts to be implemented more widely,namely; the dispatch towing concept and the pit stop concept. The gate planningmodels designed in this research explore the potential of the implementation of the pit stop and dispatch towing concepts at AAS. Initially, a gate planning model is designed to graphically present the narrow body gate and buffer plan in gantt chart format. In doing so the gate and buffer planning schedule for the busiest day at AAS in 2014 is visualized. The pit stop and dispatch towing concepts are then applied to the schedule where possible. From the visualization of the gate plans with and without the ETS enabled concepts, it can be concluded that the pit stop concept increases gate capacity at AAS by approximately six additionally aircraft on the busiest day at the airport in 2014. Furthermore, the dipatch towing concept increases gate planning efficiency and reduces ground arrival delays for six arriving aircraft on the busiest day at the airport in 2014. The gate planning model is subsequently expanded in order to explore the effect of increased traffic and delays on the gate planning at AAS, and the usage of pit stops and dispatch towing to help increase gate capacity and solve delay conflicts, respectively. From the extended model it becomes apparent that should the number of peak hour flights at AAS increase by 10%, and average of 25% of the additional flights can be scheduled at a gate using the pit stop concept. Should the number of peak hour flights double, an average of 8.8% of the additional peak hour flights (corresponding to 12 flights) can be scheduled using the pit stop concept. Furthermore, the model shows that, between 10% and 12% of the ground delays caused by delayed peak hour flights at the gates can be solved through the implementation of dispatch towing. This results in an average of 17.2minutes saved for nearly 50% of the arriving delayed flights. The gate planning models have indicated the potential of the pit stop and dispatch towing concepts enabled by the ETS for gate planning efficiency and capacity at AAS. However, the implementation of the ETS influences many key performance indicators (KPIs) of the apron area. In order to explore the value of the ETS on the apron area, a value model is developed. The value model is based on the value operations methodology (VOM). The value model qualitative assessment indicates that the ETS can enhance the safety, capacity, and efficiency of the airport apron environment, while reducing the costs and environmental impact of the apron area operations. The results of the models and the research performed can be further analyzed and developed by KLM and AAS in order to assist in the development of electric taxi systems and, eventually, enhance their competitive position within the aviation industry.","Electric Taxi Systems; Gate Capacity; Value Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Air Transport & Operations (ATO)","","","","52.30907, 4.763385"

Quantified investigations need to be carried out to search for the potential benefits of the application of thrust vectoring control on a civil transport aircraft. Blended Wing Body configuration is a novel aircraft concept. Due to the absence of conventional tails longitudinal controllability become part of the key challenges of this configuration. It is therefore the objective of this thesis project to carry out quantified flight mechanics analyses on the effectiveness of controlling a Blended Wing Body aircraft with vectoring thrust. As a starting point flight mechanics simulations under steady level flight conditions in longitudinal plane are conducted in this project. Through this project a thrust vectoring model, which contains the calculation of nozzle deflection angles based on nozzle deflection controls and the calculation of engine thrust loss due to nozzle deflections, is developed and embedded in a flight mechanics toolbox used for the flight mechanics simulations. The flight mechanics simulations of thrust vectoring control are then carried out with a series of nozzle deflections, flight conditions, aircraft mass and CG locations. From the simulation results it is investigated that for the Blended Wing Body configuration tested in this project, thrust vectoring control under steady level flight conditions is much less effective than the conventional aerodynamic control surfaces. The maximum effectiveness ratio between thrust vectoring control and conventional aerodynamic control surfaces obtained in this project is about 11.2%. With extensive flight mechanics simulations, the way that aircraft flight conditions, mass and CG locations affect the effectiveness of thrust vectoring control is analysed through this project.","Blended Wing Body; thrust vectoring; control effectiveness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

However, it is widely recognized that different components from these respective fields all contribute to the workload an Air Traffic Controller experiences. Hence, this study has tried to bridge this gap by quantitatively comparing two previously developed models of Air Traffic Controller workload. For the comparison, the contextual Dynamic Density (DD) and the cognitive Man-machine Integration Design and Analysis System (MIDAS) have been chosen. This is due to the well-established nature of these models in their respective fields. In the comparison context of three Conflict Detection & Resolution scenarios, two consistent quantitative relations have been found between a number of DD and MIDAS variables respectively. The most consistent relation effectively illustrated the quantitative relation between the inter-aircraft distance based DD complexity and the MIDAS cognitive/average channel load. Given this relation, a much more thorough understanding has been obtained of how the workload quantification types proposed by both models relate to one-another. It was concluded that none of the models could effectively model the expected workload behavior in solitude. Therefore, it was proposed that knowledge from these models should be combined. Three of such model integration proposals have been given. The proposal in which the MIDAS channel loads were convoluted with the locally applicable DD complexity values appeared to illustrate the physically desired workload behavior.","air traffic control; workload; contextual workload modelling; cognitive workload modelling; quantitative model comparison; MIDAS; dynamic density","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Air Traffic Management, Airports and Safety","",""

In 2013 the primary energy consumption in the Netherlands was for 43% supplied with natural gas (CBS, 2015a). With this proportion of natural gas the Netherlands has the highest share in national primary energy consumption of Europe (Eurogas, 2014). The reason for this large share of natural gas is the Dutch national gas production. The Netherlands has been a large gas producer, consumer and exporter since the find of the large onshore field in Groningen province. The natural gas production in the Netherlands is decreasing currently. Several studies have shown that natural gas production will be at such a level that the Netherlands will become a net importer around 2025 (IEA, 2012; ECN, 2014). These estimates are without inclusion of the recent decisions to limit production from the Groningen field. The integral role of natural gas is very important; many energy processes in the Dutch economy run on natural gas. When Dutch gas production decreases, the downstream part of the natural gas-value chain in the Netherlands might be affected. To prevent structural import dependency on one supplier, such as Russia or Norway, the Netherlands can diversify gas supply with LNG imports and biogas production. Another method to be less dependent on import is to find alternatives in the energy portfolio to satisfy Dutch energy demand. Clustered industrial sectors, such as the Rotterdam area, will also be affected when domestic gas supply will be reduced. The question is how dependent the Rotterdam industrial cluster is on natural gas. The Dutch industrial dependency on gas will be the focus of this master thesis, as presented in the main research question: “What influence has the reduction of gas production in the Netherlands on the energy sourcing of the Rotterdam industrial cluster?”","natural gas dependency; Rotterdam cluster; (petro)chemical industry; import","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy and Industry","","SEPAM","","51.889200, 4.309133"

It thrives on the knowledge which is available in public and private domains. However, it is the ability to acquire, synthesize, utilize, and share and use of knowledge which can aid innovation. This thesis intends to present the drivers and barriers of knowledge networks which aid innovation. Sharing and networking of knowledge within the knowledge network can not only improve the ability of network members to grow their knowledge base but also helps in innovation. However successful design, management, and deployment of knowledge network to aid innovation is catalyzed by drivers and challenged by barriers. The main aim of this research is to identify these barriers and drivers within the networks. In order to do so, we conducted case study analysis across 8 cases operational towards innovation. A comprehensive list of barriers and drivers were identified in the study which was consistent with the drivers and barriers identified in the literature review. Other than these, the researcher also identified some of the drivers and barriers which have not been discussed in the literature review. The list of drivers within the network include; environmental factors, technological factors, knowledge exchange, and boundary spanning. The list of barriers identified within the knowledge network include; lack of scale, financial constraints, disruption by external parties, presence of weak ties, lack of organizational commitment, and lack of infrastructure. Some of the new barriers which were identified during case analysis were; lack of proper communication, lack of time to bring innovation within the network, lack of tools which could measure the outcome and efficiency of innovation within the network, lack of filtration in the knowledge which was shared within the network. On the other hand, presence of trust between the network members, coherence within the network members due to proper communication, and marketing strategies to pitch for funding and also the promotion of innovation were some of the new drivers identified.","knowledge networks; innovation; barriers; drivers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-12-03","Technology, Policy and Management","Innovation Systems","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Van Dooren, M.M.M. (mentor)","2015","Organiq is a company with a large emphasis on creating products that solve social problems. Next to products that address problems such as poverty, illiteracy and social isolation, the company wants to expand their activities into the domain of bullying prevention and intervention. As a student looking for a graduation project, I have been consulted to develop a new anti-bullying product for schools. This thesis reports all stages of the design process and the final designed product idea. Bullying occurs in many forms. Abusing, gossiping, physical violence, damaging or taking away possessions, cyber bullying and locking out people are all reckoned to be forms of bullying. People that are involved in bullying are divided in three groups: bullies, victims and bystanders. Children belonging to either of these roles can experience both long and short-term negative effects from the bullying episodes . Ranging from feelings of anger and anxiety to poor physical health and substance abuse. Many bullying prevention and intervention approaches exist such as the restorative justice approach, peer-led intervention approaches, curriculum approach and whole-school approaches. Although it remains difficult to determine which approach actually work best. In the upcoming year Dutch schools will be mandatory to put together an anti-bullying protocol. They will be assisted by the sector organizations PO-Raad and VO-Raad in the selection of effective programs that fit their specific school context. Besides that a database will be created, with programs that are proven effective, so schools can look up information for themselves. It should be noted that no approved anti-bullying e-learning solutions exist, so this would be a great addition for schools that want to incorporate digital tools in their programs. This information resulted in the formulation of a design direction: : “Creating a cooperative decision based e-learning game that teaches primary school children (age 8-9) desired standards and values with regard to social behavior while providing the teacher with opportunities for opening conversation about bullying.” The aim of this cooperative e-learning game will be the improvement of relationships and sense of responsibility between peers in order to prevent bullying. Most bullying intervention protocols focus on either teaching the victims how to act when they are being bullied or explain to the bullies why their behavior is harmful, assuming it will address their emphatic intellect. The goal of ‘Band of Bullies’ deviates from both these approaches. Instead of addressing the victim or bully, the core idea of this concept is to provide bystanders with strategies on how to act in several bullying situations through the use of an e-learning game. This is an approach largely ignored by other anti-bullying programs. The resulting concept is a highly animated game, with a clear story and goal, and an emphasis on teaching the right strategies for a myriad of recognizable bullying situations.","bullying prevention; e-learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Rietveld, L.C. (mentor)","2015","Worldwide 748 million people lacked access to improved sources of drinking water in 2014, of this group almost a quarter relies on untreated surface water (WHO & Unicef, 2014). According to the WHO, simple, socially accepted and low-cost household water treatment systems (HWTS), such as the Ceramic Pot Filter (CPF), can provide a solution for reliable drinking water on the short term. Although CPFs are used worldwide and are generally effective with regard to bacteria removal, they can in most cases not be indicated by the WHO as a “protective” HWTS, since the virus removal is insufficient. Another limitation of the CPF is the incapability of removing arsenic. Prolonged ingestion of water with elevated arsenic levels can lead to severe health issues including dermal lesions and various types of cancers (WHO, 2011b). The objective of this study was therefore to provide reliable experimental data to investigate whether it is feasible to extend the capabilities of CPFs with arsenic removal properties and enhanced virus inactivation by the incorporation of nano Zero Valent Iron (nZVI), which is a well-known arsenic adsorbent and has also potential capabilities for virus reduction. As a basis for the research approach, the following sub-objectives were formulated: (i) study the arsenic adsorption capacities nZVI amended CPFs, (ii) determine the microbiological inactivation efficiency by nZVI amended CPFs, (iii) evaluate the leaching of the incorporated nZVI and (iv) provide knowledge on the effect of incorporating nZVI into CPFs before firing. In this study Ceramic Disk Filters (CDFs) manufactured by combining clay soil with water and sawdust, pressing them in a disk shape and, firing them. Additionally, metals (nZVI, Composite Iron Matrix powder or silver nanoparticles (nAg)) were added to the clay mixture before firing, to obtain an iron content of 0.05%, 0.5% or 5% based on the weight of a dry disk. The manufactured CDFs were tested based on the following established requirements: (i) arsenic must be removed to below the provisional WHO guideline of 10 ?g/L, (ii) for bacteria a LRV of 2 or greater is required, (ii) for viruses a LRV of 3 or greater is required, (iv) the leached amount of metals must not exceed the WHO guidelines and (v) CDFs should have a flow rate of 0.08-0.24 L/h, which corresponds to 1-3 L/h for a full-size CPF. The removal of bacteria and viruses was quantified by loading the CDFs with test water with Escherichia coli and MS2 bacteriophages, as indicator organisms for bacteria and viruses, respectively. During this filter experiment also the metal leaching from the CDFs was evaluated, an arsenic breakthrough experiment was performed and the flow rates were measured. Furthermore, batch experiments were conducted with ground CDFs, both fired and unfired, to get more insight on the capabilities of the adsorption and inactivation of MS2 bacteriophages and the removal of arsenic, and to study the consequences of firing nZVI into the CDFs. Moreover, knowledge was obtained on the effect of firing nZVI into ceramic material by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, optical microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscope – Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX). The main findings, with regard to the requirements for a CPF, were: (i) although this study showed that ZVI on itself is an effective arsenic adsorbent an immediate total arsenic breakthrough of 200 ?g/L was observed for the CDFs with 5% nZVI; (ii) all CDFs, except the filter with 0.05% nZVI, were able to remove E. coli sufficiently to meet the requirements for bacteria removal (LRV 0.75-4.28); (iii) MS2 bacteriophages were poorly removed (LRV 0.11-0.24) (iv) there is no health-based guideline of the WHO for iron and the leached silver stayed far below the maximum WHO guideline of 0.1 mg/L; (v) the translated flow rates for CPFs were for all type filters higher than the requirement of 1-3 L/h (3.4 – 15.6 L/h), except for the filter with 0.05% nAg (1.5 L/h). Overall, it can thus be concluded that it is not recommended to incorporate nZVI in CPFs before firing with the purpose to enhance the removal of arsenic and viruses. Although, ZVI on itself is well capable of removing arsenic, especially at nano-scale, it was found that when it is incorporated into clay it looses effectiveness and when the clay is fired even more. In the batch experiments the unfired crushed CDF with 5% nZVI was able to remove approximately 90% of the initial 200 ?g/L As(III) in 30 minutes of contact time, while the fired crushed CDF only removed a few per cent As(III). Part of the faster As(III) removal of the unfired filter was a result of sorption by the clay, but the nZVI contributed considerably. Although, the LRVs for MS2 bacteriophages by fired filter material were higher in the batch experiment (LRV 0.42-1.52) than in the filter experiment – probably due more intensive contact - there was also no enhanced MS2 bacteriophage reduction noticed for the fired CDFs with nZVI compared to the fired blank CDF. There are probably several reactions that caused this loss of performance of ZVI. The results of the filter experiments indicated that there was insufficient surface contact with the nZVI particles; either due to unavailability of nZVI particles on the pore surface or due to too high flow rates. The addition of nZVI particles namely led to a considerable increase of flow rate, probably as a result of successive expansion and shrinking of the nZVI during firing. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that due to the vitrification process, in which the clay bonds together, the nZVI became enclosed in the clay structure. Furthermore, the 57Fe Mössbauer spectra evidenced that during firing all the added nZVI was oxidized into hematite, which probably affects the removal of arsenic. Different ZVI corrosion products have a different ability to adsorb arsenic: ZVI exhibits the greatest arsenic adsorption, secondly magnetite, then hematite and lastly goethite (Mamindy-Pajany et al. (2011)). This study showed that ZVI has potential for the removal of arsenic in HWTS, but with application in a different setting than by firing it in the CPF. Suggestions were made for potential alternatives: (i) CPFs with an iron coating; (ii) CPF with ZVI pre-treatment in the form of an hang-element or an extra bucket on top of the CPF, like the effective SONO filter for arsenic removal (Neumann et al., 2013); (iii) CPF with inside iron mixed ceramic pellets (Shafiquzzam et al.,2013). When designing a new type of CPF it is important to make sure that the iron (oxides) particles can be reached and that the flow rate is not too high, which ensures that the contact time with the iron (oxides) particles is long enough. Furthermore, additional research is needed on the enhancement of virus removal and inactivation. It is recommended to study the combination of nZVI and nAg in more detail and also to look at other combination of metals, such as Ag and copper. In order to better understand the adsorption of viruses onto different media it is advised to perform to determine the actual pHPZC of the used media. Lastly, it is advised that in a later stage of future research experiments should be performed with more challenging water and varying parameters such as the turbidity, the pH, competing ions, the ionic strength, influent arsenic concentration and different types of viruses.","Ceramic Pot Filters; Arsenic; Viruses","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-12-03","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

However, many OEM companies are still reluctant to adopt Big Data Analytics in their daily business activities due to different concerns. The investigation of Big Data Analytics adoption by OEM is rarely seen in the literature. Therefore, how to adopt Big Data Analytics by OEM companies in the industrial automation sector is studied. During the execution of this study, TOE theory and DOI theory are utilized to address how the different factors from technological, organizational and environmental contexts affecting different Big Data Analytics adoption phases regarding OEM companies. This framework was developed to provide an overview and guidelines for OEM companies to utilize Big Data Analytics. The influential factors and the adoption process framework for Big Data Analytics by OEM companies were evaluated by face-to-face interviews in a qualitative approach. It is found that OEM companies will experience several phases for Big Data Analytics adoption, including Awareness phase, Strategy phase, Knowledge phase, Trial phase, Implementation phase, and Internalization phase. The competitive pressure and marketing effort from the Big Data Analytics service providers will positively affect the Awareness phase. The relative advantage, top management support and competitive pressure and marketing effort will positively affect the Strategy phase. The top management support and marketing effort are the main drivers for the Knowledge Phase when the Data security is the barrier for this phase. In the Trial phase, the relative advantage, compatibility and financial readiness will be the main drives. The Implementation phase will be mainly affected by Data security and Top management support. In the last Internalization phase, only external environmental factor such as competitive pressure will affect the maturation of Big Data Analytics at the organizational level of OEM companies.

The intention is to create an easy-to-use cloud service that offers an all-in Big Data analysis solution. The Big Data Portal allows users to design workflows for their data analysis work. These workflows need to be designed in the portal through means of a notation that is both easy to use and can be extended with the latest in Big Data analysis tools. Furthermore, the portal should process the analysis work in an efficient manner, to minimise costs. In this design research DAWN, a Data Analytics Workflow Notation, was developed. This design considers the goals set for the Big Data Portal, as well as theoretical base for the workflow notation. The formal definition is derived from nested relational calculus as a theoretical base. In this work, DAWNis shown to be easily visualisable for graphically editing the workflow.

(mentor)","2015","New technologies like electric power steering and steer-by-wire have made it possible to freely shape the steering wheel dynamics. As the driver is part of the closed-loop vehicle steering system, his neuromuscular response should be taken into account when shaping steering wheel dynamics. It is known that drivers adapt the dynamics of their arm to different traffic situations (e.g., increased neuromuscular stiffness for narrow roads) and to the steering wheel dynamics itself. Based on that knowledge, this research study investigates whether steering wheel stiffness can be used to assist driving behaviour for different road widths. It was hypothesised that with higher steering wheel stiffness (KSW), drivers would keep the combined dynamics constant by decreasing their neuromuscular stiffness (KNMS). In a critical traffic situation like when a road narrows, high KSW could then allow drivers to relax more, as they would no longer need to increase their own KNMS. Eleven subjects took part in a driving simulator experiment where driving criticality was manipulated by alternating wide and narrow straight segments. Three steering wheel settings were tested: baseline, high and ‘adaptive’ stiffness, which changed gradually from baseline KSW on wide roads to high KSW on narrow roads, and vice versa. Against expectation, no decrease in KNMS was found for higher KSW. Adapting KSW to road width, similar to how drivers adapt, did thus not yield the expected benefits in terms of KNMS. In addition, even with high KSW, performance remained worse on narrow compared to wide roads. However, effort was lower with high KSW, while performance was maintained or even increased. Also, subjective ratings were highest for adaptive KSW, which enabled drivers to keep effort constant between road widths. While no effects on KNMS were found, adapting KSW can thus be a useful tool in assisting driving behaviour in different road conditions.","steering wheel stiffness; driving criticality; drivers' arm stiffness; neuromuscular admittance; driving behaviour; steering feel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BioMechanical Design","",""

(mentor); Jovic, A. (mentor)","2015","Optical coherence tomography (OCT) probes rely on MEMS micro-scanners to provide fast and reproducible scans covering as much area as possible. A popular choice of actuators employed in this role are electrothermal bimorph actuators. They comprise of two layers of different materials which are rigidly joined together. Differential expansion under heating causes the bimorph to deflect. Polycrystalline silicon carbide has been proposed to replace polysilicon as a multi-purpose material in MEMS but it has not been yet explored as a bimorph material. Under this premise, an in-plane bimorph actuator based on doped polycrystalline silicon carbide and silicon was proposed to fulfill the requirements of an OCT probe. This actuator suffered from yield and reliability issues, which were, however, linked primarily to the design and not the material itself. Therefore, in order to evaluate silicon carbide as a bimorph “hot” layer, an optimization and characterization procedure was carried out to determine its relevant mechanical, thermal and electrical properties. Specifically, the residual stress, Young modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion, thermal coefficient of resistance and electrical resistivity were determined. The layer residual stress and resistivity could be reduced by adjusting the SiH2Cl¬2, C2H2 and NH3 gas ratio¬, achieving 0.03 ? cm and 300 MPa respectively. The resistivity of the layer is adequate for it to act as a heater. The electrostatic pull-in instability technique was used to extract the Young modulus for different layers and it was found to decrease with increasing Si/C composition, with a value of 250 GPa for our selected optimum layer. The coefficient of thermal expansion was determined through fabricated v-beam actuators to be 4.3 ppm/K which indicates that SiC must be heated more to produce strain comparable to other bimorph ”hot” materials. As a final step in poly-SiC evaluation, we constructed rudimentary bimorph poly-SiC/SiO¬2 cantilevers which were subsequently used to test the static and dynamic performance of this material combination. Our conclusion is that poly-SiC is a good bimorph “hot” material that operates optimally at higher temperatures, can be used in more diverse bimorph designs and is more suited to applications that require high force. Throughout the material characterization process, we used numerical and analytical models extensively. This helped us identify good modelling practices and led to the refinement of the models, allowing us to obtain better matching between theoretical predictions and experimental data. Based on these findings of the poly-SiC properties and better models, we propose a novel in-plane, spring form actuator for use in an OCT micro-scanner. It employs a poly-SiC/SiO2 material combination in a mechanical amplifying geometry and in simulation, it achieves 80.9 mN of force and 250 ?m of displacement at 43 mW power consumption and a 0.3 mm2 footprint. All these parameters are an improvement over the initial design.","silicon carbide; MEMS; actuators; bimorph; in-plane; micro-scanners; optical coherence tomography","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","ECTM","",""

One particular mission of interest involves a formation of quadrotors performing infrastructure inspection autonomously. This thesis describes a scenario where a Target quadrotor is performing a task in a GPS-denied environment, and two Sensor quadrotors with GPS capabilities estimate the Target’s position combining their positions with bearings-only measurements. The selection of the Sensors’ positions can greatly a?ect the estimation performance, motivating the optimization of several objective functions based on the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). Two novel estimation algorithms are created and tested for both cases where the Target is stationary and moving. The results show geometric con?gurations that increase the estimation accuracy, illustrating the importance of maximizing the FIM for Target localization using quadrotors. Assuming a double integrator model for the target vehicle, an LQR controller is combined with the nonlinear estimator to achieve tracking of a desired trajectory. The results show the in?uence of the Sensors’ positioning not only on the estimation error, but also on the di?erence between the true and desired position of the Target. Finally, a network localization problem with multiple Targets and two Sensors with full knowledge of their position is considered. The Targets estimate their position using not only bearings measurements coming from one of the Sensors, but also coming from another Target.

APIs have been investigated from different angles such as popularity usage and evolution, to get a better understanding of their various characteristics. For such studies software repositories are mined for API usage examples. However, the mining algorithms used for such purposes do not take type information into account, thus making the results imprecise. In this thesis, we aim to rectify this by introducing fine-GRAPE, an approach that produces fine-grained API usage information by taking advantage of type information while mining API method invocations and annotations. fine-GRAPE establishes a connection between a method invocation and the class of the API to which the method belongs. By means of fine-GRAPE, we investigate API usages from Java projects hosted on GitHub. We select five of the most popular APIs across GitHub Java projects and collect historical API usage information by mining both the release history of these APIs and the code history of every project that uses them. We use the resulting dataset to perform four separate analyses. The first measures the lag time of each client by leveraging the version information that has been collected. We see that in most cases clients do not upgrade the version of the API that they are using to the latest version. The consequence of this is that the lag time that each client displays is quite high. The second study investigates the percentage of API features that are used by using the type information in the dataset. The results of this study show that a very small percentage of an API is actually used by clients in the real world. Our third study aims to show the relation between popular features and software quality. Finally, the fourth study analyzes the reaction of clients to the deprecation of API artifacts. Our deprecation study shows that most clients do not really react to deprecated entities.","API; mining software repositories; deprecation; popularity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Kacker, R. (mentor)","2015","The Oscillatory Flow Baffled Crystallizer (OFBC) design has been proven to offer improved temperature control and near plug plow residence time distributions, while at the same time providing large residence times. These OFBC properties hold the promise of resulting in a narrow crystal size distribution, reduced residence time requirements and improved process control. However to obtain such results the operation of the OFBC along with the crystallization process should be optimized. One of the most important operational aspects to optimize is the local turbulence that results in setting the dispersion in the crystallizer to a minimum, without compromising on the mass and heat transfer processes. In this study the residence time distribution of a tracer resulting from various possible operating configurations (amplitude and frequency) in the OFBC is analyzed, for water flows with a net flow Reynolds number of 140 (flowrate 100 ml/min) using dye tracing with an in situ transmission dip probe (absorption spectrophotometry). The best combinations of frequency and amplitude at which narrowest distribution (least dispersion) of the tracer concentration profile is achieved are found to be 1 Hz and 1 mm, 2 Hz and 3.5 mm and 4 Hz and 1 mm. The experimental results show that the ratio of the oscillatory Reynolds number and the net flow Reynolds number should be between 0.7 and 5. This is a broader range than the reported 2 to 4 range in literature. The measured residence time distributions for the best oscillatory setting have been successfully fitted to a tanks-in-series model with a 3 % maximum error of the coefficient of determination. It can therefore be concluded that the number of tanks in series is an accurate characteristic parameter of the fluid dynamics. The assumption of ideal plug flow, which is shown to not resemble the real RTD well, can therefore be avoided when developing the model for crystallization in an OFBC. The results of a parameter sensitivity study, based on the developed model, shows that the final seed CSD is weakly related to secondary nucleation for the used kinetic parameters. This can be explained as the small mass of the nucleated crystals does not have a large effect on the supersaturation. Furthermore, the final seed CSD has a dependence on all varied parameters but mostly to the initial seed loading. This is logical as double the initial seed loading will consume double or more amount of solute and therefore slow down the growth rate significantly. Secondary nucleation is very sensitive to the supersaturation profile (with the used kinetics) and so to the imposed temperature profile and the seed loading. The degree of plug flow has very little effect on secondary nucleation because the supersaturation profile is hardly influenced upon variation. A temperature profile optimization showed that in order to minimize secondary nucleation using a five zone temperature control, both a constant zone temperature and a linear zone temperature approach could lower the secondary nucleation by a factor of 2 compared to a single linear zone temperature approach. This underlines the importance of optimization in the OFBC.","oscillatory flow; baffles; residence time distribution; cooling crystallization; modeling; tanks-in-series; high resolution finite volume scheme; nucleation; growth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-03-15","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process & Energy","","Intensified Reaction and Seperation System","",""

Newer games have become more aesthetically pleasing and game worlds have grown in size and detail, but the agents living in them are often perceived as stupid and predictable by players. Enriching these agents with emotional capabilities is one way to make them more believable and engaging. Computational models of emotion can give agents autonomous emotional behaviour based on events in the game world. Nonetheless, agents with such models are rare in modern games as studios opt for simpler hard-coded solutions. We seek to formally answer the question why video games lack emotional agents. We believe lack of control over these agents to be a key factor. With autonomous emotional reasoning it becomes hard to predict their behaviour, as many things influence their emotional state. This is particularly true for large game worlds with many agents and plethora of possible situations. Results from a questionnaire on the subject of emotional agents in games, sent out to game designers in the gaming industry, showed that there is little pressure from players and publishers to include these agents. The recipients said that it is expensive to include them and that there are more cost effective ways to enhance the gaming experience for players. Their responses indicated that it is hard to incorporate emotional agents in the game design and difficult to test their behaviour. We took a first step towards solving this problem by designing and implementing a prototype version of a general purpose testing tool for emotional agents. Our tool was designed to be emotion engine independent and generic. It receives data, logged during a game session, from web services and stores it in a database. The data can be queried and visualized from a web-based front-end by interacting with several data visualization. Users can look at high-level map visualizations and spot something interesting and then zoom in on that part to inspect it further using low-level timelines. We validated the tool by conducting two rounds of user tests with a pilot group consisting of three individuals with industry experience. The results suggest that such a tool can be useful to debug and test the behaviour of emotional agents and help motivate game studios to include them in their games.","Affective Gaming; Computational Models of Emotion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Media and Knowledge Engineering","",""

(mentor); Farah, H. (mentor); de Winter, J.C.F. (mentor)","2015","Novice drivers attract a lot of the attention in terms of their involvement in traffic accidents, especially during the first period of driving. In the Netherlands, rash rates have been increasing for the inexperienced drivers during the last years, resulting in crash rates that are five times higher than the rates of experienced drivers. Following the traffic safety facts, safety has become a vital asset for the automotive industry over the past decades. The radical development of Advanced Driver Assistance systems (ADAS) has shown potential to compensate for the inabilities of drivers to properly react to risky situations. Thus, they could especially contribute in mitigating novice drivers’ crash involvement by assisting them in performing difficult driving tasks, like hazard detection and speed adaptation. On the other hand, such automation may negatively affect driving behaviour and driving performance in terms of reaction time, situation awareness and increased workload stemming from additional tasks depending on the specific type of ADAS. The main objective of this study is to examine the perception of learner drivers towards in-car driving assistance systems and the possibility of introducing them into drivers’ training and testing. The impact of two specific ADAS is examined, which are the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Blind Spot Detection (BSD) system. The research methodology included literature review, questionnaire development and in-depth personal interviews. Aspects like the perceived usefulness of the systems and the willingness to use were investigated. The results of the study showed that both systems are considered important for different reasons, based on learner drivers’ perceptions. Relieving the young driver from the stress caused by multitasking, as well as, increasing traffic safety levels lead to ranking the BSD system first in their preferences for driving assistance. The BSD system is considered as an ADAS increasing traffic safety, whereas the ACC system is believed to be luxurious system assisting in harmonising the traffic flow. For these reasons, learner drivers ranked the BSD system at a higher priority over ACC when they were asked about sequence of the systems’ introduction in the drivers’ education. Concerning the systems’ integration in training and testing procedures, their integration should ensure that drivers learn to react safely to all input interfaces and properly perceive all the systems’ indications. The training should also teach drivers about handling systems’ possible failures. Thus, after determining the sequence of the systems’ introduction, theoretical behavioural tests should be made to the trainers before the practical lessons and specific elements need to be included in both training and testing, depending on each system’s specifications and demands. In this way, elements for all levels of drivers’ training, from tactical to strategic, are incorporated.","learner drivers; Blind Spot Detection system; Adaptive Cruise Control system; drivers testing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","HTM Personenvervoer N.V. is a public transportation company that operates the tram and light rail network of The Hague. These networks are connected at The Hague Central Station, where light rail vehicles continue on the urban tram network, making it a mixed operation system. HTM frequently deals with planned changes regarding the timetable or infrastructure on these networks, for which they require a way to evaluate the consequences of the decisions that are about to be made. There-fore HTM together with the TU Delft started the development of a rail simulation model, LIBROS. It is an object-oriented discrete-event model that contains rail elements as components that can be coupled to form aggregated components, like crossings. However, this model does not yet contain the RandstadRail (light rail) network, which makes the model incomplete. Furthermore, few to no simulation models are found on the market that are able to simulate both operating principles simultaneously. HTM wishes to include both networks in the LIBROS model to be able to perform network evaluations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""
