(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Van der Meer, J.W. (mentor); Labeur, R.J. (mentor); Schüttrumpf, H.F.R. (mentor)","2007","Nowadays the protection of our country for high sea levels and heavy storms is daily news. The ComCoast project (COMbined functions in the COASTal defence zones) is originated by ten organisations out of five European countries bordering the North Sea coasts in order to develop innovative solutions for flood protection in coastal areas. Instead of automatically raising the coastal defence zone on places where more protection is needed, ComCoast creates multifunctional flood management schemes with a more gradual transition from sea to land. Part of the new solutions is the wave overtopping resistant dike. This so called ""overtopping durable dike"", should withstand wave overtopping during a storm in much better than the current ones. More knowledge about the loads on the dike by wave overtopping is therefore needed. Recently formulae have been derived for maximum flow depths and velocities on the crest and inner slope. These formulae are based on the difference between fictive wave run-up and the crest freeboard. This is a good measure to determine the flow depths and velocities on the dike. These formulae have been calibrated by two independent physical model test programs in different wave flumes by Schüttrumpf in Germany and by Van Gent in the Netherlands. If these two studies are compared there appears to be a large difference in the empirical coefficient of the flow depth equation of a factor 2.2. They collectively wrote a paper and found the test set-up as primary cause for the discrepancy in the flow depth coefficient. The differences between the test set-up and analysis have been studied in the present thesis. The overtopping time and the variation of velocity and flow depth in time have been investigated as well. These quantities are also necessary to be able to give a full description of the loads on the dike during wave overtopping. The present study shows that the outer slope is of great importance in the flow depths and velocities on the crest. This is new knowledge. Schüttrumpf performed his tests on a dike model with an outer slope of 1:6 and Van Gent used a dike model with an outer slope of 1:4. The empirical coefficients appeared to be dependent on the outer slope steepness. Subsequently a formula for the overtopping time is created, based on the difference between fictive wave run-up and crest freeboard. The overtopping time appeared not to be a function of the outer slope. The variation of flow depth and velocity in time can be approached with a linear function. The new equations for wave overtopping are compared to the results obtained by tests with the wave overtopping simulator. The wave overtopping simulator is a machine which is able to simulate wave overtopping on a dike on full scale. Despite the difficulties in measuring velocities and flow depths during these tests, one can conclude that the wave overtopping simulator works very well. Storms with high overtopping discharges can be simulated accurately for testing strength and stability of a dike.","wave overtopping; flow depth; overtopping load; crest; inner slope","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","The dune erosion prediction method presently used in the safety assessment of the Dutch dune coast was developed for situations with wave periods up to 12 seconds. New insights predict that situations with wave periods larger than 12 seconds can be expected. Preliminary analyses of the potential influence of larger wave periods on dune erosion indicate that more erosion occurs for a larger wave period. The objective of this study is to examine the performance of the process-based model DUROSTA model regarding the influence of the wave period, using large scale physical model tests. Results from the physical model tests and DUROSTA simulations are analysed for two wave periods, i.e. peak wave periods of 12 and 18 seconds. The performance of the different sub models in DUROSTA is examined in more detail, to obtain better insight in the physical processes within in the model. It is concluded that the wave propagation model functions well in the near dune area. DUROSTA underestimates undertow velocities and near dune sediment concentrations significantly. In both the large scale experiments and in the DUROSTA simulations a wave period effect presents itself mainly in higher sediment concentrations, rather than in higher undertow velocities. Morphodynamic computations are carried out to study the integral performance of DUROSTA. It is concluded that in general the profile development is well simulated for both wave periods. A clear wave period effect is observed in terms of erosion volumes. After 2.04 hours (5.0 hours in prototype) the relative increase in erosion volume is 25 percent in the physical model tests and 35 percent in DUROSTA computations. A detailed analysis of the results shows that slope effects and the method used for extrapolation of transport over the dry profile, have a large influence on predicting dune erosion with the DUROSTA model.","dune erosion; wave period; durosta; physical model tests","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Slob, E.C. (mentor)","2007","A recent novel technique known as seismic interferometry makes use of seismic ‘noise’ to reconstruct a Green’s function between two receivers by crosscorrelation. This technique can be applied for example in permanent subsurface monitoring using passive seismics or the creation of virtual sources on positions where only recordings were made. The aim of this thesis is to derive and understand equations for seismoelectric interferometry. The first part of this thesis focusses on a the calculation of SH-TE seismoelectrical responses in a 2D horizontally stratified earth. We decompose the two-way wave equation for SH-TE waves into upgoing and downgoing waves which we relate through a reflectivity formulation. The reflectivity formulation is based upon reflection matrices only, even though we can simulate both reflection and transmission experiments. We solve the SH-TE seismoelectric system in a 1D homogeneous world. In the second part of this thesis we derive interferometric Green’s fucntion representations from reciprocity theorems that relate two different states in one domain. Interferometric Green’s function representations express the Green’s function between two receivers as a function of crosscorrelations of responses of sources throughout a domain and on it’s boundary. We cast the seismoelectric system in a general diffusion, flow and wave equation and define a Green’s matrix for all different field and source types. Using this formulation we derive a source-receiver reciprocity relation for the Green’s matrix from the convolution type reciprocity theorem. The correlation type reciprocity theorem for the Green’s matrix is modified using source-receiver reciprocity to obtain the interferometric Green’s function representation. We study the SH-TE seismoelectrical interferometric representation 1D and 2D in homogeneous media. A seismoelectric interferometric representation was written to recover the causal response of the particle velocity at position B due to a electrical current source at position A, as a function of cross correlations of electric field recordings at A and particle velocity recordings at B. Provided there exists a dense coverage of sources in the domain and on it’s boundary, the representation was validated in both 1D and 2D. Approximations to the interferometric representation are investigated by studying the contributions of parts of the domain and boundary integrals. It was found that a dominant spurious event resides in the separate contributions of the domain and boundary integrals, that destructively interferes when both contributions are combined. The role of different source types in the interferometric representation was studied. In a homogeneous medium the measured events have propagated either as an electromagnetic wave or as a shear wave. The dominant contribution to the reconstruction of an electromagnetic event is by electromagnetic sources. Similarly, can the reconstructed shear wave event be attributed mainly due to seismic sources. In a medium with low electromagnetic and shear wave losses we could ignore the domain integral, this will result in amplitude errors and we will suffer from spurious events.","seismoelectric; interferometry; green's function","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Applied Earth Sciences/Applied Geophysics","",""

Situated between the Sierra Nevada and coastal mountain ranges Californias Central Valley is characterized by its flatness and dominated by agriculture as well as large cities as Sacramento. The Sacramento River and San Joaquin River originate in the Sierra Nevada and gather in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta which is mainly situated below sea level. Floods have threatened the area already for a long time, mainly through storm surges from the San Francisco Bay, river runoff from the Sierra Nevada and earthquakes. Not only the Central Valley and the Delta are endangered, also the fresh water supply for 33 million people is at stake, while water is transported from north to south through the Delta. In this thesis the Dutch water defense system and the system in California as well as sometimes the whole US are compared. The flat areas below sea level and similar recent floods (1993/1995 river floods in the Netherlands and 1997 river floods in California) make exchange of knowledge worthwhile, while the damage that earthquakes could cause is something not well known in the Netherlands. A more detailed comparison is made of levee evaluation methods. The Netherlands has already a long history of levee evaluation with special evaluation documents, while in the US, where the levee knowledge is mainly based on dams, current investigations in the New Orleans area and California stimulate the thinking on how to evaluate levees. Probably the most interesting difference between the current US and Dutch levee evaluation practice is how levee underseepage or piping is evaluated. Comparison of the Mississippi cases where the US criterion is based on cases from the 1940s and 1950s and the Dutch criteria result in some interesting results and even more questions. Both the Dutch as well as the US criteria are not always satisfying and the model restrictions, which are not always clear, make their applicability sometimes questionable. More exchange of knowledge between the Dutch and US levee specialists could be useful for both the American levees as the Dutch levees! Cooperation between the two countries should be stimulated and welcomed.","levees; dikes; California; piping; evaluation","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

Natural conditions like low visibility, extreme colds and ice make it nearly impossible to navigate and therefore restrict workability immensely. The thesis focuses on the occurrences of certain concentrations of sea ice, air temperatures and their combined events. Based on these findings a probabilistic approach allows the definition of risk features over defined spatial and temporal domains. Such results will allow a-priori project management for safe Arctic navigation and pipelay operations regarding the conditions under consideration. The probabilities of occurrence for sea ice concentrations above 0% and 30% have been determined by calculating the relative frequency over 33 years. To analyze the effect of air temperatures and ice existence on navigability and operability, occurrences of both surface air temperatures and sea ice have been determined. The combined events include: - Thresholds for surface air temperatures. * -15 Celsius, current structural limit; * -40 Celsius, designated structural limit; * -5 Celsius, where icing may start to form. - Thresholds for ice concentrations. * 0% ice concentration, current structural limit; * 30% ice concentration, assumed allowed conditions with ice classification.

(mentor)","2007","The subject of this thesis is the development of a method for reducing drag in turbulent flows, by means of the application of dented surfaces. This drag changing phenomenon is called the Dented Surface Effect (DSE). DSE makes use of dent-like cavities in the surface of an object, which influence the fluid flow over the surface. The literature presently known about DSE is not clear about the drag reducing capabilities of DSE. Research confirming drag reduction exists, but there are also experiments which do not support the drag reducing capabilities of DSE. First goal of this research is confirming if DSE is able to reduce drag. This is done by trying to recreate the results found in an experiment [Vida, 2004] which claims to reduce drag. If indeed a drag reduction is encountered the most important objective of this thesis is to discover the drag-reducing mechanism of DSE, because it is not known why DSE does reduce drag. Last objective of this thesis is the optimization of the drag reduction.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

This concerns analysis of field measurements carried out since closure of the Zuider Sea (1932) as well as an assessment of possible imporvements of long-term morphological prodictions made for this area using ASMITA. From field measurements basin characteristics can be derived. In former studies this was done using fixed water levels and fixed basin boundaries. Comparison with characteristics determined using actual water levels and/or actual boundaries leads to the conclusion that both the movement of the basin boundaries and the variation of water levels have a significant influence on observed trends in the development of basin characteristics. Basin boundaries in this study are defined as lines between basins, where deviation of current velocities is minimal. Current velocities are determined using a 2DH tidal flow model. A shift of this hydrodynamic boundary between Marsdiep and Vlie basins towards the east can be observed in the period considered. The considered adjustments to ASMITA deal with adaptation of the element surface areas in time, reassessment of the equilibrium coefficients, sediment exchange over boundaries between different basins and movement of these basin boundaries. Regarding sediment exchange over the boundaries it is concluded that the present formulation to express sediment exchange between elements does not model the driving forces of sediment movement over the boundaries correctly. Prescribing the movement of basin boundaries during ASMITA simulations leads to the conclusion that in addition to a direct change of basin characteristics due to the movement of these boundaries also the changes of the tidal prism have a significant effect on calculated developments of element volumes and areas.","morphology; long-term modelling; Dutch Wadden Sea; asmita","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

The objective of the project is: To develop a method or system to temporarily increase the dike strength during flood wave conditions. Here, the dike strength in its broadest sense is meant. This means that besides the crest height also other properties are considered. Generally, the dike height is designed with respect to a certain normative water level. The protection level is herewith based on the overtopping and overflowing mechanism. Besides overtopping and overflowing other mechanisms, especially piping, could contribute to dike failure. The project further focuses on these two failure mechanisms. The proposed emergency measure against overtopping is the traditional temporary crest heightening. The proposed measure against piping is the creation of a water berm at the inner side of the dike. The latter decreases the head difference between the river and land side of the dike by inundation of an area behind the dike. Both measures make use of some sort of water retaining system. A system that is very suitable for this purpose is a water-filled tube type of system since it has a good performance on the aspects costs, deployment, stability and applicability. The system consists of two parallel tubes connected at one point. Because piping could become a problem when the system is placed on permeable subsoil, the standard twin tube design is adapted by adding a sealing sheet in front of the tubes to increase the piping length. Finally the reliability of the system is assessed by examining the different failure modes. Especially the logistic feasibility is discussed. The logistic feasibility gives a first rough indication of the possible scale of application.","temporary flood defense; emergency flood protection; piping; water berm","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); De Boer, E. (mentor); Verhaeghe, R.J. (mentor); Zoeteman, A. (mentor); Kop, F. (mentor)","2007","In dit rapport zal worden gezocht naar een antwoord op de vraag of life- cycle management kan bijdragen in de langdurige onderhoudsplanning van snelwegen die past bij de veranderde rol van Rijkswaterstaat. Het doel is een model te ontwerpen dat de onderhoudsplanning kan helpen optimaliseren. Daarbij is het de bedoeling dat het model een antwoord kan geven op de volgende vragen: Wanneer is het optimale moment om welk soort onderhoud te doen; Wat zijn de financiële consequenties van de planning en wat is het effect op de kwaliteit van de weg. Met kwaliteit van de weg wordt kwaliteit in de breedste zin bedoeld. Hier- mee wordt niet alleen de staat van de weg bedoeld, maar ook de mate van beschikbaarheid van de weg. Drie veranderingen geven aanleiding voor dit onderzoek:  Sinds het midden van de 20ste eeuw is de welvaart in Nederland gegroeid. De toenemende welvaart zorgt voor een aanhoudende groei van de mobiliteitsvraag. Door deze groei en een langzamere groei van beschikbare infrastructuur, wordt infrastructuur schaarser. Door de schaarste is het steeds moeilijker om een hogere betrouwbaarheid en beschikbaarheid van de infrastructuur te realiseren. Alleen door efficiënter gebruik te maken van de bestaande wegen, spoor- en vaarwegen kan deze mobiliteitsgroei worden opgevangen.  De politiek heeft ervoor gekozen de beheerder van de snelwegen in Nederland, Rijkswaterstaat, een andere rol te geven. In navolging van de wegbeheerders in veelal Angelsaksische landen en Scandinavië moet de organisatie meer de regie van het onderhoud in handen nemen en zich minder met het onderhoud zelf bezighouden [Rijkswaterstaat 2004]. Korte onderhoudscontracten worden vervangen door langdurige integrale onderhoudscontracten, de zogehete geïntegreerde contracten. Deze contracten hebben een looptijd van minimaal 7 jaar en behelzen alle onderdelen van de infrastructuur. Ze zijn gefocust op trajecten en niet op afzonderlijke componenten zoals het wegdek. Voor nieuwe we- gen wordt steeds vaker een publiek private samenwerking als contract- vorm gekozen. Met behulp van privaat geld wordt de weg gefinancierd, waarna de overheid betaalt voor beschikbare wegcapaciteit aan de private investeerder. Verder is rekeningrijden een belangrijk aspect om de mobiliteit in Nederland op peil te houden [nota mobiliteit].  De marktpartijen in het onderhoud (aannemers) zijn geïnteresseerd in deze geïntegreerde contracten, omdat ze daarmee vrijheid hebben om optimalisatie te zoeken, innovaties in te brengen en daarmee ook meer marge te realiseren. De aannemers willen meer worden afgerekend op prestaties dan op hoeveelheid verricht werk. De 3 bovenstaande veranderingen leiden er toe dat de rol van Rijkswater- staat verandert naar die van een asset manager, die het totale netwerk stuurt op prestaties. Geïntegreerde contracten en het meer op afstand plaatsen van de onderhoudsplanning en werkzaamheden en het beheren van 1 netwerk leiden tot een andere situatie. Rijkswaterstaat zal genoeg in- formatie moeten bezitten om in het contract, voor elk onderdeel van het netwerk, met de aannemer de juiste prestaties en prijzen vast te kunnen leggen. Hiervoor is een ander instrumentarium nodig dan tot op heden wordt gebruikt in de contractvorming tussen Rijkswaterstaat en aannemers. Bij de huidige onderhoudsplanning wordt gebruik gemaakt van bestaande voorspellingen voor levensduren. Bij een afwijking van de normale levens- duur van een onderdeel, wordt er eerder onderhouden. Impliciet wordt hierdoor op het meest ideale moment onderhoud gepleegd aan dat bepaal- de onderdeel (bijvoorbeeld de ZOAB deklaag). Echter, hierdoor ontstaat echter een suboptimale oplossing, omdat er naar alle onderdelen (deklaag, verlichting, geluidsschermen, berm, kunstwerken etc.) apart wordt gekeken. Integraal wordt er door de kennis van de experts wel impliciet geoptimaliseerd, echter dit wordt niet expliciet in kaart gebracht. Bij het aanbesteden van het beheer van een wegdeel, bijvoorbeeld met een geïntegreerd contract, is er behoefte om met behulp van levenscycluskos- ten (lifecycle management) de kosten voor onderhoud en de risico’s in de kosten in te kunnen schatten voor de duur van het contract. Als asset manager wil Rijkswaterstaat het netwerk optimaliseren, waarbij met partijen die onderdelen daarvan in tijdelijk beheer hebben, duidelijke prestatie nor- men worden vastgelegd en planningen van deze beheerders op elkaar worden afgestemd. Dit houdt een verschuiving in van de filosofie bij infra- structuuronderhoud: het bepalen van onderhoudsstrategieën zal er naast ervaring aan de hand van de technische staat meer gebruik worden ge- maakt van voorspellingen en analyses van computermodellen op basis van kennis en statistiek. Lifecycle management, of Lifecycle cost analyse (LCCA), is een economische evaluatietechniek over de levensduur van een kapitaalgoed (bijvoorbeeld weg, spoorlijn of machine) die verschillende alternatieven met elkaar vergelijkt. De verschillende alternatieven houden verschillen in bouw, onderhoud, controle en gebruik in. Alle kosten zoals aanleg, onderhoud, beheer, eventuele inkomsten en soms sloopkosten worden meegenomen [Blanchard, 1992]. Het doel van een LCM is te komen tot een set van alternatieven dat over de levensduur de laagste kosten voor de eigenaar (en gebruiker) met zich meebrengt. De beste balans tussen alle alternatieven is gevonden wanneer de lifecycle kosten het laagste zijn. Voor het ontwikkelen van een lifecycle model, welke Rijkswaterstaat onder- steunt in haar rol als asset manager, is het nodig om inzicht te krijgen in:  de kosten van aanleg van de complete weg;  de schadesoorten van de verschillende wegonderdelen;  onderhoudsmogelijkheden van de verschillende wegonderdelen;  mogelijkheden, kosten en effecten van wegafzettingen;  kosten van verschillende typen onderhoud;  waarde van beschikbaarheid van een weg;  mogelijkheden tot optimaliseren van de verschillende soorten levensduren van de verschillende wegonderdelen. Voor een goede modellering van de onderhoudsbehoefte van een snelweg wordt een snelweg opgedeeld in meerdere onderdelen. De verschillende wegonderdelen hebben allen een andere levensduur en onderhoudbehoefte. Al deze onderdelen hebben een heel pakket aan onderhoudsmaatregelen. Sommige maatregelen worden toestandsafhankelijk uitgevoerd, echter de meeste maatregelen gebeuren volgens een vaste frequentie. De degradatie van de deklaag asfaltbeton en de betondegradatie van kunstwerken kunnen met behulp van degradatieformules worden gemodelleerd. Deze formules zijn gebruiksafhankelijk en stochastisch verdeeld, om zo een waarheidsgetrouwe weergave te krijgen. Na bepaling van de hoe- veelheid onderhoud, worden de effecten voor de kosten en voor de gebruiker uitgerekend. Het spreekt voor zich dat het clusteren van onderhouds- werkzaamheden voor onderdelen waarvan het onderhoud gelijk valt een besparing oplevert ten opzichte van apart onderhouden. Dit levert dus niet alleen voor de beheerder winst, ook voor de gebruiker; de weg is minder vaak afgezet. Voor het clusteren van onderdelen met een verschillende levensduur of onderhoudsbehoefte kan een model uitkomst geven. Het eer- der uitvoeren van onderhoud, betekent onderhoud plegen op een niet optimaal moment. Hierdoor wordt dus eigenlijk geld verloren, omdat er eerder dan fysiek nodig wordt onderhouden. Dit is eigenlijk kapitaalvernietiging. Of het verlies opweegt tegen de winst die het clusteren met zich meebrengt, kan een model met levensduren, kosten voor onderhoud en waarde voor de bereikbaarheid goed berekenen. Als casestudie de A9, traject 9a, van hm 5.6 - 11 (de Gaasperdammerweg) gekozen. Het traject is door de geringe lengte (5.4 km) goed te modelleren en omdat elke 100 meter weg eigen gegevens met zich meebrengt. Het hele traject heeft 2 rijstroken en is het voorzien van matrixborden en verlichting, evenals geluidswallen, waardoor dit traject gezien kan worden als een representatieve weg. Verder heeft dit traject door de ligging parallel aan de A10 zuid, een goede omleidingroute, zodat eventueel ’s nachts een hele rijbaan afgesloten kan worden. Dit stuk snelweg is in 2005 geheel onderhouden, waardoor recente data voor het onderhouden van dit stuk snelweg bekend zijn. De scenario’s die in het model zijn doorgerekend, zijn de volgende:  onderhoudsfilosofie zoals nu toegepast wordt door Rijkswaterstaat;  de goedkoopste oplossing op basis van een minimum kwaliteit;  de beste oplossing als de hoeveelheid verkeershinder ook wordt mee- genomen in de afwegingen. Uit de bovenstaande scenario’s kan worden geconcludeerd dat het integraal bekijken en toedelen van onderhoud aan een snelweg kan leiden tot andere keuzes dan in het huidige onderhoud. Er kan worden geconcludeerd dat een model, zoals voor dit rapport g bruikt, een betrouwbaar beeld geeft van de onderhoudsbehoefte over de tijd en van de consequenties van het uit te voeren onderhoudsregime in zowel kwalitatieve (kwaliteit van de weg) als kwantitatieve (uitgaven) zin weer. Verder geeft het model een goed inzicht in de risico’s, die langdurige onderhoudscontracten met zich mee brengen. Door de verdeling in de voorspelling van levensduren, kan in een set uitkomsten het groot onderhoud bijvoorbeeld tweemaal in plaats van éénmaal voorkomen. Om deze risico’s in kaart te brengen, is gebruik gemaakt van een Montecarlo analyse. Hierbij is de onzekerheid van bepaalde factoren ingevoerd en er worden 1.000 sets van antwoorden gegenereerd. Hiermee ontstaat een beeld van de spreidingen in de antwoorden. Tot slot kan worden geconcludeerd dat een integrale benadering voor onderhoud, over meerdere onderdelen heen, een aanzet is tot kosten besparing in het wegenonderhoud. Door middel van modellen, die voortdurend gekalibreerd worden, kan een kostenverlaging voor snelwegonderhoud snel worden gerealiseerd. Het huidige model heeft echter wel uitbreidingen en verdere kalibratie nodig. Vooral de onderdelen van levensduren voor deklagen en de bepaling voor voertuig verliesuren moeten in verder onderzoek verder worden uitgediept. Het model zoals dat gebruikt is echter een belangrijk hulpmiddel bij het invoeren van lifecycle management en het bepalen van prestatiemaatstaven voor geïntegreerde contracten.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","Environmental awareness and sustainable development have been popular themes over the last few years. To improve dikes along the estuaries in Zeeland (The Netherlands) where a high foreland with natural areas of salt marshes is present, alternatives to stone revetments are examined. From a natural and aesthetic point of view, a slope covered with vegetation is preferred, because in this way a more gradual transition between the salt marshes and the dike with the hinterland is obtained. Revetments which obtain their strength from the grass cover or the clay layer are possible alternatives. This research project looks at the possibility of using a thick clay layer to form a sustainable and feasible revetment for the outer slope of sea dikes in the presence of a high foreland, with sufficient strength and stability to withstand a normative load, a design storm. This research concentrates on the behaviour of clay under wave loading and the influencing factors on this behaviour, because there is still little knowledge on this behaviour of cohesive material. All large scale experiments which involve clay under wave loading are investigated and compared in this research. This resulted into a complete overview, which is analysed to obtain new valuable conclusions and to validate existing conclusions and assumptions. The behaviour of clay is researched with respect to the development of erosion, the location of erosion and the shape of erosion profile. The influence of the clay condition, the soil structure development, on the strength of the clay under a wave load appears to be significant. Within the subdivision in clay conditions, the clay type (the sand percentage of the clay) and the wave conditions are of influence. Comparisons with the erosion behaviour of sand and with observations in actual storms give additional conclusions on the behaviour of clay and a validation of the conclusions from the experiments. Clay appears to have a significantly lower erosion rate than sand; the experiments however show less erosion development over time than in actual storms was observed. A semi quantitative model to determine the erosion depth of a clay layer over time under wave loading was developed in this research. Also a formula to the soil structure development over time and in depth was developed for this. The model is developed in a way that it can be extended if more influencing factors on the erosion process are quantified. A case study to Het Verdronken Land van Saeftinghe was performed with the semi quantitative model. On the basis of this research it can be concluded that a thick clay layer can possibly form an environmentally acceptable alternative to stone revetments, however research is not yet sufficient enough.","revetment; clay; erosion; soil structure; outer slope","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Mulder, W.A. (mentor)","2007","The aim of this project is to compute, as accurately as possible, the electric field – with the diffusive approximation (ωε→ 0) – in the upper half space (e.g., air), in the lower half space (i.e., ground or sediments), and at the surface, for an x-directed electric dipole point source J ̂_1^e located just above – or just below – the interface between the two half-spaces. From this electric field, the magnetic field can be determined. No important magnetic contrast are modeled, thus the magnetic permeability in the lower half space µ1 is considered equal to the magnetic permeability in the upper half space µ0, which is the magnetic permeability in vacuum, i.e., 4π x 10-7 H/m. The main goal is to improve the numerical accuracy of time-domain electromagnetic modeling by computing as accurately as possible, and as efficiently as possible, the primary field for all distances with respect to the source. In order to do so, the expressions for the electric field are treated analytically and approximations, based on the Taylor series expansion of the vertical propagation factor Γ, may be implemented. The near field and far field approximations are based on the idea of writing the Sommerfeld type integrals in terms of a series of semi-infinite integrals with a known solution in a closed form. The approximation for the near field presented in this undertaking is based on the Taylor series expansion of the expression of the vertical propagation factor Γn assuming a homogeneous medium, i.e., when the electrical conductivity σm approaches the electrical conductivity σn, with m and n the two media of the configuration. This approximation provides good results for the electric field within a radius defined approximately by 2 times the Skin depth of the lower half space. The approximation for the far field presented in this undertaking is based on the Taylor series expansion of the expression of the vertical propagation factor Γn assuming small wave numbers. This approximation provides good results for the electric field beyond a radius defined approximately by 3 times the Skin depth of the lower half space. Both approximations may complement each other in order to obtain the primary field for the whole 3-D space. This will depend on the contrast of the model involved and the frequency implemented, since smaller contrasts are better modeled by the near field approximation. High contrasts, as present in a model air homogeneous earth, may cause problems on computing an accurate intermediate field, i.e., approximately at distances between 2 to 3 times the Skin depth. However, the application of an approximation valid for short vertical distances z may contribute to compute accurate results near the boundary. This approximation for short z has been presented to be valid for all horizontal offsets r – including the intermediate field – and for vertical offsets z up to at least 500 m height. As a consequence, this approximation might be implemented for modeling airborne EM, where generally the flight height is about 100 to 150 m. Efficiency and accuracy are the principal attributes of the computation of the background field by applying the near and far field approximations. This is demonstrated by comparing with other numerical methods. Efficiency of a method to compute the background field is an important issue because it consists of only a small part of a whole process of modeling the electromagnetic fields. Furthermore, the accurate primary field can be subtracted from the full field by considering it as a source term in the set of electromagnetic fields equations. The scattering field, i.e., the one that brings relevant information from the subsurface, would be therefore computed in a more precise manner. Special emphasis has been given to the case with the upper half space representing a lossless medium (i.e., σ0→ 0), which is associated with air. In other words, special emphasis has been given to the applicability of the local method to model land CSEM measurements, where the receivers are placed in the upper half space just above the boundary (i.e., on the surface).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Applied Earth Sciences","","","",""

Daartoe wordt eerst de theorie over evacuatie (gedrag) samengevat. Bij de theorievorming bespreken we de voornaamste aspecten welk invloed uitoefenen op het keuzegedrag van de evacués. Het betreft dan de keuzen om deel te nemen aan de evacuatie, en (eventueel) het vertrektijdstip, de veilige bestemming en de evacuatie route. De theorie wordt gebruikt als basis voor het beschreven evacuatie model. Het evacuatie model bestaat uit drie componenten, welk respectievelijk de dynamische vervoersvraag, het adaptieve en-route reis keuze gedrag en de dynamische verkeersafwikkeling modelleren. De dynamische vervoersvraag component en de adaptieve en-route reis keuze gedrag component modelleren de evacuatie participatie en vertrektijdstip keuze, respectievelijk de evacuatie bestemming en route keuze. De afwikkeling van de verkeersstromen wordt dan gemodelleerd door de macroscopische dynamisch verkeersafwikkeling component, gebaseerd op de dynamische calamiteit en verkeerscondities. Zoals eerder genoemd, kan met het beschreven model verschillende typen evacuatie schema’s geëvalueerd worden. Naast het variëren van de evacuatie instructies (vertrektijdstip, bestemming en route), zijn ook verschillende typen instructies mogelijk. Het type instructies varieert dan van aanbevelingen tot bindende instructies (bevelen). Binnen het beschreven evacuatie model is het waarschijnlijke gedragsrespons van de evacués realistischer, aangezien er rekening wordt gehouden met het denkbeeld en de wensen en intenties van de evacués. Daardoor is het mogelijk dat evacuatie instructies (gedeeltelijk) gevolgd worden, of genegeerd worden door de individuele evacués. Het model is in staat om te gaan met een calamiteit dat toeslaat voordat de evacuatie is begonnen, of toeslaat tijdens de evacuatie. In deze gevallen, kan de calamiteit de evacués in gevaar brengen en de evacuatie hinderen. Het hinderen van de evacuatie gebeurt doordat de calamiteit ervoor zorgt dat delen van het netwerk ontoegankelijk worden. Door de mogelijke netwerk versperringen te simuleren, kan de autoriteit het effect ervan anticiperen en zo nodig het evacuatie schema aanpassen. Tot slot kunnen we stellen dat het beschreven evacuatie model mogelijk een autoriteit kan assisteren bij het zoeken naar het meest geschikte evacuatie schema. Om de potentie van het beschreven model te illustreren in het plannen van grootschalige evacuaties, is het model geprogrammeerd in Matlab en toegepast op een hypothetische bosbrand evacuatie in de Berowra Valley, ten noorden van Sydney, Australië.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

The new actuator relies on axial compression to amplify deflections and control forces simultaneously. Two designs employing morphing wing panels based on PBP actuators were conceived. One design relied on a change in curvature of the actuators to control the camber of the airfoil. Axial compression of the actuators was ensured by means of rubber bands and increased end rotation levels with almost a factor of two up to +/- 13.6deg peak-to-peak, with excellent correlation between theory and experiment. Wind tunnel tests quantitatively proved that wing morphing induced roll acceleration levels in excess of 1500deg/sˆ2. A second design employed PBP actuators in a wing panel with significant thickness, relying on a highly compliant Latex skin to allow for shape deformation and at the same time induce an axial force on the actuators. Bench tests showed that due to the axial compression provided by the skin end rotations were increased with more than a factor of two up to +/- 15.8deg peak-to-peak up to a break frequency of 34Hz. Compared to conventional electromechanical servoactuaters, the PBP actuators showed a net reduction in flight control system weight, slop and power consumption for minimal part count. Both morphing wing concepts showed that PBP piezoelectric actuators have significant benefits over conventional actuators and can be successfully applied to induce aircraft control.","adaptive; morphing; piezoelectric; postbuckled","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Aerospace Engineering, Design of Aircraft and Rotorcraft","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

Sizes approaching the 10MW capacity will have a rotor diameter somewhere in the order of 170m. This could mean much higher loads and more flexible blade designs than current MW wind turbines, most probably resulting in aeroelastic instabilities not commonly seen in the machines of today. Load control on an aerofoil using actuated trailing edge flaps could be a means to mitigate this issue. Load control on future wind turbines should serve three main goals: - Improve the fatigue life - Reduce extreme loads •- Improve aeroelastic stability The two most important are fatigue life and aeroelastic stability; as these are the likely design drivers for future giant wind turbines (10MW and beyond). The content of this report is focused on the effects of trailing edge flaps on the aeroelastic stability of a rotor (‘Smart’ Rotor), in particular, the two degree of freedom Flap-Torsion Flutter instability - Classical Flutter. Current research has shown promising results for load reduction on an aerofoil using trailing edge flaps. The aeroelastic model employed in this study uses Theodorsen’s theory for a flat-plate aerofoil with a trailing edge flap for determination of the lift coefficient. A basic BEM aerodynamic model determines the induced forces on the blades with a blade structural response exhibited according to a modal representation of a blade (eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies). The aeroelastic model of the wind turbine (rigid hub – no tower interaction) is designed with the intention to capture the Classical Flutter instability so that a simple controller for an actuated trailing edge flap can be investigated to show if controllability on the Flutter limits is achievable. The final goal is to show that it could be feasible for giant wind turbines to avoid Flutter regions in their normal operational envelope with implementation of the ‘Smart’ rotor concept.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor)","2007","Biological systems present a complexity beyond intuitive comprehension and to obtain a better understanding of the behaviour of the living organisms, large scale dynamic mathematical models are employed. From a system biology perspective, these models should not only describe the kinetic behavior of metabolic reaction networks that feature metabolite-enzyme interactions (allosteric feedback or feed forward), intercompartmental transport, and cofactor coupling, but, they should also ultimately allow combining several pathways (horizontal modeling) and/or “omic” levels (vertical modeling) in the cell. However, currently by far most of the available models are limited to only one pathway and one “omic” level. In this work, a large scale kinetic metabolic model of Penicillium chrysogenum is developed, which aims to encompassing all the major pathways present in the organism. In constructing the kinetic model, we first define the stoichiometric network presented in van Gulik et al. (2000), which consists of 188 metabolites and 167 reactions located in 3 compartments (cytosol, mitochondria and peroxisome) and postulated a kinetic expression for each of the reactions. We used approximative linlog kinetics for the rate expressions, which allowed us to represent the enzyme-metabolite kinetic interactions by an elasticity matrix. Information on the presence and absence of mass action and allosteric enzyme kinetic information was obtained from literature survey and database search. The final values of the elasticities needed to be estimated by fitting the model to the available short term kinetic response data. Two major limitations have been encountered regarding the measurements of metabolites: (1) measurement of a metabolite at all and (2) compartmentation, i.e. measurements of metabolites/reactions that are present in multiple compartments (Nasution et al. 2006). To deal with the compartmentation problem, the system has been reduced 89 metabolites and 75 reactions within one compartment, by lumping, using insights gained both from biochemical knowledge and from data recently published by our group on short term kinetic responses of primary metabolism of Penicillium chrysogenum (Nasution et al. 2006). The limited number of available measurements was dealt by data-driven model reduction while applying the parameter estimation scheme to the large model. To estimate the kinetic parameters, the aim was to followed the methodology presented in Nikerel et al. (2006) in which the theory was applied to a small example system. However due to time constrains no kinetic parameter has been estimated.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Biotechnology","","Bioprocesstechnology","",""

This topic is interesting, since almost all known diseases lead to irregularities in the signal transduction. Several aspects of the analysis of signal transduction networks are discussed. A model of the TOR signaling pathway is used as case study to illustrate the methods. Among others, the first known quantification method for eukaryotic robustness of signal transduction cascades against natural occurring variations in protein concentration has been described. Analysis of the TOR pathway revealed that cellular import of rapamycin is an essential step in the pathway, which demands attention. It was argued that this step was probably insufficiently paid attention to in the model syntheses step. It is also a possibility to improve the model of the TOR pathway.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Biotechnology","","Bioprocesstechnology","",""
