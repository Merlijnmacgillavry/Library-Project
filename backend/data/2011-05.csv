This part of the project aims more specifically on the effect of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) on the flow inside the pulmonary system. COPD causes loss of elastic support of the airways which leads to airway collapse during exhalation. As a first step towards a complete understanding of this type of flow, there is focused in this report on the flow inside a rigid, collapsed tube. PIV measurements are done in order to obtain 2D vector fields. A total of four tubes with different rates of collapse are investigated. Three different types of flow are simulated. Steady flow, flow with a step change in flow direction and oscillating flow with a sinusoidal flow rate. This last type of flow resembles a normal, human breathing pattern. Unlike the real situation where the Reynolds number is below one, the Reynolds number during the experiments performed is equal to 64, 191 and 350. Besides the experiments itself there is focused on obtaining optimal measurement and post-processing conditions to reduce the peak-locking effect inherent to PIV measurements.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2011","With the market becoming increasingly competitive, there is a pressure to deliver systems with more functionality and at the same cost, which thus leads to more complexity in terms of number of components. Moreover, the society is becoming increasingly dependent on these systems for its critical functions. This coupled with shrinking time-to-market and reducing life-cycle, creates a need to and ways to ensure reliability of these complex systems both effciently and quickly. Due to large size and complexity of modern day systems, fault-finding problem is a non-trivial one. Traditionally, Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) is used to locate faults in the hardware. A prerequisite for MBD is the accurate model of the components. However, modeling of such complex components requires huge effort, time and expertise. Earlier, a spectrum-based hardware solution named BACINOL was proposed to diagnose the hardware system without the aid of a component model. But BACINOL suffers from low diagnosis quality due to large size of ambiguity sets in the final diagnosis. In this thesis, we introduce a new spectrum-based hardware diagnosis technique ANTARES. It attempts to break these ambiguity sets by providing a better estimate of system's False Negative Rate (FNR) information to the diagnosis method. A series of experiments are performed on the ISCAS benchmark circuits to compare the performance of ANTARES with BACINOL and MBD. Results clearly show that ANTARES has better diagnosis quality as compared to BACINOL but has lower performance than MBD.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","","",""

These measurements are often performed by means of time-to-digital converters, that for these applications, require high resolution, accuracy, and throughput. This is often accomplished using custom circuitry, which entails high cost, long development time, and low flexibility. Other time measurement implementations, such as TDCs implemented on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), have been studied to meet the demands of time measurement without the drawbacks of custom circuitry. This thesis presents an FPGA-based TDC with many advantages of custom circuitry but few of the drawbacks. A characterization of the TDC, based on a Virtex-6 FPGA, is executed and many influences on performance are described, including distortions from the FPGA architecture, temperature effects, intra-chip position variation, and chip-to-chip variation. The TDC has 10ps resolution, 3.85LSB integral non-linearity, and a throughput of 300MS/s. Some directions for future work are presented, with the possibility to improve FPGAbased TDCs even more.

(mentor); Melles, M. (mentor)","2011","Project purpose The purpose of this project is to design a method which supports designers in creating accessible mobile web interfaces for visual disabled users. This will be done by formulating a set of design principles which describe the do’s and don’ts of accessible mobile web design. Background Visual disabled people cannot interact with mobile devices the way normal people do. Whether an interface is accessible or not depends on two factors. First of all, back-end software, such as magnification software and screenreaders, should be able to transcribe the information to and/or from the interface correctly. Secondly, the interface itself should be designed in such a way that the back-end software is able to transcribe its information. In other words: the interface and the back-end software should speak the same language. If either one of these factors does not meet the requirements, the user-interface interaction cannot function properly. This project is about the second factor, designing the accessibility of the interface itself. User research How should mobile web interfaces be designed in order to make them accessible to people with visual disabilities? Based on user research, the purpose of this section was to clarify who visually disabled people really are and how they interact with mobile web applications. Five visual disabled participants were personally interviewed and observed while working with several mobile web interfaces. They stated that mobile web accessibility is of significant importance to them because it greatly supports freedom and independence. Furthermore mobile web interfaces are mainly used for general orientation and managing travel schedules. In this manner apps are clearly preferred over websites due to the limited amount of information, the simple and consistent structure and the immediate access to the user’s target. Following from the results a set of design principles was formulated for accessible mobile web design. ‘Profound simplicity’ considers the simplicity of hierarchy and the limitation of information. ‘First impressions’ emphasizes that users should be able to read and control information as quick as possible. ‘Screenreader accessibility’ explains that screenreaders should be able to transcribe the information to blind users just like it is intended to sighted users. ‘Magnification accessibility’ accentuates the possibility to magnify the content in an effective way. ‘Substitute solutions for typing’ encourages designers to avoid typing solutions where possible in order to help visual disabled users spare energy. Finally, ‘Use your imagination’ encourages designers to gain understanding of the target group in order to design suitable solutions. Design To demonstrate the effect of the principles on the accessibility level a redesign of the main menu of the app ‘9292OV Pro’ was created. Prior to the design process, the original design was elaborately analysed in order to identify the accessibility benefits and problems. Subsequently a structural and a graphic redesign were created. In preparation of the accessibility test a prototype was developed in cooperation with the company. Accessibility test The prototype was tested in order to verify whether the design principles indeed increase the level of accessibility as intended. A test with five sight impaired and five blind users was set up to compare the accessibility level of the redesign with the original app. The test consisted of some tasks that were executed with both designs. The accessibility level of the designs was evaluated by means of a survey. The results were then analysed on a quantitative and a qualitative level. In general, the analysis has verified that the design principles have a large positive effect on the accessibility level for both sight impaired and blind users. Other than some explicit advantages that were established by the participants, some issues were as well identified considering hierarchy, magnification and substitute solutions for typing. Based on the findings the principles were evaluated and revised in order to optimise their effect on the accessibility level. Discussion Assuming that other mobile devices are supplied with appropriate back-end software in the future, the principles will be eligible for implementation in other industries as well. Other than smartphones, a number of examples are digital photo and video cameras, MP3 players, portable game consoles, tablet PC’s, portable navigation systems for pedestrians and health monitoring devices such as glucose meters. It is important to realize that the formulation of the principles is based on just one interface. Since each interface is unique, it is likely that with other interfaces additional insights can be gained that might be very valuable in completion to the current principles. For this reason the company was recommended to continue testing future interfaces on the level of accessibility.","visual disability; accessibility; interface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Walker, W.E. (mentor); Kwakkel, J.H. (mentor)","2011","Megaprojects are built as a result of a policy that tries to cope with an expected demand in the future. To assess the financial viability of a megaproject, a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is performed, which is very much dependent on the accuracy of predictive models that are used to forecast future demand. The outcomes of these models are very vulnerable to unexpected events (Walker, Rahman et al. 2001). As a result, the CBA becomes unreliable and gives an unrealistic presentation of the financial viability of a project. As a consequence megaprojects suffer from huge cost overruns and overestimated benefits. An alternative way of policymaking that tries to take uncertainty into account is the adaptive policymaking approach. The efficacy of this type of policymaking has already been shown by Kwakkel et al. (2010), but whether this leads to a better cost-benefit performance of megaprojects is unknown. At the moment it is not possible to perform a CBA on an adaptive policy since the CBA method is static opposed to the flexible adaptive policymaking approach. This leads us to a two-folded research question: - How to apply CBA to adaptive policymaking approach? - How good is the cost-benefit performance of megaprojects when using the adaptive policymaking approach compared to cost-benefit performance when using the traditional policymaking approach? A framework was developed that enables us to perform a CBA on an adaptive policy, using real options theory. The FASMAPA model of Kwakkel (2011) has been extended with a CBA module for the case of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, to compare the cost-benefit performance of the traditional policy with the cost-benefit performance of the adaptive policymaking approach. Furthermore, to investigate whether a traditional policy with ad hoc decisionmaking has a better cost-benefit performance than a traditional policy without such decisionmaking, an agent-based model has been developed. The cost-benefit performance of the three policies was investigated for numerous plausible futures using Exploratory Modeling and Analysis (EMA). The results of the simulations showed that the adaptive policymaking approach has a smaller range of plausible Net Present Values, indicating that the adaptive policy can deal better with different futures. In only 5.5% of the simulations did the cost-benefit performance of the traditional policy score better. Concerning the cost-benefit performance of the traditional policy under ad hoc decisionmaking, it turned out that in this case, the performance was slightly worse compared to the cost-benefit performance of a “normal” traditional policy. Overall, it can be concluded that in this case, the cost-benefit performance of the megaproject under the adaptive policymaking approach is better compared to its performance under the traditional policy. This is considered to be a first indication that adaptive policies can improve the cost-benefit performance of megaprojects.","megaprojects; CBA; adaptive policy; traditional policy; real options","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","EPA","",""

(mentor); Tuijthof, G.J. (mentor)","2011","Orthopaedic surgery includes frequent removal of bony tissue with large instruments that require a significant force to operate. An increasing number of surgeons, especially female and older surgeons, cannot operate high-load orthopedic instruments properly because they lack the necessary force or hand span. The goal of this study is to develop a device that assists surgeons with force generation for high-load orthopaedic actions. It should enable surgeons of any age, gender and gripping strength to operate bone excision instruments with their dominant hand only by amplifying the users gripping force. Methods: The device was designed for the “worst case scenario”: a 60 year old female surgeon cutting hard cortical bone with a large rongeur. The device amplification (2.2x) was determined by calculating the discrepancy between the available gripping force for this person (207N) and the maximum bone cutting force (474N), determined by cutting 90 slices of tibia with a large Luer-Stille rongeur. Several qualitative requirements were taken into account, such as maintaining haptic feedback and sterilizibility. The prototype features an amplification mechanism based on ratchets that enables two operating modes: it can either be used like a traditional rongeur or with extra amplification where needed. The device was evaluated by experimentally comparing the amplification of the prototype with the intended amplification. Results: The prototype provided more than the necessary amplification: gripping force is amplified at least 2.8 times in amplification mode. Conclusions: The proposed design shows potential to be a valuable addition to orthopedic instruments because it enables surgeons with less gripping force to cut through hard tissue with one hand. The presented prototype delivers the necessary amplification of gripping force but shows some limitations, for which solutions were presented. When these limitations are solved, clinical testing can be initiated.","orthopedic; rongeur; gripping force; mechanical amplification; ratchet mechanism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

These losses can be reduced by using novel high resistivity materials like plastic bonded magnets and carbon fibre reinforced retaining sleeves. This is an entirely new concept, and little knowledge exists on this specific topic. This thesis investigates the consequences of using these materials for the losses. The resistivity of the materials is not accurately specified and therefore measured first using eddy-currents. Then fast 2D simulations are utilised to determine the dependency of the losses on all parameters, while the lamination thickness of the magnets and the anisotropic sleeve are studied with 3D simulations. The 3D results can be scaled using the 2D results if desired. Some conclusions are that the eddy-currents are resistance limited at all times and that laminating the magnets reduces the losses as expected. The losses in the sleeve are shown not to be negligible, even when the perpendicular resistivity is as high as 10 m?m. Lastly, both the magnet and sleeve losses strongly increase with increasing relative permeability of the magnets, which in turn increases with temperature. Magnets with a low relative permeability should therefore be used.","High Speed Machine; Rotor Losses; Fault Tolerant Machine; 3D Finite Element Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-05-27","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Electrical Power Processing","",""

(mentor); Romero, N. (mentor)","2011","Background Longitudinal field studies are crucial in capturing the dynamics between the interaction with innovative products or services and the evoked experiences on users. The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) is a method originated from psychology and shows potential to use for capturing experiences in design research. The ESM captures user experiences in situ and for long periods of time. However, one drawback of this method is that much effort is asked from the participant. The frequent and often repetitive questions cause annoyance, burden, boredom and ultimately a negative experience. This project is done to find a way to motivate people to participate in an ESM study and to keep them motivated. Based on literature on motivation and existing motivational theories, an understanding is the concept of motivation is clarified and aspects that influence human motivation for certain tasks are outlined. In an exploratory study an analysis is done on motivation in practice. As a result of literature and the explorations, 5 motivation factors are identified: Fun, Benefit, Control, Social, and Coach. These motivation aspects and the accompanying opportunities functions as an analysis tool that helps to structure the design activities. Furthermore 4 stages within an ESM are identified: Reminder, Answering, Contributing, and Feedback. Action From here the projects continuous by focusing on the ESM in projects for Social Connectedness and elderly. The design space narrowed as follows: the design of the full toolkit of the ESM that covers all the stages, but the focus is on motivating the participants by adding a benefit, fun and control in the extra step of ‘Contributing’. Two concepts are developed and tested which provide insights in the effects of different opportunities within the motivation aspects. Reflection The conclusions from the two tested concepts lead to a final concept for the ESM in the Family Connector study; the Memo(t)ry, growing your personal story. This concept exists of an piece of artwork that the participants can grow. It exists of a tree that serves as a decoration in the house. By answering questions in the ESM the participant can grow leaves, flowerbud, flowers and fruits on the tree. The Memo(t)ry reflects the progress in the research, but besides that it is an artwork with a personal story. Because participants are making their own artwork with this tree, the focus of the research is shifted from stress caused by the research to enjoyment of making an artwork. In terms of fun aspects, benefit aspects and control aspects, it is possible to make an ESM research enjoyable. Based on the major insight of shifting the focus from stress to enjoyment, guidelines are developed that can be used by designers when setting up an ESM study with elderly. The main purpose of the guidelines is shifting the focus, and a number of ways are provided to do that. The guidelines include: Prompting Fun - Attract the attention in a fun way, by creating curiosity - Invite for a simple, but fun challenge - Consider the form of the prompt, choose something fun Control 7 - Prompt the participant first; then give him the control - Use the option to self report as the stationary position to provide freedom - Link the research topic/product to the ESM, to avoid a lack of clarity Answering Fun - Directly reward the participant for answering the question by provide a surprise - Keep triggering the participant, by providing variety Control - Provide familiar material, to give the feeling of having power Contributing Benefit - Let the participant make an end to each question, by offering a way to contribute his answers - Let the participant grow his own artwork - Show the progress of the research in a beneficial way - Personalize the artwork to offer personal reflection","Motivation; ESM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); De Pauw, I.C. (mentor)","2011","Bio inspired design (BID) is not a new way of designing, neither is this the first co-evolutionary design project. But combining these two design approaches into co-evolutionary bio inspired design (CoBID) is something that has not been done before. Bio inspired design can roughly be divided into two different approaches. The first approach is refered to as inspiration driven bio inspired design in this report. This approach focuses on designing an emulated application based on the discovery of an interesting phenomenon in nature. The other approach focuses on solving a design problem by looking into nature as a source of inspiration. As this approach is initiated from the field of application, this way of applying BID is refered to as application driven bio inspired design. The CoBID method which is developed in this project is aimed at inspiration driven bio inspired design. Currently there are no design methods available for this way of applying BID, since the inspiration driven approach is mostly executed in the form of a research into the possibilities of an interesting phenomenon found in nature. Some methods are available for application driven BID. But these methods are difficult to use in the inspiration driven field, as they are based on a different focus. The idea behind the CoBID method is that the knowledge about the source of inspiration and the design for the field of application co-evolve over time. At the start of the project only shear and shallow knowledge is available about the source of inspiration. This leaves space for imagination, which evokes ideas for possible applications. These ideas give rise to questions about the properties and abilities of the source of inspiration. Based on these questions the search for more knowledge about the source of inspiration is started. As more knowledge pops up, so will more ideas come to mind based on this knowledge. Earlier application ideas can be proven to be possible, or can be neglected as they do not fit the properties of the source of inspiration. In this way the source of inspiration and the field of application co-evolve towards one another, up to the point where they can be merged into an emulated application of the source of inspiration. Based on the design process of a co-evolutionary bio inspired design test case (Adrichem, 2011), an iterative model is created for CoBID. This model can be seen as two interdependent circular processes. The first circular process covers the search for knowledge about the source of inspiration. The second one aims at the field of application. Both these processes can be divided into three separate phases. The inspiration process is subdivided into familiarising, abstracting and comparing. In the familiarising phase the source of inspiration is examined within its natural context. This gives knowledge about properties like functions and the environmental influences. The abstracting phase detaches the source of inspiration from its natural context. This could be done by making a model, prototype and by making assumptions. Based on this it is possible to get to the core of the source of inspiration, which makes it measurable, scaleable and comparable. The third phase is comparing. By comparing the source of inspiration to other similar phenomena in nature it is possible to define what the strengths and weaknesses are. At the same time this comparison can give insights into how the source of inspiration works. The application process is subdivided into diverging, converging and evaluating. In the diverging phase application ideas and concepts are generated. These are based on the knowledge from the inspiration process. The converging phase narrows the amount of ideas down to the ones which seem to fit best to the source of inspiration and which seem the most promising for application. In the evaluating phase the current field of application is analysed. This analysis shows where the opportunities and threats are for an emulated source of inspiration. The six phases are all interrelated and there is no fixed order in which they should be executed. Due to the co-evolutionary character of this model, the outcomes of one phase automatically lead to the next phase. This makes that CoBID is an iterative process which continues up to the point where the source of inspiration can be emulated into a design application. In the test case CoBID was executed as an individual project, but it would be better to execute CoBID in a collaboration between a biologist and a designer. Biologists and designers have a different view on such a project and both bring a different quality to the table. For that reason designers should be involved in the process of gaining knowledge about the source of inspiration, as they have the ability to look at this on a higher level of abstraction. At the same time the biologists are needed in the process of designing an application, as they have basic knowledge about nature and the source of inspiration which can be put to use in this development. When comparing the CoBID method to biomimicry, it turns out that these two methods have a lot in common. The main points on which they differ are based on the difference in starting point. CoBID is developed for inspiration driven bio inspired design, whereas biomimicry is developed for the application driven version. The main idea behind both methods is that they allow for easy information and data exchange between the source of inspiration and the field of application. This is done by detaching the source of inspiration from its natural context and by biologising questions from the field of application.","bio inspired design; co-evolutionary design; moss peristome; design method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2011","The Port of Leixões is located in the north of Portugal. The operational conditions at berth “A” are affected by several factors resulting in a down-time of the berth of about 20%. In order to describe the behaviour of the moored vessel physical model tests were performed at the Faculty of Engineering University of Porto within the research and development program DOLPHIN. Numerical simulations of wave propagation including non-linear wave interaction and the generation of both sub- and super-harmonics were not carried out in the DOLPHIN program. Within this study a sequence of numerical models was applied to describe the moored ship motions and make a comparison with measurements from the physical model tests. An approach which combined a Boussinesq-type wave model with a panel model was selected as the appropriate approach for the present study. A Boussinesq-type wave model was selected, since diffraction around a breakwater, partial reflection from port structures and non-linear wave processes are important and relevant hydrodynamic processes to describe the wave field in the vicinity of the ship. The output from the Boussinesq-type wave model describes the surface elevations as well as the velocity field of the waves in the vicinity of the ship. The successive panel model takes the presence of the ship within the incident wave field into account and calculates the wave forces on the ship. The calculated total wave forces are a summation of the Froude-Krylov, diffraction and second order wave forces. Time-series of wave forces serve as an input for a ship simulation model, which simulates the ship motions and the mooring forces, taking into account environmental forces and non-linear interactions with the mooring system. The initial approach combined the Boussinesq-type wave model MIKE21 BW, with the panel model Harberth and the ship simulation model Quaysim. Due to numerical instabilities within MIKE21 BW an eddy with unreliable velocities was formed after longer period of simulation. This eddy was located in the vicinity of the ship. The subsequent computations with Harberth resulted in a continuous increase in second order wave forces on the ship. The first order wave forces on the ship did not increase continuously, but via an analysis it is shown that the calculated first order wave forces on the ship are not reliable. The finally simulated ship motions in Quaysim are not reliable as well. The unreliable wave forces on the ship as well as the unreliable subsquent simulated ship motions are a consequence of the pre-simulated instabilities within MIKE21 BW. The cause of the numerical instabilities in MIKE21 BW could not be discovered during this study. Since longer period of simulations are required to obtain statistical reliable ship motions a switch was made to an alternative Boussinesq-type wave model called TRITON. Adaptations in the model set-up in TRITON ensured that numerical instabilities over longer periods of simulation in the simulated velocity field were avoided/minimized. The emphasis in simulations with TRITON is on simulating and understanding the low frequency waves. The focus was on simulating the low frequency waves that caused significant moored ship responses within the physical model. The simulated waves in TRITON agree well with the measured waves in the physical model basin. It is shown that a standing wave is measured in the physical model basin, which caused measured surge responses of the ship. The obtained insight in the generation of these low frequency waves may be used when performing additional physical and/or numerical model tests. It is recommended to simulate the total Port of Leixões with a Boussinesq-type wave model, taking into account all relevant hydrodynamic processes for moored vessel response. In that case a bound long wave should already be imposed in the incoming generated waves, since the generation of primary waves only may lead to an underestimation of the total content of low frequency waves. The wave simulations, as performed with TRITON, are expected to be sufficiently accurate to serve as an input for vessel response computations. The recommended additional wave simulations and vessel response computations are expected to provide additional insight in the causes of excessive ship motions. New insight in the behaviour of waves as well as vessel response may lead to improvements of the operational conditions at berth “A” in the Port of Leixões.","TRITON; moored ships; MIKE21BW","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Ports and waterways","",""

We study which observer-optimizer pair offers the best control performance while maintaining adequate computational burden so that a posterior real-time implementation is feasible. At the same time, the relationship between state estimation accuracy and control performance is covered. Along the way we distinguish between stochastic and deterministic observers and compare which class is more suitable for our case study. The observers we make use of are: the moving horizon estimator (MHE), a nonlinear version of a Luenberger observer (extended Luenberger observer, ELO) and nonlinear variants of the Kalman filter such as extended Kalman filter(EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Special variants of UKF and EKF that make use of a non constant system covariance matrix, which according to some literature is suitable to describe uncertainty distribution in batch processes, are also included in the analysis. The analysis focuses on how four main error sources such as unmeasured disturbances, uncertain initial conditions, model mismatch, and stochastic disturbances may impact observer estimation accuracy as well as their repercussion on control effectiveness and consequently on process performance. Results show that unmeasured disturbances are the most detrimental to observer and process performance in our case study. In spite of this finding, we present a methodology to tackle and solve this problem. All the analysis is first made under an open-loop configuration and then moves onto a closed-loop setup. All testing is based on computer simulations of the crystallization process. The evaluation criterion is based on the magnitude of a normalized root-mean squared error throughout 50 batch runs. The results are then used to identify if a link between estimation accuracy and control performance exists. The computational burden is also evaluated along 50 batch simulations, and is measured on the basis of CPU time required by every observer at every estimation stage.","nonlinear observer; UKF; EKF; EnKF; MHE; crystallization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-05-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","DCSC","","Control Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2011","Het aanleggen van turborotondes is de beste manier om ervoor te zorgen dat een kruispunt veiliger wordt. Turborotondes hebben namelijk weinig conflictpunten en een lage snelheid op de rotonde. Het liefst wordt dus zo lang mogelijk gebruik gemaakt van een turborotonde om de bouw van een kruispunt met verkeerslichten zo lang mogelijk uit te stellen. Het toepassen van verkeerslichten op turborotondes is een mogelijkheid om bij hoge intensiteiten nog steeds gebruik te maken van een turborotonde. Uit een eerste analyse blijkt dat het toepassen van verkeerslichten op turborotondes tot verbetering kan leiden van de verkeersafwikkeling. In dit onderzoek is daarom onderzocht wat het effect is van een RotondeDoseerInstallatie (RDI) op verschillende typen turborotondes. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat door het toepassen een RDI de totale capaciteit tot 10% kan worden verhoogd en tegelijkertijd de verliestijden tot 50% kunnen afnemen. Hierbij gaat het om een winst van 10 tot 30 verliesuren per uur, waarmee de relatief geringe investering snel kan worden terugverdiend. Een RDI is een tweekleurig verkeerslicht dat geplaatst wordt op de hoofdstroom. De RDI is een doseerinstallatie, met het doel om de hoofdstroom te clusteren, zodat het verkeer vanaf de zijstroom makkelijker de rotonde op kan rijden. Door het toepassen van een RDI blijkt dat de stroom die kort wordt tegengehouden door de RDI, tegen de verwachting in, ook een lagere verliestijd heeft. Door de toepassing van een RDI kunnen dus alle richtingen profiteren van een lagere verliestijd. De optimale instelling en plaatsing van deze lichten is tot stand gekomen met een reeks VISSIM simulaties. Hierbij is de werking van de RDI getest op zowel de turborotonde als de spiraalrotonde. Beide rotondes zijn getest met verschillende belastingen, inclusief vrachtverkeer, waarin telkens een vaste verhouding tussen de verschillende stromen en richtingen is aangehouden. Bij de turborotonde blijkt de RDI voor alle belastingen effectief. Bij de spiraalrotonde blijkt dat het effect groter wordt naarmate de hoofdstroom dominanter wordt. Als case studie is een RDI gesimuleerd op de turborotonde op de kruising N470-Noordeindseweg/Berkelseweg. Vooraf bleek uit berekeningen dat de rotonde over een aantal jaar niet meer voldoet aan de norm en dus aangepast moet worden. Uit simulatieberekeningen blijkt dat door toepassing van een RDI een betere doorstroming wordt bereikt. Hierdoor zijn grootschalige aanpassingen voorlopig nog niet noodzakelijk. De resultaten van dit onderzoek moeten leiden tot een praktijkonderzoek, zodat de resultaten uit dit onderzoek kunnen worden bevestigd. Daarna is het belangrijk dat de keuzemodellen die nu worden gebruikt voor het kiezen van kruispuntvormen worden aangepast. Hierdoor kan vaker voor een rotonde met RDI worden gekozen in plaats van een grootschalig kruispunt. Immers profiteren alle richtingen bij de toepassing van een RDI.","RDI; Rotondedoseerinstallatie; Turborotonde","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Kwee, Z. (mentor); Ortt, J.R. (mentor)","2011","Companies often struggle with complex decisions regarding their R&D output and how to market and distribute subsequent innovations. It is of increasing importance to expand the knowledge on how strategy behind product launch is developed. Preparing an appropriate strategy for the launch of a product requires decisions taken early on in the development process which will have far-reaching consequences for the ultimate launch and success of the product. This research is largely explorative in nature and was designed to study these ‘strategic launch decisions’ by looking at influential factors within these decisions and the relationship between such decisions and the concepts of ‘expected technology diffusion’ and ‘uncertainty’ in specific. No propositions could be found within literature involving a combination of the concepts of ‘expected technology diffusion’ and ‘strategic launch decisions’ or the role which uncertainty may play in strategic launch decision-making. We will, thus, focus on identifying possible propositions which may offer better insights into strategic launch decisions and as such, adopt the following research questions: 1. ""What factors have an effect on the choice for a strategic launch decision?"" 2. ""Which factors are of greatest influence on a top manager’s choice for a strategic launch decision?"" 3. ""What is the relationship between expected technology diffusion and strategic launch decisions made by a top manager?"" 4. ""What is the relationship between uncertainty behind technology diffusion and strategic launch decisions made by a top manager based on expected technology diffusion?"" We addressed these research questions by performing a literature study into strategic launch decisions and multiple case studies of several top managers and how they approach such decisions. In order to collect data for the case study, interviews were held with several individuals operating within large incumbents, a ‘vignette’ study was performed and individuals were asked to complete questionnaires. This yielded a list of factors from both literature and practice, which were subsequently compared. Although the results for research question 2 were inconclusive contingent on unanimity, it was possible to identify several factors which are taken into account more than others by top managers. Based on the comparative case analysis and the vignette study, we further found several propositions which provide an insight into the results for research question 3 and 4 and which may be tested in future.","launch strategy; strategic launch decisions; diffusion; top manager","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Innovation Systems","","Technology, Strategy & Entrepreneurship","",""

(mentor)","2011","The human abdominal cavity is an interesting part of the human body, containing a lot of important organs which, due to relative soft boundaries, are quite accessible for examination. Conditions like mechanical bowel obstruction, obstruction of the inferior vena cava, abnormalities of the viscera and existence of abdominal aortic aneurysms can be detected using physical examination. This technique involves ‘feeling’ for abnormal mechanical behavior, unusual masses or pulsation sources, and is basically a manual assessment of mechanical properties and excitation sources. Changes in mechanical properties change the feel, but also changes the dynamical properties of the abdominal system. As such, it can be expected that changes in mechanical properties or changes in excitation sources should also cause an alteration in system dynamics, and should be visible as a change in vibration pattern of the abdomen. This provides an quantifiable parameter which can be measured and monitored. Previous research showed that it was possible to use a Laser Doppler Vibrometer to detect vibration patterns on the skin surface above the carotid artery and the thoracic cage, and it is assumed that this approach can also be applied in a scan of the abdominal surface. A measurement setup is designed to measure the cardiac induced vibration of the abdomen. An ECG monitor registers heart activity and is used to synchronize the measurement with the QRS complex of the heart. An commercial Laser Doppler Vibrometer is used to measure the vibration on a grid consisting out of several dozen of reflective stickers placed on the abdomen surface. By using the QRS complex as a trigger, a sequential scan passes along the defined gridpoints and measures their velocity over a sample period of a few seconds. Afterwards the sequential data is used to generate an approximate parallel scan of the surface. By including a Finometer into the setup it is possible to monitor the brachial blood pressure waveform and to define frequency response functions between the input blood pressure and output skin vibrations. The measurements reveal that there is indeed a repeatable vibration pattern present at the abdomen, which synchronizes with heart rate. Although the velocity of this vibration pattern is affected by respiration, its effect can be reduced by applying averaging over multiple scans, making it is possible to obtain a clear pattern which synchronizes with the cardiac cycle and is most likely generated by pulsation in the abdominal aorta and possibly by other arteries. It is also observed that the vibration pattern differs in shape depending on location on the abdominal surface. Gridpoints located above the abdominal aorta show a clear cardiac pulse, even appearing to show the wave velocity of the pressure pulse, while gridpoints positioned further away show an increased complex signal and a significant reduction of vibration amplitude. Several different data processing techniques are tested. It is found that the vibration patterns show quite some detail, and its is necessary to discriminate between measurement location. Frequency response functions between bloodpressure waveform and skin vibrations are defined and appear to show the presence of dynamical behavior. Accompanying coherence functions show quite high values of coherence up to 10 Hz, but this tends to vary between measurements. This suggests that, although maybe not on all occasions, abdomen vibration is primarily caused by blood pressure waveform.","abdomen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-29","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

The translocation dynamics of heterogeneous polymers through nanopores can be modelled using the LJ and FENE potentials and different interaction strengths between the monomers of the polymer and the pore. The translocation time gives important information of the chain sequence, depending on the length of the polymer. The waiting time is defined as the time a specific monomer stays inside the pore. This waiting time in particular gives useful results considering the chain sequence. Simulations reveal that the waiting time of the last monomer can define the type of monomer under consideration. Monomers with a high interaction with the pore will stay inside considerably longer.

This is used in several fields, like homology research, auto immune disease research and protein shape estimation. There are various algorithms that can perform this task and several hardware platforms suitable to deliver the necessary computation power. Given the large volume of the datasets used, throughput is nowadays the major bottleneck in sequence alignment. In this thesis we discuss some of the existing solutions for high throughput genetic sequence alignment and present a new one. Our solution implements the well known Smith-Waterman optimal local alignment algorithm on the HC-1 hybrid supercomputer from Convey Computer. This platform features four FPGAs which can be used to accelerate the problem in question. The FPGAs, and the CPU that controls them, live in the same virtual memory space and share one large memory. We developed a hardware description for the FPGAs and a software program for the CPU. Some focus points were: a sustainable peak performance, being able to align sequences of any length, FPGA area efficient computations and the cancellation of unnecessary workload. The result is a Smith-Waterman FPGA core that can run at 100\% utilization for many alignments long. They are packed per six on a FPGA running on 150 MHz, which results in a full system performance of 460 GCUPS (billion elementary operations per second). Our elementary processing element can deliver double the work per clock cycle than a naive implementation, resulting in a better throughput per area ratio. At a system level a notable amount of workload is cancelled. It is the most flexible implementation we are aware of . We re-evaluate the use of FPGAs for accelerating Smith-Waterman and conclude that they will continue to be a good choice per dollar and per watt, as long as we narrow the problem space.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-05-27","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Embedded systems","",""

(mentor); De Vries, L.J. (mentor); Correljé, A.F. (mentor); Van der Lee, G. (mentor)","2011","Due to the introduction of a new grid connection policy, transmission system operator TenneT expects congestion to arise on the Dutch transmission grid in the near future. This new connection policy was introduced by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to abolish the discrimination between existing grid users and new entrants, and should improve competition. It allows generators to be connected to the grid directly, without having to wait for transmission capacity expansions that may be required. As this could cause transmission flows as desired by market parties to exceed the available capacity, TenneT must apply congestion management in order to guarantee the safe and reliable operation of the transmission grid. The Ministry decided that basic system redispatch should be used to manage congestion. This method was regarded the most appropriate short-term implementable option available, but has some drawbacks nonetheless. In existing literature it is argued that it potentially leads to high costs, that it is vulnerable to strategic bidding, and that it creates economically sub-optimal outcomes from a grid efficiency perspective. This study has quantitatively evaluated the application of the method in the Netherlands, in terms of congestion costs, their allocation, the incentives it creates, and the opportunities for (and the consequences of) generators bidding strategically. These outcomes were compared to three other congestion management methods (market splitting, market coupling, and the APX-based method1), in order to assess the validity of the proposition that market-based methods, which form the current trend in Europe, lead to better outcomes. Using a quantitative model of the Dutch electricity system the application of all four congestion management methods was simulated. This was done under four different scenarios, each of which was based on extreme conditions that were expected to contribute to congestion in parts of the grid:  Low wind availability in Germany  Cheap natural gas  Green revolution  Code red The simulations revealed that the transmission link between the Maasvlakte region and the Ring is most prone to become congested. However, this study also found that the resulting congestion costs will be low. This is the case because the variable cost levels of production units in the areas upstream and downstream from the congested grid segment were found to be very similar. A deviation from optimal dispatch will therefore result in only slightly higher dispatch costs. Under the most extreme scenario conditions, in which 1292 MW needs to be redispatched from the Maasvlakte to other areas of the Netherlands, net congestion costs were found to be  231 / hr. On a yearly basis this would be  2 mln., which is significantly lower than cost estimates found in literature, which expect this cost to be in the order of magnitude of  10–100 mln. To identify the most appropriate congestion management method for the Netherlands, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was applied to compare the methods, in a pairwise manner and on the basis of eleven criteria. The analysis revealed that conflicting objectives preclude the identification of a single most appropriate congestion management method. It found that the APX-based method outranks market splitting and market coupling, but it remained inconclusive with respect to the appropriateness of basic system redispatch in comparison with these methods. The policy objectives of the Ministry thus appear to be different from those presumed elsewhere and by existing literature, considering their explicit preference for market-based methods. In order to improve the results of this analysis, the Ministry must reassess its objectives with respect to the conflicting criteria of proportionality, and long-term generator and TSO incentives. Also, additional research should improve the conclusiveness of the model results that were used for MCDA, as this would contribute to a more conclusive recommendation on method appropriateness. In particular, such research should encompass the options for incorporating a renewable energy compensation scheme under market-based methods, and it should, by constructing a more extensive, continuous, agent-based model that is capable of incorporating the strategies pursued by individual generators, provide a broader insight and more detailed data on the extent of congestion and the (resulting) consequences of strategic bidding.","congestion management; electricity; market power; power sector; strategic bidding; the Netherlands; transmission system; TSO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-05-23","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructures, Systems and Services / Section Energy & Industry","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis & Management (SEPAM)","",""

By adjusting the Mukherjee and Brill correlation for production/injection wells, insight into which parameters are of influence in predicting the frictional pressure drop during underbalanced drilling is gained. Also the difference between the use of oil-base mud or water-base mud is presented. Underbalanced drilling is the oldest drilling method which over the past years received new attention for bringing new life to an old reservoir. With no reservoir impairment, this method can achieve a higher recovery factor if completed 100% underbalanced. For the success of an underbalanced drilling operation, understanding the annular frictional performance of non-Newtonian mud is crucial. This is a key factor in the development of the hydraulic program which is used in the selection of the drilling equipment. Although several simulators exist, none of them accurately predicts the pressures which are experienced in reality. In this project a power-law model for predicting frictional pressure loss in eccentric annulus is used instead of the formulas defined by Mukherjee and Brill. After selecting the parameters that have a potential impact on the frictional pressure loss, a range for each parameter was defined and a sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the impact due to changes in each parameter.","underbalanced drilling; two-phase annular flow; software tool","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Applied Earth Sciences","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Law, T.M. (mentor); De Jong, T.P.R. (mentor)","2011","In order to meet the future demand of pellets for the blast furnace, the output of the grinding circuit of the Tata Steel IJmuiden pellet plant needs to be increased. As the power consumption of the grinding circuit is already at its maximum, the grinding itself and/or the grinding strategy needs to be optimised, leading to a higher circuit output while still achieving the required fineness. Further processes within the pellet plant require the grinding product to be of a certain fineness which is currently determined by measuring the Blaine number of the grinding circuit output, which is a measurement of the available surface within the grind. At the IJmuiden pellet plant, grinding is done in a closed grinding circuit, meaning that only particles smaller than a certain size are allowed to leave the circuit. Particles that are to coarse are screened out of the main flow of material and fed back to the grinding mills. The pellet feeds of the IJmuiden pellet plant are blends of different ores. The compositions of these blends are based on several factors such as availability, price and iron content. Properties that affect the grinding of the ores, such as initial fineness and grindability, however, are not taken into consideration in the selection of ores. Given this fact, a possibility to increase the grinding capacity might be found in treating the feed of the grinding circuit not as a single material, like is done at the moment, but as a collection of individual ores. This approach allows for a blending/grinding strategy to be designed based on overgrinding softer ores and leaving the harder ores coarser while still achieving the required overall fineness. As this would reduce the energy needed to achieve a certain fineness, this would increase the grinding capacity. Based on knowledge gained through a literature study on the binding mechanisms in iron ore green pellets, the strength and plasticity of green pellets is believed to be affected by such variations in individual ore fineness within the ore feed. To study the influence of individual ore fineness on green pellet strength and plasticity, an experimental study was designed that involved balling and testing of green pellets balled from four different feeds that only varied in individual ore fineness. In addition, the influence of strain rate on strength and plasticity of these same pellets was tested. It was found that variations in individual ore fineness had no significant influence on the strength and plasticity of green pellets. Pellet plasticity and strength were found to be strain rate dependent even for very low strain rates. Based on these experimental results, recommendations for further work and possible improvements in pelletising process monitoring were put forward.","grinding; green pellet strength; pelletizing; iron ore","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","section Resource Engineering","","","",""

Schiphol Group considers the uptake of electric cars an interesting solution to decrease transport related emissions around the airport. This research considers four different passenger transport services within the Amsterdam Airport Corridor.

The NPV is used to assess economic potential. Emission rates of CO2, NOx and PM10 are used to assess environmental performance. Scenarios were used to indicate the impact of uncertain factors on the potential and possible risks of investments. It turns out that the use of electric cars can be financially sound if large mileages per car and per fleet can be realized. Highest environmental gains can be achieved when electricity generation is sustainable. Schiphol Group is advised to start a small scale project with electric taxis between the airport and business centers in the airport region. A small project limits the investment risks but enables the increase of knowledge and cooperation with relevant parties. Technological and financial developments related to sustainable mobility in general and electric mobility in particular should be followed to continuously assess the potential of transport alternatives.

(mentor); Bakker, H.L.M. (mentor); Verbraeck, A. (mentor)","2011","Ever since sophistication of technology and human desire for a better, more comfortable and luxurious life have started to converge, it has had a direct impact on the way engineering projects are approached and handled. This is especially true since the second half of the previous century. A natural consequence of this is that conventional project management approaches are increasingly coming under stress. One thing that can be generally assumed to have happened is the increase in project complexity. However, the understanding of complexity by professional bodies and academia still seems to be at an early stage. This affects all industries and sectors, be they civil, electrical, manufacturing, IT or any other. As an example, we can look at the process and energy industry, with the oil sector being a case in point. Easily accessible oil fields have long since been discovered forcing new reservoirs and discoveries to be made in remote areas, deep seas or in complex forms like tar-sands. This research was undertaken to increase understanding of the role of project complexity in project management and its influence on the chances of achieving a successful project. This study focused on application of the new TOE framework on identifying and understanding the different elements (fifty in our case) of complexity, how they can be potentially grouped together into clusters of influence (fourteen in our case), contributing towards the three dimensions of complexity (Technical, Organizational and Environmental). The separate effect of these three dimensions on five common success criteria of cost, schedule, quality, safety and future business prospects was investigated. Also, the computed complexity dimensions were compared with a general perception of these three dimensions in the experience of the respondents to see the extent of the fit. To do this a survey was distributed to project managers in the member companies of the NAP network, a competence network of the Dutch process industry. The online survey contained questions on the interviewees’ most recent finished project. Through the survey, data was acquired on 67 projects performed in the NAP network. This data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate statistical techniques. Owing to the characteristics of the data, non-parametric analysis technique was used. The results of the study show the potential usefulness of application of TOE framework in project management research. The relationships found also have practical implications for project management in the NAP network and the process industry. It was shown that project complexity negatively influences project success, with technical and organizational complexity playing the most significant part. It was shown that cost and schedule were two categories of success showing the most susceptibility to complexity, whereas quality, safety and future business prospects showed resiliency towards any kind of complexity to a large extent. From the literature review, several observations were compared with the results of the thesis, showing interesting moot points. Confirming (Kloppenborg & Opfer, 2002), all types of risk have been shown to be of influence on the project result. It has been shown that the opinion of (Thomas & Mengel, 2008) that expert project management has not been paid too much attention is also confirmed by our results. Lack of planning is also shown as potential cause of project failure as indicated by (Dvir, Shenhar, et al., 2003). The biggest surprise was to find that project size has no correlation with project result, thus disproving (Collyer & Warren, 2009).","complexity; project management; project result","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","Systems Engineering","",""

Stability of a concrete pedestrain bridge with load bearing railings","Weidema, V.M.","Walraven, J.C. (mentor); Van der Veen, C. (mentor); Blom, C.B.M. (mentor); Hoogenboom, P.C.J. (mentor)","2011","Usually, concrete bridges contain a ‘thick’ bridge deck. For various reasons, bridges are constructed with railings. This thesis discusses the stability problem of concrete bridges, which are designed with integrated railings into the carrying construction. The most important advantage, using load bearing railings, is a thinner bridge deck. This was also one of the requests of Public Works Rotterdam. The load bearing railings have to endure buckling. This phenomena is not very common in massive concrete bridges. Since the request for to alternative bridges with a thinner bridge deck, like this one, is becoming larger and larger, there is need for a simple rule of thumb. This indication is necessary for estimating the dimensions of this kind of bridge without a complicated calculation. For this thesis, the stability of a concrete pedestrian bridge with load bearing railings, has been checked in three ways. There has been focussed at the compression zone of the bridge, the handrails. 1. First the buckling force is calculated. Using the buckling force and the actual normal force in the handrails, it is possible to calculate the second order effects. 2. The total resisting moment in the handrails must be large enough to withstand the external first and second order moments. The resisting moment is based on uncracked concrete, therefore no tension stresses in the handrails are aloud. 3. If stability isn’t the problem, strength is. Hence the external normal force in the handrails most be lower than the normal force resisted. The problem has been analysed. The three checking’s are visualized in graphs over various dimensions. These graphs were used as a starting point of a parameter study to get a rule of thumb, which can be used for concrete pedestrian bridges with load bearing railings. There is also concluded that bridges with load bearing railings are more sensitive to local forces (on bridge deck and railings), than plate bridges are. The rule of thumb is applicable for bridges larger than 14 meter and smaller than 23 meter, depending on the applied concrete strength. Using this indications gives a correct estimation of the dimensions of a concrete pedestrian bridge with load bearing railings.","stability; pedestrain bridge; load baring railings; dragende leuning; concrete bridge; kip; buckling; Engesser; Formula of TU Munchen; Euler","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

Projects are sustainable projects that have the objective to become an independent businesses on the long term. This graudation project has the objective to develop a new WOW! Project concept for Enviu utilizing 3D printing. The advantages of 3D printing are combined with the requirements of Enviu which has led to multiple ideas for this WOW! project. There is chosen to proceed with the idea to utilize 3D printing for solving eyewear and distribution issues in developing countries. Eyewear is developed as a product that solves health issues of low vision. However, it has become more and more an image building product because the object is dominantly visible. Nonetheless, over 135 million people in the world lack of proper eyewear while they need eyewear to improve their vision. Three causes were identified when analysing the problem. First of all, many developing areas in the world lack knowledge on proper eyecare, hygiene and eye measurements. Too little specialists are present to help the inhabitants of those countries. Besides this, the largest eyewear distribution problems occur in rural areas dealing with low purchase power and far distant to cities. These isolated areas have often insufficient infrastructure which complicates the eyewear distribution towards these areas. By considering these challenges a product service system is model is created visualized in Figure 1. A product service system for in India is developed representing a ‘mobile optician’ addressing these seven steps, explained in Figure 2. Besides an eyewear model construction is designed in which the lenses and the frames are produced with 3D printers, presented in Figure 3. Providing this product and customize it during co-creation in the product service system will solve eyewear distribution issues utilizing 3D printers in rural areas of India.","3D printing; eyewear; product service system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2011","Involving user in the development process is becoming inevitable for companies to stay competitive and innovative. Technology is no longer the main factor to furfill the customers needs. Especially in product innovation the integration of the needs and desires of customers are fundamental (Veryzer R. W., 2003). User-centered design is an approach to designing products, systems or services that put the people who will use the product at the center of the development effort (Buur & Ylirisku, 2007). Their involvement leads to more effective, efficient and safer products and contributed to the acceptance and success of products (Preece, 2002). There are several methods for user centered design within a new product development process. Personas is one of these methods, they were introduced in 1999 by Alan Cooper and are “fictitious, specific, concrete representations of target users” (Pruitt & Adlin, 2006, p. 7). It is a method that describes the actual “user” of the product. This to get a clear and consistent understanding of this user within a company. If everyone has the same understanding of the user, the product is less likely to fail (Cooper, 1999). Exact is a company that is using personas now for several years, but the personas were not really used and failed several times. To overcome this problem the idea of using video to make the personas more emphatic was invented. Exact didn`t have the knowledge and capabilities to execute this idea, so this graduation assignment was initiated together with the TU Delft. This thesis is a research for Exact into the use of video in personas, to make the personas more empathic, engaging and inspiring. The first aim of this thesis was to create and evaluate both types of personas within Exact; static and interactive* personas. The second aim was to create guidelines about the creation of Interactive personas. PERSONA CREATION Two personas were created based on an participatory design research that was held in Exact with IT and management consultants. The static persona is one paper with a photo, quotes, explaination of his working process, hobbies and family life. Photos of his children and employees are also shown. The interactive persona is a website which starts with a short introduction. Then it is possible to go further, there a map is shown of the spots he daily visits. His home, the park, the road and hos office are shown. Each of the spots will lead to one or more movies about this spot. For example the office leads to 6 short movies about his working life. To make both personas comparable, visual are similar and the same subject are dicussed. The difference is mainly found in the details and the eleboration about the subjects. PERSONA EVALUATION The comparison of both personas was done between groups. One group only saw the static persona, the other one only the interactive persona. Both groups received a similar quesionairre about the persona they saw. Several statements had to be valued and several mechanisms had to be ranked. The questionairres were compared and analyzed in SPSS. The outcomes showed that there was no significant difference in means between empathy, engagement and inspiration of the two personas. GUIDELINES Several guidelines were made based on my own creation process of the interactive persona and interesting insights from literature and experts in video methods. The following eight guidelines were developed for the creation of interactive personas: Involve the company during the whole process Presentation of the personas should depend on the current communication channels within the company. Be aware of the impact that video can have for a participant Try to supply information about the study to the participant Explain the procedure of the shooting of the video Let the participant be in control of what can be recorded Try to be open to any situation Do not try to make a to detailed script; be open to the situation the participant creates Record in the natural environment of the participant Try to focus on showing the everyday details and the context of the participant. When recording, try to focus on where the attention moves of the participant. People surrounding the participant should also be aware of the situation. Be aware of your appearance Avoid wearing obvious clothes and noisy objects; like bangles or heels. Try to make the video as natural as possible Choose a participant that can tell the story Avoid special effects and music Let the participant tell the story Stay close to the original material Show different types of information Try to combine different types of information; video, audio, pictures and text. Use these different types of information to show the different layers of information; raw data, interpretations and conclusions. Use other communication means to support the video Use posters, cups, placemats or other means to promote the persona. The goals is to trigger people to see the persona; make them curious. The guidelines are used in the toolkit for making interactive personas. This toolkit consists of card in different color and sizes, which have a similar system as a swatch book. The four colors each represent a different phase is the creation process. The toolkit shows methods, guidelines and equipement that can be used in the creation of the persona.","video; personas; user centered design; context; context mapping; Exact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

More specifically, the Hai - Huai - Huang basins and the impoundment of the Three Gorges reservoir are studied. Due to noise and the required filtering of the monthly GRACE gravity field solutions there is a limitation on both the magnitude of changes and the spatial scale at which changes occur for these changes to be successfully detected. We investigate if we can detect changes in hydrology in these areas and if it is possible to ascribe detected hydrological changes to anthropogenic water use or water management. The conducted research can be divided into two parts. In the first part we perform a large scale analysis on the different river basins. Precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture are considered for the individual basins and used when analyzing the total water storage variations as computed from GRACE gravity field solutions. Modeled soil moisture variations are found to be unreliable in (part of) the research area. We make assumptions to limit the modeled soil moisture variation and try to compute the groundwater depletion in this area more accurately. In the second part we compute the change in reservoir volume of the Three Gorges reservoir over time using laser altimetry and a Digital Elevation Model. Forward modeling if this signal shows good agreement with results found from monthly GRACE gravity field solutions.","GRACE; hydrology; groundwater; extraction; 3 Gorges; ICESat; satellite; China","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-05-29","Aerospace Engineering","Remote sensing","","Earth and planetary observations","",""

They lack the marketing experience and their focus may lie on developing a better technology and product. Books have been written about marketing in high-tech companies, but there are no books that specifically target marketing in high-tech start-ups. The main objective of this research is to find out how marketing is organized in high tech start-ups. This research examines the similarities and differences between what is written in literature and how it is employed in practice by the start-ups. This gives us a better understanding of the gap between literature and the practice. This research aims to find related aspects between high-tech marketing strategies literature and how it is employed in high-tech start-ups. The required qualitative data is collected through desk research and through semi-structured interviews with 9 high tech start-ups. The start-ups are categorized in three categories: young, mature and spin offs. Basic marketing aspects are used in this research to test the marketing. The aspects in consequential order are: Strategy types, strategy creation, market orientation, market research, high-tech customer, pricing, and advertising and branding. The findings of this research is that young and mature high tech start-ups have difficulty with some of the basic marketing aspects in their marketing strategies. Spin offs are dealing with their marketing according to what is written in literature and are more successful. Young start-ups have the most difficulty with their marketing because of their lack of knowledge and resources. Mature start-ups have learned through experience to use more marketing to become more successful. A better understanding is created about the limitations of high-tech start-ups in their marketing, new methods can be established that tackle both the complexity of the high-tech environment and the limitations of the high-tech start-ups. Further research on this topic is needed create a better understanding about the limitations.","Marketing; high-tech start-ups; marketing strategies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-05-19","Technology, Policy and Management","TSE","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor)","2011","At the department Precision and Microsystems Engineering, currently a project is running to design a haptic system for the assembly of small micro-parts. One component of the haptic system is the master robot, the device that interacts with the human operator. This robot was invented by Patrice Lambert, a PhD student. He based the architecture on the well known Delta robot, which has three (translational) degrees of freedom. To allow grasping motions he added two extra degrees of freedom on top of the three translations, grippingmotion and a rotation. The architecture of the robot being defined, a prototype had to be designed. As this was a considerable project, the work was split into two graduation projects. One graduation project was done by fellow student Oscar van de Ven, the other project by myself. In the initial phase –the short assignment – we worked together on a literature study to derive the specifications for the haptic device that origin from the interaction with the human operator. Furthermore, we developed a number of mathematical tools and models to analyze the robot. The results can be found in a separate document, see [4]. During the second phase – the actual graduation project – the paths split and Oscar started to do research and design on the motors and the sensors, I myself started with the mechanical parts of the structure. The work consisted of a full design, so a conceptual design, followed by a detailed design ending up with drawings ready-to-use for manufacturing. The idea was that my part would also include some control that nicely fitted with my subject, so gravity and inertia compensation, but the time was quite short for this. At this moment the prototype – the “PentaGriph II prototype” – is not yet assembled. Next to this project another prototype of the robot – the “PentaGriph I prototype” – was build by a student of a technical school. For this project we did also some work, including assembly of the platform components and choice and assembly of the electronic equipment. This prototype is at this moment functional. This report will only be about the PentaGriph II prototype. Some design choices or considerations are based on the experiences with the PentaGriph I robot and will be mentioned in the text. It is necessary to render thanks to a number of people for their advice or help during the project. First of all my coach Patrice Lambert and professor Rob Munnig-Schmidt for their supervision. With Patrice, we had more than weekly meetings to talk about the method and the design. I would like to thank Hans Langen who coached us during the first months of the project. Jo Spronck and Just Herder gave advice about the prototype and themethod.

(mentor); Melles, M. (mentor)","2011","This MSc. Thesis was a collaboration between the Delft University of Technology, the University of Amsterdam and Interapy. Interapy is a psycho-therapeutic institution successfully applying online burnout therapy. Their internet treatment only includes textual contact with their patients and they wanted to extend this contact with a game-based therapeutic intervention to increase patients’ engagement with their therapy. Therefore this graduation project focussed on developing such a game. To increase the engagement, one preset requirements is that the game should progress from an abstract and virtual level to a concrete and realistic level. Since it is almost impossible to develop a game covering all issues of burnout treatment, the project started with defining a more specific focus. After an analysis of the protocol of Interapy, a discussion with the therapists and interviews with three burnout patients, it was decided to focus on improving patients’ self-confidence in dealing with others. As a result of their norms and values, burnout patients often experience problems with ineffective thoughts. An example of such a thought is: ‘People can always count on me’. Such thoughts cause burnout patients to experience rejecting other’s requests as difficult and to push their limits to please others. The protocol of Interapy spends one module on dealing with others, where the patient has to conduct a behavioral experiment to practice dealing with others in actuality. The game is focusing on supporting and stimulating this experiment and can be used as addition to the current protocol. This focus included two fields, namely therapy and gaming. To see how these fields could be merged, a literature study was conducted to gain more insight in how to increase burnout patients’ self-confidence and the strengths of gaming. It was decided that the game should help to change the burnout patients’ negative mindset into a positive one. The patients progress from abstract levels toward a concrete and realistic level, along the way learning to work with positive thoughts and developing a positive mindset. The merging of the two fields resulted in the creation of design directions serving as categories for the brainstorm. These categories were control, results and feedback, simulation, narrative and metaphors, fun and levels. By brainstorming on these design directions, one concept was developed. The concept consists of four levels. The first level is the abstract level, where patients have to match negative thoughts with positive alternative thoughts. During the second level patients have to pay off with negative thoughts by shooting them away with the best counterarguments. Now the patients are sensitized with these thoughts, the third level places the thoughts in a work related animated scenario. During the dialogue thoughts pop up and patients have to decide whether these thoughts are positive or negative. The last level is a virtual behavioral experiment, where patients have to practice a conversation with an actor, representing their manager. Their response is recorded, which gives the patients the opportunity to review their response and evaluated it. After the game, patients can decide to share the recording with their therapist in order to receive feedback. The concept is evaluated with therapists and patients, where there overall impression is highly positive. Both groups expected the game will stimulate to conduct a behavioral experiment and can increase the self-confidence of the patient. Thomas Zielhorst, at the University of Amsterdam, will examine whether the game has a real effect on improving the patients’ self-confidence. His research will also investigate whether the game helps to achieve Interapy’s desire to increase patients’ engagement with the therapy. This project delivered one finished version of every level. The result of this project should be seen as a pilot set-up of a game for therapy. If the prototype proves effective, the levels could be extended with, for example, more scenarios to make it into a complete game.","burnout; serious gaming; therapy; self-esteem; behavioral change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master Design for Interaction with specialisation Medisign","",""

One of these remains are carbonized wheat grains, which are used in this thesis to answer the question: “Will the archeological remains in the subsurface survive a loading caused by newly build infrastructure or buildings or will they be destroyed?”. In order to give an answer to this question 3 types of tests were conducted: strength tests on individual particles, oedometer tests and shearbox tests on mixtures of seeds and clay. The strength test results indicate that the strength and behavior of individual grains vary depending on the carbonization temperature. Grains that are weak and brittle like the Archeon grains heated up to 270° C are most preferable when studying the vulnerability of carbonized seeds incorporated to clay and loaded mechanically in the oedometer or shear box. A CT-scan of an oedometer sample showed that sample preparation needs to be enhanced because of air inside the sample at the interface between the clay layers where the seeds were deposited. A Ct-scan of the shearbox tests showed that the seeds are shifted in the consolidated clay when sheared. An answer to the main question isn’t found and more testing needs to be done with the oedometer and shearbox. It is expected that when the sample is sheared over larger distances the seeds are shifted more and weaker seeds are broken, this and whether our own produced grains are representable to the grains in the subsurface must be checked.","wheat; carbonized","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Geo-Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","The fresh water supply will be more under pressure, due to the predicted effects of climate change in the Netherlands. More frequent salt water intrusion during the summer semester is caused by the joint occurrence of low river discharges and the expected sea level rise. The control of external salinity is necessary to guarantee a sufficient water quality of the main water system and so protect the fresh water inlets from the intruding saline water. Consequently, regional water systems are able to take in fresh water of the main water system to control internal salinity, through counteracting salt seepage by means of salt ?ushing. The control of external salinity can be realized by the implementation of measures that interfere in the main water system; e.g. by optimizing the fresh water distribution. Whether a measure will be implemented depends on the decision-making process. This study is initiated, because of the arisen discussions about the pursued fresh water policy for the drought in 2003. Salinity risk management aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of measures that focus on the fresh water supply, by means of evaluating the costs and the bene?ts of a measure. This study investigates the possibilities of the implementation of a risk-based approach within the present Dutch fresh water policy, which is nowadays based on a deterministic approach. A salinity risk management model is developed that basically is composed of three phases that research the following questions; i.e. 1.) How does the system of external salt water intrusion in the Rhine-Meuse Estuary function for given scenarios? 2.) What is the frequency of occurrence of external salinity? Given that external salinity occurs, what are the consequences? What is the resulting salinity risk? 3.) Is the established risk acceptable? If not, which alternative measures are able to reduce the present risk level? The developed research model is examined in a case study for the risk evaluation of external salt water intrusion in the Hollandse IJssel, in particular the fresh water inlet of Gouda that provides fresh water to the control area of Rijnland. This study concludes that a risk-based approach is implementable in the Dutch fresh water policy, but extended research is necessary to obtain more reliable exceedance frequencies of a Chloride concentration. This study developed two probabilistic models; i.e. for tide-dominated locations and river-dominated locations. A third type probabilistic model should be developed for locations that are not tide- or river-dominated. Secondly, more precise statistical analysis should be conducted after the discharge variation in course of time for low river discharges. Besides, statistical research is recommended after the variation of the probability distributions thorough the summer semester of low river discharges, high sea water level set-ups and a precipitation de?cit.","risk assessment; drought; salinity; damage assessment; probabilistic design; risk reduction; verzilting; Rijn-Maasmonding; Hollandse IJssel; Rijnland Gouda; climate change; fresh water policy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2011","Anti-lock Brake Systems (ABS) are one of the most important safety features for road vehicles. They sustain the stability and steerability of a vehicle under heavy braking. The ABS is part of the standard active safety repertoire of commercial vehicles. Current commercial ABS are based on many heuristics and control rules, leading to an increasingly complex system. There is no theory available to assess the stability of the system, nor its performance. Moreover, these algorithms require extensive tuning for different vehicle models. The novel algorithm analysed in this thesis offers a mathematical background and a reduced tuning effort. Previous work involved validating the novel algorithm on a test bench with a fixed vertical load. This limitation is addressed. The goal of this thesis is to determine the influence of load transfer and of tyre-road friction coefficients on the performance of the novel ABS algorithm. An improved adaptive ABS is proposed that utilizes load based sensing. Following the analysis, the results are validated using a four wheel vehicle model in CarSim and Simulink. To evaluate the performance of the improved algorithm against a commercial one, modifications have been made to a test vehicle. The commercial ABS will thus serve as a benchmark for further algorithm developments. Furthermore, research topics have been set so future work may be built upon these foundations. Overall, this thesis contributes to the design, simulation, implementation and validation of a novel ABS algorithm.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-06-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

Many projects and researches are ongoing to determine how this “drowning effect” of the delta can be stopped. One of the solutions that could be feasible is implementing sediment diversions in the levees of the Lower Mississippi River in order to divert sediment into the delta. This thesis addresses the morphological effects of river diversions on the Lower Mississippi River. The main objective is to analyze and optimize trade-offs between delta building and river navigability. For this purpose a 2DH numerical model with Delf3D has been created; the model simulates the hydro- and morphodynamic behavior. The river reach which has been studied is the final 110 km of the river from Point a la Hache at River Kilometer 78 (RK 78) down to the mouth of the river (RK -30), below Head of Passes. The hydrodynamic model has been calibrated and verified with flow and stage data from daily observations on the river. With the available sediment data a calibration has been carried out of the morphological behavior in the river. The model has been used to simulate several scenarios to get insight in the problems in the delta. From analysis of the model results the river bed in the study area can be divided into three categories. Upstream of RK 4 the bed is subject to erosion, around RK 4 the bed is practically in equilibrium and downstream of RK 4 the bed is subject to sedimentation. The reach downstream of RK 4 is the dredging reach; after analyzing the long-term simulation of 20 years it is not expected that the dredging quantities will decrease in the future. Closing off West Bay diversion has a positive effect on the dredging quantities. The best diversion site for this study area is found in the inner bend of the river upstream of Empire (RK 47) at RK 53. This site is most efficient and diverts the largest quantities of sand through the diversion.","Lower Mississippi River; Sediment diversions; Delft3D; hydrodynamic and morphodynamic modeling; maintenance dredging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Bosch-Rekveldt, M. (mentor); Rook, L. (mentor); Ortt, R. (mentor)","2011","Despite the extensive body of knowledge that exists on innovation management and project management, the number of failed projects is still disappointingly high. This is especially true in projects that involve break-through innovations. Recent literature suggests that the application of a contextual approach rather than a universal approach could improve this situation. This observation has prompted a search for factors that affect the performance of projects, as well as the development of several contextual frameworks. This research builds upon these areas and specifically aims investigates the relationships between the context and characteristics of a project, the leadership styles, and the decisions that project leaders make early on in projects. The choice of these fields will be explained individually. It is suffice to say at this point that even though research in each of these topics on its own is rather well-developed, the connections between them have not been fully researched before. As an example: the focus of this thesis is on the early phases of projects - also known as the front end development (FED) phase, because in this phase decisions are not yet finalized. Project costs in this phase are still low and making changes is easier. This thesis uses an exploratory study, due to the unavailability of prior integrated research. In this work, we review the literature and attempt to find the project contexts, project characteristics, and leadership styles that influence a project leaders’ decision making. We also look at the decisions that project leaders actually make during the FED phase. We then seek for plausible relationships among these factors and decisions, and in the process build a framework which includes all these factors and decisions. In our proposed framework, the characteristics and contexts of a project influence the decisions that managers make in the early phases of a project. The chosen leadership styles moderate these relationships. We complement the model by presenting several scenarios that aim to refine and show the plausibility of the model. Based on our study, we propose the following conclusions: first, technological uncertainty has a direct and positive effect on risk management, and yet a direct and negative effect on planning, which means that in the case of high technological uncertainty, risk management should be formalized but planning not. These relationships are positively moderated by the leadership variable of task behavior, so if the project leaders’ style is delegating, this would imply more formality in risk management, and more flexibility on planning. The other major conclusion is that project complexity has a direct and negative effect on both risk management and planning, which means that in cases of highly complex projects, both risk management and planning need to be formalized. These relationships are positively moderated by the variable of task behavior, so if the project leaders’ style is telling this would mean more formality in risk management and planning. The model and conclusions can be seen as forms of working hypothesis. In future work, researchers could focus on testing these hypotheses quantitatively and assess the validity of the model. Eventually, the model can be complemented by adding more contextual variables. The proposed conceptual model connects the fields of innovation management, project management and leadership theory. We hope that the model contributes to these fields and to the understanding of the realities which project leaders face, and that it can act as a stepping stone for further research.","innovation management; project management; leadership styles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-05-10","Technology, Policy and Management","TSE","","","",""

De vluchthaven kampte jarenlang met verzandingsproblemen en er zijn diverse onderzoeken en aanpassingen uitgevoerd, maar het probleem is nog steeds niet verholpen. Door de verscherpte wetgeving in 2008, zijn de kosten voor het behandelen van baggerspecie toegenomen. Hierdoor is het financieel niet meer rendabel voor de havenbeheerder om de haven op diepte te houden. Bij een bezoek ter plaatse bleek dat de zuidelijke golfbreker verzakt was. De opbouw van de golfbreker bestaat uit een geotube, een kunststoffilter en breukstenen. Door de verzakking van de golfbreker vindt nu golfoverslag met sediment plaats dat zorgt voor verzanding achter de zuidelijke golfbreker. Golfoverslag vindt meestal plaats in de zomer, omdat de waterstand in onze situatie de maatgevende factor is. Naast golfoverslag is de golfbreker ook sedimentdoorlatend geworden bij windopzet. Dit gebeurt wanneer het waterniveau de bovenkant van de geotube heeft bereikt. Ook de vorm van de zuidelijke golfbreker zorgt voor verzandingsproblemen. De golfbreker staat bijna haaks op de kustlijn en zorgt ervoor dat het water achter de golfbreker kalmer wordt. Door het kalmere water kan het sediment bezinken en vervolgens naar de haven worden verplaats. Als laatste is de noordelijke golfbreker te kort, hierdoor kan sediment uit het noorden de golfbreker passeren. Omdat de zuidelijke golfbreker langer is dan de noordelijke golfbreker, wordt het sediment opgevangen door de zuidelijke golfbreker en vindt er verzanding plaats in de vluchthaven. Om verzanding van de vluchthaven te beperken, zijn drie alternatieven uitgewerkt. Het verzakte golfbreker herstellen; de vorm van de zuidelijke golfbreker aanpassen en als laatst worden beide golfbrekers aangepast.

Fokker is currently developing the E-Lighter®; a lightweight, portable energy source that uses diesel to generate electric power. At the moment it is solely being developed for the Dutch defense organization that will use it for soldier missions. In order to bring production costs down, this graduation project was created. The aim of the project is to identify other markets suitable for a market introduction of the E-Lighter. An assessment of several markets, a concept, a business plan and recommendations are the outcome. The E-Lighter® is a product with very unique characteristics that perfectly match the unique needs of the Dutch army. These unique characteristics are: The E-Lighter® outputs 15W with a dry weight of 1 kg, so it needs long operating times to reach a competitive energy density (compared to batteries) The E-Lighter® uses diesel as fuel The E-Lighter® can function under many circumstances The E-Lighter® is small and light weight The E-Lighter® is expensive After brainstorming and literature research, 7 markets were selected for further research. Buoys, camera crews, disaster relief, life rafts, recreation, scientific monitoring and traffic equipment were researched using many criteria and analyses. Camera crews came out as the market with the best opportunities by far because of the following aspects: The market size is large, especially compared to the others Camera equipment uses much energy and the current solution offers room for improvement Cameramen and sound technicians are very technical people and are always interested in innovations/gadgets There is a great deal of money in the broadcast industry 6 visits have been paid to different people and companies working in the broadcast industry in order to get a thorough knowledge about camera crews and the way they work. As it turns out, a 30W version of the E-Lighter® is required to be able to serve the majority of the professional camera users. The 15W version would only help a niche within the industry. The camera E-Lighter® will be used in a hybrid function together with a camera battery. For ENG (Electronic News Gathering) cameras e.g. it means that instead of 6 batteries, 2 batteries and an E-Lighter® can be used. This saves a lot of weight and enhances the security of always having power. To sell the E-Lighter® in the broadcast industry, a company with existing relations and sales channels is necessary (Fokker will not be able to set this up itself). Anton Bauer is an experienced and well known battery manufacturer and seller within the industry and is the best option for Fokker to do business with. Manufacturing the E-Lighter® is something Fokker can do internally for small series, but bigger series need to be outsourced. A contract manufacturer has to be chosen later in the process for that purpose. After an assessment of future manufacturing costs, investments, overhead costs, etc it became obvious that the E-Lighter® will still serve a relatively small market. The current market size is ±8500 camera battery systems annually, for which one E-Lighter® could be sold per battery system. Dependent on market penetration, manufacturing costs and several other factors, 7 scenarios were created. The scenarios that are the most likely to happen will result in a NO-GO advice. The chance at a situation happening that can result in a GO advice is less than 15%. A NO-GO advice means that Fokker should not focus at all on the broadcast industry during the development of the E-Lighter. After the first batch has been manufactured, Fokker should try to sell the E-Lighter® as a license to a company in the broadcast industry. The extra revenue is welcome, but more important is that IP rights are protected as the army E-Lighter® is still being produced. A GO advice means that Fokker will find a sales partner and manufacturing partner as described before. In the best possible scenario the camera E-Lighter® sales can have a profit of over 1,000,000 annually. Conclusion: the chance that the E-Lighter® will be introduced in the broadcast industry is very small. It is unique that a product this suitable for the military market cannot find a place in another market. Reason for this is E-Lighter®’s unique characteristics that suit camera crews the best but still not enough. Most important consequence of this project is that Fokker can now focus solely on the development of the E-Lighter® for the military market. Might development go very prosperous, or might the market change significantly, this report can be taken to re-assess the decision making. Recommended is that Fokker does more (graduation) projects to assess the chances of other technologies in civil markets. Though this project turned out in a negative advice, Fokker owns much unique competences that could lead to large opportunities. Recommendations concerning the future development of the E-Lighter® have been made and can be found in the last pages of the report.","market; research; portable; power; source; fokker; camera; crews","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

Unsteady flow phenomena are encountered with wind turbines, helicopter rotors and aeroplane propellers. It is also an important factor in the study of animal flight, with birds, bats and insects flapping to produce lift and propulsion. Recently also micro aerial vehicles (MAV’s) have been constructed that use those same mechanisms for flight. With the availability of high-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV) systems, it is now possible to quantitatively measure unsteady flow fields in a time-resolved manner. Methods have been developed that enable to determine the unsteady aerodynamic forces on an object from the measured flow velocity field around it, using a control volume approach. For steady flows, these methods have been extensively validated previously by comparison to balance measurements. For unsteady flows, however, such a validation has not been made before. The present thesis investigation involves an experimental study of an aerofoil subjected to an oscillating pitch motion. Unsteady loads were determined from instantaneous velocity fields, that were obtained using a high-speed PIV system. Additionally it has been attempted to validate these loads by means of force balance measurements. The experimental set-up involved an actuated sinusoidally pitching aerofoil, with a NACA0018 profile. Eight strain-gauge bending-beam sensors formed a balance for the mechanical reference force measurements. With a PIV system, consisting of 4 high speed cameras, with partially overlapping fields-of-view, and a high speed laser, time-resolved velocity data was obtained in the cross-sectional plane of the aerofoil. Reynolds numbers near 80 000 and pitch frequencies of 10 and 20 Hz were investigated. The forces obtained from PIV agreed well with the balance data for the static cases. For the oscillating cases, they were comparable to those predicted using Theodorsen’s theory. The latter, a solution of the potential flow problem for a harmonically pitching and heaving flat plate, is an often used prediction method for unsteady aerofoil problems. The similarity between the PIV results and Theodorsen’s method, supports the credibility of the PIV results. The balance measurements were less successful for the aerofoil pitching at high frequencies. They suffered from the actuation forces and resonance with higher frequencies present in the aerofoil motion. This meant that many corrections had to be applied, which were based on estimations of the mechanical properties of the set-up.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Currently, most DTM measures (e.g. traffic signals, route information, ramp meters) function in an isolated manner, which limits its effectiveness from network perspective. More effective traffic management can be obtained when measures are instructed in a coordinated and integrated way, which is referred to as Integrated Network Management (INM). The method of ‘Sustainable Traffic Management’ (STM; in Dutch: GebiedsGericht Benutten) is already available to help joint road authorities to translate strategic policy goals to tactical control objectives, so control can be arranged in a harmonious way. A good method that uses these tactical control objectives for operational traffic management was however still l experienced to be lacking, which led to the following project objective for this thesis: Creating a generic method for comprehensible and maintainable operational traffic management in an urban or regional network, based on the tactical specifications as described in the STM method. Here comprehensibility refers to the clarity of the link between traffic situation and control actions. For road authorities it is vital that this link is obvious and the method does not function like a blackbox, since they are responsible for the consequences. The maintainability refers to the resulting effort to adapt the method when the availability of measures, infrastructure or policy is changed. Literature shows that currently available methods for INM have a limited comprehensibility and maintainability. It is furthermore found that the concept of rule?based control offers the best basis for a control method that can overcome these problems. The STM method already provided some relevant elements, which serve as input for the proposed method. This concerns: o Preferred and alternative routes for important OD?relations o Road priorities o Road functions o Frame of reference Furthermore three principles for operational traffic management are already available and are incorporated in the proposed method. This concerns the ‘sweet to sour´ and ´local to network wide´ control principle; they state that when countering traffic problems first restricted and local measures should be deployed, and that only when problem persist the intrusiveness and area of deployment should increase. The ‘graceful degradation’ principle furthermore states that deterioration of network elements should be strived to occur gradually. The proposed method controls traffic by giving functional instructions as output, which describe the function of a desired DTM measure, rather than its specific operational signal, facilitating a generic and maintainable method. These functional instructions consist of one of four solution directions (rerouting, enhancing throughflow, enhancing outflow or reducing inflow) and one of three control intensities. The applicability of functional instructions to relieve a network element depends on o The monitored traffic situation o STM elements (Road priorities, road functions, frame of reference and identification of preferred and alternative routes) o Network specification (defined network elements, relations between them and boundary conditions and performance insights) The proposed method uses five functioning levels (green?yellow?orange?red?black) as a representation of the state of a road, in which the road’s priority, function and reference value are incorporated, as well as its relevant network specific boundary conditions. A functional instruction is only desirable if the functioning level of the affected network elements is higher than that of the element it aims to relieve. In the proposed method an offline and an online phase are distinguished. In the offline phase, all preliminary work is done, so in the online phase only the monitored traffic situation is added as input to yield the applicable functional instructions. This offline step comprises the formation of an ‘information map’ which contains the definition of all network elements, the thresholds for the functioning levels and their mutual relations. These relations indicate which elements would be affected by a functional instruction to relieve another element. In the online phase, the functioning level of each network element is then identified, and for each deficient network elements the desirability of the functional instructions to relieve it is determined. Depending on the availability of measures and a standard order of functional instructions (in which the three control principles come forward), the applicable functional instructions are selected. The applicable functional instructions can eventually be translated to operational signals to the DTM measures. It is evaluated that the proposed method indeed offers a comprehensible and maintainable way of operational traffic management, better than the methods for INM already available in literature. Eventually it is concluded that with the proposed method now a method for INM is available that is useful for application in practice within a short time span and yields various advantages compared to the methods for INM currently used in the Netherlands. The proposed method offers a good followup to the STM method by translating the provided tactical control objectives to operational deployment of measures.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Wijntjes, M. (mentor)","2011","Websites have become important means for companies to create revenue. It is important for these websites that as many visitors as possible take the desired action that ultimately leads to the revenue for the website owners. The ratio of visitors who take this call-to-action relative to the number of total website visits is called the conversion-rate. Higher conversion-rates mean higher revenue and therefore websites pay a lot of attention to the optimization of conversion. There are many ways to design and optimize websites towards a high conversion-rate. Persuasive design is one of such ways. Persuasive design attempts to intentionally influence users towards a desired behavior. In this case that behavior is acting upon the desired call-to-action on the website. Persuasive design on websites can happen at different levels of which the perceptual level is one. At Fabrique, a design agency in The Netherlands with web design as a core business, is persuasive design on the perceptual level often overshadowed. Both interaction and visual designers do apply some perceptual persuasion techniques already, but this merely happens intuitively and at an unconscious level. It is hypothesized that a design tool enabling designers at Fabrique to apply perceptual persuasion principles more systematically and deliberately would increase the conversion-rate of the websites made by Fabrique. This tool should provide designers with an overview of possible perceptual persuasion principles and has to be usable, accessible, applicable, recognizable, and understandable for the designers. Three resources were consulted to construct the content of the design tool. The first resource was an extensive literature study. This followed by a designers assignment focused on retrieving the latent and tacit knowledge of designers at Fabrique regarding perceptual persuasion principles. The content construction finished with a website study in which best practices of the web were analyzed. This construction phase resulted into a list of perceptual persuasion principles. A user-centered iterative design process of prototyping and testing followed to find both the optimal content and physical form of the design tool. A total of 14 significant iterations took place of which 5 iterations were mainly determinative for the form. The first iteration resulted in a poster, but was not very suitable to test with. A second iteration led to separate cards for each principle. These cards were very useful to test the content of the design tool, as principles could be added, deleted and grouped easily. Therefore during the third and fourth iteration the physical form of the design tool was kept the same, but the content system within the design tool changed. Multiple tests with designers showed that the principles in the tool were used in two ways: for inspiration and as arguments for discussion. To support the functionality of principles being used as arguments, the tool had to enable easy searching, which led to the formation of two different group systems. The first grouping system was focused on the search functionality, enabling designers to find principles based on the kind of web element the principle included. These 11 groups were called the Categories. The second grouping system focused on the underlaying perceptual persuasion foundation of the principles and therefore called Fundaments. There were seven Fundaments in total. Each principle was divided into both kinds of groups. The final iteration resulted into a swatch like design tool called inSights that perfectly supported the search functionality and the two group systems. All principles were visualized and structured similar. A first evaluative study was performed to prove the working of the tool. Two groups of two designers were asked to make a redesign of a web page. Only one group could use the design tool. These two redesign and the original page were evaluated by 30 participants in a user study. The participants were shortly exposed to the web page after which they were asked to fill in a questionnaire. This questionnaire evaluated the attitude towards the page, and willingness and ability to click. A second task was to rank the redesigns and original page based on their persuasiveness. Analysis of the results showed that significantly more participants ranked the redesign made with the design tool first. This result was supported by the questionnaire, which also showed that participants found the redesign based on the design tool more eyecatching and enjoyable. A second study was performed to investigate any possible hierarchy between principles of different Fundaments regarding their persuasiveness, because this could be very useful information to include in the design tool. A similar method as in the first study was used. Four designers of Fabrique designed multiple variations of a web page, in which each variation was based on principles of only one Fundament. These different variations were evaluated in the same way and by the same participants as in the first study. Analysis of the results showed that both the ranking and the outcome of the questionnaire did not indicate any significant hierarchy between Fundaments. Therefore could be concluded that all Fundaments have a similar level of effectiveness and that there is no need to include any extra information in the design tool.","web design; visual perception; persuasion; design tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-05-10","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

One of the companies who has taken an interest in this is ProRail. Together with the faculty of Technology, Policy and Management of the Delft University of Technology they started a project to develop a gaming simulation suite for training and decision making purposes, called the Railway Gaming Suite. In order to connect the games and simulators of the suite a solid architecture is needed. Three architectures were picked out to see if they are suitable for this, namely: Service Oriented Architectures, High Level Architecture and FAMAS Simulation Backbone. Using the Railway Gaming Suite as a case study, we have extracted requirements (like performance and flexibility) for an architecture for gaming simulation suites using the Architectural Trade-off Analysis Method. These requirements are used to determine the suitability of the three architectures. In this thesis the research on the suitability of Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) is presented. A prototype SOA was created, called Service Oriented Gaming and Simulation (SOGS). This prototype was used to test the performance requirement for the evaluation. The suitability was investigated by evaluating SOA to see if it is able to support the requirements we found. We subsequently also compared the suitability of the other architectures. Intermediate results of this thesis project were used to help with the decision for selecting an architecture for the Railway Gaming Suite.","serious games; software engineering; software architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-05-11","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Software Engineering","",""

(mentor); Ludema, M.W. (mentor); Ottjes, J.A. (mentor)","2011","As a response to the current negative developments in the chemical business, IMLOG developed its Lead Logistics Provider concept for PRODA. This concept takes care of all road and intermodal (containerized) transports of liquid bulk chemicals of PRODA throughout Europe. Most of the transports are performed by IMLOG, but for specific transports IMLOG is supported by LLP transport partners. After almost two years operating the concept issues have arisen, which indicates that there is room for improvement within IMLOG’s LLP concept. Eye-catching issues involve lost of market feeling by PRODA, poor concept success measurement and operational inefficiencies. These issues formed the motive for a project to first identify IMLOG’s LLP concept related issues, followed by the determination of the improvement opportunities resulting from these issues. Finally the carefully selected improvement opportunity is elaborated by means of a functional design. Therefore the following design objective is adopted within the project: Design an improvement measure based on a carefully selected improvement opportunity within IMLOG’s LLP concept. To be able to fulfil the project objective certain problem design questions are formulated. Answering these question guides the design objective fulfilment process. These problem design questions go in more detail on:  Understanding on the LLP concept from a theoretical perspective.  Understanding on IMLOG’s LLP concept for PRODA.  To what extend IMLOG can be classified as a LLP.  Lessons to be learned from comparing theory with practice and practice itself.  Factors that influence the decision for elaborating on a certain improvement opportunity.  Fundamental changes related to the functional design.  Important topics towards implementation. PART I – Identification of IMLOG’s Lead Logistics Provider concept issues The LLP concept is a form in which a LSP provides it logistics service to its clients. Just like other logistics provider forms, a LLP creates value by relating the buyer and the seller of a product. Outsourcing of logistics activities by the buyer or seller determines to be the reason why LSP exist. The relationship between the LSP, the buyer and/or the seller can range from pure transactional towards fully relational. A relationship on partner level (a partnership) arises when LSPs are involved in the business of its customer on a strategic level. Success of a partnership depends on qualitative and quantitative factors for which both the logistics services serve as input. Logistics services are being delivered by combining resources under control of coordination mechanisms. From a theoretical perspective the LLP concept can be classified as a hybrid of an operational 3PL with the responsibilities of a 4PL. Characteristics of the LLP concept (LLP key success factors) are derived from this classification. Operating the LLP concept should also contribute in relieving the logistics business from currently experienced issues. Therefore a set of structural issues, also known as pitfalls, is formulated. The LLP key success factors and pitfalls will serve as starting point in the determination of IMLOG’s LLPness by comparing literature with practice. IMLOG’s LLP concept was initiated by PRODA’s need for lower logistics costs, improved customer service levels and improved sustainability within the supply chain. Within the LLP concept a distinction is being made between physical and administrative logistics services. Main physical logistics services involve transportation, storage and container cleaning. LLP transport partner management, transport order and transport chain coordination, payment portal, track & trace and optimisation/integration are considered to be administrative logistics services provided by IMLOG’s LLP concept for PRODA. The organisational structure of the LLP concept is mainly formed around the four types of transport offered by the IMLOG’s LLP concept: LLP transport partner transport, short distance road transport, long distance road transport and intermodal transport. Issue are identified by determination of IMLOG’s LLPness from a theoretical perspective and investigation of the IMLOG’s LLP concept in practice. The determination of IMLOG’s LLPness resulted in concept issues. The quality level of the partnership between IMLOG and PRODA involving the LLP concept is medium, where improvement can be realised by focussing more on the relational elements in the partnership instead of the operational ones. IMLOG’s LLP concept for PRODA fulfils 50 percent of the LLP concept critical success factors identified. Four of the critical success factors are not fully met, but with slight changes in the concept these factors could also be met. Only one critical success factors scores very low on IMLOG’s LLP concept for PRODA: IMLOG fulfils no leading role in logistics, supply and demand chain integration. From this can be concluded that IMLOG cannot be classified as a LLP in the concept it provides for PRODA from a theoretical perspective. With confronting IMLOG’s LLP concept for PRODA with the pitfalls identified in literature it can be concluded that most of the pitfalls are encountered. No continuous improvement, no extensive performance measurement programme and a lack of pro-activity are the most important pitfalls encountered. On the other hand with its LLP concept IMLOG was able to completely avoid the pitfalls involving a lack of flexibility and tailored systems and structures and the absence of pan European coverage. Investigation of IMLOG’s LLP concept in practice resulted in relationship issues, service fulfilment issues and business process issues. The relational issues originate from unmet expectations by PRODA caused by the absence of extensive benchmark activities in the concept and pro-active information supply from IMLOG’s side. Service fulfilment issues are identified by analysing performance data from the beginning of IMLOG’s LLP concept for PRODA. It can be concluded that the service levels are increased against lower cost after the deployment of IMLOG’s LLP concept for PRODA. Nevertheless the performance data show that the number of underweight shipment and the number of late deliveries know very unstable behaviour, which can be identified as the two main service fulfilment issues. Numerous business process issues are identified which are involved to the daily key operational processes within IMLOG’s LLP concept for PRODA. Most of the issues identified involve internal processes of IMLOG LLP department, where a few issues are related to the interface between IMLOG, the LLP transport partners and PRODA. PART II – Determination of improvement opportunities & selection The identified issues serve as input for the determination of four main improvement opportunities within IMLOG’s LLP concept. The first step in this determination process involves clustering the identified issues in three improvement domains: the relationship domain, the service fulfilment domain and the business process domain. Based on the issues clustered in the three improvement domains, four main improvement opportunity types are derived. First type of improvement opportunity involves business approach change, which results from the relationship domain. If IMLOG would like to adopt itself towards the theoretical LLP, certain major changes cannot be by-passed. These changes will influence IMLOG’s current way of performing business: its business approach. The second improvement opportunity defined is Customer Relationship Management (CRM), derived from the relationship domain as well. CRM provides an integral approach with a focus on customer development and customer retention. By adopting a CRM strategy unmet expectations at the customer’s side can be eliminated through a good understanding of each other perception of requirements and performance. Enabling factors in CRM are availability of information and the use of an extensive performance measurement programme. The third improvement opportunity defined is the performance measurement structure. Both identified concept issues and service fulfilment issues shows that performance measurement in IMLOG’s LLP concept is not optimal. By developing and implementing an extensive performance measurement structure, the related issues can be solved. The fourth type of improvement opportunity lies in business process change solving the service fulfilment and business process issues clustered in the domains of the same name. All except two identified business change improvement opportunities are directly related to operational functions within IMLOG’s LLP concept; the remaining two involve supporting functions. Based on the nature of the business process change improvement opportunity identified a certain change programme are proposed; ranging from rightsizing to business reengineering. The selection for a certain improvement opportunity to elaborate upon is made by comparing all identified improvement opportunities on four factors. These factors are facilitation of growth, improvement of internal performance, creating a win-win situation and the challenge in the elaboration process. In close collaboration with IMLOG is agreed that business process change involve the most promising improvement opportunities. When improving IMLOG’s internal business processes, not only IMLOG benefits. The customer benefits as well, by higher services levels and probably reduced costs. In special the container assignment process will be main topic of interest within the design task. Reengineering the container process will result in a totally new process design on container assignment, although some basic principles will be applied in the assignment processes. PART III – Design of an integral container management system Besides the container assignment process, two other container management functions can be improved through centralisation. Taking these two additional container management functions into account next to the container assignment process, a functional design of an integral container management system is developed. This system knows three main functions: container assignment, container maintenance coordination and empty container repositioning. The key in the integral container management system is that all three container management functions are centralised in the Centralised Container Management System (CCMS). This is in contrast with the current situation where these three functions are managed on a regional level. Following this design task scoping process requirements are formulated which serve as input for the CCMS’s functional design development process. Within the CCMS each container management function knows a process for which a functional design is made. The container profile, containing all information on container characteristics, is the main element within these three processes. For the container assignment process the shipment order profile, containing the shipment order characteristics, is essential as well. In this process a container is assigned to a certain shipment order based on a match between the container and shipment order profile. Database checks and incidental notifications trigger the container maintenance coordination process through which all arrangements for maintenance are made. Empty container repositioning is responsible for solving imbalances in IMLOG’s network involving empty containers. Empty containers are shipped to the areas in IMLOG’s network where they are needed the most. For each of the processes the involvement of different actors including their interfaces is presented. Key Performance Indicators are proposes as well to be able to measure the performance of the three processes and the CCMS in total. All but one of the earlier defined requirements are fulfilled within the functional design presented. The requirement that was not fully fulfilled within the design proved to be not accurate according practice. Issues being solved and efficiency improvement of the container management related processes are highly expected when implementing the presented functional CCMS design. To provide insight in the steps prior to the CCMS implementation, important topics are identified. Resources needed in the process toward a full operational CCMS are addressed, including the costs related to this process. The importance of change management in the development and implementation phase is discussed as well. Automation thru a Decision Support System (DSS) can be identified as a major factor in optimisation of the container management processes. Therefore the principles of a Decision Support System are discussed. Eventually steps concerning further development towards a full operational CCMS are identified. Conclusions & recommendations The design objective in this project is fulfilled by identification of issues and improvement opportunities, selection of one from which a functional design is made. Looking at IMLOG’s LLP concept it can be concluded from a theoretical perspective that IMLOG does not fully fulfils the profile of a true LLP from a theoretical perspective. Although the current form of IMLOG’s LLP concept could perfectly be developed towards a true LLP. The identified issues serve as perfect opportunities in this development process. Looking at the current practice of the IMLOG’s LLP concept a lots of improvement opportunities can be identified. Optimisation of internal operational processes forms in here a perfect start. Additionally a stronger focus on relationship management in IMLOG’s LLP concept is needed to improve customer satisfaction. An extensive performance measurement structure will support relationship management, but provides more detailed insight on IMLOG’s internal performance as well. To take full advantage of the extensive performance measurement structure an appropriate Information system is needed. An extensive information system will enable optimisation of IMLOG’s internal processes through automation as well. For successful implementation of the CCMS, a broader scope in the development process must be adopted. This allows the design to be tailored to its environment which should positively influence the CCMS performance on the long run. Automation is a very important enabling factor in improving the efficiency of processes; therefore a high level of automation should be applied within the CCMS. The success of the CCMS depends on highly on the support within the IMLOG company: change management should be extensively applied in creating this support. Furthermore opportunities on including multiple order assignment per container per day, real-time container assignment and integration of transport planning and the CCMS should be investigated for further efficiency improvements.","Lead Logistics Provider; LLP; intermodal; chemical; logistic concept; logistics management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-31","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport, Infrastructure & Logistics","","Transport, Infrastructure & Logistics","",""

(mentor); Van Paassen, L.A. (mentor); Ngan-Tillard, D.J.M. (mentor)","2011","Actual bearing capacity of piles in Almere often differs from the expected values as calculated using nearby CPT data; the calculated strength is often higher than can be achieved in the field. To calculate the bearing capacity of foundation piles within Almere an addition has therefore been made to the standard NEN6743-1. The proposed hypotheses for these deviations include heterogeneous soil behavior and overconsolidation. These hypotheses are tested by a multiple data acquisition approach in which available data such as geological data and available maps have been used along with new acquired data including GEM-2, CPT, core logs and laboratory tests to obtain a better insight in the problem. The investigated maps, Begemann core logs and CPT data has shown that the subsurface of Almere indeed reflects a heterogeneous character at multiple scales. Comparing CPT soil behavior type profiles to Begemann-, grain size- and micro scale CT scan data concludes that the translation from CPT data to in situ soil parameters can be inaccurate; different soil types can show a similar behavior. Inaccurate CPT interpretations can result in bearing capacity miscalculations, but by itself cannot be the result of the deviating soil behavior of Almere. Overconsolidation of the soil has been proven by vertical stress calculations and multi-stage triaxial test results of two samples. Overconsolidation ratio (OCR) calculations based on steady state vertical stress profiles might have been underestimated in the Holocene clay layers: as a result of ongoing pore pressure dissipation resulting from the land reclamation the OCR and soil strength increases over time. Overconsolidation may have also resulted in an overcompacted soil which has the tendency to dilate when applied to vibratory sources, such as during the installation of pile foundations. Both statements have to be verified.","NEN-6743; overconsolidation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""
