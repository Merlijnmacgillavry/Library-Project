(mentor); Weijnen, M.P.C. (mentor); Correljé, A.F. (mentor); Wirtz, A.C. (mentor)","2013","The EU and the Netherlands have set multiple energy transition objectives for the year 2020. In 2009 the European Council has formulated long term goals to reach 80-95% greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for 2050, which comes down to an 80% CO2-emission reduction overall and a 95% CO2-emission reduction in the fossil-fuelled power production sector. Since power production capacity investments are only done by power production companies in the liberalized market, they are key players with a vital role for achieving CO2-emission reductions and an energy transition. Since the future electricity market situation is uncertain, it is interesting to get more insight in how different scenarios will affect the profitability of power plants and how the profitability could affect the investments that contribute to the energy transition. The EU and governments of the member states therefore have to cooperate with the power production companies to specify the roadmaps and realize the energy transition. The main goal of this research is to explore the possible profitability of Dutch fossil-fuelled power plants in 2020. The main research question is formulated as follows: What role do fossil-fuelled power plants play in the energy transition? This question touches upon both the importance of having fossil-fuelled power generation capacity available for meeting the power demand and the energy transition which implicates achieving the European and national energy policy objectives. From a stakeholder analysis it follows that the Dutch government and power producers are very dependent on each other. While power producers strive for continuity and making profits, the government wants to maintain a low electricity price, high security of supply and wants to protect the climate and environment. The research method applied for this research consists of linear modeling the Dutch merit order, a scenario analysis with the merit order model and spreadsheet modeling in order to be able do to a profitability analysis of power production portfolios. For the scenario analysis 36 scenarios for the year 2020 were created, based on different settings for the natural gas price, coal price and CO2-emission price. For all the scenarios the profitability of the Dutch expected installed fossil-fuelled power production capacity in 2020 is determined. The most important variables that cannot be influenced by the owners of the fossil-fuelled power plants, but do affect the profitability of these plants, are: the natural gas price, coal price and CO2-emission price. From the model outputs it can be concluded that the natural gas price, coal price and CO2-emission price all should be increased in order to cause a shift in the merit order so that gas-fired power plants become cheaper than coal-fired power plants. Only when this shift in the merit order is created with a high coal price and CO2-emission price, a CO2-emission reduction occurs. Since the majority of the installed power production capacity in 2020 is fossil-fuelled, the security of supply depends mainly on the fossil-fuelled power production capacity. Unprofitable power plants could be mothballed or shut down by the energy producers, which would lead to a very low security of supply. However, since the electricity has to remain affordable, a balance between the values of the three variables has to be found. As becomes clear from the scenario analysis, the CO2-emission price level needs to increase significantly before any shifts in the merit order are realized. This should be done by market intervention, since the CO2-emission price will most likely not reach the desired value through the market. However, a Dutch national increase of the CO2-emission price does not per se lead to the desired effect, if the power producers in neighbouring countries do not experience the same market conditions as in the Netherlands. An increased CO2-emission price on the European level should therefore be encouraged.","energy transition; profitability; power plant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy and Industry","","","",""

(mentor); Romero, N. (mentor)","2013","This report presents the Graduation Project: “Mediator tool to increase the acceptance of technologies among seniors”. The project is the culmination of the MSc Programme in Design for Interaction at the Faculty of Industrial Design at Delft University of Technology. Several technologies have been developed to support seniors to live independently at home by enabling them to stay active and productive for longer, to keep a good health, to maintain social networks or to increase personal security to give some examples. Even though technologies to enable an independent living exist, seniors still face barriers in exploiting such technologies to their full potential. The report presents a tool to increase the acceptance of technologies for independent living among seniors. The focus was on motivating seniors to interact with technologies through a tool that is an intermediate step among seniors and technologies. The mediator tool should be implemented before seniors had the first contact with the technology and would encourage them to interacting with it. At the same time the mediator tool should be external to the technology itself. An innovative technology that supports seniors independent living based on a TV platform, the Care@Home system, was taken as case study. The graduation project was supported by one of the stakeholders in the development of the Care@home system, the Interactive Intelligence Group of Delft University of technology. In a literature research, factors that influence the acceptance of technologies were studied. Analysis of qualitative interviews among seniors was done to further explore the factors that influence the acceptance of technologies for independent living in a real context. The research indicated that seniors are motivated to accept new technologies when the clearly perceive the benefits that they can provide into own lives. The goal of the project was on arise awareness about possible gains to be obtained through the use of the technology by enabling seniors to discover by themselves if they could benefit from such technology. The mediator tool is a communication tool to go beyond informing seniors the gains that they could obtain; it allows seniors to create their own experience. This goal was used to develop design ideas. Three ideas were presented to seniors to research what elements of the designs would motivate them to encounter for the first time a technology for independent living. Seniors feedback was used to identify areas of opportunity for the mediator tool. It was found that seniors are motivated by trying new technologies in familiar social settings where they can interact with peers. These two elements were incorporated in the design concept, the Realization Pathway. In order to verify if the Realization Pathway reached its goal, enabling seniors to discover by themselves if they could benefit from a technology for independent living, a prototype was built and tested among nine seniors. The prototype was a low-tech version of the design concept developed that emulated the intended interactions. The participant in the user test confirmed the value of the design: The Realization Pathway aroused awareness about the possibilities of technologies for independent living. The Realization Pathway enabled to gain knowledge and then decide if one can benefit from the technology or not. The Realization Pathway enabled to meet a new technology in an positive social experience. A larger study with a diverse group of seniors with diverse needs is necessary. Most of participants recognized the gains that they could get but did not think that they could benefit from the technology. Participants value to be aware about what new technologies offer and the social side of the experience provided by the Realization Pathway. These preliminary findings suggest that using communication tools in social familiar settings could motivate seniors to approach technologies for independent living.","technology; acceptance; senior","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Govers, P. (mentor)","2013","The process of New Product Development is one of the most important competitive factors in today’s market environment. Nevertheless, it remains an risky and uncertain business and both the academic field as companies try to identify best practices to improve this process. In the past two decades, firms have increasingly adopted Information Technology (IT) tools and services to improve NPD effectiveness and efficiency. Such IT tools can support knowledge and information management, collaboration and communication, but also in the design and engineering of the product. Developments in technology, like the emergence of Web2.0, and the shift from closed innovation to a more open innovation system has caused firms to gain interest in using open innovation and new media tools in NPD activities. New tools emerge or are added to existing software, which makes IT pervasive in all phases of NPD. To improve the process of NPD and to justify investments in IT, it is important for firms to understand the impact of these tools on NPD outcomes. Since these tools are relatively new, as is their use, little empirical research exists that investigates these relationships. The main goal of this study is therefore to investigate the use of IT and open innovation tools in the New Product Development process and its impact on NPD outcomes. The study is part of a cross-national study in the United States, Australia and The Netherlands. This thesis is concerned with the Dutch part. An online survey was distributed to 209 project-level NPD team members. The survey asked the respondents to evaluate the extent of usage of 18 IT tools for each major phase in the NPD process; the discovery, development and commercialization phase. Respondents also had to evaluate project outcomes for each phase, and indicate which external partners were involved per phase. Important controls and antecedents include product complexity, competitive intensity, open innovation climate, IT infrastructure, IT embeddedness and IT champion. The final sample of The Netherlands consisted of 104 respondents which results in a 50% response rate. The functional area of the participants is balanced between R&D (35%), Sales and Marketing (24%) and ‘Other’ (31%) representing CEO’s or directors. The firms of the respondents are either quite small (51% has less than 500 employees) or quite big (25% has more than 10,000 employees), predominantly established (68% is older than 20 years) and multinational (82%). The findings suggest that most companies involve customers and suppliers in their NPD activities. The extent of usage of new media and social media open innovation tools is lower than traditional tools (e.g. Email). Next to that, IT tool usage differs across phases. Total IT usage appears to be higher in the discovery and development phase compared to the commercialization phase. The antecedent IT infrastructure was found to have most significant effect on the use of IT, though not always as expected. While a better IT infrastructure has a positive impact Process & Project Management tools and Social Media Tools, it has a negative effect on Traditional Tools. This suggests that a better IT infrastructure causes a shift in the type of tools used in a company. Furthermore, Social Media tools (e.g. Social Networking tools) have a positive impact on Process Performance, while using Traditional tools in the commercialization phase can negatively influence Process Performance. This study provides a snapshot of the use and impact of a set of IT and open innovation tools. To understand its developments and impact over time, the use of specific IT tools by phase should be examined again in a few years. The impact of IT infrastructure on the use of specific IT tools also needs further investigation as well as the impact of Social Media on NPD outcomes.","Information Technology; Open Innovation; New Product Development; Social Media","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor); Van de Kerk, A.J. (mentor); Molenaar, W.F. (mentor); Uijttewaal, W.S.J. (mentor)","2013","Salt intrusion is undesired because it has negative effects for drinking water and agricultural water intakes. At the Krammer locks (Zeeland, the Netherlands) a complex system is integrated in the design of the lock which prevents salt intrusion very accurate. This effective reduction of salt intrusion is regrettably accompanied with high energy consumption, high operational costs and high maintenance costs. On top of that, the entire system needs big maintenance in 2 years (20 M euro) and an extensive expansion in 10 years (300 M euro). Since retaining the current system is very expensive, other options have been elaborated. A pilot project is carried out in the smallest lock of the complex. The pilot has as main objective to get insight in possibilities for a design in the much larger commercial locks. The objective of this study is to present a feasible design for a salt intrusion prevention system in the commercial locks. It should be comparably effective as the current system, while having lower energy consumption, lower construction costs, lower maintenance costs, lower operational costs and a higher lock capacity. After an analysis it became clear that this is possible by including a movable sill in the structure. A comparison with the design of the pilot and the current system must prove the abilities of the new design. The presence of a movable sill results in a height reduction of the air bubble- and water screens in the new design. The screens are both integrated in the movable sill. In operation, the sill moves vertically up and down once every tidal cycle of 12 hours. It allows ships to sail over it, while being positioned as high as possible. Above the top level of the sill, the integrated screens reduce the negative effects. In this way, the optimum reduction of water exchange is obtained. The design of the screens is partly based on the design of the pilot. It’s optimised by using other dimensions and reducing the required air pressure for the air bubble screens. After determining the governing loads on the structure, a dimensioning has led to the final design. The driving mechanism is located above water and controls the height of the sill via vertical steel tubes. The structure is integrated in the existing lock chamber, in which a guiding rail distributes the forces of the sill to the lock chamber. The design is first compared to the current situation. In this comparison it becomes clear that salt intrusion prevention of the current system can be matched closely. The reduction of fresh water loss by the system improves considerably and the capacity of the lock increases by a third. A comparison of the design with the design of the pilot is quantified as being approximately 20% more effective, consuming 50% less energy and being 30% cheaper than a configuration with air bubble- and water screens only. The expected improvements of the design in this study show that it is an interesting design. The quantifications are obtained by calculations based on various assumptions. Before the design can be realised, there are quite a few important recommendations which need to be elaborated. The assumptions in the used calculation methods need attention especially. Nevertheless, the presented design shows that a movable sill is an interesting option, to which further studies seem worthwhile. Apart from a realisation in the Krammer locks, the design has a broader potential; the benefits hold for all locks with salt intrusion countermeasures installed. It’s especially interesting in deep locks or locks with an increasing mean water level. In that case the effectiveness may increase even more.","salt; lock; intrusion; salt intrusion prevention; movable sill","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Sonneveld, M.H. (mentor)","2013","This graduation project is done for Tristar Europe B.V. The company’s core portfolio consists of domestic appliances, with a strategy to produce low-cost products in China to sell in a low price segment in Europe. However, the focus of the company is slowly changing and Tristar wants to become a more competitive and progressive brand. Tristar has detected an opportunity in their growing Funcooking section: developing a new product to take the lead in this market segment. The company desired a product that responds to the growing problem of obesity and help people cook together in a fun and healthy way. Research questions were set up to gain information about the company, funcooking, cooking & food, the market, context and obesity. The questions were answered during the analysis by retrieving the needed information through Tristar, literature research, an expert opinion and user research. The goal of this analysis was to formulate a grounded philosophy for the product that had to be designed. The ideal social cooking experience is like the Dutch Sinterklaas celebration with surprise gifts; the excitement and curiosity on forehand and spending the evening together in a cozy and relaxed atmosphere. Next to these feelings, people want to discover good food, feel balanced and share new experiences. Five core values regarding a dinner ritual were extracted; creating a cozy and relaxed atmosphere, togetherness, anticipatory pleasure, consciousness and activeness. These all contribute to enjoyment; enjoying each other and enjoying the food. With a design direction derived from the analysis, the ideation and conceptualization was started. The aim was to design a social cooking and eating ritual in combination with a corresponding funcooking device which evokes the diners in trying this new ritual. All ideas were built around the storyboard which tells the intended story of the social cooking ritual and keeps the core values in mind. Different parts of this storyboard were put into a timeline, each part having different designed solutions. By intuitively combining these solutions, the strongest ‘tracks’ in telling the intended story were extracted. The ‘TRIcook with app’ was chosen and further embodied. TRIcook ritual: The host will use the phone App to explore and decide on basic ingredients thereby afterwards sending invitations in which the diners will be asked to come up with a course based on these ingredients. Both the host and the invited diners will experience a growing curiosity due to the task. The diners will work together to create each course and the dinner will exist of cooking and tasting the different small courses after another. Working together creates togetherness and will be even strengthened by sharing all dishware and by presenting food to each other. Tasting and being conscious about the food is an important part of this ritual. TRIcook device: Using the TRIcook device, everybody is working together to create a dish: cutting on the three cutting boards, cooking on the three grill-devices and presenting this using the three plates. All parts are triangular and the arrangement will adapt to the users during the ritual, which contributes to the interaction with each other and the food. The plates and cutting boards have respectively a bended and hinged corner, which will invite the diners to pick it up, pass it around and present it to the other diners. Furthermore, pinchers are included eating tools for being in close contact with the food. A user test was performed to test if the diners encounter the intended social and food interactions during the ritual and whether this leads to a fun, cozy and healthy experience. This validation was twofold: on one hand the scenario with the tasks and the multiple courses and on the other hand the interaction with the designed product on the table.","Tristar; TRIcook; funcooking; design; cooking ritual","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Desmet, P.M.A. (mentor)","2013","Noise reduction in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is an important goal as it impacts the health and comfort of the critically ill patients as well as the health and concentration of staff. Research shows that a considerable amount of noise produced in the ICU can be influenced by ICU staff. However, until now there are no interventions that sustainably change the behavior of staff to reduce noise. This project aims to do so by creating a design that will make ICU staff be happier being quieter. The project is conducted within the context of the Clear Mind project at Philips and the Delft Institute of Positive Design. The Intensive Care Unit In the ICUs of hospitals, critically ill patients are monitored and treated by specialized staff. The ICU doctors set up the medical plan for the treatment which is executed by the nurses. Nurses are supported in their activities by several medical devices that create alarms. Noise in the ICU These alarms contribute to the noise in the ICU that exceeds several health guidelines. The excessive noise has a detrimental effect on the patients' health that is already in critical condition: even in sedated people, excessive noise leads to stress and disturbance of sleep which slow healing and are thought to be connected to delirium. Delirium is a state of confusion in patients that increases their length of stay and mortality. Reduction of noise in ICUs is thus necessary to improve the patient outcome. Research shows that next to alarms, a significant amount of noise is produced by staff activity and conversation. Interventions that change the behavior of staff to reduce noise have not yet achieved a significant and long-term reduction of noise. This project investigated how to sustainably reduce noise by changing staff behavior through design. Behavior change Literature research showed that a behavior change in staff could be created by increasing their motivation or ability to reduce noise and a trigger that activates the desired behavior. It was furthermore found that in order to make the behavior change sustainable, staff had to be positively motivated. This lead to the design goal of making the ICU staff be happier being quieter. Context research conducted at an ICU revealed three stages in the ICU routine into which a trigger had to fit in order to be effective: direct (visual) patient monitoring, indirect (aural) patient monitoring and review of patient condition. It was also found that staff could influence noise contribution caused by alarms, personal conversation, open doors and professional actions and activities. The motivation and ability of staff underlying each category were then revealed by user research. The major staff priorities were found to be about relating to colleagues, doing meaningful work and ensuring patient health and comfort. Iterative design Based on the insights of context and user research, initial ideas were generated and tested in focus groups to validate the design strategy. After it proved effective, ideas generated during a design workshop led to design directions and selection of a direction. It was concluded that the motivation of staff to reduce noise had to be increased before their ability. Mock-ups of initial concepts to increase motivation were tested with ICU staff and refined through design and another focus group with staff. Final concept Field research and iterative design resulted in the final concept, called the silence level. Before use, the motivation of staff to reduce noise is increased through education. The concept then enables staff to monitor the silence level during their routine via integrated and ambient feedback in effective locations. The silence level motivates staff positively because the focus is on creating silence instead of avoiding noise. Furthermore, the silence level refers to patient health and comfort, which motivates staff, and the different actions staff can take to improve the silence level, which gives them the ability to act immediately. The evaluation of a working prototype with ICU staff showed that the design worked as intended. The next step in the development would be a long-term test in an ICU.","ICU; intensive Care Unit; intensive Care; noise; patient health; well-being; behavior change; noise reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-04-26","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

This work has been elaborated as part of the Reinventing the Toilet Challenge for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which is part of a strategy to promote safe and clean sanitation in developing countries. This system is composed of two main elements, a diverting toilet and a dewatering system. The diverting toilet adheres to the toilet ritual and its elements of the particular characteristics of urban slums in Delhi. It is a squatting pan with a pour-flush system with the main characteristic of urine and faces separation. After re-direction, faecal material goes through a 3 stage process for water extraction; mix, dewatering and storage. During the first stage the faecal material is conditioned with a flocculant in order to facilitate water extraction. The dewatering process (second stage) is a dual process. It includes a gravity drainage and a screw compression unit. Finally, a third stage where sunlight and heat from the plasma unit are used for waste dehydration.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","IPD","",""

(mentor); Van Ledden, M. (mentor); Luijendijk, A.P. (mentor); De Boer, G.J. (mentor)","2013","For many applications in the field of coastal engineering 2D-morphological models are being applied. Due to the large computational effort these models demand it is nearly impossible to include a full wave climate in long-term morphological modeling. This has asked for waveclimate reduction methods in order to reduce the input and consequently the computational time of a simulation. Various methods exist to reduce a wave-climate, from straightforward approaches to more sophisticated ones. In this thesis four methods have been chosen and their outcomes have been compared to each other. From the different simulations with different sets of boundary conditions have followed different longshore sediment transport (LST) rates along both the undisturbed coast as well as along the groyne. In most practical applications the reduced set of conditions is upscaled making use of so-called upscaling factors. This makes it possible to accurately reproduce the LST-rate along the undisturbed coast with a reduced set of conditions but questions arise whether this reduced set still accurately reproduces the LST-rate along a groyne or breakwater that protrudes the surfzone. Various reduced sets of wave-conditions have therefore been applied in a 2Dh-morphological model for the testcase of the Salaverry-harbour in Peru. The LST-rate along the groyne has been upscaled with the same upscaling factor as was used to regenerate the LST-rate along the coast. Results have shown that in this case the choice of an input reduction technique barely influences the accuracy as long as a minimum of 8 conditions is taken into account. Moreover all the reduced sets of conditions based on different input reduction methods reproduce the original LST-rate with an accuracy in the order of 2 to 3 %. In case less than 8 conditions are taken into account the accuracy reduces. Besides that it has been shown that it is more important to account for a variation in both wave height and wave direction rather than solely varying the reduced wave-climate based on one of these characteristics. The value for the grain size diameter influences these outcomes only marginally.","morphological modeling; sediment transport; numerical modeling; boundary conditions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2013","The competitiveness of container seaport terminals is mainly determined by the time in port for ships (transshipment time), and the rates for loading and discharging. The goal of this thesis is to reduce transshipment times by using model predictive scheduling, combined with a switching max-plus linear system description. Container terminals generally utilize cranes to load and unload ships, specialized equipment to store containers in large stacks, and vehicles to transport containers between cranes and stacks. An unloading cycle generally consists of three distinct steps, which are the unloading by a quay crane, the transport from the crane to the stack, and finally the stacking. The dynamics of this transportation system as a whole can be influenced by choosing the vehicle which is assigned to each of the container jobs, and by choosing the order in which vehicles and stacking cranes handle their containers. The dynamics of this system are mainly determined by the time it takes to perform each of these steps, and by synchronizations between the steps. This makes it possible to describe this system with a switching max-plus linear (SMPL) model. This thesis will show how one can describe the container transport system as an SMPL system. Furthermore, this thesis will show how the goal of minimizing transshipment times can be reached with the use of model predictive scheduling (MPS). It will be shown that the MPS problem for this SMPL system can be rewritten as a mixed integer linear programming problem, for which various efficient solvers exist. This allows one to find the solution to the MPS problem for large scale container terminals within a short solution time.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); Vermeeren, A.P.O.S. (mentor)","2013","Heart failure patients suffer from a chronic condition that is caused by decreased efficiency of the heart muscle. This limits the physical abilities of the body, and can lead to emotional problems such as depression and anxiety. Heart failure patients generally experience frequent hospital readmissions, and the medical treatments in the hospital are very expensive. In recent research on 'Patient-Centered Care', a structured approach was proposed to create a better cooperation between patients and healthcare professionals during hospitalization. This way, the medical treatment and setup of the care plan can be better tailored to the specific needs of patients. This increases patient satisfaction, improves treatment adherence and can lead to better health outcomes. Following these results, Philips was interested to explore this care approach for hospitalized heart failure patients. The goal of this project was to: ""Design an interactive system that increases patient involvement in the development of their personal care plan during hospitalization."" Through literature research and observational studies in two hospitals, information was gained about the hospital environment, structure and treatment process in practice. This was followed-up by performing a series of detailed interviews with cardiologists, nurses and patients. This provided thorough insights into the problems of the current hospitalization process, and opportunities for engaging patients in their care more explicitly. Three concrete design directions have been introduced as a result of the research and analysis phase: 1. Support the patient in describing and discussing their personal narrative 2. Support the care plan formulation process by the cardiologist and nurse 3. Support the presentation of the care plan to the patient After an exploration of these directions, it was found that an improvement in the anamnesis procedure would provide the most interesting design opportunity for this project. The explicit design goal was to: ""Design an interactive tool to sensitize patients for reflection on their personal situation, and to stimulate them in exploring and expressing their perspective in a ‘lightweight’ and playful manner to the care team."" Through an iterative process and close cooperation with medical staff, a design proposal was developed to demonstrate how hospitalized patients can be better involved in the nursing anamnesis interview. The design principle and content of the tool were based on sensitizing techniques from design research, and the theoretical anamnesis framework of Gordon. The development of the concept was based on the anamnesis subject of 'Self-Perception', which resulted in six exercises for the tool design. These exercises focus on the subjective thoughts, feelings and attitudes about oneself. During the design process, the most important design challenge was to find a balance between simplicity of the exercise and meaningful sensitization of the user. The conceptual design and the effect of using the exercises was evaluated during a user test with six participants in an elderly center. All exercises were performed without problems by users independently, and the participants were quickly engaged with the tool. The design was considered to be friendly and open. It helped users to communicate their point of view on the discussion subjects with valuable nuances. The final design of this project is a playful digital application for patients, to improve the quality of the anamnesis. It can be used by patients independently and directly from their beds, on the interactive terminal at their hospital room. The application has two main goals: 1. Sensitizing the patient for the personal subjects of the anamnesis interview. 2. Supporting the discussion of the patient's narrative with the nurse. The design facilitates these goals by providing specific self-reflection exercises that help the patient to understand and communicate about their personal perspective in an easy accessible manner. During the anamnesis interview, the exercise input created by the patient forms starting points for the discussion with the nurse. Through mutual exploration of the produced content they can better locate and act upon potential care problems and opportunities. At the end of the project a final evaluation was carried out with a nurse and heart failure patient from the polyclinic, based on a paper prototype of the application. The goal was to evaluate the design, the potential implementation and its contribution to the quality of care. The results show that the application succeeds in stimulating for self-reflection on the exercise subjects, and that it helped the patient to explain her point of view effectively. The tool makes personal subjects accessible to talk about because of the friendly approach and emphasis on visualizations. The exercise content is balanced for keeping clear visual overview and was found to provide sufficient input for constructing personal stories. In comparison with the current anamnesis approach of asking explicit questions, patients can now discuss personal information more freely and from their own interpretation of the anamnesis subjects. This leads to a more natural and deeper conversation with the nurse. With this input, the care team is better able to provide care that suits the patient adequately.","interaction design; hospitalization; nursing anamnesis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-04-25","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Titanium nitride (TiN) is one of the contenders for use as metal in the future CI's, but its characteristics need to be verified, measured and tested. A metal should comply to certain requirements like the ability to deliver enough charge to the nerve ending in the saline environment of the cochlea. TiN is able to withstand a high current density (2.8 mA µm2 ), while aluminium failed due to electromigration; even when coated with TiN. The resistance of a 10mm long and 5µm wide track decreases from 1.08 . 10^4? to 6.9. 10^2? when a combination of Al and TiN is made. This solves the reasonably high resistance of TiN. The self-heating and the change in resistance due to temperature changes (TCR) are measured, because the amount of dissipated heat should stay as low as possible. TiN has a low TCR, 5.9 . 10^-4. Furthermore, the metal must not dissolve in the environment, which can be checked by a (cyclic) voltammetry and by endurance tests. TiN was able to withstand the harsh tests. The improved functionality and quality asks for the addition of transistors to the electrode array. Furthermore, this thesis shows that it is possible to create working npn, NMOS and PMOS transistors with TiN using only 5 masks.","titanium nitride; cochlear implants; bicmos; CI; hearing aids; electrode array","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-05-07","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Electronic Instrumentation","",""

(mentor); Steijn, R. (mentor); Vellinga, T. (mentor)","2013","The objective of this study is to determine for which conditions the bypass capacity is optimized in combination with a limited influence on the navigational function of the harbour. The bypass capacity is defined as the capacity to bypass the sediment around the harbour under the presence of the defined driving forces (i.e. waves and/or tide). The conditions involve varying forcing, geometry of the breakwater, bathymetry, the presence of a dredged entrance channel and the grain size. The capacity for sediment bypassing depends amongst others on the sediment transport regime and the harbour geometry. For this research both phenomena have been categorized to make up a framework of transport regimes and types of harbours. This gives 6 archetypes with specific bypass characteristics. Only the most promising archetype has been studied more thoroughly. Therefore the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes of each archetype have been studied with the help of existing literature, reference situations and a sensitivity analysis of the relevant parameters. Based in this analysis it is concluded that a harbour which does not require a dredged channel and only services vessels with a small draft (approx. 2.5 m-3.5 m), along a coastline which experiences a large net transport is the most relevant and promising archetype to study. This is a relevant case because the downdrift coastline experiences erosion which opposes a problem for the coastal manager. The described case is a promising case because the small harbour blocks less sediment, there is no dredged channel and the contraction of the tidal current in combination with the wave-breaking-induced current is expected to give sufficient bypass capacity. The most promising archetype is studied more thoroughly with the numerical model Delft3D. From a sensitivity analysis and the literature study it was concluded that the parameters, as specified below, have significant influence on the bypass capacity. - The extension of the breakwater in the surf zone, related to the width of the surf zone; - The wave height; - The wave angle; - The shape of the breakwaters; - The current velocity; The influence of these parameters has therefore been assessed with Delft3D. Three criteria were of importance in assessing the results: - The amount of relative bypassing; - The depth in front of the harbour; - The depth in the harbour. The model calculations have provided output on the influence of each parameter on the bypass capacity and the serviceability of the harbour. The most promising situations are assessed on a longer time scale to see whether the promising situation holds. This gives the following conclusion (see next page): This research shows that a bypass friendly harbour is possible under certain circumstances. These circumstances are a harbour with streamlined breakwaters and an extension equal to the width of the surf zone at a coastline with significant wave and tidal influence. The streamlined geometry of the breakwaters leads to higher longshore flow velocities in front of the harbour, related to a harbour equal in size but with semi-streamlined breakwaters. The higher flow velocities enlarge the bypass capacity. The high flow velocities, in combination with the extent of the breakwaters also lead to a limited decrease of the depth in front of the harbour and very little sedimentation in the harbour. Both the limited decrease of the depth in front of the harbour and the little sedimentation in the harbour have a positive effect on the amount of bypassing. The bypass is also initiated quicker than that in case of semi-streamlined breakwaters because less sediment is required to make the new coastline orientation in case of the streamlined breakwaters.","bypass; friendly; harbour; streamlined","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-05-03","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

The specific cause of the damage is unknown. In this research the role of the dynamic behaviour of a jetty investigated. This research has the goal to elaborate circumstances under which the dynamic behaviour of the open piled jetty on Sint Maarten significantly enlarges the amplitude of vibration, when being subjected to wave loading. This is investigated by simulating the water surface and corresponding wave loading in the time domain and computing the dynamic response for the first jetty of Sint Maarten for different wave climates. Wave loading on the jetty deck and the piles are included in three directions. For the wave loading on the deck (slamming/wave-in-deck loading) a new formulation is derived in this research, in order to get a formulation which is dependent of time and location which is essential for a dynamic analysis. This new formulation is based on results of physical model tests performed for the situation of Sint Maarten. The dynamic analysis is performed by modal analysis in the time domain, without including non-linear interaction between the travelling waves and jetty structure. The response of the structure to the wave loading is analysed using the variance spectrum of the displacement, dynamic amplification factor and displacement signal. From the results it can be concluded that the dynamic behaviour of the jetty of Sint Maarten significantly enlarges the amplitude of vibration in horizontal direction for the investigated wave spectra. In vertical direction the maximum displacement decreases due to the dynamic behaviour. For further research verification of the dynamic behaviour of an open piled jetty and improvement of the wave-in-deck pressure are recommended.","slamming; wave-in-deck loading; dynamic analysis; time-history loading; modal analysis; dynamic amplification; jetty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Mayer, I. (mentor); Kortmann, L. (mentor); Wenzler, I. (mentor)","2013","Background: The increase in elaborateness of serious games has resulted in a more and more prominent use in business environments, their use has grown dramatically. Due to this growing interest; Shell has requested, in 2009, the development of the serious game Hazard Recognition, a single player 3D simulation of a Shell drilling site. Motive: The development of Hazard Recognition has reached completion, but due to the absence of experimental evidence that Hazard Recognition contributes to learning, adoption into Shell lacks. In order to collect this evidence, an evaluation study has been proposed. Complication: Mayer et al. (2012) are in the midst of development of an overarching framework for the evaluation of serious games. However, there is no off-the shelve method available for the evaluation of a serious game’s learning efficacy. Therefore, this study’s research question is: “What is an appropriate method, which can operate in the Comprehensive Evaluation Framework (Mayer et al., 2012), for the evaluation of a serious game’s learning efficacy and the contributing factors?” Method: Literature research has provided for the necessary academic foundations for the development of the evaluation method. Successively, a quasi-experimental experiment shaped the context of application and testing of this method. The experiment was the evaluation of Hazard Recognition’s learning efficacy. The result of this experiment showed that Hazard Recognition achieves learning efficacy. Results: An appropriate conceptual method for the evaluation of a serious game’s learning efficacy, within the context of Mayer’s Comprehensive Evaluation Framework, has been laid down. The learning efficacy of a serious game is defined as the ability of the learning intervention to achieve its learning objectives. This can be mapped and measured by evaluating the movement of students through Burch’s Competence Model (1970s). This requires to map the position of the student on the two axes (conscious and competence) by the measurement of self-perceived competences (conscious) and objective performance (competence). For these measurements there has been formulated an experiment setup with various requirements and constructs for the measurement methods have been developed. The case study, which consisted of the evaluation of Hazard Recognition’s learning efficacy, showed that both the developed conceptual model, as the developed measurement methods are valid.","serious game; evluation; learning efficacy; quasi-experimental","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-04-24","Technology, Policy and Management","Systems Engineering","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor); Van Doorn, F.A.P. (mentor); Post, K. (mentor)","2013","Nowadays dementia is a common disease; around 250.000 people in the Netherlands suffer from dementia. It is a collective term for diseases characterized by memory problems, intellectual problems and changes in behavior. The process of dementia can never be reversed, but moving seems to be a solution to delay the process. With dementia there is a decay of the neurons in the brain, while in other parts there is atrophy (shrivelling of the cells). These nerve cells become smaller, but there is still metabolism in those cells. This means that these areas in the brain can be reactivated. By moving with the body, the shrivelled brain cells can be reactivated, which can possibly delay the process of dementia. The aim of this graduation project is to identify the needs and wishes of the visitors of the meeting center and their carers in terms of movement, in order to design something to stimulate the visitors to move, individually or with the co-operation of their carer, in order to delay the process of dementia. Literature research is performed in order to find information about dementia and user research is performed to gain information about the needs and wishes of both visitors and carers regarding movement. The main conclusion was that a lot of things the visitor and carer loved to do together in the past are not possible anymore. It was often mentioned that they would love to cycle again. Another conclusion was that the visitors like the social contact they have with other visitors when doing physical activities together at the meeting center. The results from the analysis and research are used during a brainstorm and to create a design vision. In general, the design vision is to develop movement stimulation for the visitor, individually or with the co-operation of their carer or another visitor. In order to stimulate the visitors to move, it is important to have something that motivates them to keep moving. All visitors and carers share an extensive history and have a lot of memories about the past. Photos can be used to recall these memories, because people with mild dementia can still talk about the past quite well. Recalling memories from the past by using photos is called reminiscence. This is something that probably can be used as motivation; in order to see a (new) photo the user needs to move. Besides photos, music can also be used to reminiscence. After generating different idea direction, the chosen direction is ‘cycling in exchange for photos or music’. This direction makes it possible for the visitor to make the cycling movement again. A kind of bike trainer is used to ensure that the visitor can sit on a chair while he makes the well-known cycling movement. During cycling the visitor can hold handlebars in order to increase the ‘cycling feeling’. On top of these handlebars a tablet pc is attached on which photos and music can be shown. As long as the visitor is cycling, photos or music are shown on the screen, but if the visitor stops cycling, the slideshow of the photos or music pauses. This needs to be the motivation for the visitor to continue cycling. While the visitor is making the cycling movement, the carer or another visitor can sit next to him, in order to talk together about the things that are shown on the screen. Due to this they can recall memories from the past. At the same time watching photos is memory training, because the visitor needs to think about the things he sees on the screen. A prototype of the product is made in order to test the product. The user test turned out that all visitors and carers like to use the product. They really like to see the photos (especially the personal photos) or hear the music while they are cycling. Some of them mentioned that it is more pleasant to use this product than the exercise bike they have at home. Asking the visitors on another day if they would like to use the product again, they all said yes. Moving and memory training are two important aspects in the meeting center. This product combines both aspects, which ensures that the product indeed fits the vision of the meeting center. The employees of the meeting center are really enthusiastic about the product. They like the idea that the visitors will see photos or hear music while they are cycling. They can imagine that if the product would be located at the meeting center the visitors will use it, although they would need to stimulate the visitors because they would not take the initiative themselves.","dementia; moving; reminiscence; contextmapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

Qurrent, a company focussing on reducing consumer energy consumption, is acting in a competitive market. Big players like Eneco, Nuon and Essent are rapidly developing products with comparable functionalities and services and they have larger customer bases than Qurrent does. Focussing on their core values will enable Qurrent to gain competitive advantage over the large competitors and create their own market. However, they have difficulties telling their own story and being who they say they are. They have a nice vision but they have a hard time using this vision to create a strong brand and use this as a competitive advantage. In the mean time, with the rise of technological possibilities like traceability of goods and safe peer-to-peer payment systems, the middle man can be excluded enhancing collaboration amongst consumers. This leads to all sorts of collaborative enterprises. This trend reveals several opportunities which Qurrent can use in order to achieve their mission. This project explored these opportunities. Literature research was executed, as well as an extensive internal and external analysis. Additionally, many workshops and brainstorm sessions were organized to reveal underlying values and existing ideas. As a result, a process is set in motion in defining a brand promise, persona’s are created and the brand values are made explicit and tangible, all in order to help the brand come to live internally and inspire the employees to be and act on a Qurrent-way. Moreover, a customer journey is made to give an overview of and the relation between the existing touchpoints. Additionally, this report shows that within the age of collaboration lie opportunities to improve their story even more. It describes how Qurrent can increase their sales and strengthen their brand by making use of these opportunities which arise in the age of collaboration. A community currency is introduced, with modules which are reinforcing the customer journey as well as Qurrent’s brand identity, like a Q&A forum where consumers help each other.

(mentor); Bottero, S. (mentor)","2013","Shale gas is natural gas captured in low permeable shale formations, to be able to produce this gas the permeability of the reservoir needs to be enhanced. Hydraulic fracturing is used in low permeable reservoirs to increase the permeability and make gas production possible. Fracking fluid is pumped in the reservoir at high pressure to create high permeable fractures through which gas is produced. Fracking fluid used for hydraulic fracturing contains a lot of bacteria, attached to a surface these bacteria can create biofilms. A biofilm is a 3D structure of micro-organisms in a matrix of EPS consisting for more than 90 % of water. Previous studies have proven that biofilm development can decrease the water permeability (Gerlach & Cunningham, 2009). Less is known about the influence of biofilm development on the effective gas permeability. In this research the influence of biofilms on the effective gas permeability is investigated using a steady state gas flow through a porous sample containing methanotroph bacteria. A similar experiment with ethanol as the carbon source was done by Bottero et al (2010). A decrease in the effective gas permeability was noticed, however it could not be excluded that the permeability decrease was caused by ethanol condensation inside the sample. For this thesis the set-up as used by Bottero et al (2010) is improved to minimize the chance of condensation. A temperature control system is implemented and the carbon source is changed from ethanol to methane gas. The differential pressure and flow rate are logged to determine the permeability of the sample. The water content of the sample is based on the permittivity which is measured with a TDR cable tester. The multi section scatter function model for TDR analysis was adapted to make it applicable for this research (Heimovaara, Huisman, Vrugt, & Bouten, 2004). The parameters are selected with the DREAM algorithm created by Vrugt et al (2011). During the 32 days of the experiment the water content decreased due to desaturation resulting in a permeability increase. The bacteria produced only a minor amount of water, known because of the carbon dioxide production. In this experiment the gas permeability is not noticeably influenced by biofilm development, the water production by bacteria was lower than the desaturation rate. The sample was placed inside a low conductive plastic tube, unfortunately this made it impossible to separate biofilms from water based on measurements with the TDR cable tester.","hydraulic fracturing; biofilm; methanotroph","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Reservoir Geology","",""

One of the reasons why Philips Consumer Lifestyle’s Product Research Centre (Philips CL PRC) intends to further develop the research methodology by integrating emotion aspect is to strengthen the innovation output. Instead of focusing only on attribute-centric research, the product development process needs to shift into ‘emotional experience’ centric research. The challenge lies in finding in which specific stage of product development should the emotional driven approach be integrated seamlessly. Philips is a company that has a great expertise on advanced technology innovation, which performs a mature development process with fixed stage separation.

(mentor); Bakker, K.J. (mentor); Dijkstra, J. (mentor); Everts, H.J. (mentor); Stoevelaar, R. (mentor)","2013","An increase over time in bearing capacity of displacement piles is often found in the field. This phenomenon is called pile set-up. The increase is predominantly caused by an increase in shaft resistance and is observed even until 1000 days after installation. In the Dutch situation, a proposed tightening of the design standard for pile foundations makes the need to understand this phenomenon relevant. It is thought that pile set-up and group effects can contribute to the bearing capacity of piles and it would be worthwhile to incorporate them into the design standards. Although there are some ideas on the mechanisms that play a role there is no quantitative model to describe this mechanism. From literature the bearing capacity seems to increase linearly with the logarithm of time, however, the results depict a large scatter. It is assumed that a lot of factors influence pile set-up. This thesis depicts the results of a study on the possibility of simulating pile set-up in sand by means of centrifuge model testing. Conditions of this type of physical models can be controlled and makes them very useful for parameter studies. This study presents relevant literature about pile set-up. The presumed mechanisms behind the phenomenon and influencing factors are discussed. Because set-up is only observed for displacement piles, installation effects are also investigated. It is believed that the governing mechanism behind pile set-up is to some extent rearrangement of sand grains. Some literature indicates that long-term set-up is already present minutes and hours after installation. This allows investigating the set-up mechanisms under controlled conditions in a centrifuge. A pilot test is performed with the geotechnical centrifuge of Deltares. Two test series are run to investigate the set-up of a single pile and a group pile until 1000 minutes after installation. Two instrumented piles are tested several times during the run. Special attention is given to the installation and the surface roughness of the piles. Two different installation methods are applied: monotonically jacking and pseudo-driving. From the test results, it cannot be concluded if it is possible to simulate pile set-up in sand, observed in the field, by means of centrifuge model testing. Increases in shaft friction are observed for the jacked pile, as well as the cyclically installed pile. However, it is unlikely that these changes are only due to the factor of time. It is believed that the imposed pile displacements (test boundary conditions) disturb the results to a great extent. Clear influences of the installation of neighbouring piles are observed. It is recommended to perform following tests force-controlled. Perhaps longer lasting tests are needed. It is advisable to vary with soil homogeneity, soil uniformity and pile diameter in further model investigations. All of these parameters can influence the degree of set-up. Future research should also focus on field studies.","pile set-up; centrifuge model test; geotechnical engineering; group effect; bearing capacity; time dependent","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-09","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""

(mentor); Meijer, S.A. (mentor)","2013","This thesis describes a design project of a shelter solution for disaster relief in cold climates with non-wearable textiles. KICI foundation is searching for applications to reuse old clothes which are not wearable. In a collaboration with the Dutch Red Cross, they want to find an application for textiles in the context of disaster relief. Post consumer textiles can be brought back to loose fibres and processed to form a nonwoven mat with good thermal insulation properties. The difficulties of disaster relief are investigated. Requirements and wishes are obtained for a product proposal. The shelter solution has to meet with both the requirements of an NGO procuring the product and the final user. For the NGO, production costs, volume and weight are most important criteria. For the affected person, the highest priority is offering protection against cold temperatures. Besides these requirements, transitional wishes are taken into account being the reusability, relocatability and upgradability of the product. Self-reliance should be stimulated as displaced people have the ultimate goal to recover from a disaster and establish livelihoods as they had prior to the disaster. The product should be adaptable to the availability of local materials. Using too many or too little local resources can harm the local economy. With the use of scenarios, typical contexts of use where created. A makeshift shelter offers a solution in the earliest phase of a disaster. Effective insulation is obtained by creating a sleeping area within a larger shelter. Insulation of the floor is a high priority measure to winterise a tent. When a thick floor can be created, large reduction in heat loss can be obtained. Three concepts focusing on one of these issues have been developed. The starting point of the final design was a makeshift insulation sheet. A product named “Kover” is proposed for the immediate response phase of a disaster. Rather than a complete shelter design, the aim is to provide a shelter product that is a valuable addition to the catalogues of relief items. It can be seen that costs, volume and weight are all within the order of magnitude of alternative shelter solutions. In this proposal, the most important unique selling point is the large thermal insulation value. This is larger than other shelter solutions for immediate disaster. Also, the product can be used in different contexts. Although not an direct selling point, the sustainable source for the insulation material is unique. For KICI, a business model can be set up around the Kover. As a clothes collecting company, their role should be to find sources of post-consumer textiles that are suitable to be reprocessed in the Kover materials.","disaster; relief; textile; KICI; NGO; thermal; insulation; shelter; Pakistan; BoP; design for disaster; transitional","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Extensive research is performed on this topic, however, there are some aspects of time synchronization which still require attention. In this thesis we investigate aspects of the network which influence the accuracy of packed based time synchronization in Wireless Sensor Networks. The network of four nodes that are capable of wireless communication is constructed. Each node consists of Arduino Mega board with ATMEGA2560 micro-controller and RZ502 Accessory Kit with AT86RF230 radio chip. Three time-stamp exchange models are implemented on this network to synchronize the clocks and and compared with each other. The estimation of the synchronization parameters is done using Least Square estimators. Phase offset, frequency offset and communication delay are required to be estimated during the synchronization. From basic time-stamp exchange scheme, only sender-receiver model enables the estimation of the communication delay. The global synchronization leads to more accurate synchronization compared to the pair-wise synchronization. Based on the constructed setup, the aspects which influence the accuracy of time synchronization are identified: clock stability, clock resolution, time-stamping moment, physical layer property, communication aspects, synchronization time, number of synchronization messages, synchronization interval, time-stamp exchange model and synchronization algorithm. The requirements on these aspects are derived from the demand on the accuracy of the synchronization.","Wireless Sensor Network; clock synchronization; time-stamp exchange model; synchronization parameter; least square estimator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Circuits and Systems","",""

The developed acquisition system outperforms the present system, leading to 80 times improved frame accumulation in low light conditions. The improved data acquisition renders the system suitable for TDC non-linearity characterization, with observed DNL within ±1 LSB range across 160x64 active pixels. When validated for range finding applications the design enables distance measurement up-to 3 meters with millimeter precision.

(mentor)","2013","ABSTRACT - Nederland kent een divers landschap dat varieert van een strandwallenkust, veenvlaktes, droogmakerijen, zandplateaus tot rivierenlandschappen. Grote delen van deze landschappen zijn echter in de loop van de eeuwen getransformeerd in stedelijk gebied. Vooral in het westen van het land, de Randstad, is veel van het landschap verloren gegaan. Toch kent de Randstad in vergelijking met andere metropolitane gebieden een relatief open structuur. Het behoud en gebruik van deze open structuur is belangrijk wil Nederland een land blijven waarin het goed wonen en werken is. Het onderscheid Nederland ten opzichte van andere landen en kan hierdoor internationaal mee blijven spelen. Daarnaast geeft landschap identiteit aan een bepaald gebied wat van waarde is voor de concurrentiekracht van Nederland, maar ook verschillende steden van elkaar onderscheid. Ook verbetert het aantrekkelijk en toegankelijk maken van de landschappen buiten de stad de leefomgeving van de stedelingen en voorziet daarbij in de toegenomen recreatieve behoeftes. Door het landschap een belangrijke plek te geven in de verdere ontwikkeling van het stedelijk gebied in Nederland, gaat de stadsrand ook een belangrijke rol spelen. Lange tijd werd de stadsrand gezien als expansiegebied van de stad. De uitbreidingen werden als afzonderlijke opgaven gezien, waardoor de inpassing van de verschillende functies niet op elkaar en de omgeving aansluiten. Dit project gaat in op de plek waar stad en landschap van elkaar gescheiden worden door een bedrijventerrein. Voor het aantrekkelijk en toegankelijk maken van het buitengebied en het voorzien in de recreatieve behoeftes van de stedelingen, werkt het bedrijventerrein als grootste barrière tussen stad en landschap. Belangrijkste redenen hiervoor zijn het niet goed op elkaar aansluiten van de structuren van de stad, het bedrijventerrein en het buitengebied door verschil in netwerk, en de inrichting van de openbare ruimte van het bedrijventerrein dat niet voldoet aan de kwaliteitseisen van het recreatieve langzaam verkeer. Binnen dit afstudeerproject is ingegaan op het bedrijventerrein Waarderpolder in Haarlem. Hiervoor is een strategie ontwikkeld die het bedrijventerrein beter inpast in de omliggende structuren door het recreatieve langzaam verkeersnetwerk in te zetten als structurerend element. Belangrijk te realiseren is dat het toevoegen van alleen recreatieve routes door het bedrijventerrein niet voldoende is om het gebied interessant te maken als verbinding tussen stad en landschap. Stedelingen moeten meer betrokken worden bij het gebied, wat gedaan kan worden door het toevoegen van programma dat gericht is op de stedeling, zoals een woonboulevard of de mogelijkheid tot stadslandbouw. Daarnaast is het aan elkaar koppelen van netwerken op verschillende schalen en deze te verbinden door middel van het totale programma, een belangrijk aspect. Hierdoor gaan verschillende mensen om verschillende redenen gebruik maken van het gebied, waardoor het onderdeel wordt van de stad. Hierdoor verdwijnt de barrièrewerking en wordt de verbinding tussen stad en landschap verbeterd.","Stad; Landschap; Bedrijventerrein; Recreatief langzaam verkeer; Openbare ruimte; Haarlem","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-04-19","Architecture","Urbanism","","Urbanism","",""

(mentor)","2013","The objective of this study is to propose a method that is able to deal with data poor environments within coastal studies. Numerical models are useful tools to get insight in the coastal processes of the system being modelled. Inaccurate or poor input data leads to inaccurate or even incorrect model results. By stochastic modelling insight is obtained in the uncertainty propagation through the model and will, in contrast to deterministic modelling, provide output distributions. The coastline of interest suffers from structural erosion and consists of a rocky reef lying oblique in front of the coastline, which causes complex rip current patterns. Accurate information about the reef geometry and sufficient calibration and validation data is missing, which means we are dealing with a data poor environment. It became clear that the Monte Carlo method is the most appropriate method for this study. The Monte Carlo method is very robust, is relatively easy to implement and is based on random sampling. To generate a random sample the uncertainties of the used input and model parameters need to be quantified in probability distributions. The uncertainties are quantified by describing the total wave and wind climate in six separate probability distributions while taking correlation between the wave and wind variables into account. The uncertainty related to the reef geometry is taken into account by using the unknown reef elevation as stochastic variable. Roughness height is the only model parameter that is used stochastically. This is a commonly used calibration parameter and therefore partly obviates the missing calibration and validation data. As for the reef elevation appropriate and substantiated parameters are chosen. The obtained output distributions show that it is possible to provide an indication of the expected results. The reliability is, as expected, lower for the sediment fluxes than for the hydrodynamics. By examining scatter plots and correlation coefficients insight in the relationships and relative variable importance is obtained. The reef causes complexity and leads to different variable importance for (spatially) different output variables. Surprisingly, the results show that for the total sediment balance of the system the wind speed and wave period are the most important variables of the system. A regression analysis is used to quantify the relative importance of the used variables. It gives insight in the direct effect of the variable on the model output. Correlation between input variables makes it more complex but regression analysis is able to determine the direct and indirect effect of correlated variables on the model output. The proposed method gives rise to many applications and opportunities. It has shown an indication of the expected results can be given including an estimation of the reliability of the results. The corresponding probabilities can be used for risk analyses. The system is better understood and insight in complex coastal processes is obtained. Uncertainty analyses are able to provide the variable importance of the system being modelled, which for this study show unexpected results. Knowledge about the variable importance is valuable for coastal engineers and decision makers as it enables to focus on the most important model aspects and variables. By imposing stochastic model parameters the need for calibration can be determined. Furthermore a conceptual method has shown that it is possible to determine the (financial) value of obtaining more (accurate) data. This can lead to economic efficiency in coastal engineering practice, as it determines the necessity of data collection and calibration. Given the applicability of the proposed method it is recommended that uncertainty analyses like this become a more common approach within coastal studies, regardless of dealing with a data poor environment.","stochastic modelling; uncertainty analysis; coastal modelling; value of information; variable importance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-04-26","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Liu, P. (mentor)","2013","To keep up with the growing demand for oil and gas, the oil and gas industry ventures into deeper waters. For a deep water pipeline project, South Stream, a pipeline test program is developed. Part of this program is the investigation of the resistance of an externally pressurised pipeline against local buckling collapse. This is a decisive factor in design of marine pipelines. Local buckling of a pipeline is the buckling behaviour within its cross section. Buckling is defined as the state of a structure for which a relatively small increment in load leads to a relatively large increment in displacement. Generally this is reflected in a change in deformation shape and possibly a loss of stability. A perturbation theory, first developed by Koiter [1], is applied to model this behaviour. The response of a geometrically imperfect structure is obtained by using the response of an initially perfect structure, e.g. a straight beam or a perfect ring. From the principle of minimum potential energy an equilibrium state can be obtained. For a certain load, the bifurcation load, multiple equilibrium configurations are possible. The nature of this equilibrium state is investigated by expanding the load around this bifurcation load and expanding the displacement functions around their fundamental solutions. The value and sign of the post-bifurcation load coefficients determine the system’s initial post-bifurcation stability. Introduction of initial imperfections leads to modified post-bifurcation load coefficients. Generality is enhanced by using dimensionless identities. System collapse can occur in the elastic domain for unstable initial post-buckling behaviour or in the plastic domain due to material yielding. It is likely that collapse of a system with (small) initial geometric imperfections occurs due to an interaction of elastic and plastic buckling. Buckling leads to relatively large displacements that induce material yielding. This can lead to loss of stiffness and can induce collapse. Relatively thin walled rings and cylinders tend to collapse more in the elastic domain, while relatively thick walled rings and cylinders tend to collapse more in the plastic domain. This is due to the fact that thin walled structures require more deformation to induce yielding than thick walled structures. When performing a collapse test, end caps are attached to a pipeline specimen. This is modelled by boundary constraints. End caps are very stiff and modelled as being rigid. Their influence on the bifurcation and collapse behaviour of a cylinder is investigated. The constraints introduce boundary layer behaviour in the regions close the end caps. It is found that these constraints increase the buckling load of a cylinder with respect to an infinitely long cylinder (ring under plane strain condition). Besides, for relatively short cylinders, the buckling mode is altered. While a long cylinder prefers to collapse in an oval shape mode (described by 2 lobes), a short cylinder prefers to collapse in a mode shape described by a higher number of lobes. A collapse test is performed to estimate the collapse behaviour of a real life pipeline. Hence it is required that the collapse shape that is observed in the test matches the oval collapse shape of a long real life pipeline. This results to a minimum required length of a tested pipeline specimen. A relation for the required length is obtained. An analytical method has been developed to determine the buckling load and mode of a constrained cylinder. Finally, the analytically obtained results have been verified using finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental results obtained from literature. [1] W.T. Koiter.

(mentor); Plomp, H. (mentor)","2013","When tasked with the assignment to design a world headquarters for sustainability and sustainable development, I was perplexed by the ambiguity of the conceptual aspect, but at the same time restrained with a comprehensive list of pragmatic requirements. Firstly, the term ‘sustainability’ is one that is vexed with different definitions, perceptions and contradictions. It was thus necessary to define what a United Nations Ecological Council strives to achieve in humanistically, ecologically, and symbolically. Secondly, as part of the U.N., there lies a fine line between security of the building and the potential for public space, as well as the public perception of the building and what it stands for. Finally, situated in New York City and next to the existing U.N. headquarters designed by Oscar Niemeyer and Le Corbusier, a balance between old and new, modernism and a relatively new paradigm of sustainable building, and urban and natural, needs to be achieved in an approach that is sensitive, yet novel. The design must complement the history of the site and the UN, reflect the technology and knowledge of today and anticipate a very uncertain future. These aforementioned problems necessitate a holistic methodology that balances these contradictions in such a way that creates value for the site, the city and the world. Looking at the task and understanding the task of design this building at several scales -- site, regional, global -- I began to understand the need for this building not only to be merely a ‘sustainable’ building in terms of energy efficiency or the usual interpretations of the ‘sustainable’ label within the discourse of architecture. I saw the necessity for this building to be a pedagogical tool that will educate the general public, one that serves to be a catalyst vis-à-vis sustainability and public understanding. The building and site must aspire to demonstrate the commitment of the UN to finding solutions to global issues: food security, greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel dependence, and provide an example for a future in which humans will work with nature rather than against it. The UN Headquarters of Sustainability will be designed to be part of the larger ecosystem in that it will, like other organisms, have a certain lifespan, will be able to grow and adapt and over its lifespan it will bring a positive net benefit to the city and the larger global community. The overall aim was to find and develop innovative techniques and schemes that mitigate local and regional issues that can be translated to larger global problems. My departure point with regards to researching and understanding the site, city and objective involved looking at typology and morphology of the city, environmental aspects such as climate and geography, society, culture, philosophical and ideological discourse, and phenomenology.","UNEC; SADD; New York City; materialisation; sustainability; architecture; United Nations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-05-01","Architecture","Materialisation","","Strategic Architectural Design Development (SADD)","",""

After the coining of the term modernity in 1863 by Beaudelaire, as being the conjoining of the ephemeral and fleeting with the eternal and immutable Architecture has wavered from opposition to opposition. However oppositions, up to now, could not provide for satisfactory solutions. Whereas modernism still tried to conjoin the “ephemeral and the fleeting” conditions of modernity with the “eternal and immutable” conditions of architecture, postmodernism merely celebrated these conditions without even bothering to provide for answers. In that sense, both modernism and postmodernism as such can be regarded as tendencies towards extremes. Moreover modernism was even able to produce extremes within its own thinking. Hence functionalism claimed that every function could have its own single optimum. Thus the Raumplan provided many functions in an array of single optima while the Plan Libre, in its spatial redundancy, provided many functions, yet no optimum at all. In desperate attempts to catch up with their Zeitgeists, architects thus sought answers in polarities. Almost negativist like: If not A than B! Architects thus seem to avoid the middle. However, accepting that the truth might be somewhere in between, the middle - or the architectural oxymoron - could provide the best of both worlds. Thus creating buildings with more humble, multiple optima. The middle finally breaks with vertical thinking, which remained predominant in architecture, and taps into horizontal thought, which is thinking from difference rather than identity. Thus one could argue that the middle is even more radical than any extremity and in its shift from vertical to horizontal thought even the antithesis which, up to now, has been avoided.","ecology; modernity; multiple optima","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-04-18","Architecture","Architecture","","Delft School of Design","",""

(mentor); Van den Bos, W. (mentor)","2013","The application of twin lift spreaders and Long Twin spreaders for Straddle Carriers (SCs) is still growing, although with an increasing interest in Long Twin spreaders. Simultaneously the average container load has increased as well over the last year. These two developments and the design limitations in SCs have resulted in a requirement from SC manufacturers to reduce the dead weight of Long Twin spreaders to a figure close to the dead weight of a normal twin lift spreader. In addition there is a desire to replace the hydraulic system used in spreaders. The goal of this research is a conceptual design for a Long Twin spreader for SCs, preferably completely electrically driven, which weighs approximately 10-15% less than the present design, while maintaining the same functionalities and life time expectations. Although the mass increase for the all the electro mechanical systems will be taken into consideration, the design procedure is narrowed to an electric drive system for the telescoping function. The present Long Twin SC spreader mass is 9800kg. The telescoping function is performed using a hydraulically driven belt drive system in single operation and hydraulic cylinder drives in Long twin operation. Prior to the redesigning of the present spreader, the loads affecting the spreader structure are analyzed. The use of standard defined load and stress spectra is hereby taken into consideration with the use of a real SC load spectrum. In this research, redesign options have been determined in 5 sections considering the reduction in mass and the application of electro mechanical drive system for the telescoping function. Via first hand calculations and fairly simple Finite Element Analysis (FEA) models the feasibility as well as properties, mass and price have been checked. The sections are: Drive system: the long twin function requires that a connection is established between the Long Twin unit and the telescopic beam. In the present design the connection is made via a heavy linkage beam, which transmits the drive force from the hydraulic cylinder at the Long Twin unit to the telescopic beam. Omitting the linkage beam results in a direct mass and height reduction of the spreader. Redesigns that have been considered are: linkage via the container structure, direct linkage via slots in the mid frame and digital linkage using sensors. Drive components: the drive system requires electro mechanical drive components to fulfill the telescoping function. The present design consists of a hydraulically driven belt system for operation in single operation and the hydraulic cylinders for operation in Long Twin mode. Because the implementation of drive components depends on the drive system selected, various implementation methods have been considered for the following drive components: rack and pinion, roller screw, roller chain and wire rope drives. For every system, the required motor gear unit is determined. Basic steel section design: the basic steel sections of a spreader are the telescopic beams and the mid frame. These sections determine the highest part of the total mass of the spreader. The basic section design of the present spreader is reconsidered upon shape and the implementation of High Strength Steel (HSS). Attention is paid to the use of HSS, because this results in difficulties. Structural design: the direct linkage drive system requires that slots are implemented in the mid frame section. The slots can affect the structural integrity of the mid frame and are therefore checked via FEA. The implementation of slots in the side plates as well as the top plate is considered. Other measures: possible redesigns that might lead to reduction in spreader mass but cannot be dedicated to one of the above parts are considered in this part. In this part, systems are considered that reduce effects of stress and friction on the spreader structure: stress distributing plates between the edge of the mid frame and the topside of the telescopic beams, shock absorbing suspension between the spreader and SC and rollers instead of slide plates. The final concept design is selected according the Kesselring value analysis, which is part of the methodic design procedure. Via a morphologic overview various concept designs are selected, which are expected to perform well on the rating specifications. The expectations are based on first hand calculations, FEA models and mechanical properties. The rating specifications are based on the functional requirements of three SC manufacturers and finally selected in consultation with Stinis. The final concept design resulting from the methodic design procedure has the following properties:  The telescopic beam with equally placed side plates is performed in HSS;  The mid frame with bended side plates is performed in HSS;  Direct linkage via slots in the top plate of the mid frame;  Vertically placed roller chain drive system for Long Twin operation electrically driven;  Original belt drive system for single operation electrically driven;  Stress distributing plate between the mid frame outside edge and the topside of the telescopic beam. The performed methodic design procedure has resulted in a concept design that satisfies to the stated goal. With the concept design a mass reduction of 1350kg (13,8%) can be established with respect to the present Long Twin SC spreader design. The chosen concept design is not the least weighing concept that has been considered, but performs the best on the various concept specifications, thereby maintaining functionality and expected lifetime performance. However, there are some points that can be concluded from this research. The use of a SC log file rather than conservative load cycle distribution prescribed by the standards results in a more favorable classification. The more favorable classification results in lower application factors and a higher permissible fatigue strength. It can be stated that spreaders designed with the conservative load cycle distribution are over dimensioned; the actual lifetime performance will be higher than the requested lifetime performance. The implementation of electric drives and HSS will result in increasing costs. The increasing costs are mainly caused by the drive system. The high costs due to use of HSS is expected to decrease over time. Mass increase will be unavoidable with the replacement of hydraulic drives for electric drives. In addition the robustness will decrease as the drive system will have to be dimensioned on the edges of what is possible to save mass. The use of HSS in the final concept design is necessary to reach the stated goal on mass reduction. The fatigue strength of HSS is the limiting factor in the spreader design. Therefore, post treatment of the welds will be required to reach higher fatigue strengths and higher mass reductions. In addition to the decreased mass of the spreader, the height has been decreased. Although the concept design leaves little space between the stacking height and the maximum hoisting height, the SC manufacturers will not have to increase the SC height.","Spreader; Light; weight","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2100-03-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Transportation Engineering","","Transportation Engineering and Logistics","",""

This implies to leave the hierarchical mode of concept driven essentialist architecture. Instead, I want to make a shift towards the non-hierachical ecological(ontologically flat) field of potential(context), from where the objectile becomes. This ecological praxes might, as Gilles Deleuze explains, “be defined as a search to identify in each partial locus of existence the potential vectors of subjectification and singularization.”1 It is about getting rid of the preconceived mind to find the difference that makes the difference. The process is best describe like the notion of “walking as controlled falling”. I am set in motion by a particular desire. To fulfill this desire I will have to move. To move is to go through a “phase transition” which enables new discoveries. “Walking as controlled falling” is surrendering to constraints like gravity and those of your body, whilst having a certain degree of freedom. As Brian Massumi explains, “you move forward by playing with the constraints, not avoiding them. There’s an openness of movement, even though there’s no escaping constraint.”2 It is about the reciprocal determination between freedom and constraint that can only be found upon experimentation. Inevitably there will be mistakes, as risk implies both success and failure. But without risk, there will neither success nor failure and the project will end up in a state of aesthetic purgatory! How can I to avoid this? Bruno Latour would give me the following anwser: “Drawing and modelling do not constitute an immediate means of translation of the internal energies and fantasies of the architect’s mind’s eye, or a process of transferring ideas from a designer’s mind into a physical form, from a powerful “subjective” imagination into various “material” expressions. Rather, the hundreds of models and drawings produced in design form an artistically created primal matter that stimulates the haptic imagination, astonishes its creators instead of subserviently obeying them, and helps architects fix unfamiliar ideas, gain new knowledge about the building- to-come, and formulate new alternatives and “options,” new unforeseen scenarios of realization.”3 It is about problem finding instead of problem solving. It is not about judging content at face value. It is about findingthe intent which makes content.4 It is about thinking in the relationality between objects which allows for a manifold of interpretations, thus, affords a different (or similar) outcome. It is about searching. To search in the field of potential is to discover. Rediscover. Doubt. Decide. Doubt. And Make! It means to integrate and embrace all possible constraints early in the project. It means, for example, no fundamental hierarchical difference between the installations or urban environment. It is truly about beeing in the middle. About the milieu. About everything at once at the same time!5 NOTES 1. Felix Guattari, The Three Ecologies, 1989 Continuum, P. 4 2. Brian Massumi, Mary Zournazi, Zournazi Massumi Interview 3.

From this “phase space” research question can come to light. These questions would not necessarily need to be resolved, however (and more importantly), they need a thorough quasi-objective investigation. My most recent question, for example, investigates the possibilities to translate the positive spatial conditions of a field condition into a vertical diagram. It could be that there is no “ultimate” resolution or model to do this. However, the investigation can trigger new questions, thus, cascade into an entirely new vision. This vision could not have been envisioned if the original question had not been asked.","skyscraper; theory; Delanda; Deleuze; speculative realism; Delft; vertical; horizontal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-04-18","Architecture","Delft School of Design","","Architectural Thinking","",""

The negative stiffness working principle is a mechanism consisting of a spring generating force around a rotation axis, with a variable moment arm. The spring force is decreasing, when rotating the axis, less than the moment arm is increasing and torque thus increases. A mathematical model has been used to dimension different design parameters. The negative stiffness working principle has been realized with the first negative stiffness orthosis (NSO). Ten able-bodied subjects with an artificially increased ankle joint stiffness performed passive and active Range of Motion (RoM) tasks while wearing the NSO. The NSO increases ankle angles for constant torque input. Maximal active dorsiflexion angle increased as well, while dorsiflexor muscle EMG-activity decreased for equal ankle angles. The results show that the negative stiffness mechanism is able to partly compensate stiffness and support a better dorsiflexion angle to force ratio, which is especially beneficial in UMND patients with weaker muscles than normal.

(mentor); Romero Herrera, N.A. (mentor)","2013","Thanks to advances in technology a time has arrived where it is possible to generate energy by virtually everyone for a competitive price. To produce energy on a small scale, fossil fuels are unattractive because energy can be extracted from them more efficiently on a larger scale. For technologies such as solar photovoltaic panels, there is no scale limitation. For that reason alone, solar panels are an attractive means to generate energy for households. Nevertheless, experts or people with good background knowledge are needed to install and run such an energy production facility at home. So for laymen users without ‘special’ knowledge, the idea of personal energy production might not be very appealing. I believe that in order to establish a democracy in the energy market every user in the system should be able to become an active player and use technologies to generate energy. Is such a change in ‘users’ role’ easy to achieve? In the current energy market, ‘not’! Energy as medium is very abstract and does not carry any tangible form and is therefore very hard to relate to a tangible action. In order to motivate people to take an active role in producing and using it, I think the way and the form we use it, should have more relation with human nature. In order to do that, first the current understanding regarding ‘energy production and consumption’ of users should be explored.The so called ‘prosumer’ is introduced, which combines producer and consumer in one user. In this project, after a thorough exploration of the current place of the user in the energy market, I create a concept- which I name Ampul- that aims to connect personal or small-scale energy production with people’s domestic environment in a meaningful and natural manner. The Concept House1, which was built in Heijplaat, Rotterdam under a European founded project to explore the user perception, involvement, understanding and acceptance of newly introduced sustainable technologies, is used as a context to test the created concept with actual users.","Prosumer; User experience design; Interaction design; Energy generation; Solar cells; Photovoltaic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The final result is the total mass of the building: a landscape of Asignifying Affordances in the Assemblage. While reflecting back I found out that the approach in the process of this design is more similar to a Landscape design than to any more traditional Architectural Approach. This because “landscape methods could summarize a whole range of apparently different approaches towards architecture”.

Het was bedoeld om klanten te ontvangen en de werkzaamheden en resultaten van KEMA te presenteren. Nu staat het gebouw grotendeels leeg, en de nieuwe functies die voorgesteld zijn hebben niets meer te maken met de oorsprong. Mijn ontwerp moet hier verandering in brengen. De doelstelling is om het gebouw representatief te maken voor een groter publiek. De essentie is om oude karakteristieke waarden, welke het gebouw in meerdere mate bezit ten opzichte van de andere gebouwen op het terrein, te behouden en te versterken. De nieuw functie welke het gebouw toegekend krijgt heeft te maken met energie. Dit is grotendeels een voor de hand liggende keuze omdat het gehele deelgebied te maken heeft met energie, en er dus veel kennis is binnen handbereik. Wat echter ontbreekt is de connectie met het publiek. Het propaganda gebouw wordt hierin de ontbrekende schakel. Het presenteert nieuwe duurzame energiebesparende technieken die toegepast kunnen worden door bezoekers. De vertaalslag van de functie naar het ontwerp speelt hier een belangrijke rol, het moet niet alleen een gebouw zijn waarin ruimtes zijn om technieken te presenteren, maar technieken worden ook opgenomen in het gebouw om ontwikkelingen inzichtelijk te maken voor publiek. 3 thema’s spelen een belangrijke rol, namelijk het toepassen van nieuwe systemen op een bestaand gebouw, het toepassen van nieuwe systemen op een nieuw gebouw en een mogelijke samenhang waarin oud en nieuw op elkaar inspelen. Om duidelijkheid te scheppen tussen oud en nieuw is er bewust keuze gemaakt voor een contrast tussen het oude en nieuwe gebouw, echter om het geheel weer als één gebouw te laten werken is de nieuwbouw op een slimme manier ontworpen. Het oorspronkelijke propaganda gebouw met een lineaire routing en grotendeels slechts visueel contact naar de omgeving, wordt nu een gebouw met een binnenplaats welke meer waarde geeft aan het gebouw door meer fysieke interactie met binnen en buiten. De aanbouw is ondergeschikt aan het oude, de herkenning van het gebouw aan bijvoorbeeld de karakteristieke ingang en het prominente trappenhuis blijft behouden.","KEMA","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-05-01","Architecture","RMIT","","KEMA, Arnhem","",""

By bridging the grammarware and modelware technological spaces, we can create support for textual and graphical editors. The former space provides solutions to the parsing of text while the latter space has strong support for graphical syntaxes and editors. In this thesis, we present an approach for the robust synchronization of textual and graphical editors based on such bridging. The approach: provides a mapping from textual syntax definitions to metamodels and a corresponding bidirectional mapping between their instances, recovers from errors during text-to-model synchronization, preserves textual and graphical layout even in the presence of erroneous texts and models, and provides synchronized editor services such as selection sharing and persistent model sharing. The approach was implemented for synchronizing textual editors generated by the Spoofax language workbench and graphical editors generated by the Graphical Modeling Framework.","Spoofax; GMF; Behavior Trees; textual; graphical","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-04-11","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Department of Software Technology","","Software Engineering Research Group","",""

This includes: 1. obtaining knowledge on which variables determine the function of a supermarket 2. analyzing possible methods for differentiation and selecting the ones most appropriate for Jumbo 3. determining the possible internal implications of differentiating assortments This is translated into a differentiation strategy for Jumbo. This strategy contains three pillars: Store Format Based on a store’s function and the price sensitivity of its customers, a store format will be selected. Each format has different products and hardware. Assortment Each product category is segmented based on its differentiation variables. The assortment is adapted to the wishes of these segments, by changing the assigned shelf space of a (sub)category. Also the socio-demographic customer mix has an influence. Locally produced or supplied products get extra emphasis.

Dertig van de tweeënnegentig ziekenhuizen zullen in dit geval hun afdeling verloskunde moeten sluiten. Door de concentratie van zorg op minder locaties neemt het aantal gynaecologen per ziekenhuis toe en daarmee zal het perinataal sterftecijfer afnemen. Deze concentratie van zorg heeft een nadelig gevolg voor gezonde zwangeren die thuis zouden willen bevallen: velen daarvan zullen in de nieuwe verdeling te ver van een ziekenhuis met afdeling verloskunde wonen om verantwoord thuis te kunnen bevallen. Deze gezonde vrouwen zijn hierdoor in de toekomst gebonden aan een bevalling in het ziekenhuis. Het concentreren van de verloskundige zorg in Nederland is wellicht onvermijdbaar. Het verlagen van het perinatale sterftecijfer heeft ten opzichte van de nadelen die gezonde zwangeren aan deze maatregelen ondervinden prioriteit. Daarom is het belangrijk dat er wordt ingespeeld op deze huidige ontwikkelingen in de verloskundige zorg om zo de negatieve gevolgen voor de gezonde zwangeren zoveel mogelijk te beperken. De thuisbevalling brengt vele voordelen met zich mee voor het verloop van de bevalling omdat de vrouwen, doordat ze zich in hun eigen huis ‘thuis’ voelen, zich daar gemiddeld het best kunnen ontspannen. Het is belangrijk dat er wordt onderzocht welke behoeften van de vrouwen vervuld moeten worden voor het thuisgevoel kan worden gecreëerd zodat, wanneer deze gezonde zwangeren in de toekomst wellicht niet meer thuis kunnen bevallen, het thuisgevoel op alternatieve bevallocaties kan worden opgewekt en de voordelen van de thuisbevalling zo goed mogelijk in stand kunnen worden gehouden. De reeds bestaande GeboorteHotels kunnen hier een belangrijke rol in spelen. Hier kunnen gezonde zwangeren in een huiselijke omgeving bevallen binnen de muren van het ziekenhuis en er (een gedeelte van) hun kraamperiode doorbrengen. Doordat met de gebouwde omgeving de ervaring van de ruimte door zijn gebruikers kan worden beïnvloed, kan het thuisgevoel worden gecreëerd door middel van het inzetten van bepaalde architectonische middelen. Door te onderzoeken welke architectonische middelen dit zijn en ze toe te passen op de bestaande GeboorteHotels, kunnen deze worden verbeterd. De hoofdvraag van dit afstudeeronderzoek luidt dan ook: Welke architectonische middelen kunnen er worden ingezet om de (mentale, sociale, fysieke en ruimtelijke) behoeften van de gebruikers van een GeboorteHuis te vervullen om het thuisgevoel te creëren?","GeboorteHuis; Geboortehotel; Geboortekliniek; Geboortecentrum; Architectonische middelen; Thuis; Huiselijk; Geboorte; Ronald McDonald; Zorgboerderij; Kraamperiode; Bevalling; Zorginstelling; Wonen","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-05-17","Architecture","Architecture","","Explore Lab","",""

However, it also created social problems; having one of the highest suicide rates in OECD, high rates of alcoholism, plastic surgery and addiction to computer games and pornography. Furthermore the elderly population in Korea is growing rapidly, with an estimated percentage - in 2050 - of 38% against 52% of the working class. Embracing these social-economic problems, I designed a community that will allow for convenient distribution of shops, residences, amenities and prioritized walkability. This will allow for spaces where young and old get the occasion to integrate with each other and into their society. Experiencing Seoul I found that street life is extremely important and particularly dynamic, which generates an ambiance that is typical for Korea. Due to new developments this street life, and the public space in general, are replaced by ‘locked’ open spaces, residual space of high-rise buildings. Those areas are only accessible for the people who live there and as a result the city of soul is segregated. My urban design is concerned with both the need for density due to the urbanization and growing economic and the need for public space. By allowing areas in the community to be dens and high, but also creating an important low-rise pedestrian strip that can generate the community life that is so characteristic for this city and its culture. A predominant element in this urban design is the integration of the high-rise development, by transforming the ‘locked’ space into a public space. The location of my architectural design is precisely where the pedestrian strip is penetrating the high-rise area. This not only allows the design to mediate - in a volumetric way - between the low-rise building blocks and high-rise towers, but it also continues and reunites the two different kinds of public spaces. My design embodies a new roofed public space for community activities and will accommodate the place for a ‘Community Learning Centre’. In this way the design forms a new approach to experiencing street life. Moreover, is the design focuses on the broader social problems of Korea by combining space for study, leisure – like sports and karaoke - tutoring and creativity into one design. Every component in the design - the floor, the roof, the façade and the rooms - can be seen as isolated elements. Therefore the roofed public space creates a feeling of roughness and openness, wherein every room gets his own identity by way of materialisation. These materials have a natural impression – like stone, steel and wood – in order to create a differentiation in expressions but a feeling of coherency. Besides, it provides for a transition from the urban area to the park. The inside of the rooms are more sensitive and related to its specific program.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-05-01","Architecture","Architecture","","Materialisation - VCA","",""

(mentor); Daamen, W. (mentor); Brookhuis, K.A. (mentor)","2013","The objective of this thesis project is to analyze the traffic behaviour that the Shared Space approach assumes to enforce in a traffic space designed according to its principles, and to determine the impact of this behaviour on traffic performance and safety, isolated from location-specific elements. This is done by means of a new conceptual model and an implementation of it in a simulation model. Shared Space is, if anything, a road design process, with a vision on the functions of public spaces and on the role of stakeholders in designing them. Traffic behaviour and traffic control measures should not severely restrict other functions of public spaces. Shared Space distinguishes between social behaviour and traffic behaviour. Social behaviour could sometimes overrule established traffic rules. This shift may lead to a reduced level of experienced safety. This is supposed to help to improve the objective safety levels, based on (reverse) risk compensation. Analyzing Shared Space traffic demands a simulation model to be applicable to an intersection, accommodate different modalities, include the road and the movements on it, model the impact of the road environment and contain a form of conscious decision-making. In scientific literature, a large number of appropriate models can be found, such as gap-acceptance models, conflict-point models and social force models. The conceptual model emphasises the dynamic relation between two fundamental traffic processes, negotiation and movement. Negotiation between road users will determine their accelerations, and subsequently their speeds and positions. All modalities are involved in the negotiation process, assuming sufficient communication to clarify intentions. Every road user has two behavioural variables: an initiative factor and a politeness factor. The initiative factor determines whether the road user, during negotiating, would like to take precedence even if it does not have priority. The politeness factor impacts whether the road user will offer or accept that the other road user will proceed despite its not having priority. Road users have fixed paths consisting of curve points connected by line elements. In the negotiation process, it is calculated whether the trajectories of any two road users will be in conflict within a certain time horizon. If so, both road users can have alternative acceleration patterns, leading to alternative trajectories, which can also be tested for potential conflicts. The two behavioural variables initiative and politeness have an impact on the range and sequence of considered potential accelerations. The simulation model, a combination of object-oriented and procedural elements, is implemented in Matlab. The program generates a graphical user interface, which can be used to adjust input variables and visualise output data. The model's face validity has been analyzed on the basis of simulations of eight traffic situations, concerning following behaviour, conflict handling and the impact of initiative and politeness. The simulation results are largely as expected for moderate traffic demand. The simulation model is applied to four cases in order to determine the impact of varying initiative and politeness shares on two indicators for an intersection's performance and safety: the average speed and the Time Exposed to critical TTC (TET) value. Increased initiative and politeness do not lead to a higher average speed or a lower aggregated TET value. There is a significant correlation for individual road users between taking initiative and experiencing a higher average speed and a lower TET value. For politeness, such a correlation was not found. The Shared Space approach can be modelled as a concept and implemented as a simulation program for heterogeneous traffic on a generic intersection. The simulation results do not back up the assumption that the approach would have an impact on traffic performance and safety.","Shared Space; traffic flow model; mixed traffic; non-signalised intersection; simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor); De Jong, P. (mentor)","2013","Deze master thesis beschrijft in de eerste plaats een onderzoek naar de transformatie potentie van het voormalig postkantoor van Utrecht. In de tweede plaats beschrijft het de ontwikkeling van het INKOS LT instrument als toevoeging op het bestaande INKOS model. Het INKOS model berekent de financiële haalbaarheid van een transformatietransitie over het eerste jaar van gebruik. De toegevoegde INKOS LT module simuleert de cashflow om de financiële haalbaarheid tijdens een 20-jarige gebruiksduur te bepalen. Om tot een vastgoedstrategie (transformatie potentie) te komen wordt gebruik gemaakt van het DAS-framework (De Jonge, Arkesteijn et al. 2008). Deze methode combineert economische theorieën met gegevens over de vastgoedmarkt om een vastgoedstrategie te bepalen. Op deze wijze worden er vraag- en aanbodprofielen uitgewerkt en worden oplossingen geselecteerd om mismatches te overbruggen. Deze profielen zijn door middel van SWOT-analyse vertaald naar transformatie scenario’s. Het postkantoor van Utrecht ligt in het centrum van de stad aan de rand van het grootste winkelgebied van de stad. Het postkantoor is in 2001 geregistreerd als rijksmonument en staat sinds 2011 volledig leeg. Het bestemmingsplan van de gemeente Utrecht geeft toestemming om het volledige bestemmingsvlak te bebouwen en geeft toestemming om een hotel met maximaal 100 kamers te vestigen in het gebouw. Wel is er een aanmerking opgenomen dat er voorzieningen getroffen moeten worden om fietsen in het gebouw te kunnen stallen. De centrale hal moet publiekelijk en intact blijven. De relatie tussen de Neude en de Oudegracht dient versterkt te worden De ruimtelijke kwaliteit scoort goed op de aspecten bereikbaarheid, comfort en aanzien en leefbaarheid. De veiligheid is relatief slecht in de omgeving van het postkantoor. Het carrévormig postkantoor domineert de omgeving met zijn massieve en statige uitstraling. Het in de Amsterdamse School ontworpen gebouw valt direct op door het grote gewelfde pannendak, en de aan de voor- en achterzijde gesitueerde trappenhuizen. De paraboolvormige centrale hal is het meest opvallende interne element van het gebouw. Deze 15 bij 28 meter uit baksteen opgetrokken centrale hal is 17 meter hoog. Wat direct opvalt zijn de kristalachtige ramen van geslepen glas die met de vorm van de bogen meelopen. De fundering van het postkantoor is geheel vervaardigd uit metselwerk met bij de wolfskuilen natuursteen op staal gefundeerd (peil=-5500). Het opgaande werk bestaat uit vier constructiedelen die wel verbonden zijn met elkaar, maar eigenhandig de krachten afdragen naar de fundering. De transformatiepotentie voor het postkantoor van Utrecht is onderzocht en heeft geresulteerd in drie scenario’s: I. Neude Plaza: In deze variant wordt er een aansluiting gezocht bij de kenmerken van de locatie. Deze locatie is gekenmerkt door winkels, uitgaansgelegenheden en horeca. Het voormalig postkantoor Neude Utrecht zal een functionele verbinding vormen tussen het Neude plein en de Oudegracht. De risico’s zijn gelegen in de eigenschappen van de locatie voor de toekomstige winkels. Zo is de beleving van veiligheid van de omgeving ongunstig, specifiek door de criminaliteit. De toekomstige functionele invulling dient ondergeschikt te zijn aan het historisch karakter van de binnenstad. Ongunstig aan dit scenario is de huidige landelijke stijging van leegstaande winkelpanden. II. Neude Inc: In deze variant wordt er geanticipeerd op de stijgende vraag naar bedrijfsverzamelgebouwen. Het gebouw zal gekenmerkt worden door kleine ondernemingen met een huurcontract. Ook dient een aanzienlijk gedeelte van het gebouw bestemd te worden voor het inrichten van kleinere kantoorunits, flexibele werkplekken en ontmoetingsplekken waar geen huurcontract voor nodig is. De risico’s zijn gelegen in de routing met de auto richting het gebouw en de relatie met de Oudegracht. Een kantoor wordt niet gezien als een publieke functie. De commerciële functies op de begane grond en de kelder moeten het gebouw een publiekelijk karakter geven. De economische groei in Utrecht is lager vergeleken met het provinciaal gemiddelde en er heerst een stijgende werkloosheid. Dit houdt in dat de relatie met het nabij gelegen centraal station optimaal moet zijn. Hier komt bij dat de naastgelegen Neude flat leeg komt te staan en 69.000 m2 vrij verhuurbaar kantoorruimte achterlaat. III. Cultuurhuis Neude: In deze variant wordt er geanticipeerd op de huidige functie van het Neude plein in Utrecht en de bijkomende functie van de centrale hal als binnentuin voor het Neude plein. De risico’s zijn gelegen in de routing met de auto richting het gebouw en de relatie met de Oudegracht. Het publiekelijk openstellen van het gebouw blijft essentieel om de relatie met de omgeving te behouden. De commerciële functies op de begane grond en de kelder zijn essentieel om deze verbondenheid te behouden. Het kunnen berekenen van de financiële haalbaarheid over een langere periode met INKOS is onderzocht en heeft geresulteerd in het INKOS LT model. Dit model maakt het mogelijk om de exploitatiekosten en opbrengsten over een langere periode te simuleren. INKOS LT bestaat uit een iteratief proces, dat bepaald wordt door het intern rendement, de eindwaarde en de beschouwingsperiode (kosten en opbrengsten). De eindwaarde wordt bepaald door middel van de rendementsmethode, de beschouwingsperiode wordt bepaald door het invoeren van financiële kengetallen. Door een vijftal stappen te doorlopen wordt het financieel rendement met INKOS LT bepaald. Op deze wijze wordt er, stap voor stap, een cashflow gesimuleerd gedurende de beschouwingsperiode en wordt het financieel rendement bepaald.","transformatie; monumentaal vastgoed; INKOS; financiële haalbaarheid; transformatiepotentie","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Real Estate management","",""

Also amateurs get the chance to learn from professionals, by watching, talking and acting. People can share their ideas and explore their talents. Also passersby are welcome in and around the building. Already its location is unique and therefore a reference point. The amount of people and its facilities make it a real urban element in the city. When it has become a well known point, it is easy to say ‘let’s meet at the theater’. The cultural program has its roots in a universal appreciated art form: dance. With appearances in many forms, dance can be enjoyed by people from different cultures, it can be practiced at different levels and at different ages. In an aged society such as Korea it might even be used as therapy to develop motor skills and movement. In the new theater more of the creative facets that are involved in or related to making a dance production are present, including presenting, costume making and painting. Furthermore shops will be included to provide the right material and to enable people to bring the creativity home.","Theater; City; Korea; Seoul; Yongsan; Lifetime City; Theater City","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-04-19","Architecture","Materialisation","","Vertical Cities Asia","",""

Typically, in these models, the instantaneous volatility is defined in terms of cumulative log returns on past investments in the asset. A necessity in view of option pricing is that the asset price process can model all features of volatility surfaces.lIt appears that neither existing Hobson-Rogers models nor an extended version can full this requirement. This gives rise to develop a new model specification, contained in the Hobson-Rogers class. The second order weak approximation scheme of Ninomiya-Victoir combined with Quasi Monte Carlo integration leads to an efficient option pricing method. For the most part this can be attributed to the fact that the ordinary differential equations in the Ninomiya-Victoir scheme of the new model have closed-form solutions. The proposed model can explain actual option data better than former models, as is demonstrated by several maturity slices for European options on the S&P500.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(mentor); Tabeau, K.E. (mentor); Linchel, L. (mentor)","2013","The concept of design thinking is highly wining ground not only to the design engineering field but also in fields related and associated with business and management. An increasing amount of non designers who use design thinking emerges. Thus, the purpose of this thesis is to transfer design thinking qualities to non designers. Service Science Factory as an example of such organization that uses design disciplines with non designers. Service Science Factory focus on multidisciplinary teams which are quite wide and it comes from different scientific fields outside design scope. Their intention is to create tangible, feasible and reliable innovative services for their clients. The thesis starts with the exploration of the Service Science Factory environment. The participants are approached with two qualitative methods; participant observation and cultural probes. The results of the analysis of the methods reveal issues namely problems in understanding the process and mainly at the begging of the process. The analysis of the results provides a filter which will guides the literature research on design thinking. Furthermore, preliminary design requirements such as the facilitation of the process by the project leader and the need of common knowledge base on behalf of the participants emerge. Next a literature research on design thinking is presented. In terms of the process two concepts are essential: the problem and solution space co evolution and the usage of divergent and convergent thinking in order to reach to a solution. Hence, basic actions on problem framing such as mass, fact and problem finding are essential for exploring the problem space used in order to reduce the ambiguity of the problem. Furthermore, structured reflection is used to improve the design process; an element essential to novice designers and non designers in order to learn or improve their processes. The results of the preliminary requirements as well the results of the literature research set the basis for the concept development. The concept is developed as the literature suggests; by co evolution of the problem and solution space through experiments which lead to the final outcome. The final module is a training tool embedded in the Service Science Factory process. The participants with the help of the project leader participate into inquiries of creative sessions along with individual reflection and collective discussions sequences in order to gain beeper understanding of the content of the project as well as the process they follow. More precisely, two different set of sessions, one to asset the research (mess/data finding) and on to asset the final problem statement (problem statement session) were created in order to help the participants to understand better the content of the given project. Furthermore, reflection of the process is required in order to understand better the overall process of design. As the result, the participants acquire useful knowledge about the design thinking parading because they experience the problem solution space evolution as well as the diverge and converge nature of design thinking through the sessions. Moreover, the sequence of individual and collective discussions makes the team to acquire individual knowledge about the project as well as create the base of share understanding which is important when working with teams.","design thinking; reflection cycles; design process; training tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

This action stimulates open innovation in reusing those open government data. Yet, the study about the potential of open data platform to stimulate open innovation in the public sector has not been disclosed into wider research area. Therefore, this study is aimed to get insight the potential of the platform to stimulate open innovation especially in the public sector. Current adoptions of the platforms in three different countries; the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Indonesia, are examined to capture the value of the platform. To provide a comprehensive analysis of those three countries, this study tries to understand the backgrounds of those countries and the current adoption of open data platform in each examined country. A conceptual framework was developed from open data value chain analysis. It can define the strengths and weaknesses of current adoption of the platforms in three examined countries. In this framework there are two activities; literature reviews and empirical research, which were conducted to answer the main research question. Literature reviews were conducted to explain three countries’ backgrounds with regard to democracy, public administration, culture, technology infrastructure, and open data policies. There are several differences among three countries’ backgrounds in those aspects. They should affect to the best strategy which will be implemented in order to get successful adoption of open data platform in each country. Next, the evaluation of the ENGAGE platform’s services was an empirical research to understand the ways the platform can stimulate open innovation in the public sector. This study discusses open innovation process within the platform in reusing open government data of three examined countries. Nevertheless, the current ENGAGE platform has not supported yet for stimulating open innovation. It has to be completed with several tools which can stimulate join collaboration among open data stakeholders such as researchers, citizens, and businesses. Further studies should discuss this result to other open data platforms by using the same typical framework. Therefore, a generalization can be made.","open government data; open data platform; open innovation; public sector; open data value chain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-04-15","Technology, Policy and Management","Information and Communication Technology","","Management of Technology","",""

However, since natural gas hydrates deposits were discovered in 1967 the conception of natural gas hydrates as an important energy resource is well accepted. Latest estimations indicate that the amount of natural gas stored in hydrate form is almost six times the volume of conventional natural gas. A relative new method to produce methane from natural gas hydrate deposits is the sequestration of CO2 in a water-bearing layer underneath a natural gas hydrate deposit. This process depends, among others, on the in-situ formation rate of CO2 hydrate in a porous medium, which depends on pressure, temperature, composition of the aqueous and gas phase and the geometry of the porous medium. Concerning the formation rate of CO2 there is no general accepted value that could be used in numerical models to predict the speed of CO2 gas hydrate formation in porous medium. Additionally, the experimental determination of the formation rate is difficult or even not possible. However, indirect determination of the formation rate based on gas consumption rate can be realized. This study represents gas consumption rate experiments in glass bead and Bentheimer sandstone cores determining gas consumption during CO2 dissolution at relatively low pressure of 1.6 MPa and determining gas consumption during hydrate formation in a Bentheimer sandstone core at a high pressure of 3.0 MPa. For the experiments in the glass-bead core, the pressures reached at the end of the dissolution experiments are in good agreement with the thermodynamic equilibrium values. For the experiments in the Bentheimer sandstone core, the experimental procedure had to be modified to obtain reproducible results: these results were in good agreement with thermodynamic equilibrium data. The modified procedure was applied in the high pressure experiments. The resulting initial gas consumption rates of these two experiments are 4.1x10-4 mole/(s.m3.kPa) and 105 mole/(s.m3.kPa). Additional experimental investigation is necessary to explain this discrepancy.","CO2 gas hydrate; Porous media; Bentheimer sandstone; gas consumption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Section for Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Ruiter, I.A. (mentor)","2013","Dutch outdoor brand ‘Nomad’ has initiated in the past the development of inflatable tent poles, so called air beams. This near to be finished air beam technology is separately developed and is currently not yet implemented in a tent design of the (future) portfolio of Nomad. The goal is to have tents implemented with air beams for the collection of 2014. With this new collection of inflatable tents, the desire exists to return to an earlier abandoned user group that consists of ‘serious outdoor users’. For this group, it is asked to develop a lightweight tent construction principle with implementation of the developed air beam technology. This principle will then later have to be translated into whole product range proposal of lightweight inflatable tents. Context Analysis: lightweight tents This thesis describes the development and embodiment of this desired lightweight inflatable tent series and starts with a context analysis of lightweight tents. Nomad as a company is analyzed and future market position and user groups are determined for a Nomad lightweight tent. Both discussed marketing position and user scenario’s match in the implementation of a tent for travel and trekking purposes. Furthermore, it appears that the current lightweight tent market is saturated, and that deviating properties are needed to (re)enter this market. Both internal as external experts agree that it is in line with Nomad’s values to deviate on ‘comfort per weight’. In addition it is found that the most benefits could be gained in a four person tent. In the end, a provisional design goal is composed that describes the development of: “A four person inflatable lightweight tent with a differentiating comfort to weight ratio per price in the travel and trekking segment” Technology analysis: air beams A definition of air beams is given by Malm et al. (2008) as follows: “An air beam is a high-strength fabric sleeve fitted around an air retention bladder which, when sealed and inflated, acts as a load bearing structural beam or arch”. The application of this technology by Nomad is evaluated, and it turns out that their developed technology is far from finished and need further improvement and substantiation. Subsequently, air beam’s mechanical behavior is studied and the most important design parameters for an air beam tent are determined to be the beam diameter and inflation pressure. These high influence parameters on structure stiffness and capacity will receive the most focus during future dimensioning. Hereby it should be taken into account that the travel/trekking purpose of the future product only allows small dimensioned inflation means. A strategy is composed that will first develop a spacious but stable four person inflatable tent structure, and will later evaluate the resulting design on inflation time to validate its success. To finalize this section and the analysis phase as a whole, a design brief is composed. Design goal and challenge for this project are pointed out, and the differentiating product properties ‘comfort’, ‘deviation’, and ‘feasibility’ are composed that give direction to the upcoming concept design phase. The design challenge is composed as follows: “The real challenge in fulfilling the design goal is the contradiction of a stable four person inflatable structure, that on the one hand needs to be as spacious as possible, and on the other hand should deliver an acceptable pitching time with the limited inflation means that the ‘trekking’ proposal offers.” Concept Design During concept design, the design of a lightweight inflatable tent is initiated. The concept design process is subsequently described by idea generation and concept development and results in an overview of generated concepts. The three product ideas that are developed into final concepts have each another focus point; representing the differentiating product properties ‘comfort’, ‘deviation’, and ‘feasibility’. Since the design goal asks for a tent with a differentiating comfort per weight ratio, concept development has put focus on the optimization of the volume of the selected concepts for the amount of material that is used. In the end, the resulting concepts are evaluated and the best proposal for set design goal and challenge is selected. The biggest advantage of selected concept (shown below) is its relative short inflation time, and forms thereby the most feasible four person inflatable tent that is able to conquer the set design challenge. Final product To go from selected concept to the final product, a last design step is taken. The main focus during this step is the embodiment and dimensioning of the air beams and valve system. Here it is calculated that the final air beam design with a diameter of 70 mm and inflation pressure of 0,75 bar can withstand wind speeds of 18,5 m/s. Features of the final four person tent are subsequently presented, and the final design is transformed into a proposal for a whole series of inflatable lightweight tents. The created ‘Nomad Air’ tent range contains a four, three and two person model. During product evaluation, a conducted user test shows that the pitching of an inflatable tent takes substantially more time than a similar model with conventional poles. The inflatable pitching process is nevertheless perceived as acceptable, but not seen as a outstanding improvement compared to conventional pole tents. In further evaluation it appears that the proposed four person tent is expected to have a too long inflation time and will most likely not be accepted by consumers. The final tent series proposal will therefore only exist of a three and two person model and will be equipped with 65 mm air beams. These proposed tent models offers feasible, producible solutions that are believed to be able to grow into good functioning products. However, compared to existing lightweight tents, the inflatable tent series can not bring outstanding advantages. True unique selling points other than ‘inflatable’ are not present. This makes it a too weak proposal to enter and stand out in ‘specialized outdoor sport shops’. Therefore, it is concluded that the final designed inflatable tent series should not be executed by Nomad.","Tent; Inflatable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-04-12","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Product Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Doorn, F. (mentor)","2013","This graduation project describes the design process of the Pancake Expedition; a non guided family product for the Rijksmuseum. The objective of this project was to design an explorative family expedition that enriches and enhances the museum experience for families and surprises them in two ways; a surprise concerning family interaction and the museum collection. The Rijksmuseum, located in Amsterdam, is currently being renovated. In the time of this project the Philips wing of the museum, with an exhibition about the Dutch Golden Age, was open for public. After the reopening, the Rijksmuseum will offer visitors an overview of art and history from the late Middle Ages to the present day. A scope of new products will be introduced, including the explorative family expedition which focuses on the Golden Age collection. Literature shows that family friendly museums are a hot topic in the museum world. In these museums the focus is on both the adults and the children. The Rijksmuseum defines a family as at least one adult visitor in the company of one or more children who have a familial bond with each other. Within this definition several family compositions and family behaviour types can be distinguished; e.g. a single parent with two children has another family and museum interaction than two grandparents with one grandchild. Museum experience is different each time a visitor enters the museum. A positive experience and memory occurs if the museum matches the expectations of the visitors. To enrich and enhance the museum visit and increase the social interaction within the family, the explorative family expedition should be presented and communicated clearly and inviting. A method to stimulate interaction in museums is Visual Thinking Strategies. This method consist of three open-ended questions and is based on the theory that learning occurs from social environmental interactions. A way to enrich and enhance the museum visit of families, is to offer an interesting and fun product. The explorative family expedition should focus on the complete family and stimulate family interaction. In order to design an interesting explorative family expedition, insights in desired family interaction and museum visits had to be obtained, as well as family behaviour and experiences during a Rijksmuseum visit. An observational research and a co-research study were conducted. Co-research is a qualitative form of research in which users participate actively in the research process. The observational research showed that most of the families have a goal-oriented approach, they scan objects quickly instead of viewing them intensely. If they take more time for an object, they like to discuss it as a family. The children have a major role during the visit, they determine the pace within the museum. Most of the adults on the other hand determine the route and have the role of teacher and motivator. From the co-research it appeared that all families like to do and explore things together in museums, though there should be room for 1-on-1 moments and alone time as well. The focus of museum products should be both on the children and the adults; they want to learn new things by doing, and like to see a gaming element in these products. All families like to have a souvenir of their visit. Based on the outcomes of the co-research, five characteristic families, so-called familias, have been composed. Four guiding themes are formed with the research outcomes; souvenir, action, gaming element and family interaction. These themes were kept in mind when the step to the design phase was made. Also two extra guiding themes, based on the assignment and the literature, were taken into account; surprise element and positive memory. Based on the research outcomes an extensive list with design guidelines was formulated. With help of the guiding themes that derived from the exploration and research phase, eight guidelines have been selected as most important for this project. These guidelines were used during the idea and concept phases. With help of a creative session and historical background of the Golden Age period, ideas were generated for the explorative family expedition. Six ideas were presented to the Rijksmuseum and three of them were developed further into concepts. In the first concept, Golden pancakes, the families have to find missing ingredients of a pancake recipe. The tour has the form of a recipe box with thematic question cards. In concept 2, Explore the Golden Age, the families have to solve riddles with help of the objects in the museum. The form of the correct answer has to be pressed out and all parts can be put together to build a 3D model. The third concept, The Rijksmuseum game, is based on a life-size board game. The museum building is used as a playing field, and the family has to roll a dice to determine where to go. Each room includes a question or fun-fact. Based on a comparison to the eight most important guidelines and the preference of the Rijksmuseum, one final concept has been chosen to elaborate further as the explorative family expedition. This final concept combines the strong points of two concepts; the Golden Age pancake recipe and the form of a 3D puzzle. The final design of the explorative family expedition, the Pancake Expedition, introduces the families with the Golden Age period by means of a pancake recipe. The recipe is used to explain the overall story of this period. The main question that will be answered during the tour is; what do you need to bake Golden Age pancakes? The questions in the tour are presented in the form of a construction kit. Each question should be answered by pressing out a part of this construction kit. At the end of the tour the families can build a 3D puzzle with the nine collected parts. The result is a pop-up model of a VOC ship. The tour consists of eleven questions, though only nine of them will be answered by the families. The visitor flow can differ, this is related to the answers that were given during the tour. At the end of the tour, the families are able to answer the main question. They are introduced with all pancake ingredients and how these ingredients were imported and transported by the Dutch in that period. The result of the 3D puzzle is also part of the answer to this main question. A reality check was set up to evaluate the product. During this reality check four families used a simplified version of the tour in the Philips wing. From this user study it can be concluded that the Pancake Expedition is experienced positively by all families, though there are some focus points to keep in mind for further refinement. Furthermore the design has been evaluated with help of the eight most important guidelines and the familias that were composed in the research phase. Recommendations were formulated for the Rijksmuseum in order to implement the design. The most important recommendations are to rephrase the questioning in order to make it more inviting and to the point. Also a final decision concerning the material and the slit width has to be made in relation to the appearance of the product and the pop-up mechanism.","explorative expedition; families; Rijksmuseum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-07-11","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2013","Industrial buildings, used as warehouses or distribution centres, are characterized by large doors which are opened temporarily or for longer periods. A new technique - called Ambergy - is investigated which prevents unnecessary energy loss through open overhead doors in heated industrial halls. This technique consists of a smart coupling between the heating system and the overhead doors. By temporarily switching off gas-fired heaters near open doors, the heat loss through the door should be minimized. It is expected that the Ambergy system can contribute to energy savings, also when the indoor thermal comfort is taken into account. However, at the start of the research, the amount of energy which can be saved and the effect of the Ambergy system on the thermal comfort, was not known yet. If energy can be saved by using the Ambergy system, and the current thermal comfort level can be retained, many industrial buildings can benefit from this. This thesis aimed to get an insight in the energy saving effects of the Ambergy system and to determine its potential - technical - feasibility. To fulfil this aim, a literature study is performed to predict important physical aspects affecting the heat balance, to gain insight in air transport phenomena and to derive criteria to compare thermal comfort levels. By using the software packages Matlab and Simulink, these physical aspects and air flow phenomena are implemented in a thermal building-dynamics simulation. This simulation predicts effect of the Ambergy system on the air temperature across the hall and the fuel savings for different circumstances during a whole winter season. Assumptions made in the thermal building-dynamics simulation - regarding the air flow direction - are verified with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Furthermore, measurements are performed in one representative industrial hall (Alphatron, Rotterdam), to gain input data for both models and to validate the outcome. To make the system as optimal as possible and accepted by the employees, also the effect on the indoor thermal comfort is taken into account. A comparison between the current thermal comfort level and the expected thermal comfort level, when applying Ambergy, is performed by calculating the required insulation value of the clothing of the employees (IREQ-value). As part of this thesis, also requirements for pilot projects at business facilities of DHL and Alphatron - in ’s Hertogenbosch and Rotterdam respectively - are defined and these pilot projects were carried out during this thesis. Due to the confidential nature of this research and the embargo set by the TU Delft and BreedofBuilds B.V., no information can publicly be given regarding the results, conclusions and recommendations done in this research until August 2017.","ambergy; heating system; energy; industrial; hall; control; heat loss; building physics; sustainable; sustainability; finite element modeling; heat; CFD; civil engineering; building engineering; gas-fired-heaters; thermal comfort","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-08-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Building Technology and Physics","",""

Current tools express the complexity of concurrent programs with varying degrees of success. We have evaluated and analyzed the visualizations of these tools in relation to the inherent concurrency problems they were meant to solve and come up with an alternative approach to tracing, analyzing and visualizing program executions. By focusing on the use of shared fields we show memory based interaction between threads by use of sequence diagrams, structured in a novel way. This new approach is implemented in a Java based, Eclipse plugin, dynamic analysis tool called Field Of Thread (FOT).

(mentor)","2013","This report presents the results of a master thesis with the objective to develop an active toe angle concept on vehicles with a multi-link rear suspension. The result is a design for a concept which uses the roll of the vehicle and adjustments of the suspensions geometry as drivers. From a market analysis, three technologies are defined to actuate the toe angle of the rear wheels; four-wheel steering, four-wheel independent steering and active geometry suspension. Because of the opportunities of the latter, an addition on the current actuation is proposed. This new concept embodies two modes for a more stable but also a more agile ride. Current technologies are compared with the new concept using the customer attributes and it is concluded that active geometry suspension is favourable regarding the costs, the safety risks and the reduction of fuel consumption. To validate the performance of this new concept, a BMW E60 vehicle model is created using Simulink and the effects of changing the suspension geometry are evaluated. With this bicycle model, the driving limits during cornering are mapped for the stable and agile mode. For the two modes, it is proven that they are effective to alter the vehicle dynamics to the desired response. In the stable mode, the possible cornering circumstances are increased. In the agile position, the yaw rate is increased and the turning radius decreased. With these results, the potential impact of the proposed concept is proven satisfactory. To select the position of actuation in the rear suspension, a model of the BMW’s rear suspension is built with the use of Lotus Suspension Analysis Software. This model is validated first on data available from the kinematics. With the model, the desired toe changed is searched by moving the joints. A isolated joint has been found which alters the roll steer without influencing the camber angle. The reaction forces on the joints are also checked for different modes and cornering situations, although the compliance was not taken into account. To conclude, a methodological approach is used to create a design proposal. First the House of Quality is used to determine which functional and technical attributes are important. The displacement range and the settling time are the most important functional attributes, while reduction of the actuated force, making the concept modular and reducing the cost are the technical attributes with the highest ranking. From the seven designs which have been created, a choice is made using a pairwise comparison. Since this method yielded no direct outcome, the insights from the comparison are used to create a new design, which is ultimately engineered for some key characteristics.","automotive; multi-link; active toe; roll steer; suspension geometry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-04-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2013","The advanced ageing of the electrical power network combined with the inevitable increase of renewable energy utilization and the constant increase of power consumption over the last decades call for a change in the current power network paradigm. Electrical world stakeholders have to embrace the situation and come up with methods of better utilizing the existing, but also new, network resources. The ongoing financial crisis also acted as an eye opener for new concepts and smart opportunities. This project’s approach is to create a modern and automated layer on top of the existing power network physical layer which makes use of several physical models to interpret the current and future expected health status of the network’s components. With this automated layer, the network operator can configure the network to be a self-sustainable, or at least more independent, and a more insightful system. Real-time and projections of the network’s health status can be used as power flow optimization factors. Simulations based on real power flow data have shown that distributing thermal loading throughout neighbouring power components results in a more efficient resource utilization as it lowers the overall network accelerated ageing factor, while keeping the power flow characteristics within the legislated integrity limits. It has been shown that, by applying this health prediction framework to the IEEE-14 bus network and allowing the layer to act in a decentralized fashion independently of the network operator, the overall network lifetime utilization can be reduced by 80% by rerouteing only 13% of the overall power flow. This rerouteing of power flow does not compromise the load requirements, nor does it require more power components than the ones present in the IEEE-14 bus network configuration. Although it is difficult to implement this framework layer on top of the electrical power network, due to its well-known structural inertia, it has been shown that this system can effectively be deployed in different steps in time. Furthermore, the level of trust the network operator has in the system can also be incrementally upgraded, as this layer can be used at first simply as a more insightful source of data and only when desired it can be used as a more active factor in the electrical power network management.","model-based optimization; power transformer; oil-paper insulation; insulation ageing; asset management; smart grid; renewable energy integration; high frequency transients; decision making; IEEE14; MATPOWER; Matlab; High Voltage; tangent delta; Tettex 2840; agent; electrical power network; predictive health model; thermal loading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","High Voltage Technology and Asset Management","","EPE","",""

Through this process, correlations for the model parameters with measured SPT blowcounts were suggested and validated. The effects of the state of the soil, lateral earth pressure coefficient, the damping ratio and static shear were evaluated. And the model was validated in the case of controlled conditions like the ones in the centrifuge and in the field with the case study.

Business drivers on the one hand; management is expecting more information and more steering possibilities. Market drivers on the other hand; better incorporation of decentralized generation, improvements of the existing services and maintaining or improving the existing high levels of system reliability. To facilitate the changing requirements, more intelligence and connectivity in control systems is necessary. In the past, control systems were connected with proprietary networks to the SCADA network. These systems and networks were often custom-made, isolated and had little processing power. The current trend is to implement and use control systems with off-the-shelf technology, with interconnectivity and with computing power. This trend is referred to as Internet Technology (IT) integration into Operational Technology (OT), in short: IT/OT integration. It brings a significant change in the status quo of the energy industry. Based on the literature as well as the questionnaire, we can argue that a difference in perspective can have an impact on control system security. The values that people have can determine - to a certain extend - the way security is interpreted and perceived. When there is a difference in perspectives, it might keep organizations aware, but when the differences are too comprehensive it will restrict the organization in properly dealing with threats. Whether shared values for the IT and OT group are likely to happen and desirable to have is an interesting question. When the IT and OT group maintain their current separate values, communication and interaction is important. Interaction and communication might improve understanding and commitment which can advocate control system security. To increase commitment, understanding and shared values, managers must play an active role in promoting shared values. Risk management is to a large extent steered by people; the influence of their perspective on security is believed to be significant. Throughout every sections of our risk management framework the perspective on security was a reoccurring theme. Threat perception, vulnerability identification and risk response can all be influenced by the perspective on security. Again, a shared set of values on security can contribute in improving risk management. Some final thoughts – ideas and best practices - on control system security had been drafted in the last paragraph of this research. A short abstract of the recommendations: be selective in bringing control systems from isolation, use the wisdom of the crowd to find vulnerabilities, facilitate education and training for personnel, share practical knowledge and ideas with the industry, and make better use of online media monitoring (Twitter, Pastebin, forums) to actively search for threats.","Cyber security; Security Paradigm; IT/OT integration; Control systems; Risk framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Beleid, Organisatie, Recht & Gaming","",""

(mentor)","2013","Renewable energy is a trending topic nowadays. Government restrictions force us to produce less CO2 and use more renewable energy sources. One of the ways of becoming a more sustainable society is by using solar energy. Solar panels are promising in supplying a large part of our energy demand. The price per kWh is important to be competitive with other energy sources. Therefore we try to make solar cells more efficient. Improving solar cell efficiency can be done by optimising the electrode grid pattern. This research relies on existing topology optimisation techniques as used in mechanical problems. By using a finite element formulation of the electrical conductivity we can solve the electrical problem in the grid. Examples show that this is actually working. A large part of this thesis is about the non-linear behaviour of the cell. The way to model this, is discussed and 3 methods are used to compute the nodal currents in the finite element formulation from the current density values. It can be seen that the most accurate way of doing this, is using sample points for the voltages in the element. The objective used in topology optimisation for mechanical problems is adapted for the electrical problem. But this is not exactly corresponding to the main target, maximize the solar cell efficiency and new objective is introduced. By computing the total power output of the solar cell the performance of the cell is measured. Different optimisation cases are investigated, by varying busbar voltage, busbar position, number of busbars or changing the size of the design domain, different solutions are obtained. To conclude it can be said that topology optimisation can indeed be used for optimising the electrode pattern in solar cells. The first test using the total power as an objective gives promising results, with efficiencies in the order of 90% of theoretical maximum fill factor.","topology optimisation; metallisation patterns; photovoltaic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-08-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2013","Society faces the compelling need to change the current ways of producing energy due to the environmental burden of fossil-based energy technologies along with the scarcity of fossil resources. Renewable Energy Technologies (RETs) appear as an option for sustainable energy generation. Small Island Developing States, SIDS, are a particular group of nations that face remoteness, isolation and geographic dispersion, poor connectivity and limited human and technological capacity. SIDS and are not strangers to the challenge of adopting sustainable energy technologies, but as a matter of fact their penetration, particularly in the SIDS of the Caribbean remains rather small. In order to understand why is this the case, this research frames the adoption of RETs as an Innovation for the Caribbean region. Innovation can be considered in several ways, such as product innovation; systems innovation; innovation can be studied from the perspective of firms or regions. In this context it refers to the process of introduction of new technologies in the energy generation system of the Caribbean. Hence, a the theoretical approach of this research combines the theories of Technological Transitions, particularly Geel’s Multi Level Perspective (MLP), which helps to understand the factors that influence technological change; and the theories of Innovation Systems (IS), focusing on Hekkert’s Functions of Innovation Systems (FIS), which provide a toolset to understand the capacity of a system to innovate. This framework focuses on the factors that explain why is the region struggling to adopt RETs. Regardless of the wide availability of renewable energy resources and the attractive economic conditions for the adoption of RETs, the legislation, the lack of regulation, longstanding utility monopolies and international commitments represent major institutional barriers for the energy transition in the region and the emergence of an IS that support their adoption. Furthermore, it is clear from the analysis that more effort is needed to strengthen the capacity of the region to innovate, by supporting the creation, transfer and diffusion of knowledge; by encouraging entrepreneurship and creating a fair market for the RE industry in the region; by increasing awareness and securing political commitment to the energy transition. Finally, some opportunities for market development were identified including adoption of RET by the Travel & Tourism industry; advisory services; financing and funding scanning of the market for business and government; and early introduction of retail and service companies.","technological transitions; functions of innovation systems; renewable energy; small island developing states; Caribbean","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Values, Technology and Innovation","","Technology Dynamics and Sustainable Development","",""

(mentor)","2013","The projects in oil and chemical (O&C) industry often experience problems during their execution, because of those problems, some of the project ends with large cost and schedule overruns. The poor performance of projects not only affects the strategic objective of project’s owner but also poses a dual threat to engineering and construction (E&C) companies. They negatively affect their profit margins and their business objectives. Given the strict budget constraints imposed by the present global economic situation, owners and stakeholders expect their projects to be delivered cost effectively and efficiently. Therefore, it is important for E&C companies to strive for improvement in their project management practices. The current thesis research is a step in direction to introduce a new concept for improvement in performance management practices. For that purpose, the research introduces “early detection of project problems” as the main instrument and uses the quantitative information from past project to develop a body of knowledge and first conceptual model to predict the future performance of projects at their early stages. The research is conducted in five phases, the first phase of the research explores O&C project and their performance management practices. Based on the gathered knowledge via literature study and available information, the main research question is formulated as “How can future problems and performance of a current O&C project be predicted at early stages using knowledge and experience from past projects in an EPC environment?” Thereafter, a series of sub questions were formulated aimed to answer the above-mentioned research question. The later part of the first phase developed a structured research approach and research methods. In the second part of the research, efforts were directed to find the so-called “early warnings” of problems. To identify the early warnings, two main sources were explored, literature and experts from O&C project industry. Each investigation into respective sources resulted into number of early warnings. Each identified early warning was evaluated on selection criteria with three selection parameters. After the careful evaluation, the following ten early warnings were selected. ID Early warning indicator LES Lack of understanding of project execution strategy among project team PTE Project team lacks experience required for the project COC Conflicts between owner and E&C contractor NCO Numbers of change orders CCO Cost impact of changes FED Percentage of missing information in FEED package PH Growth in process man-hours PS Delay in process engineering CE Change in concurrency level between process and piping engineering DPO Delay in issuance of purchase orders The selected early warnings were carried to the third phase of the research, in which four detailed case studies were performed to have observatory evidence. The case studies in this phase consisted of four project with different performance levels. The difference in performance levels of case projects set the contrast in which the predictive capability of early warnings could be observed. The case study investigation found that there is a relationship between early warnings, project problems and project performance. After obtaining the observatory evidence, the fourth phase of the research adopted a purely quantitative approach and studied the behavior of early warnings in a relatively larger set of past projects. Subsequently correlation analysis was performed to find correlations between early warnings and final project outcomes (which collectively asses the project performance). The quantitative analysis did present interesting and encouraging results. The main results are mentioned as follows: I. Early warnings do behave differently in case of poor and good performance projects, few in terms of their absolute value and few in their incremental changes. II. Correlations do exist between EWI and project outcomes, however not all the EWI found to be correlated with all project outcomes. III. The EWI indicators does show a dynamic quantitative relationship with project outcomes over engineering duration of the project Using the results from quantitative analysis, an attempt is made in the last phase of this research for the development of prediction model, which can predict the future performance of projects. The results of pilot prediction model were analyzed and compared with forecasts made via traditional forecasting methods. The comparison of forecasts found that prediction model does make prediction that is more accurate. However, there are errors with-in prediction models. In addition, the external validation of model suggested limited reliability and accuracy of pilot model. The dataset used for quantitative analysis and building of prediction model is relatively small and limit the generalization of findings. Therefore, to have a more accurate prediction in good projects, a dataset is required which contains a balance of Successful and less than successful performance projects. Despite the smaller dataset, the findings and approaches presented in this research can be used to build a useful model and subsequently applied in O&C project industry. A set of insights and recommendations (short term and long term) has been made for Fluor to implement the findings of this research to develop an operational performance prediction system. The research possibly has following main contributions to scientific and industry. Contribution to scientific community I. A shift from reactive project management to proactive project management II.

These project are more and more near sensitive nature reserves and thereby a potential threat of biodiversity; which is a major concern for port developers, authorities, environmental organizations and dredging companies. This research has emerged from the execution of Khalifa Port in Abu Dhabi; a project which lasted from February 2008 to July 2010. Turbidity in the water column (near coral reefs) was one of the main problems affecting Boskalis’ workability. Predefined, tight and fixed turbidity levels, valid for the whole site and execution period, were not allowed to be exceeded without adverse measures for the dredging company. The client had stated that the dredging company would always be responsible for the measured turbidity values; no matter what cause. An extensive data set resulted from this project. === Objectives === The aim of this research is twofold and can be related to the following research key objectives:  The goal of this study is to gain insight in the relevant processes that result in the behavior of fines.  Set up a simplified conceptual model be used as guidelines for future projects. === Approach === Research was done, following two approaches. First, the turbidity data set was analysed, where the relation was made with occurred hydrodynamics. The pre-dredging period was considered to capture the natural conditions leading a conceptual understanding. Understanding of Khalifa data can be used for in general guidelines for projects with similar environmental issues. Second, the behavior of suspended fines with a resuspension origin was simulated in an idealized model set up, this to improve understanding and secondly to create the ability to anticipate on turbidity events with regard to planning workability.","resuspension; suspended sediment; coastal Environment; dredging; natural turbidity variability; Abu Dhabi - Khalifa Port; simplified conceptual model; dataset","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-04-05","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Buijs, J.A. (mentor); Baseliers, S.H. (mentor)","2013","Hilti has high market coverage but relatively low penetration in the Dutch Diamond Service Contractor (DSC) trade. There is also no dedicated strategy. This loyalty issue needed a solution. I fulfilled this position from a fresh point of view during my graduation project. The target groups in the DSC trade are Diamond Service Contractors (DSC’s) and Demolition Experts (DE’s). Hilti Hilti was analyzed from an internal and external point of view. Remarkable is the strong Hilti identity, which can create excitement among people. However, sometimes this leads to arrogant attitudes among Hilti employees. The Hilti organizations itself is very large and international. Hilti is therefore easily able to survive a local crisis, like the current one in the Netherlands. Another strength of Hilti compared to the competition is the channel system in own control. This enables Hilti to explain an unambiguous story everywhere. A drawback of the large Hilti organization is the inflexibility. I tried to break this is aspect during this project by introducing innovative concepts. DSC Trade The DSC trade customers’ workload is directly linked to the total Dutch construction output. Trend agencies predict several scenarios for the building construction sector, but the latest prediction expects growth in 2014. Prices in the DSC trade are also under a lot of pressure. Hilti products on the other hand are relatively expensive. Although Hilti products are always good, my analysis showed that they are not always value based. In other words, there is a gap that should be bridged between the Hilti pricing and the Hilti value proposition. Simply lowering the prices is not an appropriate solution that fits Hilti. Furthermore, the Hilti TS’s from the DSC sales team are unable to act upon certain sales issues. An example is that they do not have access to a catalog that shows all Hilti DSC trade products. The need for radical new products among DSC trade customers is mostly bound by legislation. Also no radical product innovations have been introduced the last few years. Therefore the DSC trade customers use similar products already for many years. The Hilti product portfolio does not include some of these products, which are regularly used in the DSC trade. This indicates product gaps in the Hilti DSC trade tool portfolio. The DSC trade consumable sector on the other hand is suffering from extreme competition. Many competitors are selling consumables almost below cost price. Customer Research The DSC trade customers are researched in depth. First several employees of a DSC trade customer were observed. Many intersecting facts showed up but especially that drilling the hole does not take that much time actually. Starting and cleaning up on the other hand takes much time. Focusing on those aspects is even more interesting than improving tools or consumables. Another fact is that employees care little about safety. This is an important mismatch, because Hilti is currently one of the best suppliers in safety aspects. The last important fact from observation was that employees do not get to choose the type of consumable, they just get a certain brand from their manager. However, when they do production work (drilling many same sized holes), they get different consumables types and/or brands to compare the performance of each type individually. The second part of the customer research is interviews. A total of ten managers from DSC trade customers were interviewed about different topics. The findings are best represented with three key findings. The first is the Hilti image among the DSC trade customers. Although the customers mention that they like Hilti because of the good products, without a doubt it is the first thing they mention when thinking about Hilti is expensive. Secondly, changing any of their habits is difficult, because they are very conservative. It takes a lot of time to gain trust of a DSC trade customer. Thirdly, almost all customers I visited were categorized as engaged. Engaged is the highest customer loyal level towards Hilti according to Hilti’s own loyalty system. I expected inventories full of Hilti but the opposite was true. Most of them had only a few tools from Hilti and sometimes a lost Hilti consumable lying around. Apparently engaged customers are not that loyal to Hilti as the loyalty stage suggests. The third part of the customer research was a survey among 93 DSC trade customers to determine Hilti’s market potential for the DSC trade. This was needed to adjust the impact of a customer loyalty strategy. The research confirmed Hilti’s loyalty problem and showed a low market share. It also showed a large potential regarding four new product lines. The last part of the research was a workshop with the five DSC trade Hilti TS’s. The goal was to look for characteristics that could describe a DSC trade customer. When DSC’s and DE’s are taken as one big group, there are many personal differences. Profiles were the best method to describe a specific customer. These profiles can segment customers. With these profiles it is possible to create a tailored approach for a specific type of customer. Strategy The analysis resulted in four strategic directions for Hilti in the DSC trade. Three were within scope of this project: Extreme Hilti craziness through personalized approach Employee focus for market penetration Transparent discount policy Furthermore a customer journey workshop with key people from the DSC trade resulted in a customer journey tailored to the DSC trade customer and many ideas to solve the loyalty problem. The customer journey clarified an important problem. Apparently many Hilti touchpoints are non-functioning in the DSC trade. Based on this conclusion the design task was to design a new touchpoint that enhances the overall DSC trade customer journey combined with one or more of the three strategic directions mentioned before. Concepts Three realistic concepts were developed from the design task. One of those concepts is radical and two are incremental. The radical concept is a sales tool that convinces the customer about the Hilti offer by using the profiles mentioned before, customer review movies, branding movies and most important a complete overview of an up to date Hilti portfolio to show to the customer. It is radical, because it needs integration with Hilti’s back office and focusses on Hilti headquarters. The second concept is the Hilti Elite. It is an exclusive networking club for DSC trade customers with points they can collect for discounts. Customers are attracted to various events in the benefit of Hilti. The last concept is the Fleet Van, which is the ultimate loyalty solution. It is a concept that brings Hilti’s fleet management to a new level. The customer is able to get total package with a furnished van, tools and consumables in consignment stock. The customer can now respond quickly to orders on the go, because high quality consumables are always in stock. Implementation The Hilti Elite and Fleet Van are relatively low risk concepts. I definitely recommend Hilti to implement them. Timing the implementation of these concepts is very important, because although both concepts are individually good they can reinforce each other positively. Pilots should also be executed, because feedback from customers is very important for finetuning the concepts. As explained before, the sales tool is a very radical concept. Probably there is no possible way to develop it at Hilti Netherlands. Therefore communicating the concept to Hilti headquarters is needed. The concept is easily worldwide up scalable within Hilti. Conclusion The success of increasing the customer loyalty in the DSC trade depends on the willingness to innovate and amount of money spend by the Hilti management. Hilti should be triggered to do so, because of their low market share in the DSC trade. Otherwise the competition is simply able to outperform Hilti and in the end Hilti should always outperform and outlast.","SWOT; customer journey; Construction; Hilti; concepts; Roadmap; Loyalty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

Four scenarios are examined; they have different foam-strength parameters and different wellbore grid-block radii. As a comparison to the simulation model, fractional-flow theory [Buckley and Leverett, 1941, Rossen et al., 2011] is used to represent the same scenarios. The differences, which represent errors in the simulator case with the Peaceman equation, are discussed.

(mentor); Schoenmaker, R. (mentor); Hobma, F.A.M. (mentor); Post, M.L. (mentor)","2013","This research deals with the general problem of existing foundation of civil infrastructure in the Netherlands that is generally not included in the maintenance management cycle. This can lead in some cases to highly undesirable situations where a lot of time and money must be spent in order to provide a safe and available infrastructure facility again. The objective of this research is to determine whether the current situation of maintenance management of infrastructure facilities in the Netherlands can be optimized by balancing the performance, risk and cost. This is done by investigating whether specific maintenance management to the foundation of an infrastructure facility can contribute to this objective. This leads to the following research question: “Which kind of specific maintenance management focused on the infrastructure’s foundation can optimize the balance between performance, risk and cost?” This research is divided into two parts, the first part is a theoretical background research where the essential items of the optimization problem are outlined and an analysis, based on literature, performed on three real life cases. In the second part; the practical case study, the theoretical analysis is compared to the actual maintenance history of the cases. This evaluation compares the theoretically optimal maintenance strategy against the applied one. In the practical study also the occurred failure of the foundation is analysed where the main cause of the incident is studied. In this way the optimization obtained can be validated through the assessment of potential difference in the optimal and applied strategy. To answer the main research question first the individual research components are investigated. Performance can be described as the quality-level of functioning of a specific system or sub-system. A high required performance demands in general a higher level of maintenance management and the required performance of a facility differs per infrastructure facility. A risk is the chance of an undesirable event happening and can be expressed in the chance of occurrence multiplied with its consequence. Determining the maintenance management risk-based can be used to select cost effective and appropriate maintenance tasks and techniques. Maintenance involves costs. Currently there are many old and deteriorating objects in the Netherlands that should be maintained for the coming decades. The budget for these maintenance activities are decided upon in political surroundings. The specific maintenance management able to optimize the balance between performance, risk and cost, is interpreted as the maintenance management strategy. This strategy describes the physical nature of the maintenance activities. As optimization of this balance between performance, risk and cost is not a given fact, the balance between the three research criteria is assessed; when performance is maximized, and thus in general risks minimized, the costs are automatically maximized as a higher level of quality maintenance management and monitoring is more expensive. When the costs are minimized, the quality of the performance will be lower and the risk of failure higher. The main research question can be translated to the choice of the maintenance management strategy that is optimal considering the three balanced components. Within this research three case studies are used to determine this optimal balance and thus the kind of maintenance management suited for infrastructure foundation. As infrastructure foundation beholds many different physical forms not all infrastructure foundation can be seen as one and the same. But the analysed failures and consequences can be recognized for a larger domain as the cases have a decomposition of general components that civil infrastructure foundation consists of. In this research the attained domain are the three case studies used, whereas the intended domain is infrastructure foundation that has physiological similarities with the attained domain; sunken tunnel types with access ramps founded on tension piles, viaducts and bridges founded on a concrete pile foundation. In detail the research shows that the optimal maintenance strategy to be used for the intended infrastructure foundation would be preventive of nature, in contrast to the current situation where only a corrective strategy is applied. The research shows that the optimal balance is to mitigate the socially unacceptable risks by preventive tasks and monitoring actions in order to prevent and/ or monitor failure. The level of prevention of these tasks and actions are initially determined by the availability of data. Thus a significant aspect of attention is the importance of object data availability.","infrastructuur; beheer en onderhoud; civiele techniek; fundatie; risico analyse; (RCM) Reliability Centred Maintenance; (FMECA) Failure Mode and Critical Effect Analysis; optimalisatie","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Silvester, S. (mentor)","2013","Big and growing airports, like Schiphol, have many facilities, like hotels and parking lots, that need to be connected to each other and the airport terminal. A good approach for this, would be the use of electrically driven, driverless vehicles, called Automated People Movers (APM). An application of this, a so called Group Rapid Transit (GRT) system, has already been developed by the Dutch company 2getthere. However, for the specific use of such a system on airports, only the GRT vehicles are not sufficient. Use on airports asks for an infrastructure above ground level, to be combined with the existing buildings. Further, such an infrastructure should be sustainable, to make the GRT system fit in the future plans of airports. Therefore, this master’s graduation project is about the development of such an elevated infrastructure. In order to design this, the following question is being answered: What should a sustainable elevated system infrastructure for 2getthere’s GRT system at airports look like? An important part of this master’s project thesis, is the analysis. First, the different relevant aspects of ‘sustainability’ have been investigated. This resulted in the conclusion that sustainability does not only include the aspect of ‘planet’, but that also ‘people’ and ‘profit’ (in this case, mainly the profit of the airports) are of major importance for a sustainable design. Second, the principles and applications of APMs have been summarized. At the moment, there are only a few examples of (big, metro-like) APM systems. However, in many situations, a somewhat smaller APM system is more appropriate. GRT systems with their theoretical capacity of 10,800 passengers per hour are a good solutions for many of the transport demands at airports. Next to this good fit in terms of capacity, APMs have many sustainable aspects, that distinguish them from conventional public transport systems. The to-be-designed infrastructure needs to emphasize this. Thirdly, analysis of different aspects of airports led to the conclusion that GRT systems are the best suitable APMs for airports. GRTs can mainly be applied to connect different buildings and facilities, instead of being applied in buildings. As an example, a proposal for a spatial design for Schiphol is included. Further, the important aspects of designing an infrastructure have been explored. As the infrastructure has to be elevated, different bridging systems have been scrutinized. One of the conclusions was that the infrastructure has to be as light as possible, with as little foundation as possible and it has to be prefabricated. In short, the conclusions are that steel is better suitable than concrete for the construction. This all contributes largely to the sustainability of the infrastructure. Importantly, the road surface can be involved in generating energy. These four analysis chapters result in the vision that the elevated GRT infrastructure design should be as ‘minimal’ as possible. This is reflected in the design statement: The GRT system infrastructure should be like a culm of bamboo. The design vision was elaborated in a list of criteria. Then, this design vision and knowledge from the analysis phase are translated into ideas, focusing on the main structure of the infrastructure and its sustainability. These ideas are combined in the two principle solutions ‘less is more’ and ‘green corridor’. These two concepts are merged into the final design, that consists of a trail made of pultruded glass fiber reinforced plastic profiles, carried by a steel construction that serves as guide rail at the same time. The trail is placed on steel pillars, 4.5 m above ground level and is accompanied by an evacuation path. The entire route of the infrastructure can be constructed from 20 m long modules. Also, the design contains standardized curve, split and slope sections. Since the wheels of a GRT use only a narrow part of the track, there is room for solar panels in the middle, to gain energy for the vehicles. The final part of the report consists of evaluations. The design is first evaluated based on the list of criteria in general and on sustainability in particular. In an evaluation with an expert from Schiphol, the design was reviewed as a promising product, that could be successfully exploited by 2getthere. The evaluation results in a list of recommendations followed by a personal evaluation.","GRT; elevated infrastructure; airport; Schiphol; sustainable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-04-02","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

The cultivation process of algae is still open to refinement, however; bioreactor design can still be optimized. One of the factors that affect light penetration through a bioreactor growing algae is cell shape. This study endeavored to find (i) if a shape factor could be determined for different cell shapes that could be applied to existing or future photobioreactor models and (ii) if algae cells could be modeled as titanium dioxide particles, in order to make use of existing, extensive work done on their optical properties and behavior. The specific scattering, absorption, and extinction coefficients for six different species of algae (of three different cell shapes) and P25 Degussa powder were determined using an integrating sphere set-up. Their optical properties and behavior were analyzed and compared. Cells from the same genus behaved similarly and smaller particles, regardless of shape, generally inhibited light penetration into the reactor more than larger particles. Therefore, algae species with larger cells can be grown in higher concentrations than those with small cells before light extinction poses an issue. Cell chemical make-up is also known to affect light penetration, and in this study it appeared that more protein-heavy cells block more light than cells which are mostly lipids. Furthermore, the algae particles behaved very differently from those of titania; specifically, they are strong absorbers and titania particles are not. These initial results would suggest that it is inadvisable to model algae particles as agglomerates of titanium dioxide.","algae; optical; bioreactor; photobioreactor; particle; shape","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Product & Process Engineering","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This estuarine system forms the main part of the iSimangaliso Wetland, which is a World Heritage Site of UNESCO. Since the beginning of the twentieth century the Mfolozi Floodplain is under intensive sugarcane cultivation. This sugarcane cultivation has led to different management strategies of the Mfolozi River and mouth. The mouth of the Mfolozi River has been separated from the St Lucia Mouth for a long period, which led to hyper saline conditions in the St Lucia Lake in times of drought. To guarantee fresh water supply to the St Lucia system the estuary is recently (July 2012) connected to the Mfolozi Mouth via a Beach Channel, resulting in a system with a single shared mouth. If this mouth is closed water backs up on the Mfolozi Floodplain. The main goal of this project can be defined as: “Investigation and development of a flood management system for the Mfolozi Floodplain, considering the fresh water supply to the St Lucia Lake in times of drought.” An important issue for the development of this flood management system is the presence of two groups of stakeholders with conflicting interests. The first group is the ‘green’ group that consists of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park Authority, Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife and the GEF project. The management part of the park is done by the iSimangaliso Wetland Park Authority and the executive part by Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife. In 2008 the iSimangaliso Wetland Park Authority was granted a trust fund by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) to investigate and improve the management strategy for the St Lucia system. The second group is the ‘blue’ group that consists of the UCOSP, USM and the local farmers. The UCOSP provide tramline transport of sugarcane from the farms to the sugar mill (USM) and manages the flood protection infrastructure on the Mfolozi Floodplain. The main problem is that the ‘blue’ group wants to breach the mouth at a certain level to prevent the farmland of flooding, where the ‘green’ group wants to leave the opening and closing process of the mouth to nature to guarantee a natural estuarine functioning of the St Lucia system.","floodplain; flood risk; backwater; river mouth","en","student report","TU Delft, Section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""
