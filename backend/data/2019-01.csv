Its diverse population with dozens of ethnic groups, each with its own values and traditions, is growing at an extreme rate and exemplifies the phenomenon of rapid urbanization. However, the current social housing programs exclude more than 50% of the population, living from less than 75 euros a month. Housing is not accessible to the majority of the population, because of the high demand, the rising cost of basic building materials such as iron and cement, weak policies, no collaboration between the state and private sectors, and a large low-income population. This research and design project aim to contextualize issues such as high population growth, rapid urbanization, and the lack of mass social housing aimed at the Burkinabé population, whilst considering its context and cultural values. Planning for the expansion of cities, which were originally built for a limited few, is a challenge many countries in the Global South face and one that applies to all architects, planners and designers around the world. This paper shows that considering contextual Burkinabé strategies, such as the vernacular way of constructing with local techniques and materials whilst considering the harsh climate, and the way the large variety of ethnic groups communicates and shares resources, is important when wanting to scale up the rural dwellings to a city scale. Fusing both the vernacular and an African modernity offers viable solutions to the spatial development of the country’s urban growth.","Burkina Faso; Domesticity; urbanization; housing; social housing; incremental; Sub/Saharan Africa; Africa; clusters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

We can either use this potential as an additional safety margin in structures or design structures with no passive reinforcement.<br/>The advancements in active structural health monitoring devices have opened further possibilities to validate the performance of this material. One such device is the Smart Aggregate (SA). Smart Aggregates are piezoceramic transducers capable of sending and receiving ultrasonic waves. From basic wave theory, we know that elastic waves capture the properties of the medium through which it propagates. We can use this phenomenon to study the damage inside UHPC. This is accomplished by studying the changes in velocity and peak amplitude of an elastic wave as it propagates through the loaded specimen.<br/>This thesis has two main objectives. First, a modified tension test is developed to determine the uniaxial-tensile behavior of UHPC specimen. Second, embedded smart aggregates are used to send and receive elastic waves inside the UHPC specimen subject to modified tension test and the wave parameters such as velocity and peak amplitude are studied. The propagation of elastic waves in UHPC specimen with steel fibres is understood from this experiment. A relationship is established between velocity of the elastic waves versus average strain and peak amplitude of the elastic waves versus average strain. The results obtained could serve as basic knowledge required to conduct elastic wave tomography.<br/>In short, this thesis explores the possibilities of using SA to detect damage in UHPC and whether it can be used as an additional safety measure in active structural health monitoring. Although the huge potential of Ultra-High-Performance Concrete is apparent, considerable effort is required before we can realize safe habitable structures using it.","UHPC; SA; Smart; Aggregates","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

However, due to cultural norms and ethical principles tied to death care, such innovation is not easy to introduce to the public. As a result, sustainable developments in the funeral industry, and literature based thereon, are still scarce. This study aims to address this research gap through an exploratory, quantitative research approach. Although these problems play at a global scale, this study focuses on the Dutch scenario, taking recent changes and current developments into account. Based on an analysis of the resource flows in current mainstream funeral alternatives, a comparison between the funeral and waste management industries is made. Whereas both fields of work have a lot in common on technical and logistical levels, their social aspects differ significantly. The waste management sector is not bound to nearly as many social factors, and is significantly further in the development and integration of sustainable systems that people use on a daily basis. Real-life examples of these new developments are analysed, to identify which factors played a prominent role in the social acceptance by its users, the public. In order to do so, a custom social acceptance framework for (quasi-)circular funeral technologies, based on pre-existing frameworks from different theoretical backgrounds for social acceptance in other contexts, is developed. The seven values of community, connectedness, family, cleanliness, trust, procedural fairness and attitude are identified as most influential in the contexts of composting municipal organic waste and the collection and sorting of MSW (Municipal Solid Waste). These values are then analysed in the context of death care literature, which allows for a comparison between both industries. With such varying cultural backgrounds to these technologies, social values in an acceptance framework are also bound to show plenty of differences. Interesting to note are the numerous similarities, reinforcing the initial assumption that the two industries are comparable. Based on the identified differences, ideas are conceptualised that implement aspects that should positively influence the introduction of sustainable waste management systems in the death care industry. These ideas, and other relevant developments in the industry, are discussed with various funeral experts. Different perspectives of these topics can be analysed through their unique backgrounds. With their feedback, the ideas are updated with experience and knowledge from within the field, which is used to develop two sets of recommendations. A key differentiation is made between sustainable funeral alternatives and (quasi-)circular funeral technologies. The recommendations provide a wide variety of approaches to increase the social acceptance of either two categories. Although there’s room for both developments at the same time, it is recommended that the overall social support for sustainability in the funeral industry is increased through the improvement of currently available alternatives, before novel (quasi-)circular technologies are ultimately introduced onto the market. The proposed suggestions represent a range of different approaches: from technological aspects, to digitalisation of services, and much more. In the end, it is important to realise that the selected funeral method is only responsible for a part of the total emissions related to the whole funeral ceremony. On a larger scale, one’s funeral is only a fraction of the emissions one creates in a lifetime. However, sustainable funerals can be a tool to provide a meaningful end to a personal quest of living more sustainably.","Funeral Industry; Death Care; Municipal Waste Management; Social Acceptance; Theoretical Framework; Circular Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From the city scale to the regional scale, group members are dedicated to various tasks. Hence, the personal focus on the technology - AI is framed by the context of Amsterdam Science Park and the governmental future project for the AI campus. The research initiated with the given conditions of the Science Park station and the future scenarios of both scientific community and neighbouring community. This had led to an investigation on the topic of ‘border/boundary’ condition that set be the existing infrastructure - train dike. This 6-meter high structure has currently posted some urban issues where it limits both communities and their potential growth in the entire region of Watergraafsmeer. Science Park as a technological and academic quarter of the city is deemed significant, however, the identity of the Science Park is being treated as the conventional technology parks in other cities that most of these parks do not closely participate in the daily life of the city. This problem is what the train dike has been causing the Amsterdam Science Park being over isolated (though its location is comparably closer to the city center). This urban analysis has opened up a lot of opportunities by allowing clear and flat urban penetration from both side of the communities and merge at the location of current train dike.

In reality, the soil properties of these layers are heterogeneous and spatially variable, making it difficult to properly deduct the engineering properties that are required in the design of geotechnical structures. This leads to uncertainty in the design. The probabilistic framework known as the random finite element method (RFEM) can take the spatial variability of soil properties into account in geotechnical designs in an effort to reduce the uncertainty. The spatial variability is represented by the mean, the standard deviation and the scale of fluctuation. The scale of fluctuation is defined as the distance in which a significant correlation is found within the soil properties and is related to the geological deposition of the soil layer. The calculated reliability of man-made structures, such as dykes, is the output of the RFEM and is influenced by the scales of fluctuation of the subsurface. Since many man-made structures in the Netherlands are constructed on soft soils, they cause deformations in the subsurface. These deformations change the geological layering of the soil. It is therefore expected that the deformations caused by man-made structures influence the scales of fluctuation and that the changed scales of fluctuation influence the calculated reliability of the man-made structures. The objective of this thesis is to research how the spatial variability of soft soils is influenced by man-made structures. To research this, a case study is undertaken at the Leendert de Boerspolder in the Netherlands. One-hundred cone penetration tests (CPTs) have been taken in an area of 15 by 50 meters in the polder as well as in the dyke as part of the research programme Reliable Dykes. From the cone resistance data of the CPTs the spatial variability of the area can be estimated. The case study is accompanied by two theoretical studies. The first study aims to estimate the effect of deformations on the spatial variability of generated random field data for different types of deformations. The second study of this thesis will provide the deformations that have occurred in the area of the case study from a plane-strain finite element analysis of the dyke and polder.<br/>The first part of the research focussed on four deformations that are often encountered in the proximity of a dyke: vertical compression, horizontal compression, simple shear and rotation. The effect of these deformations on the spatial variability has been studied by applying the deformations to three resolutions of random fields and then estimating the change in scales of fluctuation. Since no soil properties were assigned to the random fields, the results can only be used qualitatively. The research is then continued with the estimation of the spatial variability of the Leendert de Boerspolder. It was necessary to identify the soil layers first. These are a top peat layer, a clay layer which shows a transition from organic at the top to silty at the bottom, and a bottom peat layer. For each of the CPT lines parallel to the dyke the outliers of the cone resistance data were removed for the different soil layers and the depth trends were removed. This resulted in normalised cone resistance data from which the spatial variability in different directions could be estimated. Finally, a two-dimensional plane strain analysis of the soil layers at the Leendert de Boerspolder was made. In the first step of the analysis the depths of the soil layers are at the level before construction of the dyke. Then the dyke was constructed step-wise. This allowed the initial soil layers to deform as close as possible to the actual deformations under influence of the dyke. Finally, the following conclusions are made by combining the resulting deformations with the results of the other research. At the Leendert de Boerspolder, the spatial variability of the polder next to the dyke is not influenced by the dyke and can be used as the baseline spatial variability to which to compare the spatial variability in the proximity of the dyke. Underneath the crest a significant vertical compression causes both the vertical and horizontal scales of fluctuation to decrease, while a smaller amount causes a change in just the vertical scale of fluctuation. Underneath the slope and toe of the dyke, rotation increases the larger vertical scale of fluctuation and decreases the larger horizontal scale of fluctuation. Horizontal extension of the soft soil underneath the slope results in a larger horizontal scale of fluctuation. Horizontal compression underneath the toe results in a smaller horizontal scale of fluctuation.","spatial variability; random finite element method; scale of fluctuation; soft soil; Leendert de Boerspolder","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","52.213939, 4.599626"

The Earth’s rotational state and its interior are closely linked. The deformation of the body induced by a surface ice load depends on the local viscosity, while the adjustment of the equatorial bulge to the position perpendicular to the rotational axis depends on the average global viscosity of the body. Therefore, lateral viscosity variations could play a role in GIA-induced TPW. Here our goal is to extend an existing GIA model based on a finite element method (FEM) with a simulation for TPW (Hu et al., JGR 2017).<br/><br/>The model is based on FE software ABAQUS coupled to the solution of the Laplace equation. The perturbed gravitational potential is a function of the radial displacements. Therefore, an iterative process is required to solve for the displacements in the body. For the TPW algorithm we assume that during the process of TPW the equatorial bulge readjustment is fast enough such that the equatorial bulge is always nearly perpendicular to the rotational axis. In that case the linearized Liouville equation can be used by using coordinate transformations for each time step. This method allows for large-angle TPW and takes into account non-stationary surface loads with respect to the rotational axis. In the spin-up phase the flattening of the Earth is simulated by applying a centrifugal force for a long-enough duration. <br/><br/>We find that when the perturbed gravitational potential in the first time step is not fully converged, it affects the perturbed gravitational potential in future time steps and thus TPW. Furthermore, when a surface ice load is applied to the model, TPW is triggered. The centrifugal potential changes based on the new position of the rotational axis, and this also affects the perturbed gravitational potential for the following time steps. As a result, the perturbed gravitational potential and centrifugal potential cannot simultaneously for all time steps be iterated for using our TPW approach. Therefore, to be able to study the effect of lateral viscosity variations on GIA-induced TPW in the numerical model, the iteration between radial displacements and centrifugal potential needs to occur per time step.","true polar wander; glacial isostatic adjustment; numerical modeling; Earth observation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the beginning, the main objective was to gain a better understanding on the current situation of the organization around foresight activities, their barriers and challenges. The aim was to later develop a solution that could help them to overcome those challenges discovered and to have a more proactive attitude towards the future.<br/>Barco NV is a well-known technology company with a tradition as a hardware manufacturer. Barco is currently going through a digital transformation and counts on a renewed strategy that also considers customer centricity and business innovation as starting points for innovation as relevant as technology. However, in practice this is much more complex, and the firm is step by step evolving into that ideal. The company tends to end up focusing mostly in the short term. This happens, among other reasons, because of a lack of skills, a non-tangible or workable company vision, and the self-pressure on meeting their economic plans. This causes the proposition of short-term businesses and therefore limits the explorative attitude in the firm. To support in this challenge, the initial phase of the thesis was focused on gaining a better understanding on the current challenges in Barco around foresight activities. As such, literature study in corporate foresight and some of its methods like scenario planning was employed. In parallel, internal research based on interviews with Barco employees gave the first keys to discover the barriers that the firm was facing and the feeling towards them. Thanks to the research done and the insights gained in Barco, the focus was on defining and co-creating a workshop. This workshop would enable Barco teams to shape future scenarios and improve their foresight skills. However, due to certain events that were taking place in Barco, this solution couldn’t be pursued and a new opportunity emerged.<br/>The Scenario Creation workshop was upgraded into a theoretical framework, which was developed with the input of three technology corporates and the recommendations of two consultants. All these professionals had links and personal interest in topics around innovation, foresight, design thinking and strategy. This framework was created to support Barco in having a better and holistic understanding on the business context in which the firm operates and its surroundings. In this way, it will help them in anticipating to changes in the three horizons of innovation. At the same time, it brings a change in mindset where the validation of hypotheses about future innovations plays a crucial role by involving external experts and end users in the scenario creation process. Finally, it brings a better way to communicate innovation and to test future scenarios: externally, to get them challenged by experts, and internally, to create a shared language for innovation. The foresight framework is characterized for combining design thinking principles, like user-centeredness, iteration, validation, creativity, inspiration and abstract and concrete thinking, with deep knowledge in foresight activities and scenario planning.","Corporate foresight; Scenario planning; Ambidexterity; Organizational design; Transformation; Trends; Human-centered design; Learning attitude; Corporate culture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

On the other hand, building on the strength of the oil industry could enable a faster development of offshore floating wind turbine technologies (for use in deep and ultra-deep water oilfields), access to capital, political connections, global reach, and state of the art technical capabilities. Both the use of water injection to enhance oil recovery in suitable reservoirs and use of offshore wind technology to harness power are proven to be commercially and technically viable, each on its own. However, the integration of both systems has not been adequately investigated. This thesis investigates the potential of autonomous stand-alone wind-powered intermittent (fully wind powered, Scenario A) and cyclic water injection (wind and gas powered, Scenario B) schemes in offshore oilfields, specifically in heterogeneous layered oil reservoirs. The results obtained from analytical evaluations and numerical simulations of a 3D synthetic model demonstrates strong oil recovery performance, economic, and environmental feasibility, under modelled reservoir and economic conditions. Improved oil recovery is achieved by improved sweep of low permeable layers and previously poor swept areas. It is evident that reservoir performance favors the more intensive schemes (higher ratio off-injection period per cycle to the on-injection period per cycle and longer off-injection duration) with higher injection rates. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis for offshore oil field characteristics (distance separating injectors and host platform, reservoir heterogeneity, reservoir symmetry, vertical transmissibility, rock wettability, reservoir pressure, capillary pressure, and intermittent injection initiation time) is conducted. Wind-powered intermittent and cyclic injection schemes are economically feasible mainly in heterogeneous layered reservoirs. Offshore sites with superb wind power provides the highest internal rate of return (IRR) for the fully-wind powered scenario. Offshore Locations with relatively lower wind resource (down to good level of wind power potential) and favourable wind variability patterns can still achieve a higher net present value (NPV), yet at a lower IRR. As larger and more costly wind power systems is required to enhance the oil recovery. The economic and environmental benefits of wind-powered injection schemes is attributed to a higher energy efficiency (in terms of the number of crude oil barrels recovered per MWh), as well as a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, fuel costs, and power transmission costs. Both fully and partially wind-powered schemes are considered more economically favourable under higher oil price environment, lower weighted average cost of capital, longer distances separating host platform and injection wells, higher carbon tax and more stringent environmental conditions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the same time frame, information technologies have evolved from paper-based media to their latest and most powerful form of ubiqituous information on our screens and constant data traffic. As individuals we reap the benefits of these developments, but as a society we are facing new risks. In an age where information equals power, the few now control the many once more. Companies like Google and Facebook have the potential to curate and manipulate our world view, while simutaneously the constant proximity to news and digital interaction is creating a new indifference unheard of in previous generations. With social interaction moving into the abstract cloud, real-life interactions become increasingly valuable. It is therefore time to re-introduce the notion of offline participation into our daily lives not by creating a new institution or destination that is dependent on admiration, but by morphing and blending its physical aspect into other parts of infrastructure space, thus becoming part of it itself.

The physical spaces of our large transportation nodes have always been places of awe, while at the same time remaining cornerstones of society, making them the perfect place to latch on to. This way our space for public participation will be able to create a more open and transparant system that champions interactions between people. As a strategy it aims to attach the Forum typology to an urban commodity, solidifying its position and relevance.

At the same time, climate change is predicted to have a massive impact on water availability by drastically altering hydrological regimes across the globe. The development of a tool to monitor water productivity is part of the first objective of the Dutch government to increase water use efficiency in agriculture with 25% in the Dutch partner countries. Water Productivity is an indicator that links agricultural yield with the amount of water that had been consumed for its production (kg/m3). The FAO WaPOR (Water Productivity Open-access Portal) project, implemented by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), has been funded by Dutch Ministry of Foreign affairs and uses remote sensing data to monitor agricultural land- and water productivity throughout Africa and the Middle East. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs aims to have the FAO WaPOR data portal used as a tool to assist and provide policymakers with information needed to make policy decisions in a way that benefits and contributes to SDG 6. Furthermore, the data is supposed to be used for yearly reports in which progress of the projects that are funded with the Dutch developing aid budget are presented to the Dutch parliament. However, implementation of the FAO WaPOR data for monitoring has been a challenge due, among others, to the fact that both the use of satellite technology as well as the concept of water productivity are relatively new and still need time to embed in the current policymaking sector. In addition, it is not yet clear what information policymakers, such as the Dutch government and parliament, actually need to make good policy decisions with respect to SDG 6 and 2. In this additional thesis, the definition of Crop Water Productivity will be limited to the crop yield per unit of water evaporated that was used for its production in (kg/m3). The evaporated water is subsequently defined and limited to the amount of water that was brought in for irrigation purposes, the so-called blue water evaporation. A draft methodological note is proposed that includes guidelines on how to use and present the available information on FAO WaPOR data portal for results reporting and are complementary to the international frameworks and standards of SDG 6.4. A distinction was proposed between a so-called active and passive results. Passive results involve the investments made to enable policy and decision-makers with supporting tools (such as data provision) and capacity (building) to improve water use efficiency in agriculture. Active results directly contribute to improved water use in agriculture on the field level and can be quantified in terms of an increased percentage in water productivity. A final recommendation is given to invest in the partner countries that suffer from physical water scarcity, considering that the incentive to improve water productivity in those countries are much higher. Countries with physical water scarcity and are so-called partner countries of the Netherlands include, Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian Territories, Yemen and Sudan.","Water Productivity; Policy framework; Remote Sensing","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Prevailing applied N treatment technologies are mostly energy-intensive. This dilemma triggers a rethinking of the way to approach N management. “N2kWh-From pollutant to power” is a project that aims at creating an energy-positive 푁 treatment system by exploiting the energy potential stored in reduced N compounds. Both thermal and electrical energy needed in this scheme will be provided by Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) using the ammonia recovered from wastewater. To guarantee a proper function of the SOFC a minimum of 5 wt% of ammonia in the gas mixture is a prerequisite, whereas, the reject water of anaerobic digester only typically contains 0.15 wt%. Therefore, selectively stripping NH<sub>3</sub> in waste streams is the main technical bottleneck of this project.This study aims at contributing to the understanding of selective transport of NH<sub>3</sub> by pervaporation. A comprehensive literature study indicates silica-based ceramic membrane is able to perform this selective transport. Therefore, the task of this research was to test the feasibility of selective transport of NH<sub>3</sub> by commercially available silica-based pervaporation membranes (hydrophobic PDMS and hydrophilic Hybrid Si AR). The objective was to find the optimum operating condition for maximizing the selective transport of NH<sub>3</sub> by silica-based ceramic pervaporation membrane. To this end, the impact of flow regime (laminar and turbulent flow), temperature (35 <sup>o</sup>C and 45 <sup>o</sup>C), presence of additional salt (NaCl and Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) and TAN concentrations (total ammonium nitrogen; 1.5, 12.0 and 20.0 g TAN·L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively) was assessed through a series of systematic experiments.It was found that the PDMS membrane was unable to selectively transport NH<sub>3</sub> from liquid solution because both H<sub>2</sub>O and NH<sub>3</sub> are polar molecules while the hydrophobic PDMS was nonpolar. Besides, the PDMS membrane tested was not stable under solutions used in this study.The results of Hybrid Si pervaporation membrane showed that the optimum operating conditions for selective transport of NH<sub>3</sub> was 35 <sup>o</sup>C, Re=2,400, 20.0 g TAN·L<sup>-1</sup> ammonium bicarbonate solution (pH adjusted to 10). For these conditions, the highest perm-selectivity (ratio of mass transfer coefficients of NH<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O) was 0.5 indicting NH<sub>3</sub> was less selectively transported than H<sub>2</sub>O.The impact of flow regime on selective transport of NH<sub>3</sub> was related to polarization effects and depended on TAN concentration in feed solution. In the tested temperature and TAN concentration range, perm-selectivity was independent on both parameters. In addition, the effect of both temperature and TAN concentration on the ammonia was mainly due to the driving force, so their influence on the perm-selectivity was limited. Presence of salt seemed to have a positive impact on the perm-selectivity. Although salt has little impact on the mass transfer coefficient of NH<sub>3</sub>, it decreased the mass transfer of H<sub>2</sub>O resulting in a better selective transport of NH<sub>3</sub>.As for energy consumption, it was inversely related to TAN content. At the optimum operating condition 7 MJ·kg<sup>-1</sup> - N was consumed by pervaporation in this study. Compared with the energy consumption of air stripping, pervaporation is a promising technology for NH<sub>3</sub> recovery.","pervaporation; Ammonia stripping; ammonia recovery; Wastewater treatment; SOFC; Energy; Resource recovery; Hydrophilic pervaporation membrane; hydrophobic pervaporation membrane","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-31","","","","Civil Engineering","N2kWh-From pollutant to power",""

It is estimated that the world population will grow up to 10 billion people by 2050 with the majority living in cities. In Europe 80% of the population will live in cities by that time (Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, 2017). As more people will move into cities, the demand for food in cities will arise too. This means that somewhere else in the world natural landscapes have to be transformed into agriculture in order to feed us. Yet 73% of deforestation can be attributed to agriculture and deforestation is likely to continue with projected increases in food demand (Global Environmental Change 28). The UN report (Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, 2017) estimates that 70% more food need to be produced by 2050 to feed the expected 10 billion of world population. That is equal to 1 bn tones more wheat, rice and other cereals and 200 more tones of beef and other livestock. This is a very difficult to achieve because most available farmland is already being farmed and in ways that decrease its productivity and lead to soil erosion and water wasting. The aim of this research is not to solve this unsustainable global food system, but rather to make people aware of what is going on and how our food model has been transformed through decades. This will make people aware of the big impacts the controlled food system has on the climate, their food and therefore their health and even their wallet.The aim is also to make citizens able to grow their own fruits and vegetables and not to be 100% dependent on the unsustainable world’s food system. This is indirect a great step into changing our food model. This leads to the research question of this thesis which is:<br/>How can the architecture of a residential building create an active way for people to get involved in the food system again? In order to answer this question research studies have been made, including literature studies, plan analyses and site analysis. When people who share the same interest and fascination about food awareness will live at the same residential building or in the same neighborhood, they can share their knowledge and build up an sustainable urban environment with a sustainable food system. Due to this people can relate much better to their food.","Dutch Housing; Amsterdam; Food Production; Wintergardens; Vegetable gardens; Urban farming; Sustainability; Food awareness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Dwelling","","52.3604, 4.89957000000004"

Over the years many different algorithms have been developed and in Dutch practice actuated control is mostly used. Actuated control and other similar approaches apply variable green times to handle demand fluctuation, which leads to a reduction of the delay for vehicles in comparison to e.g. fixed-time control, however, in actuated control it is difficult to accurately predict control decisions. This study proposes a new traffic signal control algorithm that creates a planning of control decisions based on expected vehicle arrivals. By doing so, predictability of control decisions increases, while no sacrifices need to be made regarding the optimality of the control policy. Since certain errors such as inaccurate queue discharge rates are incorporated in the planning of control decisions, a second algorithm is required that adjusts the planning of control decisions to actual traffic conditions. Using an N65 case study intersection the performance of the new traffic signal control algorithm is compared to other algorithms. Depending on the availability of vehicle arrivals and the composition of traffic flows at the intersection, the new algorithm outperforms standard Dutch actuated traffic signal control in terms of overall delay by 3.1% to 4.7%. A range of improvement possibilities is suggested to ensure a greater reduction of the delay.","Traffic Signal Control; Planning of Control Decisions; Look-ahead Control; Time-to-green; Time-to-red; Signal Group-based Approach; Dynamic Programming; Objective Balancement; Adaptability, Predictability, Priority","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-08-01","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The scarcity of building materials and environmental awareness of the building industry generated a need for new techniques and developments, pushing architects and designers to increasingly turn towards biological and natural processes. Nonetheless, the related insight is still scattered, whereas the growth and development of new technologies are constantly accelerating. <br/>The urgent need for new, sustainable solutions is clearly visible in the Dutch housing market.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Children missing an upper limb face a wide range of issues. Besides the difficulties adult prosthetic users face, such as unsatisfactory function, comfort, and appearance, children also have to deal with the challenges associated with growth. The goal of this thesis was to design an appealing solution for these growing children with an upper limb deficiency. With the specific focus on accommodating the physical dimension changes, as well as their ever-changing tastes and preferences. To find solutions for these issues, a design process was started. Ideas were generated, which were narrowed down into 3 concepts, before the winning concept was further developed into the final design. Crucial aspects of the final design were then validated before finally the thesis work in its entirety was evaluated. The end result of the design process is the Frequently Replaceable Hand concept (FR Hand). Instead of replacing a prosthetic arm every 18 months, the arm is replaced every few months. This allows the arm to always be the right size and keep up with the changing demands of the growing user. For the concept to work, the prosthetic replacement process needs to become significantly easier, cheaper, and faster. In order to achieve this, two main parts were developed. First, a natural looking body-powered hand, which is 3D printed using a combination of flexible and rigid parts. The hand can be quickly and easily assembled without using any tools or fasteners. The 3D CAD (Computer Aided Design) model behind the FR Hand is designed from the ground up to be scalable. The hand’s dimensions are driven by 7 main independent variables. <br/>Second, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is developed. This allows the user or their family to generate a perfectly fitting prosthetic hand, without requiring any modeling experience or help from a professional. The resulting 3D model can then be sent to any 3D printing service to be printed and shipped to the user.<br/>Some of the most significant aspects of the FR Hand were validated. The durability of the flexible hinges was tested by cycling the hand 300,000 times, none of the hinges failed. The scalability of the CAD model was tested by generating 1320 hands based on randomized dimensions derived from an anthropometric database, the program was able to generate 96% of the hands without any errors. The hand prototype weighs 99 grams, has an actuation force of 14 Newton and a single finger can handle a tensile load of 157 Newton. The FR hand costs under €6 in material costs and can be delivered to the user for less than €100. In conclusion, the FR Hand is a functional prosthetic hand system that is aesthetically pleasing, always the right size and keeps up with the user’s preferences, which were the goals at the start of this project. Currently, the scalable forearm and socket interface to accompany the FR Hand are missing. Overall, the FR Hand is not ready yet to be deployed in the real world, more development and testing need to be conducted before this is a viable option for growing children missing an upper limb.","3D Printing; prosthesis; prosthetic; hand; children; growing; replaceable; upper limb; appealing; GUI; child; arm; trans radial; body powered","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-01","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The project concluded with a proposition that Deloitte could use to inspire potential clients. The proportion shows, how to shape a flourishing and rewarding relationship between chronic patients and GPs by using personal data.Deloitte is the largest professional service provider worldwide, they are aware that standing still is not an option. They are moving their business model towards an asset-enabled business and are adapting their strategy to their customer’s needs. One of Deloitte’s growth areas is Health. This graduation project will provide Deloitte with a new health proposition. The increase of chronic patients makes it hard for the health sector to meet the growing demand of care. A reliable solution is health tech. Care providers are working hard to find the best suitable health tech solutions for their problems. Besides the health providers, the government and the patients are also paying attention to it. Patients are getting more self-aware and are putting more effort into staying healthy with all the available resources. While the growing group of chronic patients embrace the personal data generated by health tech, the overworked GPs show distrust toward health tech. This different perception of personal data has an impact on the quality of the relationship. According to the qualitative research that was conducted, the impact of personal data is visible in the relationship between chronic patients and GPs. The main hurdles that influence the relationship are: 1. lack of knowledge on the trustworthiness of data sources, 2. lack of guidelines on how to share personal data and associated concerns, 3. complexity around data interpretation and 4. lack of support to enable a fruitful relationship between patients and doctors.The goal of the proposition is to shape a flourishing and rewarding relationship between chronic patients and their GPs, enhancing curiosity, enabling continuity and celebrating openness, and as such overcome those hurdles. The concept created for the proposition is ‘Meer’. This concept was created through multiple validation and conceptualization sessions. ‘Meer’ is a twofold digital application that creates an ecosystem both for chronic patients and GPs, including a shared view to use during consultations. Four different functionalities of the ecosystem are designed to overcome the four hurdles: 1. With ‘Meer’, chronic patients and GPs can explore the possibilities of devices and trackers to generate personal data by being exposed with a set of validated apps. 2. ‘Meer’ generates a better overview of the patient’s health data for GPs and patients by collecting all the personal data in one application that is easily accessible. 3. More frequent contact with chronic patients is established digitally. This results in the opportunity for GPs to validate new issues more often. 4. ‘Meer’ enables chronic patients to support GPs by generating the right personal data at the right time. In the end, ‘Meer’ strengthens the relationship between chronic patients and general practitioners. This enhanced relationship will lead to: Increased satisfaction and improved enablement &amp; compliance of medication for chronic patients; easier clinical decision making and easier reveal of psychological problems for GPs; and it will generate a therapeutic relationship for the chronic patient. This proposition shows how the four different hurdles in the relationship between general practitioners and chronic patients caused by the use of personal data can be solved by the concept ‘Meer’. The proposition is valid according to different partners of Deloitte and shows potential for the future of chronic patient care.","Health Tech; Health Care; Relationship Design; Proposition Design; Deloitte Digital","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

With the focus shifting from metals to composites for primary structures, USW process is seen as a fast, clean and efficient alternative for the conventional joining methods. Continuous Ultrasonic Welding (CUW) is an innovative, upscaled version of the USW process, where the weld is made over a moving part to create a weld line instead of a single spot. Currently, there has been very limited research done in this field and the technology is in very early stages. The key to success of this technology lies in creating a uniform weld of an acceptable lap shear strength (LSS). Recent research has suggested that using a woven mesh as an energy director (ED) at the interface provides a good uniformity along the weld line, along with an acceptable LSS value. The research shows how the mesh deforms prior to the melting process, creating an intimate contact between the adherends and how this has a positive effect on the weld uniformity. This study uses this data to design and manufacture a new ED that has these beneficial features incorporated in it. The study also uses an expanded mesh as an ED to study the effect of open areas in the weld uniformity. The EDs are used in the CUW process and compared based on their different features. Through this study, a deeper understanding of the behaviour of EDs during a CUW process is established which will be useful for developing new means of optimizing this process.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Wolterbeek, H.T. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Proton therapy efficiency can be described as the ratio between tumour and non-tumour dose, while the tumour receives the planned dose. This efficiency is limited by the energy deposition property of the proton. To enhance the efficiency beyond this physical limit, targeted nuclear reactions during proton therapy could be exploited. For this purpose the 11B(p,3a) reaction has<br/>been researched. The three alpha particles created have a high linear energy transfer (LET) and cause an increase in energy deposited at the reaction site. This reaction has a high cross section for low proton energies and protons have a low energy in the tumour area. Hence, proton 11B capture will more frequently occur in the tumour area, which can increase the tumour to non-tumour dose. Proton boron capture therapy (PBCT) has been studied, using Monte Carlo simulation and by conducting experiments, which suggested a 90 and 50% increase in energy deposited respectively. However, these results were contradicted by other research, stating the 11B(p,3a) reaction could<br/>not significantly increase energy deposited during proton therapy. This discussion formed the foundation of this thesis. Two Monte Carlo methods, MCNP6 and Geant4, were used to investigate the reproducibility of the results obtained in previous research. First, MCNP6 simulations were done, which did not result in significant dose increase for proton therapy. To investigate the reproducibility of MCNP6 a second Monte Carlo method, Geant4, was used. Geant4 simulations produced similar results to MCNP6, equally not reproducing the promising results of previous research. Neither Monte Carlo method included all possible reaction cross sections for alpha particle creation during PBCT. Therefore, a simple Boltzmann model was made to simulate proton and alpha particle transport, including these missing reaction cross sections. To simulate the effect of below 1 MeV proton boron capture, a non-dynamic Boltzmann model was used, which resulted in a non significant increase in alpha production during PBCT. Afterwards, an alpha-proton-alpha avalanche reaction was investigated. For the effects of this reaction to be investigated a dynamic Boltzmann model was used, which resulted in no significant increase in alpha production either. To investigate if the 11B(p,3a) reaction could cause the increase in cell death found by experimental work, the cell killing potential of each alpha particle created was calculated analytically. Using the alpha production rate from the non-dynamic model, this calculation resulted in ten cells killed per alpha particle created. The alpha particles created during PBCT have a track length similar to the size of one cell, therefore it is unlikely for an alpha particle to kill ten cell. None of the obtained results, provide evidence that the 11B(p,3a) reaction will enhance the efficiency of proton therapy. Thus, we hypothesize that the experimental results could be related to boron having a radio sensitizing effect on cells. To test this irradiating boronated cells with gamma rays is proposed as the next step for further research.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

Offshore wind generated electricity is currently one of the most promising sources of energy to create a sustainable global energy mix. The offshore wind industry has developed rapidly over the last years. The cumulative installed capacity shows an exponential growth. Monopiles remain the most popular substructure type of all installed substructures in Europe. This thesis focuses on calculation methods to evaluate the response of that foundation type.<br/><br/>The interaction between a monopile and soil is called soil-structure interaction (SSI). In the offshore wind industry, SSI is commonly modelled as a 1D local Winkler foundation with local nonlinear elastic springs to represent the lateral soil stiffness. The stiffness is often based on semi-empirical relations between the lateral displacement of the pile and the soil pressure (p-y method). This approach neglects the interaction effects between different soil layers and there are uncertainties regarding the validity of applying this method to large diameter, rigidly behaving, monopiles.<br/><br/>In this thesis, a 3D linear-elastic (LE) finite element (FE) model is used to compute 1D global (non-local) complex-valued dynamic soil stiffness, which captures the coupled 3D reactions of soil to the pile. The frequency dependence of local and non-local linear-elastic lateral, rotational and coupling dynamic soil stiffness is analysed for heterogeneous soil stratigraphy. The effect of different boundary conditions in the 3D model formulation to the frequency dependence of dynamic soil stiffness is analysed.<br/><br/>The complex-valued-frequency dependent dynamic soil stiffness kernels are approximated by frequency independent coefficient matrices for added mass, damping and stiffness. The performance of the coefficient matrices in terms of representing the complex-valued dynamic soil stiffness is analysed with cost functions. It was found that the dynamic soil stiffness can be approximated by frequency independent added mass, stiffness and damping coefficient matrices in the frequency range of interest for offshore wind.<br/><br/>A 1D Timoshenko beam model is developed in the frequency-domain and is discretised in space by Euler’s central finite difference method. The added mass, stiffness and damping matrices, which represent the non-local Winkler foundation, are incorporated in the model. The SSI response of the 1D model to the dynamic loading is compared with the response of the 3D LE FE model in the frequency domain.<br/><br/>As a last step, a superstructure and turbine are integrated with the monopile SSI model and the total integrated model is transferred to the time domain. Time domain computations are performed for free vibrations, harmonic loading and realistic aero-/hydrodynamic loading scenarios. The transformation into the time domain is important since it allows the user to incorporated nonlinear wave and wind loading and air-turbine interaction effects that are considered to have a major impact on the resulting dynamic system response. The developed time-domain model is computationally very efficient in predicting the time-domain SSI response of an offshore wind turbine for varying loading scenarios. <br","SSI; Dynamic soil stiffness; Non-local Winkler foundation; frequency dependence; monopile; Offshore wind turbine; Numerical Analysis; 1D Model; 3D linear-elastic finite elements model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-31","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(Demirkan, Spohrer, &amp; Welser, 2016; Svahn, Henfridsson, &amp; Yoo, 2009). While presenting numerous opportunities for organizations, digital technologies lowered the threshold in the market for new entrants. Therefore, change has become imperative for large organizations in order to survive. This profound and accelerating transformation of business activities, processes, competencies and models to fully leverage the changes and opportunities brought by digital technologies is called digital transformation (Demirkan, Spohrer, &amp; Welser, 2016). Digital transformation presents a novel and complex challenge for organizations regardless which industry they belong to. It is imperative for all the organizations to embrace the deep-rooted, never ending digital journey for their survival. However, going through this journey is not easy for organizations in highly competitive and rapidly changing business environments. Clearly, it is impossible for companies to respond to all the technological developments happening in the world. But how should the companies choose the right technology and how should they apply it? How can they reap the benefits of these technologies in favor of their organization and customers? On the other hand, brand, is an established concept in the literature. It is acknowledged by the literature that it could be a powerful tool for organizations in selecting, guiding and maintaining strategic directions for organizations (Mosmans &amp; van der Vorst, 1998). However, the role of an organization’s brand in digital transformation is not addressed in the literature. This literature gap formed the foundation of this graduation project and was executed in collaboration with Deloitte Digital, a creative digital consultancy which helps large organizations in their digital transformation journeys and striving for acquiring new capabilities and ways of thinking. Exploration of the brand identity of the large organizations in digital transformation and bridging the insights to Deloitte Digital context provided them a new perspective over the digital transformation projects. In order to be able to enable Deloitte Digital consultants in gaining and applying brand-aware perspective on digital transformation projects, “Digital Ambitions” workshops has designed. This workshop, aims to facilitate the creation of future vision and exploration of the possibilities in different domains of digital transformation. Finally, this study has contributed to the research domains of brand and digital transformation in bridging the gap between those by proposing links between them. Additionally, a new perspective for Deloitte Digital is provided that illustrates a competitive advantage in differentiating their approach towards the clients.","Digital transformation; Brand identity; Brand DNA; Vision; Workshop; Strategic Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this thesis a non-symmetrical column splice connection that uses a combination of bolted end-plate splice and cover plate splice is studied. End-plate column splice may interfere with installation of cladding elements and may interfere with architectural requirements. Proposed column splice provides a solution to the underlying issue with space optimization. Splice connections are modeled on Abaqus using solid elements. Based on the location in the building non-symmetrical column splice connections are classified as non-symmetrical corner splice connection and non-symmetrical intermediate splice connection. <br/><br/>Aim of this thesis is to study the structural behavior of non-symmetrical column splice connections with the aid of moment-rotation curves, individual component behavior and force distribution obtained from finite element analysis. A quasi-static analysis is conducted on software package Abaqus using dynamic explicit solver. In addition, an attempt is made to characterize the non-symmetrical column splice connection based on component method. Stiffness coefficients of end-plate in bending produced too high stiffness when used for hollow-section end-plate connection. A modified stiffness model for end-plate in bending and bolts in tension are considered for the component characterization of current connections. Effects of end-plate thickness, cover plate thickness and bolt edge distances on overall moment-rotation behavior and initial stiffness was studied.<br/><br/>Non-symmetrical column splice connections are studied under bending and tensile behavior. Due to uneven force distribution in the connection, torsion is noticed in bending cases of non-symmetrical corner splice and intermediate splice. Eurocode stiffness model for end-plate in bending and bolts in tension produced high stiffness compared to the results obtained from Abaqus. Stiffness was overestimated by at least 2 times. Whereas, acceptable values of initial rotational stiffness were obtained using modified stiffness model for end-plate in bending and bolts in tension. Increase in thickness of end-plate and cover plate had a positive effect on the resistance of non-symmetrical column splice connection. However, local failure in column cross-section was noticed when the thickness of end-plate and cover plate was 10 mm. Bolt distance from the column face and edge distance was varied. Overall resistance and initial rotational stiffness increased when the bolts were moved closer to the column face and the opposite was noticed when bolts were moved away from the column face. Similar behavior was also noticed in case bolts in end-plate were moved close to each other. <br/><br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Steel and Timber Construction","",""

CISS is an effect that causes spin polarisation to occur in currents that flow through chiral molecules, such as DNA. In this thesis, Helicene is chosen since it has a helical structure but it is also a relatively simple molecule to simulate. In the calculations the helicene is attached to two gold contacts via a sulfur atom on each side. Gold is chosen for its strong spin-orbit coupling, which is thought to cause the effect. The native Green's function transport calculation uncouples the spin-orbitals into their two spin directions, it essentially preforms the same calculation twice for both spin direction. Because the spin directions are treated separately this method neglects any interactions between electrons of different spin. Therefore no spin polarisation will arise in the absence of a magnetic field. The proposed method improves on this by accounting for the full spin-orbitals, and therefore their potential overlap with each other. Because the potential interactions between orbitals occupied by electrons of different spin, spin-flip interactions are taken into account in the Green's function when calculating the transmission of the Helicene. This then gives rise to potential spin polarisation in the current. Due to a lack of time and an overabundance of run-time errors in the FORTRAN code used to implement the proposed method in ADF 2019, no results could be obtained to confirm or deny this.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This leads to all kind of (societal) problems. Meanwhile, the value of cultural heritage is difficult to qualify and quantify in terms of economic benefits, which makes it hard to define the added value of cultural heritage and the value created by the adaptive re-use of cultural heritage. Consequently, cultural heritage is sometimes unnecessarily demolished or abandoned. This research therefore aims firstly, to identify the values of cultural heritage in general, to capture its unique and impossible to recreate identity. Secondly, this research aims to prove the indirect added economic value of transforming industrial cultural heritage into hubs of social and/or cultural integration within inner cities. By proving this added value for the neighbourhood, the awareness about the value of cultural heritage and hopefully the investments made in the adaptive re-use of cultural heritage will be increased. To identify the value of cultural heritage a qualitative approach is used following a value division made based on the literature study. This approach contained two explorative interviews and three semi-structured interviews. The perspective of five experts with a design, marketing and governmental background were compared. The interviews showed the different views on the value of cultural heritage within different working fields. To prove the added value of the adaptive reuse of cultural heritage a quantitative approach is used, the hedonic pricing method. The hedonic pricing method focusses on different characteristics of the building to determine the market value of the building based on a statistical model. The characteristics function as variables for the model. Based on previous research a variables list is defied as input to the hedonic pricing model. This method is used because it assumes that the difference in market value is caused by the difference in characteristics. By separating these characteristics, it can be determined if and how much impact one characteristic, in this case the proximity of transformed cultural heritage site, has on the market value. To do this four cases studies in Amsterdam are used, De Hallen, NDSM site, Pakhuis De Zwijger and the Westergasfabriek. Three out of the four case studies show a significant outcome. In the conclusion the answer to the first research question “What is the value of cultural heritage?” is given. It is concluded that cultural heritage is unique and irreplaceable, this creates its value. This value is recognised by people, mostly in an emotional and social context. However, the value of cultural heritage cannot be described in one sentence or in one value. The value of cultural heritage is plural and is partly subjective. A distinction is made between estimating the value of cultural heritage in price (economic value) and appreciating the value of cultural heritage in content (non-economic value). The adaptive re-use of cultural heritage has a positive impact on the market price of the cultural heritage buildings. But above all, the narrative of a building, the story behind the building, is the most important value of cultural heritage and separates it from new built. The narrative is an overarching concept that incorporates all the non-economic values, architectural, emotional and social. It is seen as a heritage premium above the normal market price of a building.<br/>The second main research question “What is the indirect added economic value of transforming industrial cultural heritage into hubs of social and cultural integration within cities?” is answered by comparing four heritage models per case study. Three main aspects can be concluded when proving the existence of a heritage premium with the use of a hedonic pricing model. First, in two of the four case studies a negative price premium is found before transformation. This is probably due to the poverty and construction before transformation of some buildings. Secondly, an overall pattern is observed where the highest heritage premium is not found directly next to the case study, but a few hundred meters away. This can be explained by the possibly nuisance that is caused by the activities of the case studies. Finally, an overall average price premium of 7.1% within a radius of 620-1290 meters was found in the three case studies that had a significant outcome. It can thus be concluded that the adaptive reuse of cultural heritage has a positive effect on the surrounding houses by creating an extra house price premium.","Cultural Heritage; Value; Economic valuation; Neighbourhood; Hedonic pricing model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

At the moment, Rijkswaterstaat experiences issues with defining the state and the residual life span of the stay cables of the <br/>Galecopperbrug. This study focuses on the technique of Acoustic Emission (AE) for monitoring the stay cables of the Galecopperbrug. The main research question of this study was: “Is the AE-system used in a fracture-based assessment suitable for structural health monitoring of the stay cables of the Galecopperbrug?”. In this study the following methods were used to investigate the AE behaviour of stay cables: a literature study on previous research and the current knowledge of AE and the structural behaviour of cables was done, a full-scale and two verification experiments were performed to investigate the AE behaviour related to wire breaks and to investigate the accuracy of linear source location techniques, an analytical model of the stay cables was made to investigate the influence of different parameters to the capacity of the stay cables and to predict the stress distribution in the wires during the experiment and finally, a SCIA model of the Galecopperbrug was used to investigate the load bearing distribution of the Galecopperbrug. In this study, it was found that wire breaks inside (stay) cables will generate elastic stress waves which can be captured and recorded by AE sensors. Based on an experiment where multiple wire breaks occurred, it was shown that wire breaks can be identified with the help of AE techniques. However, the identification of wire breaks is mainly depending on the correct choice of sensor type. Based on the experiments and assumptions that were made in this study the R6I-AST type of sensors are more suitable for wire break detection and the R3I-AST sensors are more suitable for AE signals due to impacts. Based on the assumptions and the experiments performed in this study it can be concluded that AE can be used in a fracture-based assessment for SHM of the stay cables of the Galecopperbrug.","Acoustic emission; Stay cables; Structural Health Monitoring (SHM); Cable stayed bridge; Experiment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

This leads to a need for more dense and complex building constructions, driven by the fact that people are living increasingly close to one another. These structures are often so large that it becomes difficult to navigate in the environment without any assistance. Especially for people with restricted mobility, such as wheelchair users, or the blind or partially sighted, it can pose a challenge to find the best path in a building. Consequently there is a need for navigation graphs that provide a way to structure connectivity information and routes in an indoor environment. Existing methods generally obtain information on the location of various rooms, corridors and their interconnectivity from 2D floor plans or 3D building models. However, these plans and models often were created by the architect when the building was planned, but never updated with new information after the building was built and came into use. Manually updating them is very labour-intensive. Therefore, in this research a method is developed for obtaining a navigation graph from an indoor environment by automatically extracting the information needed from a point cloud. The navigation graph is modelled according to the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard IndoorGML, which provides a basic structure for indoor navigation. The point clouds used in this research are gathered with a hand-held Mobile Laser Scanner (MLS), which also saves the path (trajectory) taken in the building. This all leads to the main research question: How can a navigation network in IndoorGML format automatically be extracted from a cluttered indoor point cloud and its trajectory? In order to answer this question this research focuses on the detection of doorways, and how they connect indoor spaces, such as rooms and corridors. A new way of door detection is proposed, which is based on the identification of walls using the 3D Medial Axis Transform (MAT) of the point cloud. After this it is explored how the established connectivity relationships can be extended with accessibility information, such as the location of stairs, and the dimensions of doors. Additionally it is researched how a more detailed navigation graph can be created by subdividing large spaces that have multiple connections. In this thesis it is proven that geometric input for a navigation graph can automatically be obtained from a point cloud. 100% of doors could be detected in the dataset that the methods were developed on, and when testing the methods on another point cloud, this number decreased to 70% , due to unforeseen situations. All spaces connected by detected doors, stairways and sloped surfaces were included in the graph, from which a more extensive navigation graph could be produced by subdividing corridors. This final product was compared to networks drawn by humans on a corresponding floor plan, from which it can be concluded that the graph produced by the methodology of this thesis is a good basis for a navigation.","indoor navigation; point cloud; IndoorGML; door detection; voxels; laser scanning; 3D Medial Axis Transform; navigation graph","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

The combination of these different factors makes it difficult to make a reliable estimation of the amount of wave overtopping. In the design new materials are used of which the effect on wave overtopping is unknown. The band width of the design is very narrow so an accurate prediction of the amount of overtopping in the prototype is necessary.

Microgrid offers substantial benefit such as high reliability, adaptive to disturbance, improved load and generation control and high utilization of renewable energy sources (RES). However, the utilization of renewable energy resources leads to a problem due to its intermittency of the generated power. The conventional solution to measure the intermittency problem, such as network expansion and electrical energy storage, require huge cost and complicated planning. Therefore, the utilization of thermostatically controlled become a more viable solution. Several forms of energies are involved in the industrial microgrid. The utilization of the various form of energies requires a platform that accommodates the co-simulation and data exchange of various models. The aim of this project is to observe the impact of a thermostatically controllable load to the energy saving and to offer a methodology that accommodates the co-simulation and data exchange of various components, such as microgrid network, boilers, and optimization algorithm. Several steps are required in order to achieve the project's goal. Firstly, a comprehensive literature study is conducted to determine the characteristic of the network that has to be modelled. Optimal power flow is used as the optimization algorithm in order to achieve the optimum operation of the system. The second step is performing a series of components modelling. The IEEE14 bus system is selected as a foundation of the network model. A separate boiler model is also developed since in the electrical domain, and it is modelled as a constant power load. A more detailed thermodynamic model is modelled for greater insights. Functional Mock-up Interface platform is used as a standard to accommodates the co-simulation between network model, boiler model, and optimization algorithm. The master code is developed to manage the simulation and data exchange of each component. Finally, a simulation of a different seasonal cycle is implemented to observe the performance of the system. Winter and summer season is chosen as the case scenario due to its different profile on the wind turbines power.","Microgrid; Co-simulation; Industrial Microgrid; Multi-energy System","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Amsterdam despite being one of the denser cities also faced this phenomenon. Today, Amsterdam is very desired by dwellers and it puts the city in a difficult situation. The city can’t expand outwards and need to densify within the city perimeters. However, with the design philosophy of the Compact City there are many attractive opportunities to make Amsterdam a better city through building more qualitative better spaces with high densities. The design proposal adds within a complex urban fabric two buildings that will help to create a new hotspot for development at the outer east side of the Golden Age city expansion area of the city of Amsterdam. The building aims for Young Urban Professionals, a group that stood at the beginning of the current revitalization of the city. There outgoing and ambitious lifestyle were the inspiration for a new typology. One that put its emphasis on the communal realm. For a group that must get their social interaction from friends this space is of most importance. The private realm is a micro-unit that through its design could remain small and pushes the density levels upwards. The building’s design is a combination of maximizing the potential build volume while still connecting to the urban fabric that it stands in. The facades extend the precious green structure that is present at the location and the facades merge with the brickwork found in the older buildings in the surrounding. Touches of the Amsterdam School are found back in the design and windows are designed to offer maximal flexibility of the floorplans inside. Between the load bearing walls that span 7,8 meters there are three variations possible. One that holds one 60m² apartment or in the case of this design with two times a 30m² micro-apartment or three times a 20m² micro-apartment. This flexibility will ensure that the building can adapt to any future changes that may occur and remain sustainable. The building has one of the highest standards of insulation and is detailed to be as airtight as possible to ensure a minimized loss of energy. The CO2 controlled mechanical ventilation system with heat recovery, hot and cold geothermal storage, and a dry system floor heating all ensure maximal comfort with minimal energy.","Compact City; Micro Appartments; Flexibility; Young Urban Professionals; YUP; Amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Dwelling","Between Standards and Ideals","52.366909, 4.923985"

At the outset of an emergency, limited resource and time create large planning uncertainties and current refugee sites’ assessments based on field visit are no longer adequate. The selection of unsuitable locations triggers a number of issues such as environmental degradation, competition for scarce resources and, exploitation of water sources. These can be reduced through a rational refugee allocation decision process. The question that arises is, can the refugee allocation process be supported by a structured decision-making (SDM) approach and more specifically, by a portfolio decision analysis (PDA) model? Focusing on water security criteria, this study presents the initial phases of the SDM-approach intended to ensure a more sustainable allocation of newly-arrived refugees among new and/or existing hosing sites. To this end, a procedural tool for supporting WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) officers in the site assessment is proposed. This was obtained based on 15 semi-structured interviews and questionnaires carried out in a global stakeholder environment, in order to make the SDM framework applicable to other settings. <br/>The generic procedural tool was tested in a case-study in south-western Uganda by applying a portfolio decision analysis model. Local and global data were combined with stakeholder preferences to predict the performance of diverse sets of alternatives. The latter were generated according to different combinations of numbers of refugees, hosting locations and percentage of water extracted from surface water, groundwater and rain water. To identify efficient portfolios, we used the Robust Portfolio Modelling - Decisions software. Results showed that overlooked solutions outperforms over the current allocation strategy. In specific, the scatter of newly arrived refugees showed the highest scores on availability of water, socio-economic costs and host communities' advantages. The proposed framework provides also options for the optimal repartition of the future water extraction among available water sources, aiming to avoid their depletion while preserving sustainable costs of the water services.<br","Portfolio Decision Analysis model; Water Security; Refugees; Structured decision-making approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Whereas new buildings are already mostly able to achieve a high energy efficiency the biggest potential for CO2 reductions lies in retrofitting the existing housing stock. Yet current interventions aimed at retrofitting our built environment often seem to remain below their expectations. Actual solid evidence on their performance is scarce and inaccurate. One reason for the lack of information is seemingly the rather simplified and therfore inadequate approach to generate feedback.

This unlocks a lot of new opportunities and abilities, but also results into big societal and behavioural changes, which need to be addressed in our built environment. Architecture seems to have disappeared on the background, while technological advancements appear to dominate the field. As a result, a representation of the human dimension lacks in our cities and buildings, risking alienation of our settings. Meanwhile, the digitised city drives our mental capacity to an extreme by firing an abundance of stimuli upon us in a velocity that keeps accelerating and intensifying. There is a need to retrieve answers to the emerging design themes in order to meet the demand of human centred architecture in a digitised era. This quest pictures different other dimensions that should be considered, but simultaneously can reinforce the character of an architecture appropriate to a digitised era, resulting in an embodiment of a new zeitgeist. Main discussion points within the debate are: creating human awareness, offering solutions for cyber criminality, allowing technological development to be more democratic, avoid an excess of overexposure from our environments, fusing globalisation with our different local settings and finding the right design tools and methods to approach architectural representation interlaced with digital systems. It is important to keep in mind that the human should stay at the focal point of design at all times and not the machine. Technique should be seen as nothing more than a prosthesis of the human body, it should be restricted - by all means - to take over human functioning. We need to provide open systems and not define everything by algorithms. In this way we can make way for the plurality of human development through creativity and have a stronger interaction between human and machine. In the end the networked systems can behave, together with the city, as an organism that is open to evolve in any direction, based upon the gathering of data. By realising our potential human influence we can have impact upon the network, through manipulating or hacking it towards our own benefits.","architecture; digitisation; innovation center; mental health; environmental psychology; Sense of Place; globalisation; democracy; digital representation; awareness; blackbox; automated landscape; human dimension; Cyber Security; Transformation; heritage; hybridisation; honourable mention","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","",""

Therefore, the prototype applies an integral of these techniques, so that the food waste generated by restaurants can be recycled to provide biogas for the stoves, to generate electricity to power equipment for the building and the greenhouse, and to leave fertilizer and compost for the plants in the greenhouse. In varied circumstances, this modular prototype has the possibility to duplicate and grow according to different system boundaries.

A custom test setup was designed and manufactured to test the sawing parameters in 8 experiments, with 2 to 9 experimental conditions tested in each, where a particle counter was used to determine the production of aerosol particles while varying the 5 chosen parameters. Results showed that the number of counted particles was highest with higher saw blade frequencies, lower saw blade contact loads, in dry completely skeletonised bone compared to fresh bone, and using an electrical oscillating saw compared to hand-sawing. Under all conditions, the high amount of aerosol counted posed potential health risks. The tested external ventilation system was adequate in removing the produced number of particles, but these high-tech systems are not always available in developing countries or emergency situations. In conclusion, the production of aerosols can be reduced by optimising the sawing parameters. However, even the lowest number of aerosol particles counted during the current study was high enough to cause potential health risks to practitioners. Safety precautions should be taken, such as external ventilation, proper breathing gear, and adequate protocols, to truly minimise the risk in all bone sawing scenarios.","aerosol; sawing parameters; pathology; biosafety; autopsy; bone dust","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

This has attracted the industries and universities making it a very important topic of research. The basic function of the autonomous vehicle boils down to transporting its passenger safety from door to door. This requires planning of a path that is obstacle free. Currently, sampling-based methods are widely used for path planning. Although these methods are proving to be successful in open environments, they are inefficient in heterogeneous environments. Planning in urban environments would be successful if this obstacle is tackled. In the current literature, it was found that there are many methods which focus on solving the path planning problem while planning around the obstruction, while there are other methods that focus on converging to optimal solutions. Hence, there is a need for methods that would plan optimal paths in heterogeneous environments. This thesis introduced a combined approach that shares elements of planning paths around obstacles and optimal path planning which are provided by the algorithms Adaptive RRT and Informed RRT* respectively. These methods are combined along with a Dubin’s motion model to simulate basic vehicle’s constraints. The proposed approach was compared with state of the art methods like RRT* to evaluate its performance via simulation. The simulation was carried out in three different scenarios with variable complexity depending upon the available free configuration space. The ability to find a solution and converge it were evaluated, an improvement of 50% was noticed in finding the initial solution and around 25% improvement was seen in convergence. This concluded that such a hybrid approach could be an important contribution to urban path planning.","Motion Planning; Autonomous driving; Algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

It is desired to objectively measure expertise earlier and more frequently in training to monitor the progress of the student. However, it is currently unknown which objective measures might describe the expertise level of an ATCo. This paper presents a method that identifies a set of objective measures that can classify an ATCo's expertise level using a genetic algorithm and hierarchical agglomerative clustering. A large set of possible objective measures and a dataset containing data from 10 ATCos (intermediate and pro level) is used. The method found a set of 8 measures that can cluster the 10 ATCo's in the two expertise groups very accurately (97,5% accuracy). The genetic algorithm showed a preference for measures that have a distinction in the results between the expertise groups. However, not all selected measures show a difference between the expertise groups, resulting in signs of overfitting. Furthermore, these measures only provided limited feedback for the individual ATCos. Clustering the results of the 10 ATCo's gave valuable information about the overall expertise level of an ATCo, as compared to the average intermediate- or pro-ATCo.","Air traffic control; proficiency; expertise level; machine learning; genetic algorithm; hierarchical agglomerative clustering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-01-29","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Islands are perfect living laboratories, because of their clearly defined boundaries and vulnerability to external factors. In this graduation Project, Ilha de Paquetá in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is taken as a case study. It suffers from the external pollution of the Guanabara Bay in both ecological and economic terms (due to a tourism decline), but the island’s metabolism itself is as linear as the system that causes the bay pollution. For successful implementation of circular interventions, a system-level perspective, based on a Material Flow Analysis for energy, water and materials, is combined with a hyper-local and pragmatic approach to get a real ‘sense of place’. The result is, firstly, a long-term strategy for Paquetá to improve the environmental state of the island. And, secondly, an architectural design for a beach pool that forms an alternative for the polluted beaches to enhance tourism. The pool regenerates and utilizes polluted bay water, purified via the wetlands that are integrated part of the design. The impact of the building on the island’s metabolism lies in the integration of a biodigester to reduce the organic waste outflow, and value to the local society and culture is added with adjacent spaces that accommodate room for community events and small-scale, conscious tourism. This way, the project shows how the Circular Economy system-level perspective can be combined with a hyper-local and pragmatic approach to achieve social inclusion.","Circular Economy; social inclusion; Sense of Place; Material Flow Analysis; Guanabara bay; Brazil; community; island","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","-22.75583031 -43.105332912"

In search hereof, an attempt is made to describe the thrust surface; a geometrical representation of the in-plane force trajectories through a structure. There exists a well-known relation between the parabolic shape of a (two-dimensional) catenary and the moment line of a simply-supported beam subjected to a distributed load, a relation which is similar to the three-dimensional case of shell structures. In this thesis, this relation is further exploited in the creation of various shell structures, using the moment hill of various simple plate cases. The moment hills of twistless plates as shell structures pose promising results with respect to shell-like behaviour. In the process of generating shell structures from moment hills of twistless plates, establishing the correct boundary conditions has proven to be essential in obtaining shell geometry with maximum shell-like behaviour. The Airy stress function is utilised to get further insight into the mechanical behaviour of shells. Exploiting the reciprocal relation between this Airy stress function and the diagram of forces allowed for both the design and analysis of shells. Taking the reciprocal figure of a discretised version of the Airy stress function results in a force polyhedron which by nature is in equilibrium. It was proven that the rules of graphic statics apply here, the angular defect between two planes then act as force vectors. By means of the force polyhedron a distinction can be made between tensile and compressive forces through any structure. Calculating the angular defect in an edge of the Airy stress polyhedron results in the force through its corresponding edge in its reciprocal figure. This thesis proposes multiple parametric tools with which the reciprocal figure of any Airy stress function can be created. These tools provide insight in the structural behaviour of a shell structure, and aid in the design of shells in the preliminary design stage.","Shell Structures; Airy stress function; moment hill; reciprocal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

Flexibility in wings is widely used by natural flyers to increase the aerodynamic performance. The influence of wing flexibility on the flow can be computed using numerical analysis with Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI). However, there is a lack of open-source FSI methods. Therefore, a new implementation is developed for the well-known CFD code OpenFOAM to facilitate FSI with the multi-physics coupling library preCICE. The OpenFOAM adapter does not require changes to the OpenFOAM source code and is compatible with a variety of OpenFOAM versions. Structural modelling is performed using the open-source code CalculiX.<br/> <br/>The method is validated using the laminar incompressible cylinder-with-a-flap benchmark for one steady and two unsteady cases. Good coherence is seen for the deflection and force generation, but the coupled method is sensitive to the eigenmodes of the structural model. <br/><br/>The influence of inertial, elastic and aerodynamic forces is quantified using a 2D wing. A sinusoidal flapping motion is imposed on the leading edge of the vertical wing. The inertial force on the wing dominates for high mass ratios and the wing deflection is rather independent of the flow. For a low mass ratio, the wing deformation scales with the increasing elasticity. The maximum lift and lowest drag were found for the wing with large flexibility and low mass so the passive deformation by aerodynamic forces creates a favourable shape for lift production. <br/><br/>Flexible translating and revolving wings at an angle of attack of 45deg show that chordwise flexibility decreases both lift and drag, however the lift over drag ratio is increased. The flow around both wings forms a coherent structure with a Root Vortex (RV), Tip Vortex (TV), Leading Edge Vortex (LEV) and Trailing Edge Vortex (TEV). The LEV on the revolving wing is stable for approximately up to half the span because vorticity is transported outward in the vortex core. The flowfield and LEV breakdown are consistent with experimental data of the same wing. The translating wing builds up circulation but the LEV detaches quickly near the centre of the wing. Chordwise bending reduces the angle of attack which decreases the distance to the core of the shed LEVs.<br","Fluid Structure Interaction; OpenFOAM; preCICE; CalculiX; Flapping Wing; Open-source","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This thesis focuses on the automation of a key step in the problem formulation for MDAO systems: the execution process definition, i.e. the order and grouping of the disciplines. Several sequencing and decomposition algorithms are developed to optimize the execution order of the disciplines and their division over multiple processors for parallel execution. The algorithms are verified and validated on thousands of MDAO systems using a scalable mathematical test case. Furthermore, the conceptual design of a conventional aircraft is performed using a novel implementation of the Initiator toolbox in KADMOS to test the algorithms in a realistic aircraft design problem. This showed that the algorithms resulted in a setup time reduction due to the automation of the execution process formulation and a reduced convergence time thanks to the improved usage of computational resources.","Multidisciplinary Design Optimization; Aircraft design; Sequencing; Decomposition; KADMOS; AGILE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

When researching the current city center, it became clear that the historical structures of the city cannot cope with the growth of the city. In the past there was space for water, green and heritage, however traffic and people are taking over now. This results in a city that has to deal with a big societal water problem of floods, shortages and pollution. In the past people lived in harmony with nature and appreciated the value of water. Nowadays people mainly experience the negative impact of water, causing a decline in the awareness of the value of water. Besides this, due to extreme urbanization, there is no place of escape from this bustling city. No place where people can hide from time and the daily routine. This leads to a design strategy with different scales of impact. First, it focuses on the scale of personal nourishment. With the design of a bathhouse, people are able to experience the benefits of a sustainable future in which we live with clean water and at the same time have the opportunity to escape and take a moment for cleansing both body and mind. Secondly, the design is a reinterpretation of the water cycle. This includes an ecological water system, based on the reuse of water through recycling, reducing the amount of new fresh water. This ensures a future with water and as well as having a positive impact on the current urban water structure. The project location, Jalan Braga nr. 43, is situated in the middle of the historical city. The building, constructed around 1915, makes the connection between the bustling shopping street, Jalan Braga and an enclosed garden adjacent to the Cikapundung river and the Kampung. It harbours water traces of flooding and historical water systems. This challenging site fits into the ambition of the project and has the power to create a showcase for similar circumstances in the world. The program of the building forms a circle of moments of escape, a transition from stress to mental and physical rest. The design of the building responds to the old heritage structures. It uses and strengthens the values of the different parts of the existing building. Each part contains another moment of escape. The circulation of the program is connected to the waterflow of the treatment system, which runs through the entire building. The commercial part of the building, connected to Jalan Braga, will host a teahouse to sit down and have a drink. It also contains the first part of the ecological water filter system. The in-between part, the node, makes the connection with the remainder of the building and offers a place to breathe. Spaces that can be used for yoga to find your physical rest. Besides this it forms the collector of rain as an important part of the ecological water system. The part of the building adjacent to the river hosts the bathhouse for men and women to let people experience the benefits of the filtered water. The bathhouse is built upon the old robust walls which enclose the garden. This enclosed garden, taman tertutup, offers a place in which you can escape and discover the last part of the water system, the constructed wetlands. Based on the vision of seeing shared heritage as an inspirator for a sustainable future, every intervention highlights cultural values. Values which are enhanced in the design by the use of the elements of water, green and light. These elements, the tools of awareness for shared heritage, guide you through the building and inspire how we can adapt heritage buildings for a sustainable future, in which we can live with water. Take time, escape and become aware of the eternal future of water.","Heritage & Architecture; Indonesia; Sustainabilty; Cultural Value; Water; Escapism; Teahouse; Bathhouse; Ecology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","Shared Heritage Studio","-6.918056, 107.609556"

For this purpose the realistic design ofa 8 MW OWT is considered as ideally located in a layered, non-liqueable site off the coast of Japan. This choice allowed to employ available site characterisation and seismic records from the well-known Japanese KiK-net. Modelling highlights are reported about the development of a dynamic, fully 3D FE model, in which the soil is described as a water-saturated elasto-plastic medium. The well-established SANISAND bounding surface formulation is adopted to reproduce the hydro-mechanical cyclic response of coarse-grained materials at the site considered, with model parameters derived via back-analysis of available seismic records. The seismic performance of the OWT is studied in relation to real seismic input of different intensity, accounting for the effect of combined horizontal and vertical components. Although in a non-liqueable site, pore pressure effects are clearly visible in the simulation results and affect the observed interaction between soil and foundation. The likely coexistence of seismic and SLS wind/wave loading is also considered for completeness. The numerical study leads to some interesting conclusions regarding the interaction between monopile head stiffness and seismic/cyclic soil response, and its impact on the motion and strength mobilisation along the OWT structure. In particular, some fundamental dierences between the dynamics induced by wind/wave loading and seismic input are put in evidence.<br/>More generally, it is also shown how existing analysis approaches developed in the context of earthquake geotechnical engineering prove still suitable to support modern offshore wind developments in seismically active regions.","Offshore; Wind Turbine; Earthquake; Dynamics; Soil-structure interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

The complex was built in 1981 and consists of 64 hectares of land. The complex is surround by a green belt where also the former psychiatric center was located. The AMC can be seen as a stand-alone city, with daily facilities, the hospital, the university en its big variety of users. The characteristic feature of the AMC monolith, that it manifests itself as an inner city, with large streets and squares and a wide range of facilities, is why it can be compared to a big city as Amsterdam. Where life takes place inside the city. As a result, the AMC has never been built with a connection to its surroundings and is there no connection with the new park to be built near the main entrance. <br/><br/>The main entrance is an unclear element from the parking space and also creates a certain boundary between inside and outside. When patients, employees, visitors and students enter the AMC through the main entrance, they enter the city through a dark, depressed corridor, which makes people feel even more inclined to feel ill. In particular, a hospital such as the AMC should contribute to the well-being of its patients and inhabitants.<br/>Climate change is an important point of attention for the whole world. Especially in big cities as Amsterdam, which is one of the most polluted cities in the Netherlands. Global warming is dangerous for the living environment in the cities and are in densely populated cities as Amsterdam a real thread and is one of the greatest effects of climate change. <br/><br/>A second problem is the disappearance of greenery in the city, and the increasing air pollution. Nature, such as parks, shrubs, plants and trees (green) can contribute to creating a healthier living environment in the city. But instead of more green being realised in the city, it disappears by the fact that cities are getting overcrowded. In the past centuries parks were built to enhance the urban climate. Meanwhile the urban ground is developed in such a high density, and the costs for sites have risen so quickly that (new) parks are very rare in the urban structure. Urban parks disappear and they are transformed into “stamp” parks. The result: the city becomes more and more polluted and gets warmer. <br/><br/>This report attempts to evaluate the positive effects of integration of nature on building scale. Research shows that green/nature can filter this air pollution and make a positive contribution to counteracting the rising temperature. The integration of a green façade and green roof in the built environment can play an important role in this. The green elements have besides an esthetically value, also psychological and energetic benefits. When these elements are designed correctly, the building can contribute to a healthier living environment.<br","AMC; AMC Amsterdam; Hospital; Netherlands; Green; Green facade; Nature; Biophilic; Green roof; Roof garden; Effects; Health risks; Air pollution; Energy consumption; Urban Heat Island; Heat stress; Park; Renovation; Entrance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Intecture","AMC Renovation | AMC Hospital","52.301067,4.9529164"

The theme of the studio fell into the frame “constructing the commons”, which focused on the everyday life and everydayness of space. The design studio laid stress on two repeating loops as central approaches towards design. The loop of research and design emphasised that research and practice not be a single-direction linear development, but an interacting circle throughout the whole production of design. The loop between present and abstract underlined that students each explored their topical focus from a particular urban condition and in return projecting their studies on the selected themes to the sites throughout a concrete design. My graduation project was primarily constructed on these methods. The project started from micro-scoped field research into the ad hoc interventions and the underlying negotiations between different entities in the built environment. Inspired by the findings from field research, at the abstract level, I narrowed down my focus onto embracing the complexity of the built environment and changes over time. Finally, I projected the cognitive discoveries into practice by the transformation of Abattoir, the abandoned slaughterhouse of Casablanca, into a culture park. Reflecting on the spatial features of current Abattoir and those of its future visions, I intended to bring “Lightness“ into the project. The project consisted of two-part, a masterplan design and two pilot projects. The masterplan design followed a layering approach. Through adding two additional layers and manipulating on the relationships between layers, I reflected on the enclaves of Abattoir.

Their typical layout and structure, the way they occupy the landscape, the materials and their age define the new role and character they will inherit. The intention was to convert the derelict Ghost Estates into vital machines for communality. Architecture by its use, adapts to the users, and as it belongs and originates to the society, therefore should evolve corresponding to future needs. The chosen example is a cluster of 10 unfinished structures, that lie close to the twin towns of Ballybofey and Stranorlar and to the forthcoming Atlantic Corridor. Their position leads to the creation of a new subcenter, proposing a new landscape and a more densified future to this area. The proposed function is the one of the Market, a use and a public space that dates back in Irish history, evaluating the former way cities were structured and operate. Assuming that a ruin exists “between the not-yet and the no-longer”, the appropriation of the ghost estates breaks this condition, creating a new future, a function and an architectural language that has to correspond, to interfere and evolve the existing reality.","Ghost Estates; contemporary ruin; Market; Ireland; Occupation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","The Berlage Post-MSc in Architecture and Urban Design","","54.795849, -7.771637"

It is at its core an exploration of how design is used to provide a powerful and coherent image of the state through the representation of the most fundamental and controversial of institutions: police.<br/>The police station is interpreted here as the center of a system of state representation, the place where civilians, officers, detainees and solicitors converge, positioning n at the intersection of state order and architectural order.<br/>The project focuses on the Garda Siochana, the sole police force in the Republic of Ireland. In the context of the Project Ireland 2040 the Irish government plans to increase the Garda presence over the country, focusing specifically on rural areas. The plan includes the refurbishment, expansion and construction of more than 30 Garda stations. A policeman, in this rural context, is a common fixture, a part of the local landscape, the butt of a popular joke. Not a semi-divine representation of the state, nor a troubled urban detective, a policeman is here part of the local society together with the postman, the butcher, the pub owner. It is this specific condition that allows for a reconsideration of police architecture not as one defined by the idea of control, or even intimidation, but one characterized fundamentally by reassurance.<br/>This reality opens the possibility for rethinking the role of police on the Irish territory, proposing an architectural language embedded in the rural irish context, consisting of an encounter between the classical order and elements of the local vernacular.<br/>This critical reconsideration projected outwards by the facade of the police station and the moments of exchange it enacts, and inwards, through the design of interrelating spaces that underpin the practice of policing.<br/>“The police are the public and the public are the police” is stated in the Peelian principles, the founding document of Irish police. It is the adherence to this principle that leads to a design for police that is not based on grandiose architectural gestures, but on a careful reconsideration of the relationship between the vernacular and the classic, the relatable and the impressive, the public and the policeman.","police station; ireland; police; order; the highway and the country","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","The Berlage Post-MSc in Architecture and Urban Design","",""

The physical effect behind the early stall behaviour of the rudder is still unknown. It is indicated that a part of the decrease in stall angle, a couple of degrees, is caused by the influence of the keel, when the disturbance passes on the low pressure side of the rudder. The hull is responsible for the remaining decrease. The CFD data indicates an influence of the vorticity of the keel and the boundary of the hull to cause a disturbance on the rudder. <br/>Further research in necessary to clarify the results found in this study. <br","Sailing yacht; CFD simulations; NUMECA; Towing tank experiments; Rudder; Keel; wake","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

It can provide an exponential speedup compared to classical computers in many computational problems, including simulations of general quantum mechanical systems, pattern finding and solving linear systems. Quantum computations can be performed by making use of qubits and performing operations, called gates, on them. A physical realisation of a qubit will be faulty, and to combat the errors that will inadvertently but unavoidably occur, the use of a quantum error correction code (QECC) is needed. A QECC is able to correct static errors; errors that occur on the states. However, it can not correct errors that occur on and during the operations. To make the computer resilient to these errors, the implementation of the QECC has to be performed fault-tolerantly. A fault-tolerant implementation of a quantum operation is designed in such a way that errors that happen during the operation, through faulty gates, do not propagate to errors on the states that are not correctable any more by the QECC. Hence, error propagation is a key concept in fault-tolerance. Every element of a general quantum circuit needs to be designed fault-tolerant. One of the elements that will be needed in any realistic quantum computer architecture is the possibility of exchanging the states of two qubits, so that an arbitrary pair of qubits can be brought physically close, allowing the implementation of multi-qubit gates. Exchanging the states of two qubits can be performed by a fault-tolerant SWAP gate, that makes use of one ancilla qubit. In this thesis, a fault-tolerant SWAP operation is implemented on the IBM 5-qubit ‘Tenerife’ device. It is characterized as a quantum channel by performing quantum process tomography (QPT). The CPTP constraints of quantum channels in the framework of QPT are discussed and a method of obtaining a CPTP estimate of an initial QPT reconstruction is given. The error process of the fault-tolerant SWAP is analysed and subsequently compared to a normal implementation of the SWAP gate, on which tomography is performed as well. The main measure that is used in the comparison is the ratio r of multi-qubit errors (or correlated) to single-qubit (or uncorrelated) errors in the two implementations. SPAM errors are an important source of estimated infidelity. To filter these SPAM errors and obtain a better estimate of only the circuits, SPAM errors are approximated to be only measurement errors. The errors are characterized by performing tomography on an arbitrary short identity channel, and subsequently using this as an estimate of the measurement error map. This gives a method to estimate a representation of the circuit itself. We can report on an error ratio r of 0.170±0.0029 for the fault-tolerant SWAP operation and an error ratio r of 1.256 ± 0.0129 for the non-fault-tolerant SWAP operation. However, the total error in the fault-tolerant SWAP is much higher, resulting in a process fidelity Fp = 0.608 for the fault-tolerant implementation and Fp = 0.742 for the normal implementation. This is due to the larger number of gates in the fault-tolerant circuit. This research shows that a SWAP operation can be implemented fault-tolerantly, but that the error rates of the devices need to be reduced before their use becomes viable.","Quantum Computing; Quantum Error Correction; Fault-tolerance; Quantum Process Tomography","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study focusses on the exchange of water and sediment between the North Sea and the Wadden Sea through Ameland Inlet. Based on a combination of field observations from the extensive 40 days Kustgenese2.0/SEAWAD field campaign in fall 2017 and Delft3D modelling results, the flow conditions are explained and the contribution of different forcing mechanisms is unravelled. Residual flows and sediment transport at the ebb-tidal delta were found nonstationary due to the action of waves, but also due to local wind-shear stresses. The wind-driven exchange with neighbouring basins over the tidal watersheds leads to significant residual flows through Ameland Inlet, which increases the importance of wind for the system functioning. The many shallow areas and the orientation of the system in relation to the prevailing wind direction for strong winds are believed to make wind forcing as important as observed around Ameland Inlet.","tidal inlet system; Ameland Inlet; sediment transport; wind-driven flows; watersheds; Wadden Sea; SEAWAD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

As a result, the art of driving has become a control task with a strong supervisory character, including the common human factor issues. Haptic Shared Control has been shown to be useful in keeping the driver in-the-loop by providing continuous haptic guidance on the steering wheel. Nonetheless, it has been reported that haptic support often induces control conflicts caused by the limited amount of information that can be conveyed through haptic forces. As a consequence, it is often burdensome to develop a correct mental model of the underlying controller and to establish accurate situation awareness. This study presents the results of the conceptual development of a novel visual feedback system inspired by the principle of Ecological Interface Design. By displaying the future trajectory with respect to both the physical limitations of the vehicle and the intentional constraints imposed by the road, the driver is able to establish a better understanding of the space of possibilities in a certain driving scenario. The new visual feedback is combined with current haptic feedback solutions, with the goal of guiding the driver through force-feedback, while visualizing the space of possibilities as defined by the work domain constraints. A human-in-the-loop experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of the novel feedback system on driver behavior and acceptance during an obstacle avoidance task. In analogy with previous findings, the results showed that haptic guidance was beneficial during obstacle avoidance in terms of response time, control activity and effort, where the addition of EID-inspired visual feedback revealed an improved task execution, together with a significant reduction of control activity and conflicts.","Haptic shared control; Visual feedback; Ecological Interface Design; Multimodal feedback; Evasive manoeuvres; obstacle avoidance; Human-automation interaction; Driving Simulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Bertsimas and Dunn recently introduced a novel formulation based on Mixed Integer Optimization to generate optimal classification trees.

Moreover, by changing the objective function and adding constraints to the original MIO formulation, we constructed trees that take into consideration false negative errors, decreasing this type of error by 64-80% for <i>C. albicans</i> and 56-66% for <i>C. glabrata</i>. To deal with ambiguous nucleotides in the <i>C. albicans</i> data set we introduced a novel formulation to construct non-binary classification trees. It turned out that ternary trees are a good representation of the <i>C. albicans</i> data set, performing strong in terms of out-of-sample accuracy.

Thin Alumino-silicate glass, mostly used in computers, tablets and smartphones, is known for its lightweight, flexibility, durability, high bending strength and relatively low weight. However, the lack of stiffness allows for some safety-issues. In combination with another material, composite panel can be generated. The core element of this composite panel will consist of 3D printed recycled PET. The use of recycled PET has been taken into account, due to the increasing of plastic waste for the next 30 years. A combination of both materials allows for a much stiffer composite panel and reduction in weight of 71,9 % compared to a normal double glazed window panel. The unaffected composite panels showed that the panels returned to its original shape after removing the load. However, the experiments showed that 3D printing reduces the mechanical properties of recycled PET and PET. An overview is presented in this paper of the durability of the composite panel. The durability aspects for this research are UV radiation, elevated temperature and fire. The UV radiation showed that the glue from DELO ensures for a better adhesion , which allows reaching higher forces. Also, the showed to let recycled PET change into a yellowish color and becomes more brittle. At an elevated temperature of 80 ⁰C, recycled PET looses its stiffness and strength and can not take up forces when exposed. Recycled PET has melting temperature starting from 200 ⁰C and during a fire temperatures could reach up to 1000 ⁰C. This allows the core element to melt fully during a fire. The following chapters of this thesis will give an overview of the literature study and the experiments that were performed and how the composite panel can be integrated into a facade.

Each of these platforms is custom designed for installation and service lifetime, but not for decommissioning. Allseas' Pioneering Spirit is the largest heavy lift vessel in the world, capable of lifting complete topsides in a single-lift operation. The vessel’s lift system places up to eight lift points against the bottom of the platform and uses hydraulic cylinders to transfer the weight from the substructure to the vessel in a matter of seconds. But even with this vessel, removing an oil platform is technically challenging; the structural integrity needs to remain guaranteed, while minimizing the lift preparation cost as the structure will be scrapped. The goal of this thesis is to define a general approach that uses cost optimization for the platforms’ lift preparation scope.<br/><br/>The costs of the platform’s lift preparation scope consists mainly of two things; installation of lift points and reinforcement of the structure to avoid exceedance of their design resistance. In order to minimize the cost, the challenge is to find a lift configuration which minimizes the combined cost of the number, type and location of the lift points and the amount of reinforcement. A solution should not exceed constraints such as the allowable load per lift point, the number of lift points and the relative height difference between lift points. A lift configuration is statically undetermined, and the relative height difference between lift points is used to get different load distributions for the same configuration. In this way, forces are redistributed to strong points in the structure.<br/><br/>Detailed finite elements models are used to prove the structural integrity of a topsides during decommissioning. The number of degrees-of-freedom of such models is far too large for them to be used in an optimization algorithm. Model order reduction is used to condense the mass and stiffness matrix to the possible lift points, while keeping internal forces of interesting elements related to these points to check the structural integrity of a solution. The reduction allows for hundreds of lift configurations to be solved per minute.<br/><br/>The minimal costs for a lift configuration in the defined domain is found with the genetic algorithm. The optimization can include an excess amount of lift locations of different possible types. The location and load distribution over the lift points are used to define the cost function. The algorithm makes a selection that suits the constraints. The cost function gives the sum of the cost of the number and type of lift points and the number and type of structural failures.<br/><br/>This thesis presents a systematic approach for finding the optimal lift configuration for any offshore structure. The method is tested on a case study topsides by comparing the standard configuration with the optimized configuration. It is shown that by using the proposed method, the areas that need structural reinforcements are reduced from ten to zero and the amount of lift points is reduced from eight to seven, leading to a cost reduction of 27% on the offshore preparation scope.<br/><br/>The algorithm shows promising results for this topsides removal project. It is possible to include a new finite element model into the algorithm, which together with a generic cost function, makes sure the algorithm is conveniently applicable to other topsides removal projects.","Topsides; genetic algorithm; removal cost; Finite Element Modeling; model order reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-01-25","","","","Offshore Engineering","",""

One of the main participants in this dispute is Norway: a country extremely wealthy, thanks to oil revenue. In oil’s supply chain, the Mongstad refinery plays a crucial role. Situated in a fjord in western Norway, it’s conveniently located in close proximity of both the North Sea and Norway’s urbanized regions. Reclaimed marshlands have served as Mongstads foundations, from where it directly and indirectly leaves its polluting traces. During its relative short lifespan so far, heavy impact on land and water have been caused. Even though the oil industry is of major importance for the wellbeing of Norway’s inhabitants, they lack in awareness of the processes and consequences involved with this business. Mongstad clearly represents this situation: in geographical sense bordered by either mountains and the sea, on top of this the territory is completely fenced off. Compared to other oil refineries worldwide, Mongstad is an interesting case. While having a capacity of 12 million tonnes of crude oil per year, groundbreaking research is conveyed on-site. In Technology Centre Mongstad and its adjacent test facilities, CO2 is being captured from flue gasses, and prepared for storage elsewhere. Mongstads functional future is extremely uncertain. The oil industry has to change, and Mongstad’s aim of being a ‘sustainable’ pioneer in the field allows for three possible future scenario’s: 1.Business as usual. The refinement and accompanying processes still take place, but as planned, co2 from the refinery will be caught off to be processed elsewhere on the site. 2.Transformation of the refinery. As in the case of Porto Marghera, the refinery will still function as an energy production facility, but in a ‘greener’ way. The current structures will be used, and, if needed, extended. 3.Loss of function, but exploiting potential of the site in geographical and infrastructural sense. The project is adaptable to these scenario’s. It’s an architectural infrastructure, able to grow and shrink according to time, function and place. The infrastructure stretches over a 2 kilometer line, which crosses from mountains to fjord, straight through Mongstad’s borders. While reconnecting nature over exploited land, an axis arises. Heavy labour and core production taking place at one side, while research and room for future development can be found on the other side. This axis is Mongstad’s new spine: opening up the territory, emphasizing on the natural environment, but most of all: supporting a more appropriate productive future. Nine concrete interventions serve as permanent gestures, telling the story of Mongstad through framing, directioning and their highly symbolic appearance.","infrastructure; urban landscape infrastructure; modular architecture; oilscape; delta interventions; transitional territories","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","60.8012, 5.012659999999983"

Lately, AI has also found applications in organizational recruitment processes. Unlike the conventional rule-based systems, present-day AI systems learn from data patterns—supported by the growing volumes of (big) data and increasing computing capacity—and make decisions independently without any human interventions. Thus, the perception that AI is fact-oriented and unbiased has led to this change in organizational recruitment practices. Though recent studies have shown that AI decisions could be unfair, scientific research on the fairness of AI recruitment systems is limited. This research fills this gap by designing a conceptual model to assist top-level HR managers in assessing the fairness of AI recruitment tools while drawing from information systems and responsible innovation literature.<br/><br/>Guided by Design Science Research (DSR), the development of the model entailed three cycles of research, i.e., relevance cycle (which focused on design environment), rigor cycle (which focused on the existing knowledge base), and design cycle (which focused on development and evaluation). The design environment was explored by reviewing the literature on fairness in recruitment and algorithmic biases. Understanding both the recruitment fairness and potential causes of unfairness in AI helped to define the goal of the conceptual model.<br/><br/>The design cycle was informed by the design principles for responsible AI, namely Accountability, Responsibility, and Transparency (ART), and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The model presents seven dimensions which translate the principles to design requirements to assess the fairness of AI recruitment system. They are: (1)Justification; (2)Explanation; (3)Anticipation; (4)Reflexiveness; (5)Inclusion; (6)Responsiveness; and (7)Auditablity. The model also ties these concepts with specific criteria of conventional recruitment fairness such as consistency, interpersonal fairness, job-relatedness, and statistical parity. Finally, the completeness of the model was evaluated by discussing its alignment with other frameworks that had similar objective and utility of the model was validated by collecting feedback from the intended users.<br/><br/>This thesis project makes several scientific and practical contributions. The research discusses the potential risks of using AI in the context of HR recruitment systems thereby contributes to the limited literature available in this respect. By using the DSR methodology for building the assessment model, this research serves as a case for DSR methodology in designing a non-IS artifact. Furthermore, the thesis has unified scattered studies in recruitment justice to provide a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of a fair recruitment system.<br/><br/>Building on the theoretical contributions, the study has developed an assessment model to assist top-level HR managers in assessing the fairness of an AI recruitment tool. Employing this assessment tool can have positive effects on a business organization and society by eradicating the unfairness or bias that AI recruitment tools can bring into the organization. It would also raise awareness regarding the risks of AI. Given that the GDPR (article 35) mandate organizations to take responsibility in assessing the impact while introducing automated processing in new contexts or purposes, the assessment model designed in this study supports these regulations.","Artificial Intelligence; Recruitment; responsibility; accountability; transparency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Due to the reduced air resistance and friction, speeds exceeding those of modern aircraft should become possible. When the system is moved underground,<br/>the stability of vehicle vibrations may become problematic as, especially in soft soils, the Hyperloop pod velocities could easily surpass the propagation speeds of waves in the soil. In that case, the radiation of anomalous Doppler waves into the system may lead to instability of vehicle vibrations, which means that the amplitude of the vibrations would grow exponentially. The aim of this study is to evaluate the system’s stability and its sensitivity to changes in the model by using analytical methods. To that end, the study is motivated by two central research questions: (1) How can the system be modelled and described, taking into account the interaction between soil, tunnel and vehicle and how does the model description change when the magnetic levitation suspension system is introduced? (2) What is the influence of the model parameters on the system’s stability and what impact do modifications in the vehicle suspension have?<br/>The first research question is answered by modelling the underground Hyperloop system as a two-mass oscillator moving uniformly along an infinitely long Euler-Bernoulli beam embedded in a visco-elastic half-plane. Through definition of the governing equations of motion, boundary and interface conditions and subsequent application of Laplace and Fourier integral transforms, the model is reduced to a lumped model for which the characteristic equation has been derived. In the latter model, the reaction of the beam-half-plane system in the point of contact with the moving load is represented by an equivalent dynamic spring stiffness. The introduction of the magnetic levitation adds a magnetic spring to the lumped model. This spring is placed in series with the equivalent spring representing the beam-half-plane stiffness. The second research question is answered by first studying the velocity-dependent equivalent dynamic stiffness of the supporting structure in the point of contact with the moving oscillator as a function of the frequency of the oscillator vibrations. When the imaginary part of this stiffness is negative, instability of vertical oscillator vibrations may occur due to so-called negative radiation damping. Then, based on the D-decomposition method, the instability domain is found for the base parameters of the system, whereupon this instability zone is parametrically studied. The influence of the magnetic levitation suspension system is established by deriving the instability domain for two different models of a concrete tunnel and various magnitudes of the viscous damping in the vehicle. It is found that the model parameters significantly influence the system’s stability. The oscillator’s viscosity in particular has an important stabilizing effect. For both the non-magnetically and magnetically levitated vehicle, a limited magnitude of the oscillator’s viscous damping stabilizes the system for all velocities up to 300 m/s. Therefore, instability should not be considered as a real danger for the Hyperloop vehicle. Yet, when the electrodynamic levitation suspension system is accounted for, the total mass of the Hyperloop pod and the parameters of the non-contact suspension system should be determined with care as a change in their values may influence the instability domain considerably.","instability; oscillator; beam; visco-elastic half-plane; Hyperloop; tunnel; vertical vibrations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-25","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","A lot of concrete structuressufferingfrom ASR show a decrease in material properties. However, it is not clear what might be the influence of ASR on structural behavior. Influence of restraint is often ignored in material property measurement, while reinforcement is present as a restraint of ASR expansion in most structures.Thisresults in so called chemical prestresseffect, whichshould not be neglected. In the presented study,the result indicatesthat neglecting the chemical prestresswould miss the failure mechanism transition and lead to a lowerbeam stiffness. Therefore, a newway to model ASR-affected structures is proposed, called the ASR-layered model.The numerical analysis is done with ATENA.Depending on the reinforcement arrangementand amount, with longitudinal reinforcement acting as a restraint, expansion to the greatest extend occurs in the direction of least confinement and the cracks become parallel to reinforcement. Considering the potential to connect with each other and form long horizontal cracks, the ASR crackingin restrained structuresare modelled as horizontal layers with reduced material properties. The propertyreduction is concentrated in ASR layers only, this local reduction is more realistic than the traditional method done by (Ferche, Sheikh, &amp; Vecchio, 2017)in which a global reductionon material propertiesis applied. For chemical prestress, it is difficult to separate the influence of prestressin experiments,so experimentalresult is always affected both by the reduction of properties and prestress and probably some other phenomena that exist. The chemical prestress effect is modelledherein the way of physical prestress, but the expansion of ASR gel in chemical prestress would possibly influence the bond strength between concrete and reinforcement, so bond model is also considered.Some conclusions can be drawn on this study. The material reduction caused by ASR would only result in a decrease of load capacity. While in combination with prestress, the load capacity of ASR affected beam may be increased to be even higher than the unaffected beam. The application of prestress could also lead to the possible change of failure mechanism from shear to bending failure, whichis also observed in experiments. Including the bond-slip effect in prestressed ASR-layered model provides a better fitting with experimental results,but the influence of ASR on bond strength remains unclear. With parameter study, no obvious influence on ASR-affected structures could be linked to a/d ratio and reinforcement ratio. 1 or 2 ASR layers will only influence slightly on the ultimate load. The limitations of this model exist, the expansion caused by ASR is not directly modelled. Information on ASR layer property is quite limited, it would be difficult to measure the cracking part of ASR affected structures alone. In addition, the chemical prestress and possible cracking depend on the amount of ASR expansion as well as the reinforcement arrangement and amount, but they are not considered to correlate with each other in this model.","ASR; Finite Element Method; Structural Behavior; Failure Mode","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

Both methods have fundamentally different approaches for indirectly determining the cloud droplet number concentration. The parameterization method is based on the Köhler Theory, in which the activation process of particles contained in a rising parcel is modelled for predicting the number concentrations of cloud droplets. The remote sensing method, on the other hand, applies theories about particle-light interactions. Since the remote sensing method determines the cloud droplet concentrations in a more direct manner than the parameterization method, it is regarded here as the reference. An agreement was found between the two models, with a relative error of cloud droplet number concentrations between 41.1% and 78.0%, which lead to errors of the cloud’s scattering intensity in the range of 13% and 26%. Despite some discrepancies between the obtained droplet concentrations, the parameterization model shows similar trends to the remote sensing observations. It was found that the updraft velocity that is needed as input variable for the parameterization model has the largest influence on the model’s prediction of droplets concentrations, and that it is likely to be an important cause for the seen discrepancies. Furthermore, the present research shows how assumptions were made on the size distribution input variable used in the parameterization model, which were not available from observations.","Kohler Theory; Cloud; Modeling; Cloud Condensation Nuclei; Remote Sensing; Aerosol; Particle Activation; Droplet Growth","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","Additional Master Thesis",""

Because of the increasing population in cities like The Hague, social problems intensify. Among these problems is the issue of social-spatial inequality. This occurs when the distribution of life chances is dependent on the place where you live. When the differences between places have an unjust distribution of life chances as a consequence, it is called social- spatial inequality. The intention of this project is the development of a new approach, the Urban Biography, that makes it possible to get an elaborated understanding of the development of a public place, whilst using the physical, social and mental aspects of that place. This approach makes it possible to be able to read and understand the city, or a specific place at a higher level, in order to grasp the identity of this place. Especially important for this identity are the physical, social and mental aspects. Current research often lacks at least one of these aspects, which often results in a design that is only focused on the physical and not the human aspect. The basic idea is that studying these different parts will help with the understanding of the current situation of social-spatial inequality in growing cities. This deep understanding will create the opportunity to alter the public space in order to match both the historical characteristics and the challenges of the future, like the reduction of social-spatial inequality, in order to create a design for a more just future. This Urban Biography approach is applied to the case of the city of The Hague. This city has a strong distinction between rich and poor neighbourhoods. Considering the current differences between the neighbourhoods of the city, the neighbourhood, Statenkwartier is chosen to research in more detail. This neighbourhood is not necessarily the neighbourhood that comes first to mind when thought about social-spatial inequality, but is indeed a very interesting case. The elaborated study of the city as a whole and Statenkwartier in more detail, result in a redesign of the public space for Statenkwartier. The design will contribute to the reduction of socialspatial inequality in the city.","Social-spatial inequality; Urban Biography; The Hague; Public Space; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.0704978, 4.3006999"

It seems, through several extensive questionnaires, that 65% of those individuals seek another housing situation, namely independent housing of some sort (Begeer et al., 2013). Design of these types of apartments should be done with great care, since individuals with autism can suffer extensively from ill-designed surroundings (Schrameijer, 2013; Alexa, 2017). Nowadays, most housing that is available, still feels very institution-like and is scarely furnished. For this research, the following main question will serve as guidance: Which architectural elements can increase the well-being of people with autism within their home environment? The research focuses on three elements: literature study, typological research, and questionnaires/interviews with residents and personal tutors. The results deriverd from this research, are divided in problems and solutions, which then are further categorised in themes: sensory, social, and spatial. As a conclusion, I have strived towards creating conclusive guidelines for design. I have applied these design principles in my graduation project which contains a new modern little courtyard, as well as the transformation of an old school building. In these designs, I aim to show how the principles can be applied in several ways: more rigorously in the new development, while being more restrained and subtle in the transformation project. Firstly, sound appears to be the most disturbing factor in housing situations: this notion kept reoccuring in the research. Other annoyances were: glare and reflection of sunlight; abundance of darkness during the night; an unlogical routine space; lack of personal space; feelings of unsafety; forced social interaction; problems with wayfinding; lack of personalisation opportunities. To solve these problems, several solutions have come up during the research. These solutions have been summarised with addition of design suggestions, including: application of a high amount of sound insulation materials; use of matte finishes; providing a spatial layout that supports (and creates expectations for) routine; design fully equipped houses with addition of common rooms in the building; allow for social interaction, both planned as well as accidential; create opportunities for personalisation; design transitions thoughtfully. These research elements have resulted in the design of a modern Dutch little courtyard (e.g. 'hofje'), where the design has been adapted to the residents through all scales: from urban to interior level.","autism; supportive housing; sensory architecture; design guidelines; Leiden; Healthcare architecture; Dwelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","","52.159633, 4.495654"

Reactive decisions are no longer technically nor economically viable, and hence asset managers are migrating to the implementation of proactive strategies. Despite this, managers are making decisions that are poorly justified, based mostly in intuition. This is why it is important to improve the means to implement a more objective and justified proactive approach. Risk-based decisions are a proactive strategy that may help the prioritisation and optimisation of maintenance and inspection strategies. It requires for its implementation the estimation of probabilities of failure and their consequences. In this thesis, the analysis is oriented on the failure probabilities on sewer systems, especially on understanding the influences of different characteristics of the pipe (explanatory variables) on these probabilities. The outcome of the thesis answers the following research question: “What is the influence of different characteristics on the probability of failure of the sewer pipes?” Two sub-questions were stated to guide the research and help answering the main research question: 1.What defects can lead to sewer structural failure? 2.What physical characteristics make sewer pipes more prone to fail/deteriorate? For the analysis the Dutch municipalities of Breda and Almere facilitated the results of several years of CCTV inspections of their sewers. Due to the lack of availability of collapse records, this study considered a proxy of collapse, which is loss of watertightness on the pipes. Furthermore, defects that potentially cause loss of watertightness are used as a proxy of the loss of watertightness on a pipe. Defects are obtained from the CCTV reports. The first sub-question was answered based on the proxy failure under study. It was found in the literature review ten defects that potentially cause loss of watertightness, which were classified according to the coding of the standard NEN 3399. These defects are: cracks (BAB), break (BAC), defective connection (BAH), intruding sealing material (BAI), displaced joint (BAJ), porous pipe (BAN), soil visible through defect (BAO), void visible through defect (BAP), infiltration (BBF) and exfiltration (BBG). The second sub-question was answered based on some explanatory variables that were available in the dataset of the inspections, which included: sewer system type, materials, shape, diameter, length, and pipe’s above ground material. To answer this question, a descriptive statistical analysis and two survival methods were implemented: a non-parametric and a semi-parametric model. The non-parametric model consists of an extended version of the Nelson-Aalen estimator of the cumulative hazard (ENE) and its derivative the Extended survival estimator (ESE). Implementing ESE, each characteristic was analysed using the aggregate information of the defects that potentially cause loss of watertightness, and each defect individually. This was done to identify the influence in the failure probabilities (the probabilities of occurrence of defects that potentially cause loss of watertightness). The semi-parametric model that was used is the Cox proportional hazard function, used to estimate the risk ratio associated with one unit increase in one of the characteristics under study. Results of the ESE model showed that: The defects displaced joint (BAJ), infiltration (BBF) and defective connection (BAH), are the ones that have more incidence on the loss of watertightness for the two municipalities. Based on the information of aggregate defects it was observed for both municipalities that the median survival probability is past 14 years. Also, the analysis showed that stormwater sewers have a lower survival probability than foulwater sewers, that PVC pipes have a higher survival probability than concrete pipes, and that shorter pipes have a higher survival probability than longer pipes. In the case of the diameters, for the aggregate defects and defects displaced joint (BAJ) and defective connection (BAH), smaller diameters have a higher survival probability than larger ones. But this tendency is the other way around for defects like cracks (BAB), break (BAC) and porous pipes (BAN), where the diameter has a higher survival probability when are larger than when they are smaller. Characteristics shape and above ground material were only analysed for Breda. It was observed that egg-shaped pipes have a lower survival probability than circular shapes, and that pipes with green fields and floor tiles above them have a lower survival probability than pipes that have above asphalt and pavement. For both municipalities, the results of ESE showed that material is that characteristic that influences the most the probabilities of failure. Results of the Cox proportional model showed that: Almere’s results met the proportionality assumption and showed that the characteristics sewer system type and length are the one that influences the most the failure probabilities. Breda’s data is no appropriate to be used with this model, as it does not meet the proportionality assumption. Recommendations of analysing Breda with an extended Cox are given, as this version of the model allows to use time-dependent variables. of maintenance and inspection strategies. It requires for its implementation the estimation of probabilities of failure and their consequences. In this thesis, the analysis is oriented on the failure probabilities on sewer systems, especially on understanding the influences of different characteristics of the pipe (explanatory variables) on these probabilities. The outcome of the thesis answers the following research question: “What is the influence of different characteristics on the probability of failure of the sewer pipes?” Two sub-questions were stated to guide the research and help answering the main research question: 1.What defects can lead to sewer structural failure? 2.What physical characteristics make sewer pipes more prone to fail/deteriorate?

In practice, the building envelope systems are not adapted to facilitate future updates due to changing regulations or changing standards. Furthermore, in most renovation systems the material or component with the lowest service life dictates the service life of the complete system, leading to materials being disposed of before they reached the end of their potential service life. The goal of the thesis is to design a system that is adapted to these issues by being a flexible system that separates functionalities in separate boxes and layers, and therefore is able to upgrade or replace individual components when necessary to ensure the system’s long-term functionality. Study Design: Literature review, followed by the formulation of a strategy and a design. Design effectiveness is confirmed through application on a case study. Long-term functionality is confirmed through transformation of the case study application based on formulated scenarios. Setting: The thesis is part of a series of ongoing research projects associated with the 2ndSkin project. The case study is an apartment block located at the Soendalaan in Vlaardingen. Results: A design concept for an external building envelope system for energy reduction renovation of Dutch post-war apartments elaborated in a 1 to 5 detail scale. The final design incorporates an adaptable aluminium frame system with module boxes containing different functionalities, which can be slid into the main frame. The system is finished with a clamp system with cladding, functioning as the protecting layer for the system.","Prefabricated; Building Envelope System; Energy Reduction; Renovation; Refurbishment; Dutch Post-war Apartments; Future Proof; Service Life; Changing Standards","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

The aim of the pre-season flight schedules is to limit the number of scheduled flights during peak hours.This paper proposes a machine learning approach to classify the pre-season scheduled flights as delayed or cancelled with high accuracy. We also identify the most significant features for the output of the classification algorithms. Further, we propose a generic method to rank pre-season flight schedules using a set of predefined, airport performance indicators. We employ this method to rank 10 pre-season flight schedules, where the performance indicators are derived from the flight delay and cancellation predictions. We apply the flight classification and ranking algorithms at London Heathrow Airport, one of the busiest airports in Europe. Together with the development of dedicated pre-season flight schedule optimization models, our proposed approach supports an integrated pre-season flight schedule assessment, where pre-season flight schedules are re-evaluated with respect to on-time airport performance.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Current interface capturing and advection methods, however, suffer from various issues. The level set method uses the signed distance to the interface and the interface being the zero level set of this function allows the evolution of the level set field to be described with a simple advection equation. This means that no additional steps are required, but solving the advection equation generally does not conserve mass. On the other hand, Volume of Fluid methods utilise the local fluid fractions to represent the phase interface. For these methods, a mass conserving advection algorithm exists, but the absence of an explicit interface requires expensive reconstruction methods to be used instead. Additionally, this Volume of Fluid advection method is subject to a restrictive CFL condition on the time-step and, being dimensionally split, requires a structured grid to be used. Other Volume of Fluid or Moment of Fluid advection methods that do not have these conditions are not mass conserving. Dual interface methods that combine information from the level set and volume fractions are able to achieve higher accuracy, but these method still use Volume of Fluid advection to remain mass conserving and are thus subject to the same conditions. These methods use the level set field to create a cheaper and better justified reconstruction method, which negates one drawback of VoF methods. In this thesis, a method is formulated to allow interface advection on unstructured grids without such a strict CFL condition compared to the MCLS method. To do this, the finite volume level set advection method of the MCLS method is replaced with a nodal-modal discontinuous Galerkin method. The DG method is analogous to the Galerkin finite element methods, but the basis functions are now only valid on one element, and the solution can be multiply defined on the cell boundaries. This allows for level set advection on polygonal cells, and has the added benefit that since cells are semi-independent, level set correction now only has to be applied locally. This, like the finite volume level set advection method, is not necessarily mass conserving though, so the volume of fluid will need to solve this issue. The difference with MCLS is that no volume of fluid advection method is used, since these methods are the parts that introduce the aforementioned problems that are being avoided. Instead, a minimisation method is done on the VOF field in order to obtain a correction which can be applied to the level set and keep it mass conserving. For this minimisation method, a flux condition is used to impose additional constraints on the solution. This condition effectively attempts to match the interface intersections on a cell edge for both adjacent cells, for all cell edges that have a flux going through. The resulting method is tested for four test cases, with solid body translation and rotation, the corner flow test, and the vortex deformation test. In the translation test, there is only vertical velocity, so the flux condition does not take vertical edges into account. To stabilise this test case, level set reinitialisation is applied, which is a technique used to maintain the signed distance property of the level set function to use in the Navier-Stokes evolution method. This keeps the solution in the translation test somewhat representative of the exact interface, but makes the obtained results no longer representative of the actual method. For the other test cases, the method appears to converge when the grid is refined, except for the solid body rotation test using Euler Forward, as this result becomes unstable. However, no apparent order of convergence is present, and the effect of a more accurate time integration method is very inconsistent. To solve this, the method is altered to allow multiple level set advection steps for every optimisation routine. This makes the method better follow the order of convergence of the discontinuous Galerkin method, although this order is slightly lower for the vortex deformation test. The obtained results show that in it's current form, this optimisation based method is likely not usable for general applications, but that with additional work, this kind of method may prove to be more applicable than MCLS.","Two-phase flow; Level Set Method; discontinuous Galerkin; Volume of fluid; Mass conserving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

It has gained popularity due to its high spatio-temporal resolution, which is re- quired to distinguish blood motion from clutter signals caused by slow moving tissue. Since the flow of blood inside the brain is coupled to neural activity it is now possible to study brain function with the use of Ultrafast Doppler. This technique is called functional UltraSound (fUS), and forms a new and exciting research area. fUS relies heavily on optimized signal processing techniques to acquire and process a large amount of high frame-rate images in real-time. This thesis is about establishing the software backbone to allow for fUS experiments. Furthermore, it describes the development and implementation of a computationally efficient method of obtaining vascular images, based on the Projection Approximation Subspace Tracking (PAST) method. The PAST algorithm is able to display accurate representations of the blood subspace, while maintaining a lower computational complexity than the state-of-the-art method, making it suitable for Doppler imaging. When applied to fUS, the ex- ponentially weighted PASTd method achieves a similar performance in highlighting the functional areas of the brain as compared to the current state-of-the-art method, over multiple functional experiments, however with the benefit of lower computational complexity.

As a result, new and unknown challenges within the field of transportation arise. Moreover, there are uncertainties within the behavioural responses of travellers and amongst other things, the changes in the modal split within the transportation market. There is a lack of extensive knowledge of public transport user preferences regarding automated vehicles. In this study, the relative preferences for a trip with a self-driving bus were compared to a trip with a regular bus. To establish this, a stated preference experiment was conducted. Based on the responses of 282 respondents, a mixed logit model including latent variables was estimated. Based on the estimation results, it can be concluded that public transport users currently show a lower preference for the self-driving bus than for the regular bus. Moreover, travellers’ preferences to travel on the autonomous bus improve when no surveillance is present. Travellers with an increased level of trust are found to perceive more utility of a self-driving bus. This effect is stronger for women, which could explain the outcome that women are less likely to travel by autonomous bus than men. These relative preferences result in the self-driving bus being a competitive alternative for short urban trips, which allow for the increase of the travel costs for the self-driving bus compared to the travel costs for the regular bus. At last, the estimation and application outcomes of this study provide an increased understanding of the stated preferences of public transport users for self-driving vehicles operated as public transport services for urban trips.","Shared automated vehicles; Self-driving buses; Automated public transport; Public transport users; Discrete Choice Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

The goal is to identify how these characteristics could be implemented in project delivery methods to contribute to a circular economy. This design-based research is carried out from the perspective of the contractor by participation in a development program to find out how infrastructure could be delivered as a service. Additionally, insights from the perspective of the client and supplier are gathered by semi-structured interviews. Literature study has shown that the more a product is delivered as a service, the more it fits with the principles of a circular economy. In the analysis, it became clear that for the application of product-service system (PSS) in infrastructure projects five conditional state-of- affairs should be fulfilled. In addition, throughout the project lifecycle, some required changes are identified as being important. To develop a project delivery method suited to circular economy and incorporating PSS characteristics it is identified that certain steps should be taken. Therefore, an agenda for change is developed to clarify what steps need to be taken to make the transition to application of PSS characteristics in the infrastructure sector. During the research, a model has been created based on the application of PSS characteristics during the different stages of a project. The outcome of this model leads to the most optimal situation in relation to circular economy for application to the infrastructure sector. The model indicates that the identified prerequisite changes need to take place up front and during the lifecycle of the infrastructure project to transform towards a service-oriented project delivery that complies with the principles of circular economy. Most important change in relation to the existing project delivery methods is the inclusion of the end-of life phase, which should be standard incorporated in project delivery of infrastructure projects to support the closing of the material cycle. Additionally, it turns out that it is important that power (knowledge and resources) and responsibilities are allocated to the service provider to create an economic incentive to preserve the quality and value of the product throughout the contract period. In this research it turns out the most service-oriented category of PSS is currently not possible to achieve in the infrastructure sector due to the current organisation of the Dutch infrastructure sector. However, incorporating PSS characteristics on a project level could support the infrastructure sector in the transition towards a circular economy. <br","Circular Economy; Design-based research; Double Diamond; Project Delivery Methods; Product-Service System; Infrastructure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

However, this is only possible if the drivers are comfortable during automated driving. The major issue here, is that the susceptibility of motion sickness (MS) increases significantly when the driver does not have his or her eyes on road, this susceptibility needs to be minimized. However, motion sickness is not clearly understood and assessing it has been traditionally done qualitatively with questionnaires. Because of the highly individual and subjective nature of motion sickness and its symptoms, it is hard to quantify it accurately by questionnaires. To minimize and prevent motion sickness, it is beneficial to measure it quantitatively in different ways in addition to the traditional questionnaire.<br/>This thesis explores and investigates the use of physiological measurements, ECG and GSR, to relate motion sickness in a realistic driving experiment.<br/>Hence, a road test is conducted for this study with a Toyota Prius on a closed road. A slalom course was driven with a speed 25 km/h to reach lateral accelerations up to 0.4G with a lateral frequency of 0.175 Hz. This frequency and velocity has been chosen, because it is known that people are the most sensitive for MS of frequencies near 0.2 Hz and this velocity reflects urban driving. 23 participants took part of the experiment and had their ECG, GSR and their MISC (Misery scale, an illness rating) recorded during the drive. The experiment lasted until MISC rating 7 (=medium nausea) or either 30 minutes was completed. The ECG (HR, LF/HF ratio) and GSR (skin conductance level SCL, skin conductance response SCR) recordings were then compared to the MISC ratings to see if there was a significant difference between the participants who got sick and stopped at MISC 7 (sensitive) and the participants who did not get sick (non-sensitive).<br/>The results show little support correlating motion sickness or even to distinguish sensitive and non-sensitive groups with HR, HRV or GSR data. It might be beneficial to categorize people into different sensitivity profiles for MS susceptibility to make HR information more useful as there is too much of individual differences. Currently, there were few to none road tests done regarding motion sickness. It appears that physiological measurements for predicting MS in vehicles are not as straightforward and do not translate well from other types of laboratory tests to realistic road tests. Not to mention that HRV has become a controversial metric in the recent decade that might need to be re-evaluated for use. <br","Motion Sickness; Passenger Comfort; ECG; GSR; Toyota; Lateral accleration; Driving; Automotive; Automated driving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

This creates a need for removal of large defunct satellites to avoid the disastrous Kessler syndrome, which poses a major threat to the future of space exploration. This research examines the dynamics and control involved in the active removal of a large space debris - Envisat. European Space Agency's e.deorbit mission aims to de-orbit Envisat using a chaser satellite, which synchronises, docks, detumbles and deorbits it. The presence of large flexible appendages makes the configuration prone to elastic perturbations leading to complex dynamics that cannot be represented using rigid body dynamics. Therefore, a unique multibody approach based on the absolute interface coordinates in the floating frame formulation is used to model the Flexible Multibody Dynamics. The novel method proves to provide a good balance between computation time and efficiency for the control application. The controllability characteristics of two phases of the e.deorbit mission are analysed using a linear PD controller and an Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion controller. For the first phase, both controllers successfully synchronise the chaser with the target debris tumbling at the rate of 3.5 deg/s about all axes. However, during the detumbling phase, the large appendage (14.2 m) in the stacked configuration introduces complex dynamics, which could not be stabilised completely by applied controllers. Nonetheless, interesting relationships could be established between the dynamics and control of the system, which will facilitate robust control design in future work.","Space debris; multibody dynamics; Flexible structures; Control; Active debris removal; floating frames","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

A group of students, together with Bamboo Social and the Delft University of Technology, realized a Bamboo Factory in Esperanza, Nicaragua. In this factory bamboo can be treated and dried properly, making the bamboo last for 30-50 years, instead of the usual 3-5 years. The enlarged life expectancy unburdens the local people from reconstructing their houses every 5 years. To ensure this extended durability, the bamboo has to be lifted from the ground to keep it dry and the bamboo needs to be protected from direct sunlight by making a big overhanging roof. Next to the advantages of the treated bamboo, the extended durability of the bamboo also introduced a new challenge. A technique to mount the bamboo, that lasts for 30-50 years is lacking in Esperanza. Traditional lashings are used to construct bamboo structures. However, these lashings tend to loosen in about 5 years. For the Bamboo Factory steel M10 screw thread, nuts and rings where used. A quick and strong system for constructing with bamboo. However, these materials aren't locally available in Esperanza and are too expensive. A new system needs to be found. A proper waste treatment is lacking in Nicaragua. Waste can be found everywhere on the streets and in rivers, about 50% of the waste is plastic waste. In remote areas like Esperanza it is even more difficult to get rid of waste in a sustainable way. Resulting in incineration of the waste, which includes plastic. The goal of this project is to find a way to transform this plastic waste into a standardized system that enables local people in Esperanza to build with bamboo. When recycling contaminated plastic, drastic deterioration of the mechanical properties can be expected. Mechanical tests are performed on the recycled plastic to get an insight of the quality and the possible applications. <br/>A relatively simple injection moulding machine is build in order to reprocess the plastic waste. The standardized set of connectors are designed to be produced with the injection moulding machine. In order to construct with this simple set of connectors, only a hammer and a saw are needed.

Facilities in the Maintenance Repair &amp; Overhaul industry are no exception to this, but face some distinct challenges. This research presents an integrated approach to the conceptual design of an in-plant transport system for an MRO facility in the aerospace industry. The integrated approach distinguishes conceptual design as a separate phase and structures design efforts within this phase using the Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, Evaluate (DMADE) cycle. One major iteration through this cycle is done for a real-life case system at an MRO facility for aircraft components. After an exploratory literature survey, demand for the case is analyzed using enhanced Value Stream Mapping (denoted as VSM-Information) and data analysis. Design requirements and decision criteria are established that determine the effectiveness of an in-plant transport system.Here, a fundamental trade-off is shown to exist in Transport Lead Time and capacity. Three Service Level targets are set for the case to make this trade-off in design. A generic Design Interactions Framework for (vehicle-based) in-plant transport systems is proposed that addresses a lack of guidance in literature on forming integral designs during synthesis. The framework is applied to the case to compose three integral alternatives in which both call systems with Automated) Guided Vehicles and in-plant milk-runs are used. The logistic performance of the design alternatives is reviewed using Discrete Event Simulation. Minimum Viable Configurations (MVCs) are derived that state the minimum amount of transport resources per design alternative per Service Level target. Cost estimation and implementation risk assessment are performed for the MVCs found. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis is applied using the Weighted Sum Method to establish a preference ranking for the MVCs. The robustness of this ranking is assessed using a scenario-based sensitivity analysis. Results show that four MVCs exist for the design alternatives and Service Level targets defined. Two of these MVCs compete for the first place in the preference ranking and hence no clear preferred alternative is identified for the case. The ranking between the top-two MVCs is highly sensitive to setting the weight factors in the WSM. It turns out that their effectiveness highly depends on the monetary implications of a certain TLT performance and implementation risk; which couldnot be quantified in this research due to time restrictions and data unavailability. Although the results of the case study are highly case-specific, the approach taken, design principles derived and tools used are widely applicable in the design of effective in-plant transport systems and show the specific characteristics of these systems in an MRO context.","In-Plant Transport; Internal Transport; Intralogistics; System Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2029-01-24","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

Many designers have proposed transformation schemes but few have investigated full restoration plans. Where should the balance be found? The site of intervention chosen is the Humanities Faculty of the Arts campus of Leiden University, original architect Joop van Stigt (1982). Two reasons to motivate a design intervention on this site are: a) to solve critical technical problems around the building structure and b) to facilitate a more experiential learning and interactive working environment for all students, lecturers, staff and visitors. Here I aim to test two approaches to find out which approach/ position will preserve the old spirit of structuralism and reflect back concepts and spatial qualities with the new inserted interventions. The hypothesis is to see what is gained or lost if one layer around the building structure (skin/surface) is sacrificed? The method followed in the test is to place one design position on the campus' north cluster and the other position on the campus' south cluster of the Wittesingel Campus. An evaluation shows how one position offers a greater potential to preserve the spirit of the 1970s /1980s structuralism movement. The most significant finding in adapting the skin of the buildings on the campus’ north cluster, is a total transformation of the external appearance. All the individual units now appear outside as one building although inside as a cluster of individual “houses”. However by adapting the interior surface of the “houses” on the campus’ south cluster will drastically transform the inside experience of the working and learning. On the campus’ south cluster, many original material finishes are lost while the exterior brick skin façade appearance remains intact. The design of the campus’ north campus revealed that the original structure could extend itself vertically and horizontally in a new life as intended by structuralist architects. Concluding that the structure can be updated to accommodate a new infill of spaces to learn and interact between structural components and the carefully detailed, robust, rough material finishes are easy to combine with a similar range of soft colours and texture furniture for an inspiring knowledge center and sustainable 21st century Humanities Faculty Campus of Leiden University.","Skin; Surface; Structuralism; Leiden University; Transformation; Preservation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","The Future of Structuralism","52.156911, 4.481836"

The research is applied to the case study Floriade, which is a neighborhood currently under development and set to be completed in 2022. The research consists of four parts, each of which contributes the integral design of an energy system that incorporates hydrogen as a seasonal buffer. The first part focusses on the design of the energy system and the elements that are part of an energy system. Multiple energy system designs, including systems without hydrogen incorporated are evaluated. A multiple criteria analysis is undertaken in order to come to a design with an optimal configuration of elements. The system layout and components are dependent on the energy demand and the production potential of the neighborhood. The energy demand and the production capacity is calculated with an energy model, which is described in the second part of the research. Multiple software packages are used to calculate and validate data necessary for the research. The consumption and production data are used to make up the balance of energy consumption and production. The energy balance is used to calculate the efficiency of the energy system. The efficiency determines the feasibility in terms of energy losses and gains. This is described in the third part of the thesis. The overall system efficiency are calculated and the added value of storing renewable energy as hydrogen is evaluated. To minimize energy losses by means of transport all system components for making and storing hydrogen are located in one building in a central location. The final part of the thesis describes the design of this energy hub. The design of the building is based on safety measures that should be taken into account when introducing hydrogen in the built environment. The research results in the design of an energy system in which hydrogen is applied as a season buffer for renewable energy. The aspects of both energy system design as well as the application of hydrogen in de built environment are evaluated to draw conclusions on the opportunities and challenges of applying hydrogen as a seasonal buffer.","Hydrogen; Energy storage; Energy transition; Energy system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

The sagbend region of a suspended pipeline catenary may experience high loads due to these motions. When the loads become too high, the pipeline integrity cannot be guaranteed. In such case, the pipeline is lowered to the seabed to prevent buckling and excessive damages to the pipeline. The pipelay operation is to be resumed later on when pipelay conditions have been improved. This process is called Abandonment &amp; Recovery (A&amp;R). It is essential to lay pipe as efficiently as possible to reduce the time spent offshore. This study investigates the influence of the vessel motions with regard to pipeline integrity. This results in two objectives that are intertwined with one another. The first objective is to investigate the influence of vessel motions on the dynamic pipeline behaviour and integrity during installation operations. The second objective is to develop a method that will define a vessel motion based criteria for pipeline Abandonment &amp; Recovery operations with respect to pipeline integrity. Two methods are proposed to create ´statistical prediction´ curves to quickly assess the pipeline integrity. This requires the generation of multiple pipeline installation models during project preparation. These methods are applied to various combinations of water depths and pipe properties. The dynamic behaviour of the pipeline is very sensitive to changes of these parameters. A shallow water and a deep water case are used for the analyses of the results and for the validation of the methods. The pipeline integrity is assessed by predicting the maximum strain, the DNV buckling check and fatigue damage for a pipeline during installation based on stinger tip motions.","pipelaying; vessel motions; abandonment criteria","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-01-24","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering | Bottom Founded Structures, Arctic and Wind","",""

However, current state-of-the-art per-pixel segmentation networks fail to accurately capture geometrical and topological properties on land use segmentation, as these methods have inherently a lot of freedom. These geometrical and topological properties of land use structures are crucial for describing land usage on topographical maps, as their purpose is to present insight into topology and borders of land use structures. In order to preserve the geometrical and topological properties of land use structures, a novel segmentation method is introduced and tested on road structures in this thesis. Unlike current state-of-the-art segmentation networks, this new method performs the segmentation task by utilizing shape regression techniques as currently applied by state-of-the-art object detection networks. As modern object detection methods are only able to perform regression on simplistic shapes, and road structures generally describe complex shapes, a new topology preserving annotation generation method is introduced that subdivides a complex road structure into a set of oriented rectangular shapes. Since not many publicly available land use datasets contain both aerial images and per-pixel annotations, a new dataset based on aerial images and land use annotations, covering large areas of the Netherlands, is introduced as well. The results show that the novel segmentation method is capable of learning the newly introduced road structure representation, which preserves geometrical and topological properties.

Especially travelling with hold-luggage is a big pain point and stress factor for passengers’. A new way of looking at this problem is providing a baggage pick-up and delivery service by independent baggage courier companies or by a collaboration of a airline and local courier company. Generaly, this trend is unknown to passengers. <br/><br/>The project client for this project is SITA. SITA is a well known IT and hardware solution developer, who serves aviation customers worldwide. Instead of letting airport and airlines develop their own baggage service, SITA could be a party who offers an universal service. However, this trend is unknown territory for SITA, and they have limited understanding of the experiences of passengers. For SITA it is interesting to be inspired of how a baggage pick-up service would look like and what their role could be. <br/><br/>The pick-up moment is a critical moment in the service journey. In a short time-span, the service needs to leave a good impression, exchange the baggage and check it in. Then, the courier needs to be on its way again, and the passengers should be left behind with a good feeling. Especially this exchange feels unequal for the passengers. This resulted in the following research question: How to facilitate a trustworthy moment for families to ‘hand-over’ their hold-luggage to a first-mile baggage service (home pick-up to arrival airport delivery), so they can travel carefree to their destination. <br/><br/>In the designed service concept the passenger and courier identify each other with the use of a chip that is connected to a platform; where the data is stored and distributed to the partners of the service. By checking the baggage allowance and securing an Electronic Bag Tag to the luggage a check-in experience is enhanced. And prepares the passenger for a paperless and self-service future travel. Moreover, the passengers get access to the Bag Journey Planning to maintain tactile visibility over their belongings. During the moment the helping-hand attitude of the courier is crucial for the customer experience. <br/><br/>The interaction is supported by, a SITA, API cloud platform that makes the communication; sharing and usage of the data-sets, possible at this moment. Additionally, SITA offers a standard interface, through which partners can access the platform, that is runs on the own application of the courier partner. The biggest challenge for SITA is to manage all the API calls the couriers’ devices make, especially when the amount API calls per minute grows, the use of a baggage home pick-up service grows. Nevertheless, the proposed role lays within the core activities of SITA. <br/><br/>The validation with the target group revealed a rising positive development from the moment the courier arrives at the door and leaves with the bags. The participants were enthusiastic and had faith in the service quality. They called it: customer-friendly, easy, personal, and therefore they would go on holiday with a more secured feeling. <br/><br/>The project showed an exciting potential for SITA to be a disrupter in the aviation world and offer a universal baggage service. However, there are a few to-do’s for continuing the project: Develop a tactical roadmap, construct a business case for the EBT, research the needs of the courier, and search a case owner within SITA.<br","service design; value-in-exchange; experience mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Then, we perform those transforms on various ultrasound images and analyzes their sparsity. These ultrasound images include the images of two computer ultrasound phantoms and beamformed ultrasound images with good quality from real people. We looked at sparsity of the true pre-beamformed images, as well as beamformed images. We also consider constructing a specific ultrasound image dictionary using the K-SVD algorithm. We observed that, the pre-beamformed images hardly haVe no sparse basis, and the sparsity of beamformed images will only increase slightly if we use different 1D-DWT in each direction. We also found that the wide overdetermined dictionary generated by K-SVD significantly increases sparsity. After this, we simulate the ultrasound image reconstruction from the ultrasound RF measurements, and we analyze the effects of the different sparse spaces on the reconstruction performance. We observed that, the L1-regularization can work for ultrasound imaging better than L2-regularization, but the orthogonal transforms as well as the dictionary do not improve the reconstruction image quality much.","Msc Thesis; model-based; ultrasound imaging; sparse dictionary; l1-regularization; DWT; DCT; wave atom; K-SVD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

During the second shift, these culture specific habitats became occupied by the same culture, in other words, they became mono-cultured. Due to these radical cultural shifts the implanted urban structures became unattended even though some of them were able to continue their lives in the society by transforming and adapting to the new context.

These churches have been chosen because of their formal repetitive character which is potentially can be used as common resource for the city and, they have been seen as an opportunity to operate on both open and closed spaces together. However, because of its the rigid-ritualistic sacred form, the roman catholic church offers a finite space that does not allow undetermined uses to happen.

To deal with this ever congesting metropolis, the French Europeans and later wealthy Moroccans, have established an entire region to escape from Casablanca's everyday. The research investigates this relationship between the escape from the everyday into spaces for the holiday. Spaces wherein the political and economical norm are suspended, resulting in an opportunity for play (in contrast to work, labor and action). In Casablanca, beach club structures barricade the relation between the coastal boulevard and the Atlantic as natural common resource, resulting in a condition wherein one needs to pay to enjoy the ocean and its consequent holiday. Through investigating the characteristic figure of the club, the research unfolds its strategies and motives, to subsequently learn from it for a counter-project.<br/><br/>As a response to the disparity between the everyday and the holiday in Casablanca, to the research on the club and to the investigation on spaces of play, the project proposes a strategy to infiltrate the Casablanca with spaces for the holiday. By exploiting the newly established infrastructure of the tram network, the project taps into many daily routines, claiming territory adjacent to the strategically chosen tram stations. These territories are then reserved for the holiday, accommodated in an urban void, guaranteeing the possibility of refuge in the holiday and the livability of the metropolis.<br/><br/>To offer an alternative to the exclusive figure of the club, the proposed spaces for the holiday must ensure to be inclusive, both socially and architecturally. The absolute architecture of the club is broken open and becoming, transformed into a dual project; a pliant surface and a set of autonomous architectures. Together, they provide a protected holiday space separated from Casablanca’s everyday visually, acoustically, thermally, emotionally. While still providing accessibility from all sides due to its resulting porous nature. Therefore offering a true and pleasant sanctuary in middle of Casablanca’s turmoil. Through the duality of the project, a certain ambiguity is achieved, resulting in a range of conditions wherein citizens can celebrate their holiday. <br/><br/>In order to evoke direct associations of holiday within the interventions, the Casablanca’s collective memory is being exploited through abstractions of the coast in architectural form. The pliant surface is materialized in bright white natural stone, mimicking the tactics of Casablanca’s beach clubs, which imported white beach sand to create paradisaical beaches. The white (artificial) surface offers a first inversion of the everyday on which the autonomous architectural elements are imposed, in turn referencing to the beauty of the natural coast. Each element subtly referencing to phenomena of the Atlantic. <br/><br/>Together resulting in a predefined set of elements and rules which can generate precise architectural interventions when confronted with given urban conditions. The project is therefore designed as a tangram, from the scale of the entire configuration to the detail. In the thesis, three sites are fully developed, as proof of concept, exploring the potential to offer an inclusive form of holiday, inverting Casablanca’s everyday life.<br/><br","Everyday; Holiday; Inversion; Escape; Casablanca; Sanctuary; Oasis; Coast; Public Space; Tram; Heterotopia; Club","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","33.580982, -7.562960"

This study focuses on accurately modeling the outbound baggage handling process while minimizing the number of employees working on this process. The results are based upon data on the outbound baggage handling process at KLM in 2018. In order to create a feasible lateral planning, the satisfaction of the demand and the rules on positioning certain flights have been implemented as hard constraints. ORTEC already created a basic model for assigning flights to baggage halls. However, this model did not lead to the expected improvements and did not model reality very well, and therefore, some extra extensions are needed. The first extension focuses on planning the outbound baggage handling process on a more detailed level, by assigning flights to specific laterals and baggage sections. Several methods are considered to construct this more detailed planning: a mixed integer programming formulation, a hierarchical solution method and column generation. For the mixed integer programming formulation, several speed-ups and valid inequalities are suggested, as first tests showed that the LP-relaxation provides a weak lower bound on the optimal solution.<br/>The MIP and hierarchical solution method resulted to outperform the other methods for small data instances created. Because the flight schedule does not result in feasible solutions for the first extension, delaying lateral opening times is allowed under certain circumstances, in the second extension of this research. This results in more flexibility and feasible solutions can be obtained for the flight schedules. The hierarchical solution method resulted in the best feasible objective value within a certain time limit. <br/>Driving tasks, which need to be fulfilled in order to bring the baggage to the corresponding departing aircraft, are added in the last extension of the research, such that the number of drivers can be minimized together with the employees working in the baggage hall.

(graduation committee); Lloret-Fritschi, Ena (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Research and development in additive manufacturing with concrete has become more widespread over the last decade. The processes developed range from concrete extrusion, to digital fabrication of formworks and the unification of formwork and reinforcement. Although they enable the production of increasingly material-efficient structures, the individual processes still face various challenges such as implementation of reinforcement, geometrical limitations, scaling and formation of cold joints, in particular because of the layer-based process. This research proposes an alternative method of producing concrete formworks dubbed ‘Eggshell’. Combined with a novel casting technique, its aim is to overcome these challenges and make material-efficient concrete production possible. As concrete is the most used construction material in the world its influence on the construction industry is unprecedented. Of the construction costs of concrete, formwork typically makes up 30-80% of the costs. This means formwork considerations are often a key driver in determining the design of concrete structures. Materials used to construct the formwork also have a big impact on the total ecological costs of the concrete building components. As the lifespan of all formwork is finite, this adds to the already considerable amount of waste generated by the building industry. Furthermore, traditional formwork made from steel or wood is ineffective in producing the non-standard, (double) curved geometry that characterizes many contemporary architectural designs. Using innovative means of formwork fabrication, these non-standard building components can potentially be produced in a more cost-, time- and material-efficient way. Moreover, Eggshell opens up possibilities for fabricating structurally optimized geometry, enabling a more efficient use of resources. The research builds upon previous work done as a part of an interdisciplinary master thesis in a collaboration between Gramazio Kohler Research, the Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems and the Physical Chemistry of Building Materials group (ETH Zurich). In the thesis a process was developed in which a thin-shell formwork is 3D printed while a fast-hydrating concrete is simultaneously fed in. By 3D printing the formwork, complex geometries can be fabricated effectively. The printed formwork can potentially also be recycled and reused, making the process fully circular. Furthermore, reinforcement can be integrated into the structures, allowing for the creation of structural building components.","Concrete; 3D Printing; Digital fabrication; additive manufacturing; Formwork; Reinforcement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-23","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

An independent business unit operating with full focus on starting- and improving innovations within the business group. In here, the innovation strategy is aligned with the long-term strategy of the PEPP-group and an innovation process is introduced as well. All innovative initiatives that contribute to improving the core-business of the companies, should be created in the operating companies itself. These are called ‘Area 1 initiatives’. Innovations related to the core business but are more or less new, get support from Area 52. These are called ‘Area 2’ initiatives. Innovations that deal with new business models and eventually might compete with the current business, are developed within Area 52 and are called ‘Area 3 initiatives’. Their vision is that operating companies in the group should be self-regulatory for their Area 1 and Area 2 innovations. To this day however they don’t have a structure or process for this. Therefore the challenge has been to design a framework that enables operating companies of Pon Equipment and Pon Power to set up their own innovation process, and support employees to be involved with innovation. The framework enables, in three steps, operating companies to support their employees to be involved with innovation. First it is about understanding the fields of innovation. Second, these fields can be connected and made concrete by choosing innovation tracks. Lastly, after a track is defined, an innovation process can start. These steps were validated by employees from both Pon Power Netherlands, and Pon Equipment Norway. They see the added value of the different parts of the framework. However, the last challenge is to keep people involved, to get the mass of the organization tipping towards involvement with innovation. There are several types of employees in the organization. Every operating company has to appoint an innovation expert. He or she should understand different types of people; their current behavior and the desired behavior. By looking at different triggers, they can all be activated in a different way. The innovation expert has all the knowledge about the framework and has complementing tools and processes ready to start a track of innovation. When enough people are involved in a track, and stay involved in new tracks, the mass might tip towards an innovative mindset within the operating companies.","Innovation Strategy; Behaviour change; Innovation framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

A lack of understanding on road planning system, and the existence of success and failure factors limits the sustainable transition in road projects. This research explores the existence and workings of critical success factors in Dutch road planning. The exploration and identification of factors is achieved by using a comparative case study approach. Three Dutch road infrastructure project were analysed. The research established three main findings (1) The lack of early (integral) inclusion of climate concerns impedes the success related to climate aspects of a project. (2) The existence of a project climate goal is essential in guaranteeing the constant inclusion of climate concerns and climate related consideration in the planning process. (3) The success of inclusion and translation of climate ambitions into goals depends on the sustainable mind-set of project organisations, political players, stakeholders and public. The findings of this research improve understanding of road planning processes and climate related transition processes.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The shear capacity of concrete members is a major challenge of structural concrete research through the years. Many theoretical models have been developed and various experiments have been performed, focusing on the accurate prediction of the shear behavior. Many of the available theoretical models assume that a large contribution of the shear capacity is transferred through cracks by a mechanism often recognized as aggregate interlock. At the same time, due to the increase in the complexity of the structures and the development of the concrete technology, the mechanical properties of concrete have improved significantly. This fact leads to the need for modification of the existing models or the development of new ones, accommodated to the improved materials. Since, the aggregate interlock plays a significant role in the development of the shear capacity, the present research proposes a new numerical methodology for the calculation of the aggregate interlock in high strength concrete in which aggregates break, based on the widely recognized model proposed by Walraven and the results of direct surface roughness measurements. The crack surfaces of concrete cylindrical specimens drilled from a 70 years old existing concrete bridge and newly casted cubic specimens generated by splitting tensile tests were measured by a laser scanner. Moreover, the surface of a reinforced deep beam after flexural shear failure was measured as well. The measured crack surfaces were used to implement the plasticity based aggregate interlock model proposed by Walraven with an algorithm which was validated with Walraven’s theoretical model, using a so-called mesostructural model. The output of the analysis gave suggestions on the adjustment of the available aggregate interlock model for high strength concrete. The proposed model is then implemented into a shear test on a 1.2 m concrete beam, which has a concrete strength larger than 70 MPa and the aggregate interlock seems to influence significantly the shear resistance of a cracked section. Based on the observation of the surface roughness of a crack, the thesis further proposed that with a sufficiently large crack face, the localized variation in the crack surface is averaged out. Thus, the surface can be used to develop a master curve for the given concrete type. In the last part of the study, two improvement suggestions are given regarding the Critical Shear Displacement Theory. The one point is relevant to the simplification of the crack profile that can be changed from a straight line into a more inclined and the second point is related to the correction factor considering the fracture of the aggregates, that should be dependent on the crack width.","Aggregate interlock; Shear; Laser scan; Shear transfer mechanisms; Concrete","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Technological advances in key areas, such as thin film solar cells or new deployment methods, as well as the miniaturization of satellites and their components, have considerably increased the usefulness of this design. The research presented in this document aims to contribute to these technological developments, helping to unfold the whole potential of this structural solution. This research comprises the MSc thesis of the author, in partial fulfillment of the MSc in Aerospace Engineering by the Technical University of Delft. The research was conducted during an internship at the department of Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) Systems, Institute of Space Systems, German Aerospace Center (DLR). The research focuses in the study of the behavior of large thin flexible structures (LTFSs) in space from the perspective of the attitude determination and control system (ADCS). This work was performed in close relation to the DLR’s mission GoSolAR (Gossamer Solar Array). The contributions of the research can be classified in two areas, related to the modeling of the structure and to the design of the ADCS. In relation to the first one, a methodology to integrate the flexibility of a structure into its equations of motion is explained from a theoretical perspective and implemented over a flexible spacecraft. This methodology is based in Lagrange’s equations and can be applied to diverse structures, allowing modeling accurately the dynamics of the system while maintaining the model comprehensive and of relatively low order. The implementation of this approach leads to equations of motion containing both rigid and flexible motion, enabling to conduct an evaluation of the impact of the flexibility of a structure on its dynamics in a space environment. The second major area in which this thesis aims to contribute to the body of knowledge is related to the design and evaluation of attitude controllers targeting flexible satellites. Different controller’s designs are proposed, based in: 1) a linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) approach, 2) robust control theory, particularly in the minimization of HInf and H2 norms, and 3) a control approach based in analytical dynamics, known as the Udwadia–Kalaba approach. The performance of these designs was evaluated not only in relation to control instructions related to the rigid motion of the satellite, e.g. angular rate, but also to the capability of each controller of damping the system, reducing the vibrations that appear due to its flexibility. The particularities that need to be considered when implementing each controller are also studied, in order to give a clear idea of when would each controller be an adequate control solution. The result is a set of different control designs, including for each of these designs: 1) the methodology to derive the controller, 2) the performance of the controller and 3) the particularities and limitations of its implementation.","Attitude control; Flexible structures; Active damping; Analytical modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","GoSolAr (Gossamer Solar Array)",""

Special care has to be taken to design the transition between these hard and soft flood defences, as they are often vulnerable components of a coastal defence system. This study therefore aims to give more insight into the morphological processes around hard-soft transitions, in order to make recommendations on design and nourishment plans for hard-soft transitions in the future. To this end, the hard-soft transition of Maasvlakte 2 (MV2) was studied. For the case of MV2 the limited knowledge of hard-soft transitions resulted in a conflict of the assessment method of the flood defence and the nourishment strategy according to the client requirements. The most important factors governing the morphological behaviour were studied using different numerical models (UNIBEST-LT/CL , SWAN and XBeach. From the results of the case study of Maasvlakte 2, it was found that the most severe erosion at the hard-soft transition is found during periods with strong southward longshore transports, which causes positive longshore transport gradients at the transition. Cross-shore processes such as storm erosion also indirectly contribute to this by transporting sediment from higher in the profile to lower in the profile. Regarding the influence of wave reflection, preliminary results were found. Using SWAN and UNIBEST, the effect of short waves was investigated, which showed that reflection of short waves is larger at the deeper located part of the hard flood defence. The preliminary results from XBeach showed that bound long wave reflection is larger closer to the hard soft-transition, and that these reflected waves also reach quite far offshore. As regards to the role of the tide, it was found that the dominant northward directed flood tidal current along the soft flood defence strengthens the supply of sediment from south during northward transport. On the other hand, the dominant southward directed ebb current along the hard flood defence hardly picks up any sediment and therefore it does not contribute to the morphological changes at the hard-soft transition.<br/>Some generic observations in the morphological behaviour of MV2 are likely to be found at other hard-soft transitions: - A strong dynamic variability is usually present at the hard-soft transition, in the form of coastline retreat which gives a rotated coastline shape. - The reflection of short waves will likely be larger at the deeper part of the hard flood defence. Closer to the transition zone, where sediment from the soft flood defence is deposited, short wave reflection will be smaller, but long wave reflection will be larger. - In general the highest erosion will be observed in periods with oblique wave incidence where sediment is lost due to longshore sediment transport gradients. Based on these findings, several recommendations are proposed to design a hard-soft transition. Moreover this study presents some other design examples to minimise the nourishment frequency. Finally, recommendations are presented for further research.","Maasvlakte 2; morphology; hard-soft transition; Coastal Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-14","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","Maasvlakte 2","51.987801, 4.006424"

The landward side of De Slufter is a sand dike which is part of the primary coastal defence ring of the island. HHNK, which is responsible for the coastal safety of Texel, currently relocates the dynamic gully in the slufter mouth every time it reaches one of the dune heads (every 5-6 years approximately) because uncontrolled gully migration might widen the slufter mouth. This could lead to more wave attack on the sand dike, possibly affectingthe coastal safety of Texel. Still, HHNK is planning on ceasing the relocations of the gully. The goal of this thesis is to assess the effects on the present and future coastal safety of De Slufter. First, based on a field data analysis of annual topography and bathymetry measurements it is expected that the gully migration is governed by wave-induced longshore transport, curvature-induced secondary flow due to tidal forcing, overwash from the beach flat into the gully during storms and by the distance to the dune heads (which inhibits migration) To investigate the effect of ceasing relocations of the gully on present and future coastal safety a modelling study was performed with XBeach Surfbeat. 15 scenarios were created to assess the effects of different bathymetry and of sea level and bed level rise<br/>Failure was assessed on two failure mechanisms: 'Grensprofiel', which consists of two aspects. A minimum sand dike volume above storm surge level must be available in every transect alongshore in the sand dike. Also, each post-storm sand dike transect must be large enough to contain a legally defined 'limit profile'. The second mechanism is 'Initiation of flooding', which means that failure occurs when at any point landward of the 'Waterstaatswerk' boundary (the outer border of the primary coastal defence) a depth of at least 20 cm is observed. In all present scenarios no failure occurs for a normative 1/3000 year storm. De Slufter is therefore considered 'safe'. Maximum wave heights did not increase significantly for different bathymetry configurations due to the large amount of dissipation occurring in the slufter valley. No overwash or overtopping occurred in any of the modelled scenarios and morphological impact on the sand dike itself was relatively low. Failure does occur for the 1/3000 year storm with a sea level rise of 1.95 m and 3.17 m. Failure does not occur in the middle of the sand dike where the majority of the wave attack happens but in the southwestern and northeastern parts due to inundation over the ridge there (‘Initiation of flooding’). It is expected that the 'tipping point' of De Slufter, which is the sea level rise magnitude beyond which De Slufter does not adhere to safety standards, is at a sea level rise magnitude of 1.70 m.","De Slufter; Texel; coastal morphology; dune erosion; sea level rise; coastal safety assessment; XBeach Surfbeat; gully migration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","53.139800, 4.798915"

However, these devices fail to provide insight into fatigue itself. Fatigue is a broad term with many meanings. Fatigue in this paper refers to physiological changes where the muscle becomes fatigued due to increased lactate concentration during high physical activities. Real-time measurements of thermal sweat out of the eccrine glands could enable such insight because it contains physiologically and metabolically rich information that can be retrieved non-invasively. Thermal sweat that secretes out of the eccrine glands contains multiple inorganic constituents such as salt and potassium, nitrogen compounds such as ammonia and urea, and sugars such as glucose and lactate. Most literature agrees that ammonia is a potential constituent for determining the state of muscular fatigue. Different methods were proposed for real-time ammonia monitoring. Out of all these methods, a concept was designed using MOS sensors which measures ammonia concentration in a gas phase. This design was tested by letting participants perform an incremental cycling exercise up to the point while monitoring the ammonia concentration, temperature, humidity, and respiratory exchange ratio to validate whether the sensor is able to determine fatigue. The results are inconclusive whether it is able to determine fatigue through real-time ammonia monitoring.","Sweat; Ammonia; Sport; Sensor; Fatigue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

More specifically, induced earthquake activity is observed in this area due to gas extraction activities, which reduce underground gas pressure. In combination with the location’s geomorphology, liquefaction can occur due to earthquake excitations. Furthermore, the area of Groningen is a location with urban activity and infrastructure, such as pipelines, present. The post-liquefaction effect of these pipelines is their uplift, which can lead to failure, along with all its negative consequences. Furthermore, the creation of two different models, capable of describing the soil-structure interaction of pipelines and post-liquefied soil was the main objective of this thesis. The means by which these models were created was the implementation of the spring and dashpot method. More specifically, Kelvin-Voigt models were used for the ground’s behaviour to be modelled. These models required two main parameters to be specified in each case, the spring coefficient (k) and the dashpot coefficient (c). In order for the spring coefficient to be determined, the creation and usage of post-liquefaction p-y curves was deemed necessary while the problem specific dashpot coefficients used, had previously been determined by means of physical modelling. The ground profile consisted of fully saturated loose sand and the pipes investigated had diameters of 110, 160 and 200mm. The first model was a single degree of freedom one, with that being the vertical. As for the second one, it was a multi degree of freedom one. More specifically, it consisted on two degrees of freedom, the vertical and horizontal ones. The results of these models were validated by comparison to previous studies and further investigation of affecting parameters was carried out. More specifically, the way and the degree up to which several parameters of both ground and structure characteristics affect their interaction were investigated. More specifically, the first parameters considered were the pipelines’ diameter as well as their weight, resulting from their geometry and transported material. Next, the effect of the pipelines’ burial depth was considered and then, the effect of the soil’s initial stiffness. Finally, the effect of the dashpot coefficient was investigated for the multi degree of freedom models. A comparison between single and multi-degree of freedom solution results was also carried out. The results of this study were validated by comparison to previous research findings. Most results and conclusions were in complete agreement with the so far existing bibliography. However, what was found to be inaccurate was the previously determined dashpot coefficient for 110mm diameter pipelines and hence, these were left out of scope of study.","Post-Liquefaction; Pipelines Buried in Sand; Soil-structure interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Together with the fluctuations of the finite fuel resources, it is expected that the use of unconventional and renewable fuels will increase. Hydrogen fuel is a zero-emission, renewable energy source. It has a great potential as one of the principal sustainable energy sources of the future. A gradual conversion to a hydrogen based energy system, if the necessary government framework is provided, is far more likely to happen. This opportunity can be found in the natural gas grid of the Netherlands. This natural gas infrastructure is accessible for both the industry and Dutch households. The IEA HGH RD programme has conducted research about this gradual transition, with promising results. It is currently therefore a key agenda point for the Dutch government. In order to safely make a transition to natural gas with hydrogen addition, it is of importance to know the fundamental combustion properties of these fuel mixtures. These properties are needed for the prediction of and modeling of combustion systems. Traditionally, the quantification of the combustion process is done by focusing on measuring properties such as laminar burning velocity, ignition and extinction characteristics, flammability limits and emissions. The laminar burning velocity is an important property of combustion mixtures. It contains fundamental information on reactivity, exothermicity and diffusivity.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The vast majority of this share of population is living in remote rural areas of developing countries, experiencing major issues in terms of living conditions. While consistent efforts have been done in the past decades to solve the problem, still a lot of work has to be done and novel approaches need to be implemented. <br/>In the past, most of the new energy connections were achieved through national grid extension, which is proving to be a non-adequate short-term solution for a consistent share of the remaining part of the population living in rural areas. This is the reason why decentralised solutions, such as Solar Home Systems and DC micro-grids, are becoming more appealing as alternative ways to improve energy access in developing countries.<br/>In this framework, this Master's thesis will focus on DC solar micro-grids as a solution to the energy access problem. More specifically, the aim will be to develop a methodology to gather, process and analyse data, for planning and evaluation of remote DC micro-grid networks in rural areas of developing countries. One of the main novelty aspects of this proposed methodology is the integrated implementation of Geographic Information Systems and concepts derived from the mathematical field of Graph Theory, together with an electrical analysis. <br/>The methodology is clearly divided into three consecutive steps. The first step focuses on gathering and processing ground-level data using GIS, to compare different micro-grid layouts in term of geometrical length. The second step consists of a graph theory-based dual-objective optimisation algorithm to design meshed micro-grids from a set of starting topologies. The third step implements a DC power flow tool to analyse the operational behaviour of the optimised layouts. The proposed methodology is explained in detail throughout the report, with an example of its application to a sample of villages in different world-wide locations.<br/>The results of this first application of the proposed methodology allow to draw some conclusions on the methodology itself and on the comparison of different micro-grid topologies. First of all, the huge potential of the combination of GIS tools and graph theory applied to micro-grid planning is shown. The results of the layout comparison show how typically implemented micro-grid layouts are generally outperformed by micro-grids designed using novel concepts and this integrated approach. Nonetheless, each specific case studies has peculiar characteristics and conditions that need to be taken carefully into account and can lead to totally different kinds of optimal solutions. It is hence of vital importance to have a methodology which is at the same time well-structured and flexible to adapt to changes and modification of parameters in order to perfectly reflect the specific needs and characteristics of each different rural electrification project.<br","Microgrids; GIS; graph theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Within the Maritime Construction Sector (MCS) business models for AM are difficult to obtain due to its relatively large objects and the corresponding low building cost. In recent years, AM processes have developed significantly in terms of machine dimensions, building speed, material properties and production costs. It is concluded there is sufficient reason for further research on AM production within the MCS. Large scale additive manufacturing, material extrusion, offers high deposit rates and thermoplastic composite material properties. Cheap thermoplastics in combination with fibre reinforcements provide the opportunity to reduce required mass, increase building time and cut building costs. Interest in composite cargo vessels is noticed mainly due to weight reduction and corrosion resistance. However, financial consequences due to mould making and expensive materials, and regulations obstruct widespread developments. To explore the possibilities resulting from additive manufacturing within the maritime construction sector a Class III inland waterway vessel is used as case study. For more in depth knowledge the bow section of the vessel is considered. To retrieve relevant information about the feasibility and requirements of a thermoplastic bow section the main question and resulting sub-questions are stated as follows:1: Can a thermoplastic composite Class III inland waterway vessel be produced competitively using Additive Manufacturing – Material Extrusion, compared to steel and what is the expected weight reduction?Following sub-questions are listed to help answering the main question.2: What are the vessel’s functional, market driven and regulatory requirements?3: How does AM-ME comply with stated market driven, functional and regulatory requirements?4: What AM-ME polymer and reinforcing material is best suited for inland waterway vessels?5: What is the expected weight reduction using AM-ME and accompanied thermoplastic composite?6: How is the required equipment within the vessel installed?7: What will be the final weight reduction and cost price of the inland waterway vessel and can it become Class approved?By answering the stated sub-questions, the main question is answered.Approach:Functional requirements describe what a bow section should do and how it should fulfil its purpose. Market driven requirements state maximum allowable costs, building time and weight in order to be competitive over traditional manufacturing. Regulatory requirements are derived from Lloyds Register Rules &amp; Regulation on special service craft, in which composite vessels are treated. Rules prescribe material requirements, composite laminate requirements, design pressures, fire safety, maximum allowable stresses and deflection and more.AM ME offers advantages in terms of building dimensions, deposit rate and costs. Research on AM-ME results in a collection of technologies and developments required with respect to the production of large composite objects. Special attention is provided to multi-axis material deposition, material selection and cost price. Based on required mechanical material properties and material durability a selection of polymers, reinforcing fibres and additives is derived. Using composite theory for anisotropic composites, final material properties are calculated required for further bow section analyses. Besides direct composite characteristics some basic conclusions about creep and fatigue, and the use of recycled content, are derived.To estimate the final weight of the bow section, and complete inland waterway vessel, a global and local design space is derived. First, adjustments on the section due to installation of components is discussed. Manual calculations applicable on main components with composite material properties offer first weight estimations. Optimizing for laminate thickness and fibre orientation offers additional weight reduction. Insight is provided in the way the bow section is produced using AM, including installation of components and post-processing the outer surface.Besides being able to insert components and systems, these need to be connected to the bow section without causing extended assembly time, repair work, durability and leakage. Various methods of connection are proposed. To keep production costs low, weight reduction is a significant factor resulting from material costs and building time. Building time cannot exceed traditional building time especially during outfitting. In the final sub-question, final weight reduction, building time and costs are discussed. By answering the final sub-question, the main question can be answered.Conclusions:AM developments offer the possibility to comply with stated functional, market driven and regulatory requirements. Main challenge is keeping production costs low and offering cross-plied laminates. Uncertainties rising from AM production are material integrity, fatigue and classification. Keeping costs low is to be done by using cheap thermoplastic composites, increase deposit rates and reduce weight as much as possible, to keep machine time and material usage low.Based on the global design space and a reference local layout of the bow section a final weight reduction of 36% is estimated, in which various known and underestimated safety factors are taken into account. The outcome is validated by analyses of individual components and the complete bow section using software Hyperworks. By optimizing laminates on thickness and orientation an additional 9% weight reduction seems achievable, depending on initial selections for thickness and orientation. Since midship section are subjected to higher bending moments, less weight reduction is achievable for the entire vessel.It is concluded material costs can reach low values although it will be hard to prepare the required amount of materials for a cost price of in between 0.97 and 1.63 EUR/kg, to reach desired final production costs. Most favourable material compound is Polyethylene Terephthalate (40 wt%), Polycarbonate (5 wt%), E-glass direct roving (40 wt%) and E-glass short fibres (7 wt%) including a set of chosen additives (8 wt%). The selected material complies with stated regulations. The use of recycled polymers offers advantages since cost price is reduced. PET polymers show good recycling properties and allow for regeneration up to virgin quality. Although selected materials show promising fatigue properties, the effect resulting from AM deposition remains uncertain. Machine rate, building time, material costs and optimised weight of the object have resulted in a total cost price reduction of in between 15% and -22% of traditional building cost. Building time of 3 to 5 days is calculated feasible in which a 22 to 25 tonnes weighing bow section is deposited, offering 36% weight reduction over traditional manufacturing extrapolated to a complete vessel excluding extra margins for higher bending moments.Classification remains an issue although to direct rejections are expected. To comply with fire safety, fire resistant panels need to be installed. Most critical rules are respected but additional research is required on fire safety and process control during the manufacturing process, including standardization of machinery.","Composite; additive manufacturing; Inland waterway vessel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-01-13","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations | Shipping Management","",""

Pathological changes within the cells due to diseases are accompanied by a corresponding change in these physical properties and consequently can be used to differentiate between the healthy and diseased cells. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is one of the techniques used for characterization of purity of cells. The characterization involves measuring the response of the dielectric constant 휖' with frequency. The dielectric response shows the amount of polarization of the cell volume which is high at low frequencies and almost none at high frequencies. The frequency band during which the response makes this transition is known as 훽 dispersion. By observing the changes in the pattern for 훽 dispersion, the percentage of healthy cells can be estimated. The location of 훽 dispersion frequency band depends on the type of molecules, ranging from 10Hz for tissues till 5GHz for water. In this work, the design of phase locked loop is presented which is used for such EIS system to enable characterizing the materials for a wide range of frequencies.<br/>The PLL is designed for frequencies ranging from 0.5GHz to 5.12GHz which will<br/>enable the system to characterize purity of molecules from human cells to as small as water. The PLL uses injection locking technique to improve the frequency resolution required for the dielectric measurement. This technique allows power efficient way to reduce the phase noise of the PLL and hence increase the resolution of the frequency measurement. Further, counter assisted tracking is used to enhance the lock-in range of the PLL so that it stays locked during the frequency variation measurements. The required frequency resolution for dielectric measurement of water is found to be 1.2MHz for 1.25% accuracy. The current implementation can achieve worst case frequency error of 350kHz enabling the system to measure the dielectric constant until water.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-23","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Due to the use of electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) vehicles with distributed electric propulsion, UAM operates under zero operational emissions and cheaper and at a lower noise level compared to helicopters. In the long term with more UAM flights, air traffic control is expected to limit further growth of such operations. Therefore, first research has been performed on energy-efficient trajectory optimisation for a given required time of arrival, as the arrival phase is the most safety-critical flight phase with higher air traffic density and limited battery energy. However, research on the separation between eVTOL aircraft by computing their optimal required time of arrival (RTA) is limited. Besides, the available research has not considered limited battery power of the eVTOL aircraft or a limited vertiport landing pad capacity, neither discusses the ATC procedures for eVTOL flight. Unlike fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters in commercial aviation, eVTOL aircraft fly on-demand and have different flight dynamics, limited battery energy supply and a limited number of landing spots at a vertiport such as on top of high-rise buildings. Therefore, this research has aimed to take the first step in the development of Urban Air Mobility Traffic Management for autonomous on-demand eVTOL operations by developing the arrival procedures and arrival sequencing and scheduling tool searching for minimum total delay considering limited battery power and vertiport landing pad capacity. A concept of operations for vertiport terminal area airspace design has been proposed for a vertiport with one or two landing pads while making iterative use of the existing energy-efficient trajectory optimisation tool. A final approach area with a standard arrival route and two approach fixes is used to organise the flow inside the high-density area. Any scheduled delay is absorbed outside this area by flying a shallow descent, an approach fix detour or, only if necessary, in hover. The characteristics of the EHANG-184 multi-rotor eVTOL have been used throughout the research, such that a time separation requirement of 90s is determined. This work is the first to compute the optimal RTAs for eVTOLs to safely separate them for minimum delay based on remaining battery state of charge and vertiport capacity in three modules. Module 1 computes the most energy-optimal arrival trajectory for a set of different RTAs at the vertiport. The state and control vectors corresponding to this set of trajectories are fed intoModule 2. Also, the earliest and latest feasible arrival time based on flight dynamics, most energy-optimal arrival trajectory and the flight time between the approach fix and vertiport landing pad is obtained from this optimisation and fed intoModule 3. Module 2 is used to relate the initial eVTOL battery status to the scheduler in Module 3. It first computes the power required to perform each of the RTA trajectories using the flight dynamics. Afterwards, the power demand and the required SOC to perform each RTA trajectory are determined using a simplified battery model. A regression is then created between the RTAs and the required SOC to compute the latest possible landing time based on the initial SOC of each arriving eVTOL. This so-called RTA constraint is an input for Module 3. Module 3 is a mixed-integer linear programwhich ensures eVTOL separation and selects the arrival route and corresponding landing pad for minimum total delay. A column generation algorithm has been applied to enable delay absorption in hover. Besides, it contains a position shifting constraint with respect to the first-come-first-serve sequence and a rolling horizon algorithmto reduce the computational time required to solve themodel. The concept of operations and eVTOL arrival sequencing and scheduling tool have been tested for a proof of concept and afterwards validated using a hexagonal vertiport network and eVTOL arrival demand model for Houston, TX, USA. The number of eVTOLs expected to arrive has been obtained from the demand model, after which the expected time of arrival for each eVTOL has been modelled as a Poisson process. The initial state of charge of the arriving eVTOLs has been assumed to be normally distributed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-01-17","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

These heterogeneous mixtures of undissolved particles, referred to as suspensions, can be found all around us: e.g. in paints, blood, mudslides, landslides, etc. Moreover, due to some suspensions’ shear-thickening behaviour their use has been investigated for liquid-like body armor applications, new damper designs and many more. Yet, the core physical mechanism of their behaviour in its various regimes is still not completely understood. This thesis work employs the novel ultra-fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging methodology proposed by Alexander Penn, also a member of the ETH Zurich laboratory from which this work originates, to image non-intrusively into a shear-thickening suspension of cornstarch and water while a spherical intruder impacts and settles in its interior. First off, by fitting a rigid steel wire inside the settling object and imaging a marker on top of it with a high-speed camera, behaviours similar to those observed by von Kann et al. are evident: the intruder oscillates around a terminal velocity in the bulk of the suspension and experiences stop-and-go cycles near the container base. This act, however, inherently restricts motion by allowing the intruder to move only in the vertical direction. Therefore, we utilize 1D and 2D MR imaging to obtain information about the intruder’s horizontal and undisturbed vertical motion to draw conclusions that the object exhibits similar oscillations in amplitude and frequency also in the transverse component. In addition to those, we perform 2D velocity-encoded MRI scans to obtain the velocity and shear rate fields with sufficient time resolution to capture the suspension behaviour at the relevant phenomenological regimes. The data suggested that, on comparison with reference rheology experiments, the shear rates during the terminal velocity oscillations, resultant from the fluid inertia around the object as it settles, appear to be in close proximity to the critical shear rate for discontinuous shear thickening (DST, or an orders-of-magnitude jump in stress). To continue, 1D MRI measurements revealed a phenomenon new to us to be visible just after the impact: upon increasing mass, size, and drop height of intruders, the transient oscillations which transition to stable bulk oscillations were found to transform into several distinct stop-and-go cycles very much alike those that occur close to the container bottom. A qualitative physical mechanism was proposed based on the dependencies found in these behaviours. Last but not least, the effects of size while keeping the same buoyancy ratio were studied qualitatively. Direct evidence from all executed experiments confirmed secondary stable bulk oscillation regions for objects of larger size.","Magnetic Resonance Imaging; cornstarch suspension; granular system; soft matter; discontinuous shear thickening; settling object; velocity oscillations; stop-and-go cycles; impact solidification; SENSE reconstruction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","47.378234, 8.546192"

Therefore, every component of a PV system should be examined, as well as how their behaviour under operation affects performance to improve the overall PV yield. In particular the temperature of a module can have a negative impact on the power output. The drop in power output is a consequence of a negative thermal coefficient that results in a decrease of open circuit voltage with increasing temperature. For silicon solar cells, efficiency drops of 0.4-0.65%/°C have been reported in literature. Moreover, daily repetition of temperature cycles can cause mechanical degradation, thereby decreasing the lifetime of PV modules. In this thesis, phase change materials (PCM) have been studied as a method to passively reduce the operating temperature of PV modules. This is based on the ability of materials to stay at a relatively stable temperature during a phase change. By placing a PCM at the back of a PV module, the temperature difference between the module and the melting PCM causes a thermal gradient, resulting in conduction of heat away from the<br/>module. In order to find the optimal properties of a PCM, a thermal model was first developed in COMSOL Multiphysics and benchmarked with field measurements from literature. Simulations for Rotterdam, the Netherlands, revealed that an optimized PCM could increase the yearly electrical yield by 1.23% for a rack-mounted module, or 3.52% for a roof-mounted module. Furthermore, measurements were performed with commercially available PCMs under a Large Area Solar Simulator (LASS). These were able to reduce the average module temperature by 30-36°C, albeit under heavy infrared radiation coming from the simulator.","Phase change materials; Photovoltaics; Thermal management; Modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-18","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This can result in damage to ecology, infrastructure, disruption to human activities, injuries and in the worst-case scenario, loss of life (Biniyam et al., 2017). With the expected increase in the world’s population living in urban areas to 68% by 2050 (UN, 2018) and a more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events with a longer duration and higher intensity in the future (IPCC, 2012), there is a need to improve early warning system and disaster management (Restrepo-Estrada et al., 2017). Lopez et al. (2005) mentions that one of the key factors in hydrological models to determine accurate flood estimates is to have accurate rainfall input. However, many urban areas might lack this information because sensors are not available, or the number of sensors is too few to cover the entire region with an acceptable resolution (Restrepo-Estrada et al., 2017). Kidd et al. (2017) mentions that the density of rain gauges varies per region, with Europe and Eastern-Asia (including Japan) having a decent coverage by rain gauges, while the rest of the world has a sparse coverage of rain gauges. This study assesses the potential of citizen observatories for improving the spatial measurements of rainfall in comparison to a single professional station. Two types of citizen observatories are used, semi-professional stations (TU Delft) and citizen weather stations (Netatmo), that are located near the city of Rotterdam. In total there are 9 TU Delft stations and 73 Netatmo stations in a region of 256.7 km2. Based on a spatial variance analysis between these two types of citizen observatories and a professional station (KNMI) in the region, weighing factors are determined in order to merge and interpolate the data from the citizen observatories into a single rainfall map. This interpolated map is then compared to the radar rainfall maps, which are bias-corrected based on a network of professional ground stations (Overeem et al., 2016), and provide rainfall data with a 1x1 km spatial resolution. The baseline for improvement comes from the assumption that the rainfall measured by the KNMI station is uniform over the entire study area. By comparing the differences between KNMI and radar and citizen observatories and radar, it can be assessed whether the citizen observatories are an improvement. The results show that the interpolated rainfall maps are better at capturing the spatial structure of the rainfall event, both on the small-scale (10-minute timestep) and event-scale (total accumulation). When it comes to the actual rainfall values, it became clear that rainfall intensities within a 4 km radius from the KNMI station were better represented by the KNMI station while after a distance of 8 km, the citizen stations clearly helped give a better representation.<br","Citizen weather stations; Rainfall; spatial information","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

However, these approaches often include a variety of assumptions, are computationally intensive, and do not learn from failures. Recent work in deep reinforcement learning shows that navigational abilities could emerge as the by-product of an agent learning a policy that maximizes reward. Deep Q-Networks (DQN), a reinforcement learning algorithm, uses experience replay to remember and reuse experiences from the past. A sampling technique determents how to sample the experiences that are to be replayed from the experience replay buffer. Here we studied the effect of different sampling techniques on the learning behavior of an agent using DQN in partially observable navigation tasks. In this work five sampling techniques are proposed and compared to the original random sampling technique. We found that sampling techniques focusing on surprising experiences learn faster than random sampling techniques. Secondly, we found that the final performance of all sampling techniques usually converge to the same policy.

The objective of the study is to gain more knowledge about the hydrodynamics around and the kinematics of a submerged structure, to give a contribute to the research field of the submerged floating tunnel. For this study a rectangular cylinder with an aspect ratio (breadth-depth) of 2.5 is used. Two relative submergence depths (flume depth/model submergence) of 2.75 and 1.63 are tested. For all tests a still water depth of 0.7 m is applied. Waves resulting in very low KC numbers of &lt;1 for regular waves and KC[1+U_c/U_m ]&lt;2 for combined waves-current are generated. To create a combined wave-current environment, a current is created in the flume, to which waves are added by the wave generator. The water velocity is measured in front of the model. To approximate the water velocity at the model, a time/phase shift is added to the velocity signal. Linear wave theory is applied to approximate the amplitudes of the orbital velocities at the depth of the model. For the first part of the study, on the hydrodynamic forces, the cylinder is rigidly fixed in the flume. Due to the inertia dominance for low KC numbers, the relationship between the wave parameters and the hydrodynamic forces is well described by the relationship between the wave parameters and the water particle accelerations. The vertical hydrodynamic forces are found to be larger than the horizontal hydrodynamic forces. The force coefficients from this study are compared to coefficient found in previous studies. The drag coefficients for the only current tests agree well with the results from (Courchesne &amp; Laneville, 1979), (Bearman &amp; Trueman, 1972), (Nakaguchi, 1968) and (Venugopal, 2006). For the regular wave and combined wave-current conditions comparable results are found to those by Venugopal for a rectangular cylinder towed through a wave field (Venugopal, 2008). The drag coefficients in the present study show a similar trend in magnitude as in the study by Venugopal. However, the magnitudes have an opposite sign due to the velocity phase shift method applied in the present study. Nevertheless, the effect of this difference on the total force prediction is insignificant, because of inertia dominance. In general, the Morison equation predicts the measured horizontal force well for regular waves. Adding a current component to the waves results in a larger error between the computed Morison forces and the measured force. However, an increase in the magnitude of the added velocity does not lead to a significant increase of this error. The second part of the study focuses on the same cylinder, only not fixed but held in place by 4 tethers. For these tests a buoyancy to weight ratio of 1.5 is applied. The used tested angles between the tethers and the flume bottom are 30˚ and 70 ̊. The water depth, the wave types and model submergence depths are remained equal to the first part of the study. By comparing the kinematics found in three different configurations, a 30˚ tether angle combined with the largest submergence depth of ds=035 m are found to gives the smallest displacements and accelerations. To reduce the kinematics more, it is recommended to add vertical tethers to limit the vertical movement. In general, dynamic features are seen in the tethered model, influencing the magnitude of the kinematics. To predict the magnitude of the tether forces it is recommended to integrated these features in a structural dynamic model.","wave-current interaction; drag forces; intertia forces; rectangle; tether; submerged floating tunnel; Hydrodynamic; Morison's equation; Experimental; force coëfficients; kinematics; displacments; accelerations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

In the end, our research signifies two different types of IT infrastructure and governance approach, in which there is no superior or the best-fit for the implementation because the choice of infrastructure will depend on the contextual factors that affect the needed requirements.","AEOI Standard; Inter-organizational systems; tax data exchange","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology","",""

Through those platforms, the viewers have access to a huge volume of movies at any moment that makes the viewing decision for most of them a very challenging task. Recommender systems are employed by video-on-demand providers to address the former challenge. We propose a novel movie recommender system that filters movies based on the genre-related visual elements of their trailers. The proposed system utilizes a 3D pre-trained deep ConvNet to extract spatio-temporal deep features from the trailers which then are combined, through a Deep Bag of Segments (DBoS) pooling network, with the genre information of the movie to provide a single movie representation. The 3D deep visual genre-aware representation is exploited by a pure content-based filtering system to provide personalized recommendations to users. We conduct offline experiments with two datasets to evaluate the performance of our approach with respect to accuracy and beyond accuracy metrics. We also conduct an online experiment in a real-world streaming platform to evaluate the user perceived utility of the recommendations produced by a pure content-based recommender system using our proposed genre-aware movie descriptor against the same system using genre and visual 3D deep features. We conclude that a continuous genre representation, which reflects genre specific visual elements of the movie, provides interesting results in the content-based movie recommendation task. Exploring further its potential could bring important benefits to various tasks in the movie domain.","recommender systems; multimedia; deep learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

However, there are several sources that indicate that gaps and barriers exist which impede the sustainable development of many Mediterranean ports. In order to deal with the problems that are identified in ports and specifically in container terminals, which are closely related to their sustainable performance, a framework is developed. The creation of the Port Sustainability Assessment Framework (PSAF) allows the comparison of the current state of terminals with the desired state based on specific sustainability themes and consequently, evaluates their performance. Port sustainability is also approached by means of stakeholders' views and insights, throughout a questionnaire. The application of the framework in the case studies of Piraeus and Livorno, two container terminals of different sizes and challenges but both located in the Mediterranean area, proves that the concept of sustainability in the two container terminal case studies has not yet been embedded in the planning and operational phase as their sustainable performance is low. Another aspect that this master thesis addresses is the need to extend the Port of the Future Serious Game (PoFSG) in order to include in a realistic way port-city future developments and their potential impacts on the environment and the society, as well as to facilitate stakeholder engagement. Based on the results of the sustainability assessment, several weaknesses of the PoFSG are identified and tools are developed which can be useful for extending the PoFSG. The focus is mostly drawn upon two specific aspects: the scoring system of the measures' performance on “People, Planet and Profit” and the inclusion of relevant sustainability measures. Additionally, more general recommendations are made for the other aspects of the PoFSG.","Sustainability; Sustainable Port Development; greenports; Container terminal; Stakeholder engagement; Port of the Future Serious Game; Mediterranean Sea; assessment framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-17","","","","","",""

This research proposes a detection system for detecting origin hijacks, which is one of themost common anomalies seen on the Internet. Our detection system uses a filter-based approach. Each filter attempts to validate announcements seen by our detection system. Announcements that could not be verified by any filter are seen as origin hijacks. Because of this approach, origin hijacks that would otherwise be missed by other solutions will be detected. We use multiple data sources such as RIR Statistics Exchange Format Listings (RSEF), routing registries, RPKI Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) and CAIDA’s AS relationship dataset in order to validate announcements. Upon running our detection system on 29 days of BGP traffic, we were able to detect 902 origin hijacks. 83% of the detected origin hijacks had a lifespan of fewer than 2.5 hours which strongly suggests that these were undesired announcements.","BGP; Origin Hijack Detection; Filter-based","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a case study, data from the future DAP doublet (TU Delft) is inserted wherein multiple scenarios are researched that model variations in well capacity, energy prices, project design, government policies, brine gas content and heat demand available. For the case study, the model considers technical and economic uncertainties over a period of 50 years. These uncertainties are incorporated in the form of probability distributions and 15000 Monte Carlo iterations. By modeling these scenarios, an overview is developed of the economic performance of a deep district heating project based on the Net Present Value (NPV), Levelized Cost of Heat (LCOH), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Profitability Index (PI) and payback time. Additionally, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Dutch subsidy scheme is researched combined with the main financial obstacles associated with geothermal exploitation. The reference scenario of the case study resulted in a 90% probability of a positive NPV with a median PI of 1.5. Higher returns are delivered from scenarios where the subsidy policies were altered in a way that they are more suitable for district heating purposes. A scenario where high constant demand was simulated combined with an extra initial investment for the purpose of heat storage, resulted in the best performing scenario overall. Considering the demand available for this case study, the fixed operational cost, SDE base sum and gas/water ratio are the most important parameters in terms of NPV sensitivity. In order to achieve the desired growth of the Dutch geothermal sector, focus should be aimed at the realization of sufficient heat network deployment, heat storage options and more project specific subsidies.","Direct use geothermal; Economic uncertainty; Heat; Probabilisitic analysis; Techno-economic analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

Despite the apparent result of these electrical interventions, understanding of the mechanism behind neural stimulation is still inadequate. The use of optical monitoring during implantation is limited due to the use of opaque electrode partially blocking the implantation site. While the use of transparent conductor for an electrode is not uncommon in general electronics where indium tin oxide (ITO) is widely used for displays, however ITO is not suitable for implantation due to its brittle nature[1]. An alternative material to fabricate transparent electrodes is graphene, a single layer of carbon atom forming sp2 hybridization. Its high charge mobility, flexibility, mechanical strength, and optical transparency make it suitable for various flexible electronics applications including implantable microelectrode arrays. In biomedical fields, graphene has shown potential application as biosensor, stimulation and recording electrode[2]. Although fabrication of graphene microelectrodes has been previously shown[3], graphene had to be transferred manually for each layer. The high temperature needed during graphene deposition makes device fabrication directly on the flexible material impossible. Instead, the fabrication process relies on a transferring process of graphene layer from a growing medium with a high thermal budget to another desired substrate. The manual transfer process of graphene is a skill-dependant process with low scalability. In this work, a method of fabricating encapsulated graphene electrodes in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with a controlled wafer-scale graphene transfer is proposed. Graphene transfer is done by wafer-assisted PDMS-PDMS bonding. The novel use of PDMS as an encapsulation material for graphene electrode is due to its biocompatibility, flexibility and optical transmittance. The transferred graphene was patterned on the PDMS by using oxygen plasma. Holes with a diameter of 10 μm was able to be patterned while maintaining the conductivity of the graphene layer. A combination of titanium and aluminium was used as metal contacts, the titanium provides a good contact resistance to graphene layer while aluminium allows wire bonding process to be performed on the contacts. Difference in material characteristics, such as the thermal expansion coefficient has become one of the challenges during the fabrication process. Despite these challenges, the fabrication process for the electrode array was designed and tested. Conductivity of the patterned graphene layer was tested. The optical transmittance measurement showed up to 77% transmittance was achieved on the graphene encapsulated by PDMS.","Graphene; Electrode array; Flexible encapsulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

These openings, also known as tidal inlets, can either be natural or man-made and they highly determine the hydrodynamics within the lagoon system. Tidal inlet systems are found worldwide, and many of them are difficult to be understood due to their complex processes and lack of data. One of these systems is Lake Bardawil. Lake Bardawil, is located at the North coast of the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt and its ecological value is of great importance. Its existence mainly depends on the presence of three inlets which connect the lagoon with the Mediterranean Sea, called Boughaz 1, Boughaz 2 and Zaranik inlet. Boughaz 1 is located in the western side of the lake while Boughaz 2 and Zaranik are in the eastern side. <br/>One of the recent researches that is carried out by the Dredging, Environmental and Marine Engineering (DEME), The Weather Makers (TWM) and Lanters (2016), studied how the ecosystem and the fish population of Lake Bardawil can be restored by new hydraulic interventions. This thesis is an extension of the aforementioned work, but current focus is put on the determination of an innovative design and associated methodology which is based on natural design elements and can improve the functionality of Boughaz 1 inlet.<br/>Boughaz 1 was constructed in 1955 to allow the water exchange between the sea and the lagoon. Over the passing years, it has been subjected to a reduced tidal prism resulting in poor water quality in the lagoon, limited fish migration from the sea and sedimentation causes the need for dredging maintenance works. This led to the construction of breakwaters in 1985 until 1995 for the stabilization of the inlet and for the protection of the fish population in the lagoon. Although, the dredging works and constructed breakwaters minimized the abrupt sedimentation through the inlet and improved its stability in short term, the natural behavior of the system is gradually changed which worsen these conditions in longer term. For that reason, a design methodology is carried out to understand and improve the functionality of the Boughaz 1 inlet. The design methodology is based on the most important natural design elements, namely inlet cross sectional area, approach channel and inlet nourishment. Numerical models (Delft3D and Delft3D FM) are used to assess the influence of the different designs on the functionality of the system. A hydrodynamic analysis is carried out for each design element to define the final combined design of the initial phase of this design process. This final design is examined under hydrodynamics and the initial deposition and erosion patters. It is concluded that the functionality of the Boughaz 1 inlet can be optimized with the adapted design methodology. The tidal prism and flow velocities have been increased while the aim to mimic nature is validated with the initial deposition and erosion patterns.<br","Lake Bardawil; Design methodology; tidal inlet system; Boughaz 1","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-01-16","","","","","",""

Settlements of 8 - 70 mm have been measured at the Kiltunnel and of 7 - 30 mm at the Heinenoordtunnel while settlements in the range of 0 - 1 mm were expected. Both sites are investigated through non-invasive geophysical site investigation method MASW (Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves) for each 2.5 meter along the length of the tunnel and invasive site characterisation method CPT's (Cone Penetration Tests).The settlement of immersed tunnels is similar to that of a shallow foundation. It can be modelled using the Mayne equation which uses the small strain shear stiffness and the degradation of secant stiffness based on the load compared to the ultimate bearing resistance. The initial settlement can not have caused the settlements that were measured, because the initial settlement have already occurred at this time. The 5% and 95% boundaries of the creep settlements for both tunnels is much smaller than the measured settlements. To see if cyclic loading has an effect on the settlement of the middle section the effect of thermal expansion and contraction of the elements and the cyclic loading of the tides is examined.The expansion of the Gina Gaskets between the flat element and the elements at an angle is between -3 and 3 mm. This expansion and contraction of the Gina Gasket causes a vertical load on each of the edges of the middle element of 268 kN. This means that it does have a small influence on the settlement of both tunnels measured at these joints but does not explain all occurred settlement. For an indication of the settlement of the Heinenoordtunnel and the Kiltunnel under the loading of the tides a few calculations have been performed using an assumed lower bound of 40% and an upper bound of 90% of loading of the tides. At the Heinenoord the lower bound scenario gave results between 4.99 - 7.51 mm, which means that the measured values of around 7 mm are within the range of the results, while the upper bound scenario gave results between 10.05 and 15.57 mm which is larger than the measured values. At the Kiltunnel at location 21 and 23 the lower bound is more accurate, at location 19, 25 and 27 the upper bound is more accurate while for location 29 the measured settlement is somewhere in between the two bounds. At location 19 even the 95 % of the upper bound (21.34 mm) is much smaller than the measured settlement (around 34 mm). The difference in shear wave velocity is not that large and can not explain the large difference in settlement while the information from the CPT's is so limited that it is not possible to determine if there is a difference between location 19 and the other locations.","Immersed tunnels; Settlement; Shallow foundations; Static loading; Creep; Cyclic loading; Temperature; Tide","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also find that the investigated algorithmic mediation features do not significantly affect retrieval effectiveness.

Additionally, environmental laws make the disposal of waste streams from industries difficult. In this scenario, it is crucial to treat waste streams to recover water and possibly minerals, for reuse in the industry, reducing the dependency on new resources. Reverse osmosis (RO) is a membrane-filtration technology that has been in use for decades. RO systems can waste up to 30% of the feed water through the production of brine, containing the rejected minerals. This rejection is high when dealing with saline waters. Treatment of this brine stream for reclamation of water would increase the overall efficiency of RO systems. In this research, the treatment of RO brine by a closed-circuit configuration of RO – closed-circuit desalination (CCD) - is investigated. In CCD, filtration is done in batches, with the recirculation of the concentrate stream back into the feed stream. The high cross-flow velocity and short filtration batches result in prevention of scaling in these systems. <br/>This research focused on proving the resilience of the CCD system to silica scaling despite supersaturations of silica. Lab-scale experiments were performed on a single-element CCD system, specially built with relevant measurement instruments. Silica scaling was monitored by mass transfer coefficient (MTC) calculations, silica mass balance calculations, and membrane autopsies. Synthetic feed water was used, containing only NaCl (10 mg/L) and varying concentrations of silica (70 – 120 mg/L as SiO2). No anti-scalants were used. Longer experiments were performed, i.e. 20 consecutive cycles of 1 hour each with 120 mg/L of silica in the feed. The cycle duration was increased, 2 cycles of 3-hour each were performed, with 120 mg/L of silica in the feed.<br/>The MTC curves in all the experiments had a gradual decline with the progression of each cycle, but always recovered at the beginning of the next cycle. This decline was probably due to the increasing osmotic pressure in the recirculation loop. There was no permanent decline in the MTC, leading to the observation that there was no scaling in the system. This was supported by the silica in the mass balance calculations, that showed there was no loss of silica from the brine. The reactive silica concentration in the brine was as high as 1800 mg/L in the 3-hour cycle, attaining a recovery of 93%, without signs of scaling. The membrane autopsy showed that the membranes used for the experiments with 120mg/l silica in the feed had higher silicon content compared to the blanks. However, there were too few samples to compare against and make strong conclusions whether there was scaling. <br/>Thus, the designed CCD system was resistant to silica scaling in these conditions, of high pH and in the absence of other components such as iron, aluminium, calcium and magnesium. The results of this study proved that, despite high concentrations of silica in the feed, CCD can improve the total efficiency of RO systems (with regard to the water wastage) by recovering water from the brine produced by RO installations. The extremely high recoveries attained by the system would result in small volumes of very concentrated brine, making the extraction of minerals more cost-effective, because lesser volumes must be treated to obtain the same amount of minerals.","silica scaling; closed-circuit desalination; batch RO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Among the most evolving are autonomous robots, machines and vehicles, enormously extending human capabilities. While this trend became quite familiar for land-based vehicles, innovations in the underwater domain lag behind, mainly due to the harsh environmental conditions encountered. This in large contrast with worldwide growing needs for autonomous underwater solutions, like dredging. Nevertheless, for underwater vehicles becoming autonomously, various technological challenges must be overcome. The most essential one is finding a proper answer to the question; where in the underwater world am I? Autonomous robots are usually be able to operate in complex environments using external reference systems such as Global Positioning System (GPS) to locate themselves inside their environment. However, these are not accessible in underwater applications, since water strongly attenuates electromagnetic signals, notably GPS. Hence, various alternative methods for Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) for underwater applications are employed, among which the method of anchoring inertial measurements on environmental landmarks, perceived with an exteroceptive Sonar. The ultimate goal of this procedure is to correct for errors in the inertial measurements, using the environmental perception available in the Sonar scans. Nevertheless, due to practical underwater issues, it still is not readily available and even barely investigated in open scientific research. This thesis aims at the development of an underwater localization algorithm, using onboard inertial sensors and Sonar. The overall system design consists of several individual software procedures, executing certain assignments, together ultimately solving for the localization task. The developed system was tested using ground truth in form of a real-world dataset obtained several years ago in an abandoned marina. This showed that most individual procedures were able to provide good results, while having a low computational complexity in relation to online operations. However, it is quite a challenge to obtain results accurate enough to properly correct for positional errors, by using the designed system. Although showing potential, it still is not entirely decent in terms of accuracy and computational burden. This is likely due to the sparsity of the extracted Sonar measurements. Data is lacking to further verify the system, hence several questions remain open regarding its universal applicability in case of different scenarios, dynamic environments and long trajectories. In this context, more in-depth research is needed into the algorithms that are influenced by the Sonar measurements, to increase the accuracy of the overall system, while gaining more insight in its computational behaviour. Additionally, also more real-world experiments are essential, to extensively verify the designed system. In conclusion, the results showed that it is possible to correct for inertial errors, using the system developed. Furthermore, it demonstrates that most procedures individually produce good results in real-time. Hence, this study can be seen as a positive step in the right direction, forming a basis for future research in solutions that are generically applicable in online real underwater world operations.","Underwater; Localization; Mapping; Sonar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-01-16","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

By doing so, the maneuverability of the vehicle could be enhanced. To enable systems that can control this behaviour, estimation of certain vehicle states is needed with high accuracy and high frequency.In this project, a new solution to this problem is proposed by combining a mixed dynamic-kinematic observer with a single camera that produces velocity measurements based on tracking the ground plane. To improve filtering of the camera velocity measurements, the measurement error covariance matrix is updated online based on a model of the camera measurement error. Evaluation of the new methodology was done on data recorded from a 1:10 scale test vehicle and performance was assessed based on ground truth data obtained using a Motion Capture System.In normal driving conditions with correctly identified vehicle parameters, an observer without camera performs better by 25% in terms of RMSE on lateral velocity and sideslip angle estimation. However, the online adaptation of the covariance matrix results in an estimate that is at least 45% more accurate in terms of RMSE than the same observer without online covariance adaptation. Next to that, experiments show that the proposed observer with camera has better robustness to uncertainty in model parameters by almost a factor five in terms of RMSE than the observer without camera.When the grip of the tires is physically lowered and the vehicle is drifting, the proposed observer can track large sideslip angles (&gt;30°), where the state-of-the-art observer without camera is not able. The state-of-the-art observer has an increase in RMSE of 75% on all estimated quantities in comparison to the proposed methodology. These results show that adding a camera to an existing sideslip angle observer greatly enhances robustness of the observer to uncertainty in model parameters and violation of model assumptions. This comes dat the cost of losing some accuracy in normal driving conditions.","sideslip estimation; computer vision; vehicle dynamics control; covariance calculation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

To this end, this thesis seeks to combine, improve and implement existing strategies to solve the persistent surveillance task for a swarm of MAVs operating in a greenhouse environment.<br/>Broadly speaking, the persistent surveillance task seeks to find the optimal paths for a swarm of MAVs such that every point within the Mission Space (MS) is visited and they must minimise the time between successive visits. This will ensure that the MAVs are able fly through the entire greenhouse to collect up-to-date data about all the crops and the local environment. Naturally, on a physical system one has to deal with the limited flight times of the MAVs. This factor becomes very important to the effectiveness of the solution and is critical to the continuous operation of the MAVs.<br/>In literature, many methods have be proposed to solve this task, but the majority are still only tested in simulation. As a result, many works do not consider some physical constraints that will be applied to the system during implementation in a real-world setting. For example, in most cases the authors do not consider the limited fuel available to the agents or they do not consider a practical alternative indoor positioning system to GPS. In this work the problem has been divided into two main sub-tasks, namely; the persistent surveillance task and the refuelling task.<br/>For the persistent surveillance task it was decided to implement a reactive controller, in the form of an evolved Neural Network (NN), which was run on-board the MAVs. The NN used positional information from the other members of the swarm along with limited environmental information to supply its MAV with a command velocity. These NN controllers could achieve coverage levels of over 95% while simultaneously avoiding collisions between 8 MAVs in a 25m x 25m MS. Later, this method was shown to be robust to failures and scalable in terms of both MS and swarm size.<br/>When dealing with the fuel constraints, a Behaviour Tree (BT) was used to determine when the MAV should return to the depot. Surprisingly, when combined with the NN controllers the system experienced an increase in performance across all the defined metrics. No MAV failed due to low fuel levels, coverage increased to 97.41%, average cell age to 52.39s and the number of tests were no collisions were recorded more than doubled. This increase in performance was attributed to the fact that the refuelling periodically drew the MAV towards the centre of the MS. This is counter to the evolved behaviours of the NN where the MAVs would mainly focus their attention around the edges of the MS.<br","Persistent Surveillance; MAV; NEAT; NN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The failure mode identification is facilitated by a principal component analysis (PCA), which analyzes the features extracted from the power measurements of the electromotor. The RUL estimation is facilitated by the use of a hidden semi-Markov model, which is trained and tested on the same sensor data as the PCA. The framework is then implemented in a real-world environment to identify the failure mode and to predict the moment of failure in the future. The framework evaluation reveals that the model prediction show better results then a naive prediction.","HSMM; RUL; Rail; Markov models; Principal Component Analysis; Failure Prediction; Predictive Maintenance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-01-01","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Patients with 1p/19q co-deleted low grade glioma (LGGs) have better prognosis and react better to certain treatments than patients with intact 1p/19q LGG. Currently, information about the 1p/19q co-deletion status is obtained by means of an invasive procedure called biopsy. As an alternative, non-invasive techniques to extract this information from medical images are being studied. Recent research suggests that local binary patterns (LBPs), a textural image descriptor, are an important feature which can predict the 1p/19q co-deletion from MRI scans. In this project we report the effect of including LBP information in a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the 1p/19q co-deletion status in patients suffering from a presumed LGG using pre-operative MRI scans. A combination of convolutional filters was designed and included in the CNN, resulting into local binary convolutional neural networks (LBCNNs). Three LBP descriptors, each of them representing a different textural scale, were studied, as well as the combination of the three. A default CNN without LBPs was also studied. To validate the designed filters and to study more sophisticated LBPs images like the uniform LBPs, pre-computed LBP images were directly input to the CNN. An in-house multi-institution MRI dataset consisting of 284 patients who had undergone a biopsy or resection before the treatment, and with available pre-operative T1-weighted post contrast and T2-weighted scans was used to train the different network architectures. An independent dataset consisting of 129 patients was used to validate the results. The performance of the LBCNNs was compared to the performance of the CNN. The performance of the CNN and LBCNNs was similar, reporting an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) ranging from 0.816 to 0.872 for the different architectures. These findings suggest that the CNN can extract information relative to LBPs by itself. In addition, pre-computed uniform LBPs report similar metrics (AUC: 0.819), suggesting that they do not add new information.","Deep Learning; Low Grade Gliomas; 1p/19q co-deletion; Convolutional Neural Network; Local Binary Patterns; Radiogenomics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The idea behind using a Trombe wall is that heat, ventilation and comfort can be passively generated by using the ‘free’ energy of the sun. The surface of the wall absorbs solar radiation when the sun shines, stores the energy and releases the heat at night to the room, when the occupants need it (Saadatian, Lim, Sopian, &amp; Salleh, 2013). In addition, a Trombe wall can be used as natural ventilation system, of which its power is generated by the buoyancy effect in the cavity. Because a traditional Trombe wall is heavy, blocks daylight and cannot be adjusted to changing environmental conditions and seasonal differences, a new and innovative version was devised by the Double Face research team (4TU). The innovative version is called a lightweight translucent adaptable Trombe wall (LTATW) and is about five times lighter than a traditional Trombe wall. In addition, the wall is translucent and can rotate around its axes. The lower weight and translucent character are achieved by applying a phase change material in combination with aerogel, instead of stone or bricks. Phase change materials can store a large amount of (latent) heat during the change from solid to liquid state and thus, increase the thermal inertia of the system. The translucent elements are located in front of a glass façade and act as a thermal buffer in both winter and summer by rotating the elements towards the source of incoming heat or towards the sink for heat release (4TU.Bouw, 2014). In the winter, the layer of PCM is oriented towards the outdoor environment at daytime and is thermally charged by the low winter sun. At night, the system rotates and releases the accumulated heat to the interior. In the summer, the LTATW is oriented towards the interior at daytime to store the interior heat loads and during the night, it rotates again and releases the heat to the outside environment by means of (passive) night ventilation (4TU.Bouw, 2014).In this thesis, the results of a numerical spin-off study of the Double Face research project are shown, in which the influence of eight parameters (climate, building function, orientation, age, building method, room size, window size and type of glazing) on the energy and comfort performance of the innovative Trombe wall has been studied. First, an initial simulation model was developed in Matlab/Simulink, which was subsequently validated using a cross-comparison with results from DesignBuilder. After validation, the initial model has been extended to a suitable and reliable final version, with which more than 6000 different situations were simulated. The results of the simulations are values for the reduction or increase in energy demand for heating and cooling, expressed in percentages or in kWh. All results are processed in multiple designer tables, which interested designers can consult to assess whether installing the Trombe wall is useful for his or her situation, or not. In addition to the development of designer tables, the influence of each individual parameter on the performance of the Trombe wall was investigated using modeFRONTIER. It was found that in case of heating only a cold and temperate climate support a proper operation of the Trombe wall, since no heating is required in the other climate types. From the analysis, it was concluded that in relative sense (%), the Trombe wall performs best in a temperate climate, and that in absolute sense (kWh), the Trombe wall performs best in a cold climate. In case of cooling, the system performs best in a temperate climate and in a dry climate. Because the LTATW is designed to be both a passive cooling system in the summer and passive heating system in the winter, it has clearly been proven that only the temperate climate is the most logical choice. The average reduction of the heating energy demand in a temperate climate equals 36.1% (or 181.3 kWh per year) and the average reduction of the cooling energy demand equals 49.9% (or 115.0 kWh per year). Analysis of the second parameter, building function, has shown that in case of heating the function is not of great influence. The system performs well in both an office and a residence. In case of cooling, higher reductions of the energy demand are achieved in residences. Thirdly, the influence of the orientation of the Trombe wall was investigated and it was found that the best performance in case of heating occurs on a southern orientation. In case of cooling, the orientation is of less importance. The study shows that the age of a building does not have a major influence on the performance of the Trombe wall. Only in case of cooling, a slight preference can be expressed for new buildings. Studying the influence of the construction method on the performance of the wall has shown that this parameter has the least influence of all studied parameters. In both light-weight, medium-weight and heavy-weight buildings, a good performance can be achieved. For the size of the room, it was found that both room sizes perform equally well. It could be concluded that a Trombe wall can be installed in both small rooms and big rooms, but that when a room is too big, the capacity of the Trombe wall will no longer be useful to reduce a large amount of the initial energy demand. The same applies to cooling. Research has shown that for heating purposes, a room with a smaller window is more often preferred and for cooling purposes, a large window. Because the innovative Trombe wall will have to serve as both a passive heating and cooling device, an average size window will therefore probably be the most suitable. Finally, the influence of type of glazing was studied. It became clear that in relative terms the largest reductions of the heating energy demand are achieved with clear glazing. In case of cooling, the type of glazing is of less influence. Multiple sensitivity analyses were carried out to study the influence on the results of conditions that are easily affected by building occupants, and finally, a side-study was carried out into the influence of the Trombe wall on the energy demand for artificial lighting. It was found that even under slightly different circumstances the same conclusions can be drawn with regard to the influence of the parameters. The influence of the Trombe wall on the energy demand for artificial lighting is not negligible and should be carefully considered too.","Trombe Wall; Phase change materials; Passive Design; Building technology; Energy and comfort","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor); Qin, Z. (graduation committee); Narayan, N.S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","In 2018, 1.1 billion people still lacked access to energy services. Most of these people are located in remote areas which are hard to reach, especially with conventional methods of grid extension. Even if the number of people without energy access is decreasing and the number of people gaining access to electricity through renewable sources is increasing, there are still some issues that need to be overcome. Historically speaking, the three main options to fill the electrification gap have been: grid extension, decentralized Solar Home Systems (SHS) and microgrids. The first option presents high costs and high transmission losses, which make it impractical to use to provide remote communities with energy access. Solar Home Systems are cheaper but are limited in terms of power output and cope badly with the phenomenon of electrification ladder. Finally, microgrids and DC low-voltage PV-powered microgrids, in particular, would solve all the issues related to the aforementioned options, thanks to the possibility of energy sharing among users and the decentralized nature of the microgrid. Nonetheless, the monetization barrier (investors struggle to get a profit out of rural microgrids) and the lack of economic incentives for the users, are preventing, the deployment of these microgrids. Because of this, this master thesis will focus on the development of a decentralized market platform, which will enable energy sharing, provide economic incentives for the users of the microgrid and allow the monetization of such solution for any investor and third party. The main source of novelty<br/>brought about by this thesis is an innovative pricing system for the congestion and utilization of transmission lines. Thanks to this system, a common monetary fund is collected by the community at the end of the year. This fund can be used to repay investors, invest in maintenance and for microgrid-extension projects. The simple introduction of such pricing system and common monetary fund opens several scenarios for the implementation of unprecedented<br/>business models. The efficacy of the market platform in solving the energy access issue, the lack of incentives for the users and the monetization barrier, is assessed through simulations based on optimized microgrid topologies for real-life remote communities. The load profiles and generation profiles are obtained<br/>through a statistical model, which generates load profiles in accordance with the multi-tier framework for energy access. The performances of the decentralized market platform are also compared with those of a centralized platform.<br/>The results of the simulations show how the decentralized market platform reaches all of its design objectives. In fact, the microgrid experiences a reduction in loss of load and consequently an improvement of power supply availability and energy access conditions. Moreover, it is shown how, every year, a significant share of the users realizes an economic profit as a consequence of the energy trades enabled by the market platform. Finally, the simulations prove how the pricing system for the utilization of the transmission lines, avoids line congestion and actually produces a common monetary fund by the end of each year.<br","Electrification; Microgrids; Market Design; Agent-based modeling; Energy Sharing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-15","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

The dataset is split in a training (80 %) and validation (20 %) set such that no data from a person in the training set is in the validation set. Implementations of convolutional neural networks for the video frames and micro-Doppler signatures obtain classification accuracies of 85.78 % and 63.12 % respectively for previously mentioned activities. It was not possible to distinguish a person walking and walking carrying a backpack on basis of the micro-Doppler signatures. The synchronised dataset is used to investigate different fusion methods.

For these conditions, the diameter of the monopile will have to increase beyond current manufacturing capacities. The slip joint connection can provide a means to construct monopiles out of smaller segments, thereby removing the limitations to its application. A slip-joint consists of two inverted conical sections made of steel plates, placed one over the other. the upper conical section is connected to the transition piece and the lower conical section is connected to the monopile. It was found in preceding research related to the vibration assisted installation of the slip-joint, that the frequency of the vibratory force is the key to the successful installation of a slip-joint. The applied vibrations of specific resonance frequencies were found to be effective in the settlement of the slip-joint. A finite element (FE) model created in his work, failed to predict the exact resonance frequencies as observed in experimental modal analysis. The main objective of this thesis was to replicate the results obtained by experimental modal analysis during dedicated lab experiments at TU Delft, by including the components from experimental setup in a FE model. These components include the top and the bottom baseplates which are connected to the monopile and transition piece respectively, the load beam on which the external static load is applied, and machine mounts connected to bottom base plate. Further in this thesis, the FE model is modified in various ways to investigate the difference between the predicted and the observed natural frequencies of the setup. Factors like wall thickness of the cones, elasticity of the steel and stiffness of the machine mount which affect the global stiffness of the combined system are studied. As observed in the experiments that the monopile and the transition piece are not in perfect contact with each other due to the geometrical shape of the monopile, it has been tried to incorporate this observation in the FE model and see the impact of imperfect contact on the results of modal analysis. After investigating the effects of the above mentioned factors and modifications, the FE model was able to replicate the order of the modal shapes, but not the natural frequencies obtained by experimental modal analysis. Additionally, the stiffness near the contact region between upper and lower cone was found to be a key factor affecting the natural frequencies.","Monopile; Slip-joint; Modal Analysis; Numerical Validation; Offshore","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The motivation behind the research is miniaturization of state-of-the-art spectropolarimeters. The requirements for the instrument are derived from SPEXone instrument, as a reference instrument. Beside the miniaturization, two additional requirements are set as a goal: possibility to measure full-Stokes vector of polarization (including circular polarization), and to improve the spectropolarimetric resolution. The reduction in the volume of the instrument is not the main advantage, but also reduction in the number of optical components with respect to the state-of-the-art. A spectropolarimeter with fewer components allows better stability of performances over different external conditions like temperature change, and easier alignment of the whole system. <br/>In recent years the dielectric metasurfaces attract a lot of attention. Firstly, due to its compatibility to CMOS detector technology, which allows integration of thin layers of metasurfaces directly on the detector array, and secondly due to high transmission of the dielectric materials. The metasurface is an array of scatterers with period and size of scatterers smaller than the wavelength. With proper design, the complete control of electromagnetic waves is possible, including amplitude, phase, and polarization at subwavelength resolution. This is convenient because diffraction is not present at that scale. That enables to design optical devices like lenses, waveplates, polarizing beam splitters with similar performances as current technology, but with extreme reduction in thickness. In this thesis, a systematic electromagnetic performance analysis of metasurfaces is presented. Two types of metasurfaces are designed, first acting as a waveplate, and second as a linear polarizer at different spectral wavelengths. Also, a trade-off of the most suitable spectropolarimetric techniques is done, which led to the Division of Focal Plane (DoFP) type of polarimeter. The combination of these two layers of metasurfaces can modulate the polarization state of light in form of the intensity of light, which is measured on detector pixels. It is shown that with this technique, four unique pixels, each with different polarization modulation, are required to reconstruct four unknowns, the Stokes vector, which fully describes the state of polarization of incident light. Furthermore, the spectral information is measured by designing different sets of four pixels to filter out different parts of the spectrum. The result is two-dimensional detector array which measures spectrum in the vertical axis, and spatial information in the horizontal axis. The spatial information in the vertical axis is achieved by implementing the push broom concept of a satellite. Moreover, the important spectropolarimetric parameters like spectropolarimetric accuracy, spectropolarimetric resolution, and operating spectrum range are estimated.

The DRS behind it protects the hinterland through an approximate three to four meter thick layer of quarry rock. When waves travel obliquely through this Block Dam and interact with the DRS, stones are transported in alongshore direction. This process is called Longshore Transport (LT) and will have erosion and accretion of stones to effect along the DRS. In order to maintain the layer thickness of this stone layer, PUMA made a prognosis on LT for the coming 50 years after construction. From this prognosis a nourishment campaign was set-up, consisting of volumes of stone PUMA expected to nourish every 2.5 years. After a maintenance period of five years it was concluded by PUMA that the nourishment volumes were lower than expected. Therefore this thesis assessed where differences in the prognosis of PUMA on LT and the observed LT rates over the period 2013 to 2018 come from. Within their prognosis, PUMA made use of a dimensional LT relation. As this specifically calibrated Longshore Transport relation is only applicable for the computation of LT rates at a structure containing the characteristics of the DRS at Maasvlakte 2, this research looked into the possibilities of using a non-dimensional Longshore Transport relation for the computation of Longshore Transport rates at the DRS of Maasvlakte 2.","longshore transport; coarse-grained; Maasvlakte 2; dynamic rock slope; dynamic stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","51.987801, 4.006424"

The two methods show different results in their cueing fidelity assessment of four CWA configurations. An experiment with six pilots is performed in the SIMONA Research Simulator to test the capability of EMD and OMCT to predict the cueing fidelity as perceived by pilots. The subjects perform pairwise comparisons between the four CWA configurations by exciting the short period dynamics of the aircraft.

A cogeneration system allows for a more efficient utilization of energy and lowered emissions. What makes such a system especially interesting is that the revenue of the generated electrical power can outweigh the extra costs required to operate a gas turbine for producing a specific amount of thermal energy. The technical challenge, covered in this thesis, consists of improving a gas turbine for cogeneration applications relative to a classic burner. The solution can be found in reduction of the high stack losses, as these comprise the main disadvantage of firing a boiler with a gas turbine. This research focuses specifically on cogeneration with the PowerBurner, a gas turbine developed and manufactured by Innecs Power Systems, located in Ter Aar, the Netherlands. <br/><br/>The goal of this study was to identify, analyze and conceptualize methods that reduce the stack losses of a PowerBurner used for the production of steam. Implementation of such methods should allow the PowerBurner to become a more attractive alternative for steam production compared to a conventional burner. Four concepts were identified which could improve operation of a cogeneration gas turbine: Steam injection, flue gas recirculation, supplementary firing and implementation of a boiler in the combustion chamber, the Velox boiler.<br/><br/>A thermodynamic model of a gas turbine was created in Thermoflex. The model was based on the design point specification of the PowerBurner, from which it deviates less than 1% at any point in the process. Implementation of steam injection was able to induce the largest increase the electrical efficiency, from 10.5% to 20%, whereas flue gas recirculation resulted in the highest increase in total efficiency, from 85% to 95%. With supplementary firing and the Velox-type boiler, the thermal capacity and -efficiency could be increased the most, from 2 MW to 6.8 MW and from 74% to 90%, respectively. <br/><br/>The profitability of each setup compared to making use of a conventional burner for an equal thermal output was determined. Supplementary firing allows for the most profitable operation. A qualitative cost analysis showed that supplementary-fired setup required the least capital expenditures. From a combination of the thermodynamic and economic characteristics, the supplementary-fired PowerBurner was chosen to be the best alternative for replacing a conventional burner for the production of steam. <br/><br/>A conceptual design of a burner for such an application was created in ANSYS Fluent. The design was able to operate with fuel inputs of at least 0.485 MW up to 4.85 MW. 100% Combustion efficiency was achieved over the full range. Pressure losses over the burner are low at 1.6 mbar. Whether the current burner design results in a stable flame cannot be determined from the model. A NOX analysis in Fluent indicated that the emissions of NOx are over the Dutch regulation standards for gas turbines, but the accuracy of this result is not known. Therefore, future research is required to determine flame stability and pollutant emissions.<br","Gas turbine; Cogeneration; combined heat and power; stack loss; supplementary firing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Replacing teeth is required, since neighboring teeth can move and reposition in undesired positions if there is an empty space. A dental implant consists of three parts, a dental prosthetic (crown), an abutment and the implant which is fixated in the bone. <br/><br/>Dental implants are placed during a surgical procedure performed by an oral surgeon. For this project five surgeries are observed to gain more insights in this procedure. The total treatment takes long, because in between different steps of the procedure bone healing is required. The main concerns of patients are the long treatment time, anxiety and stress. Next to that, there is a failure rate of 3-5% which is mainly caused by loosening of the implant due to a lack of osseointegration and infection, also called peri-implantitis.<br/><br/>Developments to promote osseointegration and to prevent infection are taking place. Additive manufacturing techniques are used to promote osseointegration. Research into antimicrobial surfaces is aimed to lower the risk of infection. <br/><br/>Based on the analysis of the problem and the developments that are taking place a new type of dental implant is designed. The new implants are patient-specific and have a porous structure to promote osseointegration. The implants are made to be placed immediately after extraction.<br/><br/>The implant is designed based on the following design features: Shape, structure, abutment, stability and antimicrobial surface. <br/><br/>Shape<br/>The patient-specific shape is retrieved from a CBCT scan of the jaw of a patient. The required data of the tooth that needs to be replaced is collected. Using image segmentation software, the particular root of the to be replaced tooth is isolated. <br/><br/>Structure<br/>A porous structure is created to allow bone-ingrowth. A computational method can be used to create the desired porosity inside the implant. <br/><br/>Abutment and antimicrobial surface<br/>The abutment, the connector between the implant and the crown, is in the new design connected to the implant itself. An antimicrobial surface is needed to prevent infection. The surface of the implants is biofunctionalized by plasma electrolytic oxidation with silver nanoparticles. <br/><br/>Treatment<br/>With this new type of implant the surgical procedure will be shortened to 6 months, instead of 9/12months. The main advantage is that bone healing after extraction is not required, which saves 3-6 months. <br/><br/>The design and manufacturing process are changed as well. Current implants are mass produced, while the new implants will be designed for one specific case and will be produced one-by-one. This affects the planning of the total treatment, a good collaboration between all stakeholders is needed. <br/><br/>The design is validated with four oral surgeons. All of them see added values in the patient-specific design. Different opinions have been formed about the porous structure and the antimicrobial layer. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the design shows large potential to positively impact the dental implant surgical procedure. More research and testing is needed to further develop these new type of implants. <br","Dental implants; additive manufacturing; antimicrobial surface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); van Lier, Jules (mentor); Vermaas, David (mentor); van Linden, Niels (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Municipal and industrial wastewater contains a significant amount of dissolved nitrogen. This is the results of the organic protein degradation and of the large employment of nitrogen (<i>N</i>), usually in the form of ammonia (<i>NH</i><sub>3</sub>), in the industry. Currently, nitrogen is removed in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) by means of biological treatments. Globally, the most applied treatment consists in the combination of nitrification and denitrification. This technique is characterized by a high energy demand (44.3 MJ per <i>K</i>g<sub style=""font-style: italic;"">NH4</sub><sup style=""font-style: italic;"">+ </sup>removed)  which accounts for 70% of the total energy consumption in the WWTP. A less energetically intensive alternative treatment is the Anammox process. However, this also presents significant limitations, especially when dealing with extremely polluted stream and in the flexibility of operation.<br/>An alternative to reduce the energy cost of nitrogen removal by valorizing the content of residual streams is explored by the <i>N2kWh</i> project. The novel concept underlying the <i>N2kWh</i> project aims to use <i>NH</i><sub>3</sub> from waste streams as a fuel source for a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). In this way, the energy cost for biological N-removal processes is cut, and, ideally, energy can be even produced. WWTP digested reject water was recognized as potential N-source for energy recovery as a result of its relatively high total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) concentrations (up to 1.5 <i>g</i> − <i>N</i> ⋅ L<sup>-1</sup>). A (selective) concentration step and pH regulation are needed in order to convert the TAN in the reject water, mostly present in form of ammonium bicarbonate (<i>NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub></i>), into <i>NH<sub>3</sub></i> gas which can be stripped and directly fed in theSOFC. Previous studies proved electrodialysis (ED) to be the most energetically efficient technology for the removal and concentration of ammonium bicarbonate. However, due to the high alkalinity in the obtained concentrate, a large amount of chemicals is required for the pH regulation. An interesting opportunity to avoid this chemical addition is the employment of a bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BPMED). Through this unique technology, it is possible to simultaneously achieve the concentration of TAN, as well as the regulation of pH without chemicals.<br/>The main objective of this work was to evaluate the potential of BPMED for the recovery of <i>NH</i><sub>3 </sub>in the boundaries of the N2kWh project. The energy performance of BPMED was compared with the alternative use of conventional ED plus sodium hydroxide for pH control. In order to obtain valuable information on the operation, three setups were employed: regular ED, BPMED and BPMED coupled with two membrane vacuum stripping devices (VMS). For this purpose, a synthetic solution obtained by dissolving 6.6 <i>g</i> ⋅ <i>L<sup>-1</sup></i> <i>NH<sub>4</sub>HCO</i><sub><i>3</i> </sub>salt in demiwater was used to simulate the digested reject water. Experiments were designed to characterize the BPMED operation and clarify which processes influence the performance.<br/>Experimental laboratory results showed that, in terms of energy consumption for the <i>NH</i><sub>4</sub><sup>+ </sup>removal, the BPMED used more energy compared to the ED. The removal of 90% of the initial <i>NH</i><sub>4</sub><sup>+ </sup>is achieved by using an average of 13.2±0.1 <i>MJ</i> ⋅ Kg<sub>NH4</sub><sup>-1</sup>. This value was 3.3 times higher than that achieved with regular ED. This discrepancy was explained by the extra-elements in the stack and the water dissociation process, responsible for the higher voltage measured during BPMED operation. The energy consumption was proven to be higher also as a consequence of the lower current efficiency for salt transport (73% compared to 95% of conventional ED). This was due to the more severe undesired diffusion processes, mainly gas diffusion and hydroxide leakage from the alkaline stream to the diluate, taking place within the BPMED stack. However, the energy consumption for ammonium removal in BPMED was still more than three times lower than the energy consumed by nitrification-denitrification and comparable to what used by anammox. <br/>The implementation of the membrane vacuum stripping modules, in series with the BPMED, only slightly increased the overall current efficiency (up to 3.4 % current efficiency gain). The benefit in current efficiency was less significant for higher concentrations and pH in the alkaline stream. Besides that, the tested technology tandem (BPMED+VMSs) was capable of stripping <i>NH</i><sub>3</sub> and, consequently, reduce the gas diffusion over the stack. The energy consumed for the production of <i>NH<sub>3</sub></i> and for the ED operation to reach a pre-defined pH and TAN concentration was estimated to be equal to 82.55 <i>W</i>ℎ per L of concentrate. This value was substantially higher than what consumed by BPMED (48.7 <i>W</i>ℎ) to achieve the same result in the alkaline stream.<br/>To conclude, the studied BPMED system was demonstrated to be superior in terms of energy consumption for the recovery of <i>NH<sub>3</sub></i> gas when compared to the combination of ED and chemical addition. BPMED showed also crucial advantages for the environment, design and safety of the treatment facility. The energy consumption for the removal of nitrogen with BPMED was proven to be lower than what used in the competitive biological technology. Finally, neither the technology nor the operation methods employed were specifically designed/optimized for this application. This made the use of BPMED for the N2kWh purpose even more interesting and promising.<br/><br","Electrodialysis; Bipolar membrane/BPM; Ammonia; Wastewater treatment; SOFC; Ammonia stripping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-01","","","","Civil Engineering","N2kWh | From Pollutant to Power",""

This can be broken up into a need for increased spatial and temporal resolution, as well as a necessity for decreased cost of this imagery. The Deployable Space Telescope (DST) was proposed by Delft University of Technology in 2015 and it aims to achieve these goals by deploying the primary and secondary mirror as well as the baffle structure. By deploying these elements, the launch mass and volume decrease substantially compared to state-of-the-art satellites such as Worldview-4, yet achieving similar ground sampling distances. The great difficulty for the mechanical side of the team is deploying these mirrors with sufficient precision in order to arrive at a diffraction limited image with a ground sampling distance of 0.30 m. This thesis has focused on the Secondary Mirror Support Structure (SMSS) of the telescope and it has been investigated how the testing phase of the project could best be initiated. Two prototypes of the essential CORE hinge have been developed and the hysteresis behaviour of these hinges has been experimentally characterised.<br/>Several improvements for the CORE hinge have been proposed. Shear rims were designed in such a way that protection during launch is guaranteed, but their presence is not detrimental during operations. Furthermore, the mid rollers were removed in order to prevent shearing of the metal strips against these mid rollers. Lastly, a material reselection to aluminium was proposed. Other improvements of the Secondary Mirror Support Structure include the selection of cable cutters as the most suitable hold-down-and-release mechanism for the SMSS deployment. A test rationale was developed and it was decided to initiate the DST testing with the development of two prototypes of the CORE hinge in order to experimentally characterise the hysteresis in these hinges when subjected to load cycling. The CORE hinge has never been flown in space, however, it is proposed as a very promising concept for the deployment of optical surfaces, amongst others due to their beneficial hysteretic response. The first prototype that was developed was created by rapid prototyping and served as a proof of concept version. The second prototype was used for the characterisation of hysteresis. Digital image correlation (DIC) was selected as a measurement system. The DIC set-up was capable of capturing the sub-micron displacements in the hinge.<br/>Note: Conclusions are confidential and omitted from this summary","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-04-18","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Force plates in the treadmill are combined with motion capture data and fed into a musculoskeletal model. High accuracy of the force plates is needed to give reliable feedback for gait analysis. The accuracy still needs to be tested under dynamic conditions, with the belt running. Also, inertial and gravitational forces are measured during perturbations as a result of the rotation and translation of the platform in which the force plates are positioned. This results in an error in the forces and moments as measured by the force plates, which is added up to the forces exerted by a subject. Inertia compensation models have been developed and showed promising results but have not been validated extensively. This study aimed to optimize and validate an inertia compensation model for perturbations on instrumented treadmills and validate the force measurements under dynamic conditions. It was shown that the treadmill can accurately measure the center of pressure (error = 1-6 mm), forces (error = 1-7 N) and moments (error = 0.5-4 Nm). A new calibration trial was found with higher sway accelerations which improved the inertia compensation model and left residuals forces and moments below 2 N(m). Moreover, it showed that using this inertia compensation model for pitch and sway trials led to a reduction of the kinetic residuals of up to 96% and values close to baseline measurements.","gait analysis; musculoskeletal model; inertia compensation; Biomechanics; instrumented treadmill; perturbations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The tests are executed for multiple different order picking station configuration and for multiple data set sizes. This leads to an overview of the effectiveness of each of these solutions in terms of computational time and the reduced number of AGV visits.<br/>From the results several conclusions can be drawn concerning the optimal solution for a specific warehouse.

(mentor); Kunneke, R.W. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Financial institutions want to participate in the digitization services demanded by consumers. “Banking-as-a-platform” is an increasingly popular business model. By way of this business model, traditional banks and fintechs move from a fully controlled environment, with a full end-to-end product or service without external service suppliers, to an environment where consumers are directly connected to third parties. The role of a platform is to connect different user groups; users who offer products or services via the platform are called producers, and users in need of the services or products are described as consumers. The research agenda of McIntre &amp; Subramaniam (2017) addresses the need towards a more comprehensive view of design choices related to networks, platforms and strategy. Often network effects are mentioned as the most important reasons to introduce openness. It is unknown whether for platforms in banking, expected network effects have an impact on the choice for level of openness. It could be that network effects have an essential part herein, perhaps this is not the case, maybe there are also other factors that have impact. Therefore, this research will explore the impact of expected network effects on the choice of the platform to become more open, or not. The choice will be approached from the sponsor perspective and the provider perspective since these roles are both involved in strategic design choices on openness and related network effects. The purpose of this research is to contribute to a structured overview of possible positive and negative impact of openness in the financial sector, and thereby contribute to the knowledge base. More specifically, the research provides insight into whether openness is included in their platform strategy and if expected network effects have impact on the choice of being open in this specific sector. The scope has been narrowed because the financial sector encompasses a large variety of services and institutions. This research focuses on the (sub) sector of traditional banks with the ambition to implement the “banking-as-a-platform”. The described area of the financial sector is labelled as the Purple Banks. One Purple Bank and one connected retail platform has been selected for this case study. The platform in this research is referred to as FinCo. A case study method is used because this in dept research method allows for a deeper understanding of underlying mechanisms. To give direction to the possible impact of openness in the case study, a frame of reference indicating possible impact of platform openness is needed. In this research a theoretical framework is constructed. The theoretical framework provides an overview of possible positive and negative impacts. The theoretical framework is not suitable for immediate use, it is too generic. Therefore, it is made specific by adding 7 propositions on the financial domain resulting in a theoretical framework specified on the domain. The theoretical framework specified on the domain is used as a frame of reference to identify possible positive and negative impacts of openness. Semi-structured interviews are used to gather data on the possible positive and negative impacts of openness identified by the sponsor and provider of a platform in the financial sector. The result is a framework with only relevant propositions for the specific case study, referred to as overview of factors found in the case study.","platform; openness; financial sector; network effects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Most prevailing academic literature within the MRO industry has focused on availability models or operations management in repair shops in the past. This study focuses on one of the most critical, and often neglected parts of the MRO supply chain. The reverse logistic flow of aircraft components. A research methodology was constructed by integrating the adapted DMADE (Define, Measure, Analyse, Design, Evaluate) structure from Lean Six Sigma and a number of different business process improvement methodologies from the literature in combination with a simulation study. The aim of the study is to identify a methodology with practical design criteria on how to redesign the reverse logistical processes of a component MRO provider, in order to improve the performance from an integral supply chain perspective. For this purpose a case study is performed and the current state of the closed loop supply chain of KLM E&amp;M was measured and analysed. By analysing this current state, design criteria for redesign are determined. A new automated logistic handling area is introduced by separating the physical and administrative handling operations. The proposed redesign is evaluated using discrete event simulation. Through optimisation modelling the optimal balance between inventory, resources and time required to handle the volatile demand pattern to achieve a desired service level, is determined. By optimising the capacity in handling the total time in the supply chain can be shortened. The redesign was evaluated using different levels of proactive repair order creation and skill configurations. Results from the case study showed the relationship between process efficiency, available capacity in terms of manpower, inventory, service level, and handling time. By separating the physical from the administrative flow, reducing handovers and transactions, generating repair orders in advance and shifting from inventory buffers to capacity buffers the reverse logistic flow of component MRO providers can be drastically improved.","Reverse logistics; MRO; Business Process Redesign; Discrete Event Simulation; DMADE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-30","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Performing physical activity of moderate intensity is, amongst others, associated with a smaller risk on symptoms of depression, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Despite this information being widely available on the world wide web, one particular form of physical inactivity is still incorporated in the lives of many people: sedentary behaviour. An environment that is especially seductive for this type of physical inactivity is the workplace. Stress, depression, anxiety, and heart diseases are found to be work-related diseases, possibly as a result from sedentary behaviour. As a means of reflecting on physical activity, one could acquire an activity tracker such as FitBit or use one of the many available health monitoring mobile applications. However, it was found that activity trackers may not be very effective for stimulating a physically active lifestyle. In contrast, an emerging phenomenon may be able to do so: the intelligent personal assistant (IPA). In order to be a part of the solution for aforementioned problem, we aim to stimulate reflection on physical activity during work hours in order to incorporate physical activity into daily routines. Therefore, we carried out a user study with 16 participants in two countries. For carrying out this user study, we introduced Alexercise: a system consisting of multiple interacting components, used for collecting, processing and presenting physical activity data. Components in Alexercise exchange data in quasi-real time to provide workers with current representative physical activity data. As part of Alexercise, we developed a custom skill for Alexa to access physical activity data and present these by voice. In addition, we developed a cross-platform mobile application for tracking and reflecting on activity using the React Native framework. We investigated whether IPAs are more effective in stimulating reflection on physical activity, compared to activity trackers. In addition, we asked participants if they felt the need to take active breaks based on the experience of the user study. At last, we intended to compare results of participants who already incorporated physical activity in their lifestyles with participants who have not. In the development process, we encountered many challenges, such as the distribution of mobile applications and Echo Dots to participants in two countries, and facilitating real time tracking and reflecting on physical activity. Collected sensor data for Android smartphones was reported with infrequent intervals, and could therefore not be used to reliably assess physical activity. We investigated and elaborately explained how these challenges can be overcome for future work. In contrast to the challenges, participants reported that they perceived talking to Alexa as intuitive, and the majority of the participants reported that they feel the need to take active breaks based on their participation in the user study.","Intelligent personal assistant; activity tracker; HCI; Alexa","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mobile network operators seek for new operating techniques to minimise their energy costs and their carbon footprint. One of these energy saving techniques is the use of energy efficient collaborations among the base stations (antennas) in their cellular networks. In this MSc thesis, a coalitional game-theoretic approach is taken to seek for the most energy-efficient collaboration among base stations in a cellular network. Three different coalitional game theory solution concepts: the Shapley value, the nucleolus, and the core are first investigated theoretically and then tested in a case study. Each of these concepts is based on different mathematical concepts such as fairness, dissatisfaction, or stability and may lead to different solutions. The concepts and corresponding solutions are compared with each other and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. One major disadvantage that must be overcome during the case study is the computational complexity when a large number of players is involved. The concepts are then tested on an urban heterogeneous cellular network with a dynamic traffic demand representing the urban area of Delft. Within this case study, the base stations are the players of the coalitional game and they can form collaborations with each other following the approach of the three mentioned solution concepts. To overcome the computational complexity, clustering among the base stations is applied to reduce the number of players in the game. The case study showed that the application of clusters among base stations reduces the computational complexity enormously whereas the energy efficiency decreases slightly. Furthermore, the results of the application of the solution concepts are promising. Each concept achieves almost a 50% energy efficiency increase. The difference in results between the three concepts is small.","Game Theory; Cellular networks; Coalitional game theory; Clustering; Energy Efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The world’s first floating wind farm, the Hywind Scotland Pilot Park, was commissioned in October 2017 and has been competitive with fixed bottom offshore wind turbines. There is a global push to make more renewable energy available, but less desire to have wind turbines cluttering the coastline. Floating wind turbines enable the developer to take advantage of unused offshore space, at depths where traditional fixed bottom structures are impractical and at locations that do not spoil the vista of the coastline. This thesis project aims to develop a working mooring system at depth of 600 m in the Norwegian North Sea, and then investigates the possibility of shared anchors in a wind park with this mooring system. The DTU 10MW reference wind turbine atop a classic spar substructure is used. First, the mooring system at 320 m is tested under decay and environmental loads. Then a chain-polyester-chain mooring line with a bridle was developed for 600 m so that the surge offset is limited to &lt;60 m for 3 load cases. A simplified model of the wind turbine was then developed for these three load cases. The simplified model was then used to create a wind farm arrangement with 5-6 turbines each. Each wind farm varied in layout and in the number of shared anchors. It was found that while the mooring system designed passes the surge offset and natural frequency requirements, and the normal ULS safety class, it failed the high safety class in some cases. For shared anchors with multidirectional loads, the resultant force on the anchor is significantly less as long as the lines are distributed equally around the anchor point. The resultant force does not increase with two lines 120± apart. The footprint of a single turbine with the designed mooring is larger than the footprint of the entire Hywind Scotland Farm, so suggestions are made for improvement and further work.","wind farm; anchors; mooring; SIMA; wind turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM) | Offshore and dredging engineering | Bottom Founded Structures, Arctic and Wind","",""

A showstopper in the success story of nano- and picosatellites are their high mission failure rates. Environmental testing before flight is an effective means to identify design flaws and workmanship errors, and thus improve the chances of mission success. However, inefficiencies in the design process, low-budgets, and stringent schedule requirements often motivate small satellite developers to postpone environmental testing towards the end of the design lifecycle, where recovering for design flaws is inefficient. The project circumstance of nano- and picosatellite missions require, therefore, cost- and time-effective test strategies that facilitate early design evaluation. This research proposes and implements a thermal screening method for PocketQube subsystems to identify temperature hotspots and verify their compliance against operational hardware limits. Key elements of the test method are a thermal IR temperature scan at ambient conditions and an estimation of the worst-case flight temperature using experimentally derived graphs that describe the vacuum heating of thermal hotspots. The study of subsystem layout options complements the screening method by providing solutions to mitigate hotspot overheating. Moreover, the study proposes to lower the required pressure levels for thermal-vacuum testing of PocketQube subsystems. The analysis shows that, due to the small form factor, pressure levels by four orders of magnitude larger than those used in environmental test standards for larger satellites suffice to maintain the resulting temperature errors below 5K on the hot side of the temperature spectrum. Both the screening method and moderation in vacuum requirements contribute to the development of subsystem test methods that match the needs of small satellite developers.","Thermal; Testing; IR imaging; PocketQube; Vacuum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Among the many advantages of geopolymers compared with the cement-based materials is less CO2 emission, it uses byproducts as a binder, less energy consumption during its production, more durable as a material, fast setting time and high strength development. This work is an attempt to exert some light on the usability and applicability of geopolymers in the field of construction with concentration on its use in the 3D printing. The main aim of this study is to propose a design methodology for geopolymer paste mixture to be used in 3D printing process. For achieving this goal, one paste mixture design was selected among six ones on the bases of longer workability/flowability, suitable extrudability and specific setting time. These six designs have different binder ratios. The selected mixture design, named S20, was tested further to find out its suitability for 3D printing process. This S20 mixture was tested on compressive strength, setting time, rheological properties, open time, buildability and 28 days tensile bonding strength of two layers. To find the best suitable design, modifications were done on the S20 mixture by changing the ratios between the used alkaline solutions Na2SiO3 and NaOH (0.25 was selected). These alkaline solutions played a major role in delaying the initial setting time for rheological tests (90 minutes were selected) and the extrudability for the 3D printing process. Another factor for the best design is the Acti-gel as an additive. This additive has a direct link with the buildability, extrudability and viscosity when added with different percentages. The best selected percentage of the Acti-gel was 0.75% for this mixture design. The open time and the 28 days tensile bonding strength tests were selected to be 33 minutes and 1.32 MPa respectively. Comparing the measured plastic viscosity to the open time test, the extrudability of the mixture is not anymore valid beyond 8.8 Pa.s plastic viscosity. This short open time of 33 minutes for such geopolymer mixture design needs a fast-performing 3D printer. This might help in achieving construction projects within short time. <br","3D Printing; Alkaline activated materials; geopolymers; Rheological properties; Mechanical properties; Setting time","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Sediment management is considered as a sustainable way to counteract the bed degradation. To justify an investment in a large scale nourishment, the impact of a nourishment on the river functions has to be compared with the result of a reference situation without nourishment. This study aims to develop a methodology that evaluates the future performance of rivers functions accounting for the autonomous trends (bed level and climate changes) and provides insights in the functional performance and cost effectiveness of river interventions. The methodology enables the assessment of the impact of the trends on the river system without intervention. It appears that the navigational efficiency is decreased enormously by climate change en bed erosion, which will increase transportation costs. Based on these indicative analysis a nourishment is predicted to be cost effective by improving both the navigational efficiency and counteracting dehydration of the floodplains.","bed degradation; climate change; integrated river management; navigation; nature; flood protection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Carried out in collaboration with Philips Design in the Netherlands. The project is about how to engage consumers in the transition from a linear towards a circular economy in which we make more efficient use of materials and resources. <br/><br/>One of Philips’ objectives for 2020 (Philips.com, 2016) is that 15% of the turnover should come from solutions that meet Circular Economy principles. This was 8% in 2015 (Philips.be, 2016) which is a big change for a company. <br/><br/>Senseo has a large installed base. This is due to the huge success of the product since its launch in 2001. In 2012 a Senseo could be found in 60% of Dutch, and 27% of French households (Expatica.com, 2012). Besides, Senseo is the best sold product in the coffee business of Philips, mainly because its ease of use (Senseo.nl, 2018). Because of the high volumes and high distribution in the Netherlands and surrounding countries, an opportunity is found for creating much circular impact with the Senseo. <br/><br/>However, companies cannot shift to a circular economy alone: consumers are crucial in the success of the circular economy. Because even if a product is designed to circulate in a closed loop, its potential will only be realized if the consumer participates. Therefore, the goal of the project is to activate consumers to engage in the circular economy with a case study in Senseo coffee machines. <br/><br/>Senseo users can show circular behavior by taking good care of the product and by repairing it when it is malfunctioning, for extending the product’s lifetime. At the end-of-life of the product, the user can contribute by disposing the product at proper recycling points in order for the materials to be reused. <br/> <br/>The outcome of the project is by integrating connectivity in the product (the internet of things, IoT), circular behavior among consumers can be stimulated and circular impact can be achieved. <br/><br/>Two main findings of the analysis are:<br/>1. Need for support at the point of malfunctioning<br/>2. After-sales data gaps<br/><br/>Connectivity (IoT) can contribute to these findings as follows. Connectivity can improve support because it facilitates easy access. The support stimulates circular behavior because users that receive support are encouraged and more likely to solve the problem instead of replacing it. By registering the product, users data can be gathered. This enables a virtuous circle because with the gathered data the support can be based on customer segmentation (e.g. demographics) and users can receive more customized support. <br/><br/>This corresponds to the Utopian vision that by means of a connected service, the Senseo has an unlimited lifetime and any of its parts can be replaced. Of course this is an ideal situation from an environmental perspective which cannot be achieved in the short term.

However, this potential is overshadowed by low completion rates, often below 15%. Due to the high level of autonomy that is required when learning with a MOOC, literature identifies limited self-regulated learning skills as one of the causes that lead to early dropouts in MOOCs. Moreover, most of the existing tools designed to aid learners in the online learning environment fail to provide the support needed for the development of such skills. The aim of the present work is to investigate how self-regulated learning skills can be enhanced by encouraging metacognition and reflection in MOOC learners by means of real-time personalised learner feedback through social comparison. To this end, we have developed three versions of an interactive widget, the Real- Time Learning Tracker , which allows learners to visualize in real-time changes in their learning behaviour and compare it to that of previous graduates of the same MOOC. The three versions of the Real-Time Learning Tracker differ in the degree of complexity of the presented feedback so as to investigate how learners interpret varying visualisations of their learning behaviour and which one of them leads to more changes on their behaviour during the course. The Real-Time Learning Tracker was evaluated in a live TU Delft MOOC running on the edX platform while engaging nearly 2000 MOOC learners over the course of 10 weeks. Our results show that learners that have access to the Real-Time Learning Tracker are more likely to graduate the MOOC. Moreover, we have observed that the widget has a positive impact on learners’ self-regulation whereas, we have little evidence that learners developed their engagement with the course content by the end of our experiment. Based on our results, we argue that the mere fact of receiving real-time feedback on a limited number of learning habits could trigger self-reflection in learners and lead to improved learner performance. Finally, our results reveal that the exposure of learners to the most detailed version of the widget engaged more learners and this type of feedback affected positively the learning performance and behaviour of highly educated learners. This work underlines the powerful effect of real-time feedback and self-reflection on one’s learning performance and behaviour. We recommend that future research should investigate learners’ feedback literacy and devise effective ways of presenting learners with real-time personalized feedback based on their goals and learning skill level.","learning analytics; learner dashboard; real-time; self-reflection; feedback; social comparison; massive open online courses; self-regulated learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

We assess the utility of this age gap as a risk biomarker for incident dementia in a general elderly population. The brain age is estimated from longitudinal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data using deep learning models. From the population-based Rotterdam Study, 5656 dementia-free and stroke-free participants (mean age 64.67±9.82, 54.73% women) underwent brain MRI at 1.5T, including three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted sequence, between 2006 and 2015. All participants were followed for incident dementia until 2016. During 6.66±2.46 years of follow-up, 159 subjects developed dementia. The entire dataset was split into control (N=5497) and incident dementia (N=159) groups. We then built a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on the control group to predict brain age based on brain MRI. Model prediction performance was measured in mean absolute error MAE=4.45±3.59 years of brain age prediction. Reproducibility of prediction was tested using the intra-class correlation coefficient ICC=0.97 (95% confidence interval CI=0.96-0.98), computed on a subset of 80 subjects. Hereafter, we investigated the gap between model predicted age and chronological age of the incident dementia group data, compared to control group. Logistic regressions and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association of the age gap with incident dementia, adjusted for years of education, ApoE4 allele carriership, GM and intracranial volume. These models showed that the age gap was significantly related to incident dementia (odds ratio OR=1.11 and 95% confidence intervals CI=1.05-1.16; hazard ratio HR=1.11 and 95% CI=1.06-1.15, respectively). Additionally, we computed the attention maps of CNN, which shows the importance of brain regions for age prediction. These were particularly focused on the amygdalae and hippocampi. We show that the gap between predicted and chronological brain age is a biomarker, associated with a risk of dementia development. This suggests that it can potentially be used as a complimentary biomarker for early-stage dementia risk screening.","Deep Learning; Age prediction; Dementia; Biomarker; Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Voxel-based morphometry; Survival analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The sensitivity of the multi-criteria policy is tested with disruptions in the production process, and the outcomes show that the performance even increases.

This study addresses how the minimum number of samples required to obtain a statistically accurate answer. This is important since less sample measurement save time and money. The sample size is related to the homo- and heterogeneity of a rock sample, where the sample size of a homogeneous material is smaller than a heterogeneous material. Many types of research is carried out on the sampling theory, but it is hard to create a formula to determine the sample size beforehand based on a rate of heterogeneity. The homogeneity percentage is not linked to the sample size, but with a spatial elemental distribution, this can be possible. However, further research is needed in order to answer the question more exact for a situation that is more complex. This study first mentions several definitions of homogeneity, second their origin within geology is evaluated. Last this is calculated with theoretical models to explore the minimum sample size required. The project evaluates how the sample size changes when homogeneity, heterogeneity and spatial distribution of the grade varies within a rock image. It is done with the help of an image analysis tool which creates a homogeneity curve, the mean and standard deviations for an increasing sample size. The standard deviations are used to generate answer within different levels of confidence for certain margins of error.<br/>Also, the variogram is used to determine the spatial correlation of the sample and interpolation is made using a general kriging method. Multiple images are evaluated with different rates of homogeneity, the number of elements and their spatial distribution. This study proofs generating more samples increases the accuracy of the characterization. With a lower target grade, the sample size will increase and also with an increasing image or grid size the number of samples will decrease. The variogram gives a first impression of the homogeneity since a smaller range and sill indicates more homogeneous material.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the most famous examples is Shor's algorithm for factorizing large numbers, which has exponential speedup compared to its best classical counterparts.<br/>However, running such an algorithm will require to build a large-scale quantum computer consisting of thousands or even millions of qubits that include quantum error correction (QEC) and fault-tolerant (FT) mechanisms.<br/>Quantum computing is already a reality with the so-called Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) processors, some of them available in the cloud. Noisy refers to the imperfect control over the qubits and intermediate-scale to the relatively low number of quits (from fifty to a few hundred). Although current<br/>and near-term quantum devices will not have enough qubits for implementing large and fully corrected quantum computations, the use of small quantum error correction codes may extend the computation lifetime of NISQ devices. In this context and as a first step, it is important to test and demonstrate the<br/>fault-tolerance of these QEC codes.<br/>In this thesis, we explore the fault-tolerance of two small quantum correction codes that are good candidates to be applied to NISQ processors, the [[4,2,2]] code and the [[7,1,3]] Steane code. To this purpose, by following the FT criterion prosed by Daniel Gottesman in 2016, we tested both codes using two simulators, the stabilizer formalism simulator that includes quite simple error models and a full density matrix simulator called quantumsim, which includes more realistic noise. The simulations are performed under reasonable noise parameter values. For the [[4,2,2]] code, 235 circuits are tested based<br/>on the two simulators. The results show that in the stabilizer formalism simulation, the FT criterion is satised for all circuits, while not fully satisfied in the full density matrix simulation. For the [[7,1,3]] Steane code, we use a parallel-flag error correction implementation which is tested using the full density matrix simulator. Our results show that without applying any QEC cycle, for all circuits (84 circuits for 1 logical qubit simulation and 452 circuits for 2 logical qubits simulation), the error rate of the encoded circuits is lower than the unencoded ones. Adding a quantum error correction (QEC) cycle will in general increase the error rate of the computation.","Quantum Computing; Quantum fault-tolerance; Small QEC codes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

These systems, known as Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems have contributed to global climate change and global warming. These effects are the consequence of the increasing demand of HVAC systems over the last decades mainly due to population growth and improved building climate comfort. This has motivated the improvement of heating and cooling systems of buildings, for instance by implementing better control strategies. The control of HVAC systems aims to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality. These factors are influenced by temperature and humidity. Thermal comfort and indoor air quality together with the reduction in energy consumption is the core of this work, we propose a nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) as an approach to solve the temperature and humidity control while aiming to realize energy consumption reduction in buildings. MPC expresses the problem as an optimization program with constraints over a prediction horizon. The major advantage of using MPC in comparison to classic controllers for building climate comfort is the straightforward relation between temperature and humidity to energy consumption, which is quantified in the objective function definition. In this project, we represent the model of the building as a single zone space and we consider a cooling and heating coil to dehumidify and re-heat the air, respectively. These processes across the coils are graphically represented in the psychrometric chart, which allows us to define the overall system’s enthalpy as the difference between the mixed air and supply air conditions. This vector is integrated into the objective function in the MPC formulation. The MPC problem formulation is defined by the reference tracking of the temperature and humidity ratio in the zone and the energy minimization problem, which corresponds to a nonlinear constrained optimization problem. The constraints are described by the system dynamics of the zone, states constraints, and input constraints. The inputs correspond to the temperature and humidity ratio of the supply air. In this formulation, the state constraints and the reference tracking allow to indirectly limit the evolution of the relative humidity in the zone. The energy minimization problem corresponds to one of the following cases, the optimization with respect to the (i) air mass flow rate, (ii) the air mass flow rate and the sensible heat from ventilation and (iii) the air mass flow rate and the enthalpy vector. We investigate the opportunity to improve the energy efficiency by providing an analysis of the aforementioned scenarios. From which case (i) was taken as the reference controller. To solve the nonlinear program, we use the toolbox Yalmip and the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) solver. The toolbox supplies the warm-starting for the optimization problem inside the bounds defined, and then it computes the solution. The results from these approaches confirm comfort requirements. And they also show that case (iii) provides the least energy consumption in comparison to (i) and (ii).","HVAC systems in buildings; Temperature and Humidity; Psychrometrics; nonlinear MPC control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Other suitable aquifers can be found in the Maassluis formation at a depth of 170 meters and in the Oosterhout formation at a depth of 320 meters.

We ask ourselves how many arithmetic progressions are contained in zero density subsets of the integers? And what is the asymptotic distribution of the number of arithmetic progressions? Key motivation for this research are the famous results of Van der Waerden, Szemerédi and Green-Tao. In chapter 1 we introduce the necessary mathematical background in the form of Ergodic theory. Some key concepts from Ergodic theory are studied and connected to random colourings of the integers. We spent a great deal of time defining various concepts such as zero density sets and the arithmetic progression counting summation. We are able to derive a law of rare events for zero density sets, with the use of moment generating functions. Secondly, we look at different modes of convergence. Various modes of convergence like convergence in probability, distribution, almost sure convergence and total variation are properly defined. This is done to look at the occurrence of arithmetic progressions in zero density sets. We proof that almost surely, zero density sets, generated by independent colourings, contain infinitely many arithmetic progressions of any finite length. A fun application to a stochastic analogue of the prime numbers is presented. In chapter 3 we introduce the Chen-Stein method for Poisson approximation. First we build the basic theory behind the method and show it's application for proving Poisson convergence of the length 1 arithmetic progression counting summation. We show that, by utilizing a very general theorem of Arratia, Goldstein &amp; Gordon, that the number of finite length arithmetic progressions is Poisson distributed. This is the main result of this thesis. We end by giving another application of this theorem to obtain a similar result for the occurrence of very large progressions. Lastly, we try to apply the transfer matrix method as an alternative method for showing Poisson convergence. These transfer matrices are introduced, because they provide explicit expressions and convenient ways of computation for the moment generating function of the arithmetic progression counting summation. We obtain a rigours result for arithmetic progressions of length 1, and a partial result for progressions of length 2. We emphasize that more research is needed on this topic.","Poisson approximation; arithmetic progression; random colourings","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

This provides a measurement operator for the assimilation of ASCAT satellite derivations into this model. Currently, TU Wien uses ASCAT measurements to retrieve soil moisture from backscatter. Next to backscatter signal, two additional vegetation parameters are extracted from the TUWien SoilMoisture Retrieval Approach. These parameters are slope and curvature and describe the second order Taylor polynomial, which explains the incidence dependency of backscatter. A recent study showed that slope and curvature could contain valuable information about vegetation water dynamics and biomass phenology. The new explored relationship gives an unique opportunity to relate land surface variables with these observation parameters. This is significant as it could be used to create a climatological data set of high quality and temporal consistency. The surrogate model avoids the need to use a Radiative TransferModel (RTM) to relate the land surface model to the ASCAT observations. RTM’s require complex input variables such as size, shape, height, thickness and orientation of the canopy but also the dielectric properties. Additionally, RTM’s are not based on the actual output of the land surface model (LSM), as the LSMs simulate vegetation parameters such as leaf area index, soilmoisture, gross primary production, temperature and respiration. Thismakes RTMs less suitable to act as a measurement operator. The suggested method to simulate ASCAT observations are deep neural networks. Deep neural networks are able to capture every highly non-linear relationship by using only the outputs from the LSMs. For this study a regular feed forward deep neural network is used to simulate the backscatter signal of the ASCAT instrument, whereas slope and curvature are simulated by a deep convolutional neural network. The results show that the deep neural network is able to simulate the seasonal and inter-seasonal variation of backscatter. Concerning slope the model was capable to capture the seasonal trends and some of the interseasonal variations. Curvature shows the worst model performance, as the model is only able to capture the timing of the seasonal changes but not the right magnitudes. In general, the performance depends on the variation of the observation and land surface data. This suggests that the model structure needs to be adapted according to the complexity of the investigated grid point. A black-box interpretation model, called DeepSHAP, is used to extract the most important features for each observation simulation. This feature importance allows a physical interpretation of the ASCAT observations. The most relevant feature for backscatter is soilmoisture, which is consistent with previous research and gives confidence to the feature importance extraction method. The slope signal is mostly related to the gross primary production and therefore biomass assimilation. Curvature shows the highest correlation for LAI. Both results confirm the previous assumptions that curvature and slope are, respectively, related to structural and phenology changes. The results of this research are substantial as they allow to the first time to relate actual vegetation parameters to the slope and curvature signals. It additionally proves that deep neural networks are a possible choice to act as a surrogate model between ASCAT observations and a land surface model.","ASCAT; Deep Learning; Land surface model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-08-01","","","","","",""

The area is rooted in agriculture because of fertile löss soil. There have always been a tight bond between the villages and surrounding land. This connection was distorted when mining started in the late nineteenth century. The miners coming from everywhere were housed around the mines. The region thrived, until the mining industry stopped in the 60’s-70’s. Massive unemployment followed. Now fifty years after the closing of the mines Parkstad is still dealing with the consequences of a monoculture. Parkstad has accepted the shrinking as status quo and is now looking for new perspectives with a diverse sustainable economy. Miscanthus x Giganteus, a so called C4 grass, has made a march in the Western world in the last few years. The high yields need little maintenance, while it feeds on the abundant CO2 coming from the fossil fuel industry. The plant, like the floating houses in Iraq, can be used as simple and effective building material. However the western world’s interest in lignocellulosic biomass lied until recently primarily in creating biofuels like bioethanol. Due to new insights in biorefinery, the potential for Miscanthus x Giganteus seems much larger. Lignin a substance of the Miscanthus x Giganteus is for instance likely to be a building block for carbon fiber and currently in R&amp;D stage. Once this is sorted out, it could provide in the need for reducing CO2 emissions by making lightweight cars. Of the large area in Parkstad, grassland with 5000 Ha seems most appropriate for growing Miscanthus x Giganteus. Grassland has a low CO2 intake of only 3-4 tons per Ha and there is plenty unused grassland in and outside the urban area, like Industrial plots, empty urban plots or alongside highways. However the majority of grassland is dedicated for livestock. But it will become more and more available since livestock will shrink eventually do to emission legislation and farmers needing to find ways to make their land profitable. Via a grid, pixels of 1ha, just like on your screen, can be turned on and off to spread the impact of the Miscanthus x Giganteus in the entire region. This will work as a large time machine that harvests CO2 from the air and brings a sense of eternity to the people of Parkstad.","Miscanthus x Giganteus; Parkstad; CO2; Biorefinery; Carbon Fiber","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Powerplant in Parkstad",""

The most popular explanation for the flux decline supported by Bhattachajee &amp;Bhattacharya (1993), contains two mechanisms: concentration polarization(CP) and fouling. The influence of CP is noteworthy in ceramic nanofiltration system. On the one hand, CP can influence the performance of membrane separation by decreasing the retention of the molecules. On the other hand, CP could have a desirable effect which can be used for membrane surface modification. In the past three or four decades, several different models have been used to verify the existence of CP or cake-enhanced CP(CECP) effect and try to quantify it. However, all these methods or models have their own limitations. Therefore, it is essential to build a new model or adjust the constants in the empirical model according to the practical situation. The flux decline behaviour of a ceramic nanofiltration membrane in the presence of polyethylene glycols (PEGs) and silica was investigated to examine the control factor in flux decline and calculate the CP factor in the filtration. The control factor in flux decline for PEGs is CP, while for silica, both CP and fouling are important. Based on the reversibility of CP and fouling, the Gel-polarization model together with the corresponded filtration method generated the modified Gel-polarization model which is suitable for calculating the fouling resistance and the osmotic pressure on the membrane. Sherwood formula is appropriate for calculating CP factor with calibrated constants. The flux decline behaviour, as well as the CECP model developed in this work, was used to investigate the possible CP&amp;CECP during ceramic nanofiltration for phosphate retention. CECP model based on Sherwood relation can be used to investigate the influence of the fouling layer on CP with measured permeate flux, fouling mass, and an assumed/measured porosity of the fouling layer. Based on the CECP model analysis, lower crossflow velocity and cake layer porosity, larger permeate flux and fouling mass can produce a higher CECP factor. The change of permeability in phosphate retention can be used to calculate CP factors, however, the adsorption and electroviscous effect had influence on the accuracy of the results. CECP factor is not able to be measured by the change of permeability since the unstable fouling layer can influence the discovery of permeability decrease. The presence of calcium has a serious negative impact on phosphate retention probably due to the lower electrostatic repulsion of phosphate.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since deformation can be an indicator of a developing failure mechanism, information about this parameter can help authorities to detect weak spots in the dutch water defense structures. <br/>In this research, Radar Interferometry (InSAR) is used to estimate deformation time series on the vegetated part of the dike. Using Point Scatterers (PS), it is already possible to estimate deformation time series with mm precision on objects with a coherent reflection over time. Apart from objects, also surfaces provide a reflection of the radar signal. These so-called Distributed Scatterers (DS), which can for instance be found on dikes, are often strongly affected by temporal decorrelation. Although conventional approaches to detect and estimate these DS do not work, there may still be coherent information for interferograms with small temporal baselines. In this research project, a methodology is presented to detect coherent DS on the vegetated part of a dike and to estimate their deformation time series.<br/>To do so, the phases of PS are subtracted from the DS on the vegetated part of the dike to reduce the phase noise due to different states of the atmosphere. The estimated coherence matrix is then used to only select coherent interferograms which are used to unwrap the phases with respect to PS. Using data obtained from the TerraSAR-X (X-band) and Radarsat-2 (C-band) satellites, it was shown that DS could be detected on some parts of the grass-covered inner slope of the Marken dike.","InSAR; dikes; deformation; Distributed Scatterers; coherence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

The associated inherent low-frequency unsteadiness dictates the use of Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) approaches to resolve the interaction, which unavoidably implies a very high computational cost. For this reason, no well-resolved long-integration time LES of an experimentally validatable setup has yet been conducted. Therefore, a new numerical set-up for LES, which is reproducible in the ST-15 supersonic blowdown windtunnel, is identified using analytical and inviscid two-dimensional methods. First of all, a state-of-the-art analytical model for shock-panel interactions was implemented. It was observed that ignoring the transverse steady pressure difference over the panel and the subsequent mean panel deformation led to an erroneous prediction of the flutter dynamic pressure. Incorporating both resulted in a correct stiffening of the panel for low shock strengths, but the destabilisation of the panel for stronger shocks, as shown by high fidelity methods, was not obtained. This was attributed to the linearity of the stability analysis and the absence of certain nonlinear flow features in the model, such as a passive adaptation of the reflected shock to the local panel slope. Thus, to include these nonlinearities, the Euler equations were loosely coupled to a FEM model of a clamped two-dimensional panel, which were solved using INCA and CalculiX respectively. The frequency, amplitude and modal content of the panel response were found to be highly sensitive to shock impingement location. A sensitivity study of the obtained Limit Cycle Oscillation (LCO) with respect to panel thickness and settling chamber total pressure allowed to identify parameters which maximize panel unsteady motion. It must be noted that in the viscous case, spreading of the shock-system pressure jump is expected to occur, which depends strongly on Reynolds number, shock-strength, relative positioning of the shock-generator trailing edge expansion fan, and panel unsteadiness. Given the selected conditions and an interaction length estimate based on literature, the most promising impingement point was found to be located at the panel midpoint, which should place the separated shock foot in an unsteady region identified near the panel leading edge. Based on an initial estimation of the grid distribution and the required integration time, it can be stated that a computationally feasible set-up has been obtained, which is also reproducible in the ST-15 and which should induce a strong LCO, independent of initial conditions. Furthermore, it was found that the nondimensional dynamic pressure, a parameter typically used to characterize classic panel flutter, is not valid for panel flutter with shock impingement.","Shock wave boundary layer interaction; Flutter; turbulent boundary layer; Inviscid flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

This is done with a new variant of spin-orbit tomography that has been described in [Cowan and Agol, 2008] and more in depth in [Fujii and Kawahara, 2012]. This method reconstructs the albedo map from the reﬂected-light curve, the total intensity of the light that originates from the host star and is reﬂected by the planet. In the mentioned papers, the surface map of the planet is modeled as a sum of ﬁnite sized surface elements with constant albedo, and the relation between this approximation of the map and the light-curve in the time domain is determined. In this report, we use that the signal is quasi periodic due to diurnal and annual motion, and work with the Fourier peaks of the light-curve. We also approximate the map in a diﬀerent way, writing it as the sum of spherical harmonics, and neglecting spherical harmonics with high spatial frequencies. This has the advantage that the relation can be worked out analytically (for edge-on and face-on observations) without the use of complex mathematics, and that both the surface map and the light-curve contain a daily frequency. We derive an equation for the reﬂective light-curve under the assumption that the surface map is not a function of time (no clouds), and that the reﬂection is Lambertian (equal in magnitude in all directions). This transformation is found to be a linear function of the surface map. This equation is worked out for edge-on and face-on observations with arbitrary axial tilt, which describes the orientation of the spin axis with respect to the observer and the orbital plane. Furthermore, we describe how to invert this relation if the axial tilt is known to the observer. We also aimed at recovering the map if the axial tilt is unknown to the observer, since this would make sure that the reconstruction does not rely on other observations. In contrast to what was found in papers like [Fujii and Kawahara, 2010] and [Fujii and Kawahara, 2012], we did not succeed in this. A number of methods were used for this. The ﬁrst two looked at the problem from a mathematical perspective: the minimization of the distance between the measured light-curve and the light-curve from the reconstructed map, and Tikhonov regularization. The two failed because both the column space and the singular values respectively are not a function of the axial tilt. The third method that has been treated and tested involved the maximization of the ‘amount’ of positive albedo on the reconstructed map, but a test showed that the distinction that this method makes is in the same order of magnitude as the numerical error, thus proving that this method was not useful as well.

Then, to analysis the effect of vegetation cover, a standard and a double layer WCM based on parameter sets of three published studies [3]-[5] are applied in this study area to simulate the two components of σ_tot^0, direct backscatter from vegetated surface (σ_veg^0) and attenuated soil backscatter (〖γ^2 σ〗_soil^0). The input parameters of IEM, Dubois and WCM are supported by a series of ground measurements performed in Florida during the entire growth season, which includes soil moisture, surface roughness and vegetation biomass measurement. According to the analysis at different frequency and incident angle, the increase of bulk VWC can lead to either an increase or decrease in σ_(tot ). The different impact is determined by either σ_veg^0 or 〖γ^2 σ〗_soil^0 is the main contributor to σ_tot^0. At higher frequencies and larger incident angles, where the dominant part is from σ_veg^0, σ_tot^0 will increase with increasing bulk VWC. While, when 〖γ^2 σ〗_soil^0 becomes the main contributor to σ_tot^0, increasing bulk VWC leads to a denser canopy and thus more incoming microwave is attenuated. Therefore, increasing bulk VWC results in a decrease in σ_tot^0.

With the tendency of urbanization and population growth, a more sustainable urban water system becomes important to create harmonized environment between human and nature, thus it is necessary to discuss integrated urban water management in a holistic manner. In this research, starting from a water management model closed city, hybridity is identified as one character of urban water system and its contributions to improve closed city are studied by collaboration work between two disciplines, water management and urban design. A hypothesis of three components of hybridity of urban water systems is raised, which are spatial hybridity, environmental hybridity and governance hybridity. Each component consists of different elements that are involved and influence each other in urban water system. This report presents the results of spatial hybridity and environmental hybridity in a case study area Zevenkamp in Rotterdam city, the Netherlands. Methodology to analyze and evaluate spatial and environmental hybridity is developed in the perspective of urban design and water management respectively, and then be applied to assess current situation in Zevenkamp. Based on the current analysis results, five future visions are set up according to the concept of closed city and then collaborative design between two disciplines is carried out to clarify the urban layout for each vision. Added values of hybridity in each vision is assessed by quantification, as well as their performance as a closed city. Finally, all the results are compared together and discussed. Some main conclusions can be obtained from this research, which are given as follows: • Hybridity concept addresses the importance of inter-disciplinary work, and it is able to provide a thinking way to promote the collaborative processes. Based on the cooperation between two disciplines in this research, it will be helpful to guide future collaboration when more expertise are involved. • Hybridity concept gives a broader perspective on the discussion of grey and green solutions, which is not conflicting to recent debates on the importance of combination of both types of measures. • Hybridity concept can improve the design of closed city which can enhance citizens’ appreciation on urban water systems without compromising the physical performance of closed city. It will motivate locals to engage in urban water management, which can lead to the study of governance hybridity. In addition, it also inspires urban water managers for more comprehensive understandings to a more sustainable urban water management.","Hybridity; Urban water management; Urban design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

We also found that the HDI is overall a better predictor. While a few countries are already getting close to the saturation point in their motorization, an alternative knowledge-based predictor is needed for these countries to better describe trends in mortality rate.","road safety trends; learning pattern; knowledge transfer; motorization; EU","en","student report","","","","","","","","2021-03-06","","","","","",""

However, the fast changing IS environment causes for limited knowledge of eventualities, dependencies and values of systems and phenomena. Consequently, the IS risk assessment process is depending on the judgment of cybersecurity professionals to complement the incomplete knowledge. The outset of this research is to understand how cybersecurity professionals provide judgment when they experience uncertainty about the IS environment. First, the perception of uncertainty with cybersecurity professionals is analysed, guided by the theory on perceived environmental uncertainty. Second, the judgment operations of the cybersecurity professionals are analysed, guided by the theory on judgment heuristics. These two concepts are synthesised against the backdrop of the ISO27005 information security risk asessment methodology, that serves as different components of the information security environment. The results show that cybersecurity professionals perceive uncertainty about the IS environment in which it is difficult to: grasp the different interrelations in the organisation’s landscape of information and information systems, assign accurate values to the occurrence of changes/events in the IS environment and to determine the impact from changes/events to the organisation. This uncertainty is caused by the complexity and dynamism dimensions within the organisation’s IS environment. Indicated factors attributed to these dimensions are shadow IT, the innovation processes within an organisation and the organisational structuring. The judgment operations of the cybersecurity professionals are partly explained with the help from judgment heuristics. The data shows that the selective accessibility model is predominantly used to provide judgment about the IS environment during risk assessments. Thereby heavily relying on the information provided to them from different sources, consequently staying close to the initial values. The availability and representative heuristic are also identified but are referenced in fewer instances. This would suggest that the cybersecurity professional assess the information more on a case–by–case basis, rather than providing judgment based on similarity or the ease with which a scenario is retrieved from memory. Aside from the identified heuristics, the cybersecurity professional is observed not to be included in the final judgment. In such cases the uncertainty is then accepted because it is not part of their responsibility. Additionally, the security policy and philosophy paradigm shift from prevention to detection and response allow the cybersecurity professional to accept that not all IS incidents can be prevented.

Conventional methods used for FDI in multicopter UAVs are based on actuator effectiveness. They fail to identify and distinguish the type of faults present in UAV motor or propeller. The proposed method of analyzing stator current to detect and identify motor and propeller faults is based on a popular condition monitoring technique for electrical machines known as Motor Current Signature Analysis(MCSA). Any physical damage incurred by motor or propeller of a multicoper UAV can cause anomalies in the stator current of the motor which can be used for detecting faults in the incipient stage to prevent complete failure of UAV which otherwise could be catastrophic. The method proposed in this paper analyzes the stator current in time and frequency domain detect and identify the faults in a Brushless(BLDC) motor or propeller. The faults investigated in this paper include damaged rotor magnet, unbalanced propeller and chipped propeller. Experimental results validated that MCSA successfully detected and identified the faults investigated. As propeller damage/chipping is one of the most common and important fault that occurs in multicopter UAVs, an algorithm was developed to estimate the severity of that fault.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The anaerobic digestion process is studied, specifically, it’s biochemical processes, to understand the effect of addition of oxygen. Anaerobic sludge is aerated to mimic DAF (Dissolved Air Flotation) conditions, where tap water is pressurized (at 3 and 5 bar) and then depressurized in contact with the anaerobic sludge in a column reactor. During the course of this process, air micro-bubbles which were dissolved under high pressure are released due to contact with atmospheric conditions. To estimate and compare the methane production of the originally collected non-aerated sludge (anaerobic sludge not aerated in the column reactor, therefore, considered as 0 bar) and aerated sludge (anaerobic sludge subjected to high-pressure micro-air bubbles in the column reactor at 3 and 5 bar) a BMP test is conducted. Methane production was found to be lower in the aerated sludge with the BMP value for the 0 bar sludge being 296.17 +/- 45.15 NLCH4kg 1 and the value for 5 bar aerated sludge being 252.26 +/- 16.8 NLCH4 kg 1. Biogas composition of the aerated sludge was also examined with a Gas Chromatography (GC) machine and the percentage of methane, carbon dioxide and oxygen were measured for the 3 and 5 bar aerated sludge. For the 5 bar<br/>aerated sludge, the overall percentages are averaged at 30%, 70%, and 1% respectively and for the 3 bar aerated sludge the average values are 20%, 80%, and 1% respectively. Furthermore, particle size distribution (PSD) analysis was done to compare variations for particle sizes between the aerated (5 bar) and non-aerated (0 bar) sludge. Very low variation was observed between these samples with the average size of the aerated samples being marginally smaller than the non-aerated sludge, indicating poor separation efficiency for the separation method adopted.","Bio methane potential; dissolved air flotation; micro-bubbles; aeration; anaerobic digestion","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An example of such mission is the Silicon Wafer Integrated Femtosatellites mission, consisting of 100 to 1000 spacecraft with a mass of 0.1 kg. Due to modest control capabilities of the spacecraft and a higher risk of collisions, the requirements on trajectory optimization algorithms are increased. In this thesis a distributed trajectory optimization algorithm is developed which minimizes the required fuel for collision-free reconfiguration trajectories. First, the balance between cooperation in the formation and fuel consumption is investigated: with less cooperation the trajectory optimization algorithm can easily be distributed but the resulting fuel consumption is higher. The problem can also be distributed using dual methods, which can result in the same solution as a centralized algorithm. In literature both dual decomposition and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) in consensus form are proposed to solve this specific problem. In this thesis it is demonstrated that the Jacobian decomposition of the Augmented Lagrangian Method outperforms both dual decomposition and ADMM in terms of convergence rate. Furthermore it is shown that this algorithm does also converge in an asynchronous setting. Finally, the synchronous algorithms are significantly accelerated using Heavy Ball acceleration, the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Threshold Algorithm and Anderson Acceleration.","Distributed optimization; Collision Avoidance; Spacecraft; Formation Flight; Trajectory optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

A popular method to mitigate the risk of these attacks is through security patrols, but resources are often limited. Game-theory is often used as a methodology to find optimal patrol routes for security agents, such that security risks are minimized. However, game-theoretic models suffer from payoff uncertainty and often rely solely on expert assessment to estimate game payoffs. Expert knowledge should not be the only source of information since key domain features, such as attacker behaviour, which contribute to the game payoffs are hard to estimate precisely. To address this shortcoming, we propose a novel approach to estimate payoff uncertainty through agent-based modelling. We simulate different attacker and defender strategies in an agent-based model to estimate game-theoretic payoffs, while the framework of game-theory is used to find optimal defender policies. The results of the experiments show that the optimal security patrol gives special emphasis to high-impact areas, such as the security checkpoint, to reduce the total security risk. Our results further show that by strategically randomizing patrol routes, higher expected rewards for the security officer are achieved.","Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation; Patrolling Games; Game-Theory; Airport Security; Empirical Game-theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-17","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Ho-Huu, V. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Travelling by air has become commonplace, and more and more people can afford themselves to fly. In twelve years time, the amount of people that were carried by airlines doubled to four billion passengers in 2017. At Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, the main gateway into the Netherlands and also a large hub for connecting flights, saw a growth of 20 million passengers in four years time. The rise in air travel also has its downsides. Not only the boundaries of airport and airspace capacity are run into, noise annoyance and pollution caused by aircraft are also everyday's business. The growth in aviation and population will inevitably lead to conflicts. Several strategies have been proposed in literature and by legislators to address this conflict. Advanced aerodynamics, aircraft engines and alternative fuels can be considered as long term solutions for this, but changing operational procedures of aircraft and airport is considered as a good solution in terms of costs and time-wise. Most research on changing operational procedures has shown significant results, however only consider a single operation while these are of influence on one another. The integration of several operational procedures into a single problem has been recognized as one of the future research topics. In this research an integrated optimization framework is proposed that can simultaneously optimize aircraft and airport operations by allocating routes, flight procedures and runways. The framework is able to handle fuel usage, noise annoyance and capacity. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol will be used as case study airport, and a real flight departure schedule is used as reference. The framework consists of two main steps. In the first step, flights are groups according to their aircraft type, destination and departure time, and are subsequently distributed over the available runways, routes and departure procedures. This distribution is performed with a \acrshort{NSGA}-II algorithm that is capable of handling non-linear, multi-objective optimization problems. In the second step, the flight distribution is apportioned over the flights in the schedule, while adhering the separation requirements. In this way it is verified if the required capacity is available, by adhering the separation at departure, a possible crossing point and the terminal point between consecutive flights. The second step is implemented with a \acrshort{ILP} algorithm. Results from the case study has shown that significant gains can be obtained in terms of noise annoyance. While requiring little extra fuel, up to 4\%, the noise annoyance can be lowered with 31\%. Not much variance is possible for flights that operate during the night hours, and so all gains are obtained on flights in the daytime. Especially the amount of people that are highly annoyed can be lowered of up to almost 50\%. A further analysis of the noise contours shows that the framework is able to shift noise in such a way that the noise levels drop below the threshold values of the noise equivalence criteria. In other words, the noise contours can decrease in size and with that the amount of people annoyed is lowered. These results are obtained by shifting flights from runway 18L to runway 24, which is more noise friendly, and by using \acrshort{NADP}2 more frequently compared to \acrshort{NADP}1. The model is also able to make a distinction between destinations and aircraft type, and puts heavy aircraft more frequently on shorter flight legs in order to minimize the fuel usage and the exposure to noise of residents. An examination of the entire solution set in terms of the separation requirements indicates that most of the found results are feasible. By shifting more flights to a single runway, the required capacity is at stake and adding extra flights with delay will cause an exponential growth in total required delay. <br/>Using the integrated optimization framework leverages the potential of aircraft specific capabilities by allocating the right runway, route and procedure to each flight in such a way that an optimum noise contour is formed. Most gains can be obtained for the number of people annoyed and disturbed, and as these noise equivalence criteria are directly related to the well-being of residents around the airport and their opinion on the operation of the airport, this can only be considered as beneficial. The available capacity of a runway is deployed to alleviate noise annoyance by residents. The framework proposed in this research can be improved at several components in future research. The addition of arrivals, extra routes and procedures would extend the applicability and value of the framework. Another improvement that can be made is the incorporation of the second step into the first step. This would eliminate infeasible solutions inside the solution set.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""
