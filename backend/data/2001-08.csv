The goal was to explore a possible future of mobile communication, based on the fact that every human being is special and unique. It is the diversity of mankind that makes communication worthwhile and rewarding. The goal is achieved by building a vision and by designing a productconcept based on that vision. The vision redefines mobile communication at its core. Mobility is seen as adapting to certain changes and integrating them in your life. Communication is defined as a process to share pieces of culture, which are known as memes. The result is a concept that allows communication independent of your current time and space. It integrates communication with the relationships people have with each other, with memes and with objects around them. The concept describes the building blocks for future mobile communication. These building blocks form a unified, converged digital landscape that is accessible with a device. The concept illustrates a possible hardware and interface design of future mobile communication product. This project shows that mobile communication is not incidental or task-based, but should be integrated continuously in everyday life. It also points out that future communication is not exclusively about content or the form of the message (text, sound, pictures, videos) but about how communication media are used in relation to your daily routine and environment around you.","future; mobile; communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2001","In the design of oil and gas terminals Six Degree of Freedom (SDF) models are used to calculate the motions of the moored ship as well as forces in mooring lines. TERMSIM II (LNG) is one of those SDF-models, developed by MARIN under a Joint Industry Program with Shell as one of the main sponsors and users. Although the simulation programs have been used for more than twenty years, there is still need for more information about the accuracy of the models. The research objective is to verify the accuracy of the calculations of the SDF computer model TERMSIM II (LNG) simulating an LNG carrier moored to an open jetty. The accuracy is investigated by comparing calculated forces in mooring legs to prototype measurements. The prototype measurements have been carried out at the LNG jetty of the Withnell Bay loading terminal, located in the Mermaid Sound, West Australia. The moored ships were 125,000 m' Northwest LNG carriers. The measurements consist of average, minimum and maximum values per ten minute interval of the force in each mooring line. Simultaneously weather conditions were monitored near the terminal. These conditions serve as input for TERMSIM simulations. Simulation runs were carried out for different kinds of environmental loads. The dynamic loads from wind and waves (sea state) appeared to be small and difficult to be compared to the measured data. Dominant loads appeared to be swell waves with peak periods ranging from 14 to 18 s. Simulation under these weather conditions provided good results in case of loaded ships, i.e, the simulation results nearly match the measured data. In case of ships in ballast and partly loaded ships the simulations provide overestimating results. From a sensitivity analysis appeared that the results are rather sensitive to directional spreading of waves and the direction of the incident waves. From further investigation of the motions of moored ships exposed to swell waves followed that the yaw motion, due to first order wave forces, is dominant for forces in breast lines. A simple empirical expression has been derived to calculate the yaw motion of a moored 125,000 m3 LNG carrier exposed to swell waves. This expression can be used for preliminary harbour design to estimate maximum yaw motions and mooring forces. Computer simulations can be carried out during further stages of the design process when more detailed input parameters are available. The main conclusions of this research project are: 1) The difference between TERMSIM calculations and measured line forces, concerning a loaded 125,000 m3 LNG carrier moored to the LNG jetty in Withnell Bay exposed to moderate swell waves, is within reasonable limits. Underestimation of 10% to 20% for the calculated maximum forces in breast lines compared to prototype measurements has been found. 2) The prototype measurements show significant dependence between maximum line forces and the loading condition whereas TERMSIM simulations do not show this dependence. 3) The influence of directional spreading of waves on line forces is significant in case of wave directions nearly head- or stern-on. 4) Yaw motions appear to be dominant for the maximum line forces in breast lines in case of a 125,000 m3 LNG carrier moored to a jetty exposed to swell waves. 5) The yaw motion is dependent on the water depth, wave direction, wave period, wave height and stiffness of the mooring system. 6) Maximum allowable wave loads in Withnell Bay appear to be smaller than design wave loads.","lng carrier; mooring; termsim II (lng)","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Groenveld, R. (mentor); Horstmeier, T.H.W. (mentor); Pluijm, M. (mentor)","2001","At the time of writing this report the Chinese economy is one of the largest in the world. Although China is registered as a developing country, this will probably change fast while it is highly likely that China will be entering the World Trade Organisation (WTO) soon. With the growth of China, Shanghai as a container port will also grow. Plans of the Chinese government are even to turn Shanghai into the main container hub of Southeast Asia. To sustain this growth Shanghai will probably have to expand its capacity. To be able to get an indication of the future demanded requirements regarding container handling capacity, a masterplan has been made within this report. Based on a growth scenario it has been estimated that by 2010 a maximum capacity of 12500 TEU is expected. Now the expected number of vessels and their probable dimensions have been determined, the requirements regarding the terminal facilities can be determined. With these requirements eventually a location can be sought that meets these requirements. Of 3 possible locations eventually the location near Nanhui lui has been chosen. This area lies only 80 kilometre south east of Shanghai outside the mouth of the Yangtze River. A location outside the Yangtze River was required due to the increasing number of vessels calling at Shanghai having large draughts. The disadvantage of this location is that due to its location near the mouth of the Yangtze River it faces high annual returning maintenance dredging works. The advantages of this location however led to this choice. While not sufficient natural depth is available along the coast of Nanhui lui an approach channel has been dimensioned within this report. During the calculation of this approach channel it turned out that a total volume of 200 million m3 of capital dredging should be executed. In combination with the expected maintenance dredging works, the costs would probably be very high. Within this report therefore another solutions has been investigated. This solution contains a main port on the islands of Yangshan, 35 kilometres off shore, in combination with satellite terminals along the coast.The main port at Yangshan will handle all vessels that normally call at Shanghai. While many containers with a domestic destination are transported to and from Shanghai by truck and train, a connection with mainland is necessary. This connection is formed by so called shuttle barges that sail to and from Yangshan. The home terminals of these shuttles are so called satellite terminals situated at Nanhui lui and the current container terminals of Shanghai. 4 design proposals are made for the Yangshan islands. The chosen one allows all vessels to make use of the same basins leading to a reduction of breakwater length. The construction of this project will be executed in phases. Along with the phases the investments have been projected. These investments have been converted to the year of investment using an inflation of 5% annually.","port design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""
