Arsenic concentrations present in drinking water cause chronic poisoning, which depending on the exposure, lead to several life-threatening long term effects. It is however unknown to what extent this contamination is spread over the country, since many water sources have not been tested for arsenic. Different arsenic mitigation techniques have been implemented, like the Kanchan filter, but long-term field performance of such techniques are unknown and little follow up research has been done. The overarching goal of The Arsenic Project (TAP) is to contribute to the ongoing research in arsenic contamination by developing social and technical guidelines for rural households to mitigate arsenic exposure risk in selected areas of Nicaragua. This is declined in this report under the following three research components: risk, technical and social, with the end objectives to measure the arsenic concentration in wells, to calculate the related exposure risk, to map high risk areas (hotspots) and to assess the performance of Kanchan filters or more generally water treatment technologies encountered both from a technical and a social perspective. Arsenic concentrations were measured using the Arsenator®, along with several water quality parameters (pH, temperature, conductivity, etc.) using a multimeter. Arsenic speciation between As(III) and As(V) was done using the Clifford method. Short interviews were conducted to know more about the well’s characteristics (age, number of user, etc), water-related habits, and characteristics of household technology solutions, when applicable. In the latter case, assessment of the filter performance (flow rate, arsenic removal rate, etc.), and an inquiry of maintenance was done. Semi-structured interviews, focus group and in-depth interviews were used to qualitatively assess the perception of water-treatment technologies, the awareness about (arsenic) contamination and the willingness to invest in freshwater supply. TAP investigated in 5 municipalities, with at least 3 communities within each of these municipalities, cumulating more than 4000 km. 128 wells have been sampled, from which 38% contained arsenic. In 7% of all the wells, As(III) was found. Arsenic concentrations, excluding zeros, ranged from 3 to 267 ?g/L (upper bound measured in the municipality of Telica). From all the sampled areas, most contaminated wells were found in Larreynaga, Telica and Muy Muy. In general, highest arsenic concentrations were found in wells with high temperature and high conductivity. The main arsenic mobilization mechanism is most likely geothermal influence, but possibly also reductive dissolution. In total, six Kanchan filters were found. Only one Kanchan filter has a sufficient removal efficiency and the others remove nothing, have a poor removal capacity (9%) or increase the arsenic concentration during filtration. The one removing arsenic also has the lowest filtration rate. Fragility of components (tap, clay-pot), lack of pre- and post-support were recurrent in filter’s limitations. Social acceptance of the filter is generally high and users have faith in its removal capacity. In general, arsenic is seen as a threat, but arsenic awareness differs a lot depending on the community history (previous campaigns) or personal contacts with the municipality or NGOs. Other arsenic mitigation strategies are also researched and implementation of relatively complex mitigation strategy was observed to be performing successfully. General guidelines and recommendations for arsenic mitigation strategies are formulated in the report. In particular, the development of an integrated mitigation solution is community-specific and time dependent (short term vs. long term). If filters are selected a viable solution, it is important to make sure that the removal efficiencies are sufficient and for a long duration, users are confident about the filter efficiency, and that a good support program before, during and after implementation exists.","arsenic; nicaragua; Kanchan; filter; drinking water; drinking water risk; hotspot","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","","12.132778, -86.250278"

(mentor); Liu, L. (mentor)","2015","All existing data sources used to reconstruct 3D building models have certain restrictions. An eye-catching alternative is IndoorOSM, one of the most popular examples of the newly evolved crowdsourced geodata. The potential power of this rich and simple-formatted data source has been proven by many researches. However, a fatal flaw of IndoorOSM is also pointed out, which is its accuracy. Another promising data source that has been looked into is 2D architectural floor plans. They are also commonly available and full of detailed indoor information. Due to the inconsistencies and ambiguities existing among real-life floor plans, previous researches all are established on different user cases. Althogh sharing a common pipeline, they differ from each other in every step, from the data structure, processing procedure to the 3D reconstruction method. The combination of these two data sources can be beneficial, because architectural floor plans can offer IndoorOSM better accuracy and extensive indoor information while IndoorOSM can provide a unified data structure and 3D reconstruction workflow for information extracted from floor plans. Based on a throughout review of the characters of real-life floor plans, a set of rules are proposed to redraw architectural floor plans from real life. These rules mainly focus on reorganizing information contained in floor plans, taking advantages of the layering and blocking functions supported by CAD application. The original geometry and graphical representation in the raw floor plans is reserved as much as possible. Redrawing is only required when unstandardized representation is encountered. Then, an automatic process is accordingly presented to extract desired information from the redrawn floor plans into an IndoorOSM database. Finally, highly detailed CityGML LoD4 models with interior structures can be generated using a method proposed by Dr. Marcus Goetz. The pipeline is tested with several floor plans from real life for 3D reconstruction. User feedback validated the feasibility and efficiency of the redrawing rules.","3D reconstruction; IndoorOSM; floor plans","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Van Amerongen, R.P. (mentor); Fleuren, R. (mentor)","2015","Suitsupply is a Dutch fashion brand founded in 2000 by Fokke de Jong. Today, the brand is grown into a multinational, which is running more than 50 stores spread worldwide. The brand targets on businessmen and offers them both tailor-made suits and convection sized casual apparel, through online and offline channels. The experience of tailor-made clothing and the brand values ‘pioneering’, ‘fast and efficient’, and ‘combining craftsmanship with flair’ are intertwined in the high-service brick and mortar stores. In each store a tailor is working in its in-store atelier. Despite, the brand lacks in a strong omni-channeling system. These days, Suitsupply is conducting research about the introduction of a female fashion line targeting on businesswomen. The goal of this graduation assignment is to come up with an online strategy for the online introduction of this new clothing line. Since a difference can be found in the experience of shopping online and shopping in brick and mortar stores and women tend to shop offline more than online, the following question arouses: “How can the offline shopping experience be translated into an online shopping experience?”. In order to come up with a new online platform, the following design goal is formulated: “I want Suitsupply to become the fashion brand all businesswomen want to purchase their apparel at. Therefore, I want to design a complete online shopping experience for the female consumers.” A throughout online platform is developed for Suitsupply, consisting of three different experiences: ‘Personal Shopping’, ‘Tailor-Made’, and ‘Virtual Store’. The female consumers can shop in the regular online shop as well as in the virtual store. By doing so, needs and wants of consumers with the three different states of mind – locating, exploring, and dreaming – are fulfilled. The virtual store translates the experience of shopping in brick and mortar stores into an online experience, where consumers search and browse through the store. They can place items they like in the virtual fitting room, in which they can enter their body measurements and then try the items on their personal mannequin. When it comes to ordering the apparel, consumers are provided with the option to order a convection-sized item or to order a tailor-made item. In the last case, consumers first ask for a design kit, consisting of several fabric samples, measuring tape, and a product sample of a specific garment. After they received the design kit, they go back to the online platform and create the tailor-made item, by selection their preferred fabric, haberdasheries and adaptions, and entering their body measurements. This experience is brought to a higher level in the adapted design. The virtual store forms the base for the new innovation, which shows consumers – after logging in – three mannequins with three different inspiring outfits fitting the consumer’s preferences. The mannequins have the consumer’s body sizes, hair color, and skin color. By clicking, the mannequin turns around and the consumer can see how the fabrics behave. Before ordering the consumer can adapt the look and the items in a pop-up screen. Additional to the experience of shopping in the virtual store is a subscription model, which offers consumers to let a personal shopper shop for them. Consumers have to create an online profile and have to answer some questions about their needs and wants. After they have had a personal conversation with their preferred personal shopper, they will receive a box filled with several hand-picked items at home. Retailers are struggling with the growth of online shopping. In this case, the introduction of Suitsupply’s virtual store for women fits the solution for omni-channeling and will make Suitsupply unique in comparison with the competitors and will Suitsupply give a step ahead. Nowadays, the virtual stores a quite new and innovative, especially in combination with a virtual fitting room. Another advantage of the virtual store is consumers from all over the world can shop in the virtual store 24-hours a day. The online platform is part of a complete omni-channeling system, which will be build up step by step, starting with the introduction of the new fashion line online and ending in 2020. The implementation is divided into four parts: ‘Preparation’, ‘Launch’, ‘Expansion’, and ‘Omni-Channeling’. First, the female fashion line as well as the online platform should be developed. Then, the line together with the online platform will be launched in 2016 after a period of promotion. The female fashion line and the online platform will be expanded by the introduction of a subscription model in 2017. This is at the same time a new moment to create promotion and get attention for Suitsupply’s female fashion line. In the period from 2017 till 2020, Suitsupply will build up the omni-channeling system by first introducing screens in the current brick and mortar stores, then come up with pop-ups stores and ending with introducing the new fashion line in all the brick and mortar stores in 2020.","Fashion; Retail; E-commerce; Strategy; Online Experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2015","Many software systems are designed to be long-lived due to the costs involved in developing new systems. Changes in these systems are inevitable due to constant modifications in requirements that are necessitated by the constantly changing nature of the business environment or detection of faults.To adapt their software to all these changing requirements developers use several tools, i.e. recommendations systems. To create recommendation patterns, the recommendation system searches for groups of similar code changes in software archives using syntactical similarities. As this search is a heuristic approach the groups contain outliers that prevent the generation of many useful patterns. In this thesis, we device algorithms that work hand in hand with various classification algorithms to identify outliers in the initial groups generated by SIFE. The goal is to improve the final recommendations presented to the developer. For the improved classification we first use manifold learning algorithms to map our data to a three dimensional space. We then use the 3D coordinates of generalizable groups as our feature vectors and train group-specific, project-specific and global classifiers. With these classifiers we make changes to the initial groups. We evaluate the results of the changed groups with the Disruptor, Retrofit, Picasso, Flym, Android Chart and Android Universal Image Loader software repositories. Our approach results in an improvement of up to 36% in the repositories.

(mentor); Biloria, N.M. (mentor); Vollers, K.J. (mentor)","2015","Vacancy in high-rise office buildings has over the last decade become an increasing problem in many cities around the world. Within Europe, the problem is especially true in Netherlands with over 7 million square meters vacant as of 2012. Current solutions to this issue involve conversion to residential spaces, updating and upgrading the office technologically to attract companies, or failing that demolition. However, none of these solution changes the nature of the tower typology. By its nature, a tower is a highly antisocial building. Despite being a highly populated environment, inhabitants are largely segregated by floors that are connected by an elevator. The only usable space for social interaction and public activities is located at the ground level around the building. It is only here where the tower has any interaction with the city and the street therefore limiting the public realm to a horizontal landscape. By extending the street into the building and elevating it with a series of ramps and varying vertical circulation, social spaces and areas for interactivity can be expanded to encompass more space within a city. This verticality allows for areas such as functions that require close proximity to main roads to be stacked in a way that leaves a smaller footprint in growing cities. By applying this concept to existing vacant towers, the urban fabric and city skyline does not need to be changed dramatically thus retaining the overall feel of any given city. Functions that are introduced into these spaces should always have a practical and desired use, and with this in mind the local populace must be an active player in the conception process. By coupling these needs with city planning, the introduction of this system can change the way towers are used in the future and ensure spaces that will be in constant use by city dwellers.","vertical neighbourhood; reusing vacant towers; adaptive reuse","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-11-01","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Hyperbody","","51.91275347, 4.42926049"

(mentor); Vallery, H. (mentor)","2015","This thesis presents the first steps of a design study on the robust hopping and balancing robot Skippy. The purpose of the overall design study is to challenge a new design approach for robots with high physical performance. This approach comprises an iterative study of machine (physical system) and behaviour (action strategy) co-design. Skippy is maximally simple in that it has only two actuators to control itself in 3D, and it is to be made from COTS components. It should be able to hop up to heights of 4m and in addition be able to balance, do acrobatic manoeuvres and survive its crashes. The goal of this thesis is to design a realistic action strategy and mechanism for Skippy in 2D to hop up to 4m that is compliant with Skippy's required additional abilities and physical limitations. In 2D, Skippy only requires one actuator. A study that uses the new design approach is presented in this thesis. The initial model of Skippy assumes a perfect actuator and simplified transmissions. The thesis proceeds step-by-step to a more realistic model. The physical system is designed to consist of linkage mechanisms and two non-linear passive elastic elements. The action strategy is designed such that Skippy acts in saturation. Saturation is determined by various physical limits such as the limited nut velocity of the driveline's ball screw and electrical limitations of the motor's armature. The system's behaviour is improved by a redesign of the physical system that moves the cause of the saturation, which increases the mechanical power output of the motor. This redesign includes tuning of inertial, dimensional and stiffness parameters. It is shown that Skippy is able to reach its target height while having basic control over lift-off momenta, which is required for performing acrobatic manoeuvres. In addition, Skippy's balancing performance has been investigated. By adjusting the inertial and dimensional parameters that favour balance, the jumping height is reduced to 3.8m. This suggests that it is important to take additional abilities, like balancing, at an early stage into consideration for design decisions of the iterative design process. Step-by-step introduction and alteration of parts and their parameters in alternation with restrictions and secondary requirements have allowed for well-understood system behaviour and have built towards a more realistic system that works.","legged robot; design method; physical performance; dynamic behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Biomechanical Design, Biorobotics","",""

(mentor)","2015","Reservoir simulation is a key tool to get insight in complex fluid flow phenomena occurring in many petroleum reservoirs, creating the possibility to quantify fluid productions and their uncertainty regarding many unknown properties. It has been shown by experimental and theoretical research that under certain criteria immiscible (multiphase) and miscible (single-phase) displacements can develop instabilities. These instabilities cause the displacing fluid to finger though the displaced oil, which is referred to as viscous fingering. Moreover, reservoir rock heterogeneity has shown to be capable to amply these phenomena. However, to limit computational costs, reservoir simulations typically use far lower grid resolution than the scale at which incomplete mixing phenomena occur. Numerical truncation errors imposed by large grid blocks will conceal small scale physical phenomena that contribute to unstable displacements. These sub-grid flow features are what is called incomplete mixing, as opposed to the fully mixed scenario inherent to the use of low resolution grids. To cope with this problem, effective models have been developed that make use of effective fluid properties in order to capture the sub-grid effect of incomplete mixing. Todd and Longstaff’s model is the most widely utilized model in the petroleum industry. Like similar models, one major disadvantage is that this effective model depends on an undefined scalar mixing parameter, which must be obtained from either high resolution simulation or experimental data. Dynamic local grid refinement (DLGR) is a simulation technique that can adapt the spatial grid resolution to the scale at which the physical phenomena occur without refining the grid over the entire domain. This can be achieved by means of local refinement and coarsening of the computational grid dynamically at every time step where small scale, local phenomena occur using predefined error criteria. This way DLGR could provide the means to solve for complex flow phenomena arising from instabilities at fluid fronts, while preserving complex geological features that could amplify this phenomena. This report investigates the use of state-of-the-art DLGR as an alternative to the effective model developed by Todd and Longstaff (TL). As DLGR is capable of adapting the spatial grid resolution locally where physical phenomena of incomplete mixing occur, this technique potentially allows for computational efficient and accurate results. The first part of this report studies and compares the results obtained using DLGR with that of the TL model and reference fine scale simulations for miscible transport in homogeneous media. Elaboration on DLGR's efficiency in term of CPU time, accuracy and consistency regarding scalability in terms of reservoir domain size and mobility ratio of the displaced and displacing fluid. Also a comparison is made for a secondary polymer flooding. The second part of this report investigates the accuracy of DLGR for miscible flow in heterogeneous reservoirs, and comparing the consistency of DLGR and the TL model.","dlgr; incomplete mixing; instable flow; reservoir simulation; lgr; miscible; heterogeneous; homogeneous","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-10-30","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Veldhuis, L.L.M. (mentor)","2015","Open rotors are considered to have the potential to improve the fuel economy of aircraft significantly by improving the propulsive efficiency compared to the current generation turbofan engines. One of the possible configurations for the open rotors is the aft fuselage mounted contra-rotating pusher propeller. The aftfuselage mounted contra-rotating pusher propeller offers significant benefits in terms of interior noise and ground clearance compared to the wing mounted propeller aircraft. However, the pusher configuration is subjected to a non-uniform inflow due to the upstream pylon wake which affects the aerodynamic performance and noise emissions of the propeller. The objective of this research is to analyse the sensitivity of the pusher propeller performance and noise emissions to the upstream pylon wake characteristics by both experiments and numerical computations. The experiments are conducted at Delft University of Technology. To validate the experiments, a numerical model was developed using an existing propeller lifting line code coupled with an analytical model to estimate the effect of pylon wake on pusher propeller performance and noise emissions. The pylon wake velocity measurements in the freestream direction are affected by the presence of the downstream propeller. With a decrease in advance ratio, the negative pressure gradient upstream of the propeller decreases the non-dimensional wake displacement thickness and the non-dimensional wake velocity deficit. The wake profiles measured at zero thrust condition and computed numerically are in good agreement, with differences in velocity deficit of the order of 2%. The propeller performance results indicated that the rotating shaft balance used could not measure the pylon installation effect accurately. The measured offset in propeller performance is attributed to an error in measurement. Within the limitation of the accuracy of RSB, the propeller performance measurements for different pylon-propeller spacings remained constant. Numerical computations are also performed to evaluate the effect of the pylon wake on the propeller performance. The effect of installation increases with increase in advance ratio. The experimental noise measurements indicated an increase in sound pressure levels with the installation of pylon. The effect of installation is seen as tones at blade passage frequency. The Flyover directivity pattern indicated an increase in sound pressure level at all flyover angles measured. The increase in sound pressure level due to the installation of pylon is prominent both upstream and downstream of the propeller due to the low sound pressure level observed for the isolated configuration. Numerical evaluations showed that the computed sound pressure levels are underpredicted for the isolated configuration at low freestream velocities which is due to the decrease in radiation efficiency at low freestream velocity. The sound pressure level for the pylon-installed configuration computed showed an increase across all the flyover angles. From the experimental and numerical investigations performed, the effect of installation on the propeller performance is negligible whereas the effect on the propeller noise emissions is significant. This result is of significance as it can be used as an advantage in the design of the pusher propeller.","propeller; performance; acoustics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight propulsion and performance","","Flight propulsion and performance","",""

(mentor)","2015","The future airports will need to handle increasing numbers of passengers as well as adjusting to an ageing population with limited computer skills. The increasing need for fluid mobility will place enormous pressure on airports, as they seek to provide seamless coordination of transport and freight solutions. Current infrastructure constraints will lead to a demand for more efficient utilisation of existing airport capacity. The airport of future will face the changing responsibility of ensuring punctuality and an efficient process on the one hand, as well as guaranteeing the security of passengers, personnel under conditions of a growing infrastructure. To cope with these challenging responsibilities, the airport needs to handle passengers faster and more efficiently in order to reduce the ground time. In addition, the increasing expectations of passengers needs to be addressed in terms of providing a more comfortable and attractive airport. Different groups of passengers expect a trouble-free journey, regardless of what kind of problems may occur. Interestingly, innovative self-service solution are being developed by a number of companies to address passengers’ differing needs. In designing the self-service kiosk, the key notion of user experience was abandoned, by offloading the responsibility for the front-end activity to the passengers. (Accenture future of Service Design 2014, p.37) Having a holistic view on User Experience design, this project explored the possibility of creating a user-friendly automated procedure that meets different passenger needs and stakeholders ambitious, in order to smoothly lead passengers through the steps of the ground procedure. Several field and users studies led to understanding and defining the most important experiences that passengers foreseen. Together with these outcome, this thesis envisions the future of automated passenger procedure by understands the ambitious of KLM and Schiphol, and empathising with passengers. Through this thesis, the visions are translate into tangible models to examine the experiences and values that each vision evoked in passengers, as well as underline the feasibility and limitation of each concepts. Evaluating the translated vision narrows down the process into the final conceptual design. The final design is a one-stop service procedure, where passengers are going through all the checkpoints at once. The designed form provides passengers with seamless and efficient flow, this procedure provides passengers with structure and guide them through the process. In addition, he chosen technology induces feeling of empowerment and control in passengers. Subsequently, the final conceptual design is the result of integration of five values of : control, comfort, respect, entertainment and flow, as well as consideration of stakeholders ambitious and possible tasks integration. As a result of several evaluations and iterative developments, this project provides a set of standards to be considered when designing and developing the automated passenger procedure in present and the future.","Design; Aviation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial design","","Design for Interaction","",""

The company designs mostly for social projects, e.g. hospital buildings and schools. When designing a hospital building they have to consider multiple stakeholders. To them the patient experience was an area in which they had little expertise. They started this project to gain more knowledge on how to design an environment that can contribute to patient-centred care. With the help of two hospitals, both clients of de Jong Gortemaker Algra, patient journeys were created. The journeys focus on the influence of the built environment on the experience of patients visiting the outpatient clinic. From the journey guidelines were created that provide architects and hospital management with points of improvement towards a patient-centred environment. From these patient journeys different directions for product design were formulated.The choice was made to focus on making the patient feel noticed when visiting the hospital. Patients want to be cared for. However, hospital staff is often busy and does not have time to provide patients with a personal approach. Fade was created to make patients feel welcome when walking in to the waiting room. When Fade notices someone entering the waiting room it lights up and pulses, attracting patients to come over and explore it’s function. Patients can scan their patient card to check-in. Fade shows them information about their appointment and once they have confirmed this the waiting time is shown. The waiting time is calculated considering possible delay so the time shown to patients is up to date. The panels with information slowly fade towards a different panel on the product. This panel remembers the patient’s information and stays lit until they go into the doctor’s office. While waiting patients can look over to the product for distraction. The steps of use are illustrated further on this poster.","Patient-centred care; Patient journey; Contextmapping; Hospital design; Interactive product; Customer journey","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Vetsch, J. (mentor); Zhou, J. (mentor)","2015","In the field of bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, ex vivo embryonic chick femur culture models have demonstrated their experimental advantages. The work reported in this thesis was dedicated to the development of a framework through a bioreactor approach in combination with the technology of micro-computed tomography (?CT) to conduct longitudinal studies on ex vivo embryonic chick femur cultures. The bioreactor chamber was designed to allow isolated embryonic chick femurs to be positioned at an air/liquid interface under a basic organotypic culture condition for ?CT monitoring. By time-lapsed monitoring of the bone tissue, ?CT evaluation provided the information on temporal and spatial changes of the chick femur model in a three-dimensional scheme. Different experimental groups were examined with respect to the frequency of ?CT scans and the lengths of the period under organotypic culture. It was found that, after 10 days of culture, the femurs scanned every other day exhibited similar bone growth and bone dynamic morphometry as the femurs scanned only at the beginning and the end of culture. This demonstrated the multiple experimental manipulations and irradiation did not have a significant influence on the quantified bone parameters. However, considering transient bone biology, the registration method of superimposing two measurements from the interval of two days showed much more dynamic bone activity than the ones of the same femur registered from the corresponding two time points at the beginning and the end of the culture period of 10 days. Furthermore, for the femurs cultured for a longer period of 4 weeks, more bone formation and less bone resorption was shown during the first two weeks than during the second two weeks. The results indicated the importance of choosing the suitable length of culture periods and scan time points in order to study dynamic bone activity. It is therefore recommended that, in the future, a ?CT monitoring scheme should be taken into consideration in a longitudinal study. In conclusion, by taking the bioreactor approach, a feasible model for longitudinal studies on ex vivo embryonic chick femur cultures could be successfully established.","embryonic chick femur; ex vivo bone culture; micro-computed tomography; bioreactor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Biomedical engineering","",""

(mentor); Stikkleman, R. (mentor); Rook, L. (mentor)","2015","Companies can lose a substantial portion of their revenues due to deterioration in value of their products as a result of processing impediments, which might occur in the entire supply chain. Sometimes, the reasons for a decline in product quality are not fully understood, and thus there are no appropriate measures taken to prevent it. Yet, it is vital to comprehend what is actually happening during production and material handling so that proper, well-informed decisions can be made. This project deals with one of the unexplored problems -- quality loss due to product cross-contamination, which is a common occurrence in material handling, multi-product plants. It is a process of mixing product going through multi-purpose equipment and piping with leftover residue that is currently there, which takes place when there is no intermediate cleaning in between two consecutive products, though the precise character of it is usually not known. Omitting cleaning runs to save production time and money is a common practice in the industry. This research introduces a novel simulation method to quantify and predict the extent of cross-\-con\-ta\-mi\-na\-tion as well as to assess its effects. Many models for material handling in multi-product plant have been made in the past but very few relate to the issue of cross-contamination, which is of extreme importance in quality assurance and informed decision-making. As no similar models have been developed previously, or other research done based on a real industrial setting, it is a truly innovative study, intended to establish foundation for further research, and to raise awareness of the issue by starting to fill a gap of knowledge about what can happen during material processing. Initially, a thorough literature research is done, dealing with issues of trade-offs in manufacturing, cross-contamination in production, as well as how to combine scheduling methodologies with a powder mixing model in a discrete event simulation (DES). Then modelling boundaries and assumptions are established together with a conceptual model. Based on that, a general DES building blocks -- class models for a bagging machine, conveyor, mixer, silo as well as product batches and orders are created. Specific analysis is performed in Sloten, a young animal feed plant in Deventer, the Netherlands, in order to find a more precise character of cross-contamination over time, as well as to test the model application in a realistic setting. Contamination measurements using tracer--collector method over material flow with multiple intermediate sampling points help, together with relevant theoretical models, build mathematical representation of chaotic changes occurring within material flow. Obtained curves fitted with a sum of two exponentially decreasing curves correspond well to the measurements but do not explain everything that happens during the process. Nevertheless they are used to model the cross-contamination phenomenon. Two unique cross-contamination models suitable for implementation in DES are developed, basing on principles of segmentation, quantity conservation, product similarity and proportionality, and are fundamentally models of mixing between material flow and residue in the crossed container. More general one, called partial mass exchange model, allows to customize fraction of material mixed, characteristic to a given piece of equipment, while the other, mixing model, assumes homogeneous resulting composition. Finally, a case-specific simulation model, joining material handling system with cross-contamination calculations as well as customizable layout configuration and settable scheduling methodologies, is established. Experimental setup with four-stage production process consisting of ingredient feeder, a single mixer, limited intermediate storage buffers and multiple system exits, mostly bagging machines, connected by conveying equipment, is discussed. All of the machines involved are multi-purpose, flexible but with some limitations, together with the interconnections and logic among them, basing on a genuine example. Analysis shows considerable impact of system layout and scheduling rules on product contamination. In order to limit cross-contamination appropriate product sequencing, minimising the differences between consecutive products in all stages of the process in needed, while that might impede throughput because of resulting constraints. There is thus a trade-off relation among various aspects of production efficiency, as well as amidst that efficiency and flexibility, when number of storage buffers and their capacity is changed. In the end, research first benefits from measuring the extent of cross-contamination, then succeeding in giving an original example of how to build a cross-contamination model, and how to combine it with a stochastic DES, capable of suiting different designs and scheduling methodologies. Performed experiments show, that cross-contamination effects can be reasonably well simulated with a DES model. It also describes possible effects of certain interventions on various performance indicators, and demonstrates possible risks of increasing flexibility in the system. Additional, more thorough trials are needed in the future to improve the model and generalise it further. Yet, the very important first step to understand the issue has been taken, which will aid in application to other types of systems as well as help in mitigating product contamination.","cross-contamination; carry-over; discrete event simulation; quality assurance; contamination; manufacturing trade-offs; powder mixing; scheduling; dispatching; sequencing; pollution mitigation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Verbree, E. (mentor); Wandl, A. (mentor)","2015","Nowadays, not all pedestrian paths are accessible for mobility impaired people. Especially paths which consist of complex public spaces and old streets constitute problems. However, no reliable information is (quickly) available about problems that cause hindrance. The sensing rollator called meet rollator is equipped with several sensors that provide detailed data about a range of factors which affect the accessibility of the outdoors environment. A meet rollator gathers data that is supplementary, new and different. The goal of this thesis is to use sensor-data collected by a meet rollator to develop a geo-database that provides insight into the accessibility of pedestrian routes for mobility impaired people who need a wheelchair, rollator or mobility scooter. In order to achieve this goal, the following research question is defined: Does the current setting of the meet rollator provide insight into the accessibility of pedestrian routes for mobility impaired people? If not, how can the current setting be improved? This research has evaluated the available sensor (handheld Global Positioning System (GPS), Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS and camera) data collected by a meet rollator. Literature study showed that in order to determine walking restrictions in the outdoor activity space of people with mobility impairments, the geometrical demands for movement can be taken into account. According to the Manual-book of Accessibility and an expert Job Haug, a good pedestrian path for people with a wheelchair, rollator and scoot mobile has to meet three geometrical demands for movement. This means that a pedestrian path forms an obstacle if it is narrower than 0.9 meter, steeper than 9.46° or if the height difference on the path is higher than 0.05 meter. The outcome, according to the assessment of the three available sensors (handheld Global Positioning System (GPS), Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS and camera) of the meet rollator by using the knowledge of the Master of Science program Geomatics, is that with a handheld GPS no precise positioning can be reached. Therefore handheld GPS data is not useful for generating accessibility information. According to the knowledge the two sensors RTK GPS and camera are useful for generating accessibility information. The outcome, according to the implementation of the developed workflow for deriving outdoor accessibility information for a selected research area, is that some paths in the outdoor environment of Amsterdam require improvements to make them accessible for mobility impaired people. Furthermore through data processing, more insight is gained into the usefulness of RTK GPS and camera data. The results showed that the used sensors did not provide the needed precision. For the validation of the derived outdoor accessibility information a division is made between the validation of RTK GPS observations and camera observations. The BGT+ is proved suitable for providing more insight in and put semantics to the total observations obtained by implementing the workflows. The ground truth is proved suitable for validating the obtained accessibility information derived from RTK GPS and camera data. Finally, the results of an algorithm made by the Urban Modelling Group (UMG) of the University College Dublin are proved suitable for validating the obtained accessibility information derived from camera data. A geo-database that structures the validated accessibility information is created in order to give an overview of the accessible and non-accessible paths for the research area. The derived accessibility information obtained via camera data can best be stored by using polygons, to represent complex areas. The derived accessibility information obtained via RTK GPS data can best be stored by using line strings. In conclusion, this MSc thesis has demonstrated that the current setting of the meet rollator provides insight into the accessibility of pedestrian routes for mobility impaired people. However, the used sensors did not provide the needed precision. In order to improve the current setting of the meet rollator the usefulness of other sensors should be further investigated.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Tassoul, M. (mentor); Oude Egberink, J. (mentor)","2015","Introduction Virtual Affairs (VA) is a leading FinTech company that exists to (re-)establish the relationship between financials and their customers. VA believes that the only way to stay relevant in today’s society is to start and end with the needs of users, and strive to continuously innovate a company’s offering around their users needs and behaviours. One of VA’s products is InsuranceRight (IR), an insurance solution specifically targeted for direct-to-consumer insurance companies. IR is designed to facilitate users to find and buy the products that fit them best. Today, people are mostly offered a common interface, product and treatment. Research, on the other hand, has shown that equal treatment of different target groups has a disadvantageous effect on customer satisfaction and their final purchasing behaviour. So, users should be approached to and provided with their specific needs. This means a personalized process for different groups of audiences. Project definition The aim of this graduation project is to:  Research the IR future users and their current experience with insurances and online insurance product interactions.  Translate research results into a website design for IR, that serves users to their specific needs. For this project is chosen to focus on car insurances. User research To address the first aim of this graduation project, an online survey, literature research and contextmapping research, are conducted. These resulted in two essential sets of design fundamentals:  The IR user types  The user experience of the online insurance domain The IR user types Four different types of financial users are identified: the self-directed, the validator, the delegator and the avoider. This distinction of types is based on two criteria: the extent to which information is self-collected and the consumer confidence on the service of an adviser. All different characteristics and needs are included within the IR design. The user experience of the online insurance domain In general it can be stated that there is low trust in insurance companies, and their products (insurances). This distrust is a blockade when taking out an insurance. It is mainly influenced by the user’s experience of the insurers attitude. In addition, the general knowledge about insurances is also quite low. For many, the insurance domain is unknown. People do not know what they need to be insured for, what these insurances mean, which is their best choice, and in the end whether they purchased the right insurance. These issues are reflecting the online insurance platforms as well. Often is thought: “If a site looks unreliable or is difficult to understand, the insurance will probably continue to be so”. Several aspects have an influence on the online purchasing thoughts and behaviour of users, like: overview, structure, information, approach, guidance, and safety. The IR website design To address the second aim of this graduation project, all data is translated into solutions for the IR website design. Guidelines The following general design guidelines are made to carry out the meaning of the design:  The design must facilitate different types of users  The design must help the user by providing a best fitting proposal  The design must lead to a convinced user Convinced of having made the right choices resulting in the right insurance for him/her  The design must communicate in a personal manner  The design must be transparent in terms of communication and process Supporting the sales funnel Currently, most process actions (AIDA) of users take place in the interaction designed for the final funnel step; action, which is not designed for orientation purposes. Improper facilitation at an earlier stage of the process can be assigned as reason. The IR website design contains a focus shift to the earlier steps of the process, to make the experience more pleasurable. There should be no distinction in experience between existing customers and prospects. A website visit can have multiple purposes, which lead to several flows, and actions. These actions are supported trough specific tools and serve users to their specific needs. The homepage is the first encounter between user and insurer. Since many people have a distrustful attitude toward insurers, IR will reassure the user with the introduction if the insurer. Additionally, the homepage presents the user with a set of tools. These tools represent different entries for different users, depending on their cause of visit. Life events The purchase of an insurance is mostly assigned to life events. When a life event occurs, people want to know what this means for their insured life. The tool ‘life events’ helps people with this question. By selecting an applicable life event, the website will forward to a life event checklist page. This page will give guidance in needed actions and suggested actions. Situation scan Many users visit an insurance website to obtain information. The tool situation scan will provide people with basic information for different situations. One can playfully learn what certain situations mean in real life, by means of simple and transparent information. When more information is needed, the user is provided with the option to learn more. License plate quickscan & selection support Instead of pulling a user into a purchase, the IR license plate quickscan will provide guidance on which one can choose to purchase. It can be challenging to determine whether a coverage is applicable to a users situation. IR features a selection tool, which contains a set of statements. Each statement belongs to a specific coverage. When answering the statement, a coverage suggestion is presented. Best matching proposal (BMP) The BMP is a proposal for users to consider, and take out when wanted. It is a summarizing document of all until then incurred actions. It includes all coverages and a total premium. This document has to convince the user to become a customer. Most people need time in order to make a decision. IR provides the user with tools to consider the proposal, compare it to competitive insurers, and discus it with others.","Customer experience; InsuranceRight; User centered design; Website design; Insurances","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Straub, A. (mentor)","2015","The growing awareness of delivering public services into more costumer-oriented minded triggers the public organisations to manage their assets professionally. Building assets are one of the resources owned by the public organisations that need to be maintained. Maintenance departments are part of the public body that have responsibilities to make sure that the building assets are functioning well and can perform for what it is designed for. The problems arise when there are many buildings that should be managed within different functions and types; such as monumental buildings, schools, offices, etc. creates complexities. Furthermore, the nature of public organisations is different compared to private organisations. Public organisations must follow the law and regulations, facilitating stakeholders’ opinions and politics, and satisfying public. It is questioned whether the maintenance departments are capable to perform the maintenance activities professionally. In order to reveal the capabilities of an organisation a measurement tool is needed. One of the measurement tools that can disclose the professionalism of organisations is a maturity model. With maturity model, an organisation can understand their current maturity level and design their strategy to reach the next level. Furthermore, this is a self-assessment tool that is simple to use. A maturity model can consist of several levels of five, six, or seven, that will depend on the desired function. It is believed that the higher the level, the more professional is the organisation. Several quality management tools are being used by many organisations to enhance their professionalism, for instance the EFQM model. The EFQM model is commonly used in Europe that has components of “enablers” and “results”. By using those components, organisations can value their performances and processes. The main purpose of this research is to develop a maturity model that can measure the capabilities of maintenance departments. By having this tool that specifically designed for building maintenance departments, they can design strategies that fit their goals. Furthermore, to narrow down the research, the subjects of Planned preventive maintenance and Responsive maintenance are involved. To develop a maturity model as an adaptation of the EFQM model, there are several steps to do. Firstly, the literature reviews are conducted. The topics that have to be explored are the types of maturity models, the EFQM model, and the activities of maintenance departments include the Planned preventive maintenance and Responsive maintenance. There are two maturity models that become main references; the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) by Paulk et.al (1993) and the Public Commissioning Maturity Model (PCMM) by Hermans et.al (2014). The main important aspects of the maintenance departments are then summarised and linked to those maturity models and the EFQM enablers. The result is the proposed maturity model. Secondly, the first round interviews are conducted to get opinions and feedbacks from the experts about the proposed maturity model. This will find the relevancy of the key aspects in the model. The results of these interviews are the proposed maturity model and maturity levels. The third step in this research is to design an assessment sheet that can be used to measure the maturity level. This proposed assessment sheets are consisting of 26 questions with five multiple choices for each question. The fourth step is to carry on the second round interviews to explore whether the proposed assessment sheet is relevant to test maintenance departments. The results of the interviews improve the questions and the multiple answers, which are improving the maturity levels. Finally, as final products of this research, a maturity model for maintenance departments and an assessment sheet are formed. The final maturity model consists of five main aspects, 20 sub aspects, and five levels for every main aspects and sub aspects. The final assessment sheet is consisting of 27 questions with five multiple answers per question.","maturity model; EFQM; maintenance; building maintenance; asset management; quality improvement; public sector; public organisation; organisation management; performance measurement; maintenance department; maintenance organisation; construction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Design and Construction Management","",""

(mentor); Debacker, J. (mentor); Sivignon, S. (mentor)","2015","Today, two trends can be observed when it comes to commercial aircraft. On the one hand, on top, aircraft cabins are becoming increasingly cramped with more seats. On the other hand, below in the cargo hold, only about 40% of the volume is estimated to be used. The combination of these two trends leads to an interesting proposition - can passengers travel in the cargo hold? This project takes over the reins from a previous graduation report already executed towards this direction. The focus of the work previously done, was mainly on establishing that a passenger cabin in the aircraft cargo hold is a technically feasible option. However, in order for such a cabin to truly fly, it would need to meet the other two criteria for any new design or innovation - The business feasibility of such a proposition should be realistic and convincing. In addition, one must ensure that such a new cabin is desirable for passengers. This project views the concept of the Lower Deck Passenger Cabin through these two lenses. Insights and knowledge were gathered through several methods such as literature research, data analytics on airline databases and reaching out to experts from both within and beyond the field of aviation. Additionally, in order to better understand aspects of passenger desirability without developing a full-scale mockup, two prototyping routes were followed. One was through building a low-fidelity physical mock-up over an existing aircraft mock-up cabin. The other was through a virtual reality set up. Through analysis, opportunities and threats are identified when contrasting a travel experience in the Lower Deck to that in a regular aircraft cabin. This is followed by recommendations on how to not only address these threats but also to leverage opportunities that makes travel in the Lower Deck a differentiated flying experience. In conclusion, the Lower Deck is seen to possess the versatility to accommodate a range of uses encompassing both seats and functionality. To this end, several use scenarios for the lower deck are detailed in order to demonstrate this flexibility. Each of these scenarios touch back upon and validate the concept against the two chosen focus areas - desirability and feasibility. The key next steps are identified and recommendations are provided along with a roadmap to move the concept towards reality.","aviation; design; cargo; passenger; experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2017-10-29","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); De Vreede, L.C.N. (mentor); Mattheijssen, P. (mentor); Van der Heijden, M.P. (mentor)","2015","SiGe bipolar amplifiers are getting more competitive in terms of noise figure to GaAs amplifiers. However, the linearity of these amplifiers is still limited in view of these GaAs implementations. In order to address and overcome these linearity limitations, this thesis report will start demonstrating that the linearity of SiGe bipolar amplifiers for base stations applications is limited by the base-collector charge related distortion. More specifically, it will be shown that in a CE-stage, the Cbc distortion tends to limit the linearity when the exponential distortion has been canceled. Using cross-coupled capacitive Cbc compensation, the OIP3 of the CE-stage can be still improved when all other transistor properties are close to ideal. However, once the base-emitter capacitances are added to the transistor model description, this linearity improvement vanishes again. Traditionally, people overcome Cbc related constraints in a CE-stage by moving to a cascode configuration. However, it will be shown that in a cascode configuration the Cbc of the CB-stage becomes the limiting linearity factor, again under the assumption that exponential induced distortion of the CE-stage has been effectively canceled. To overcome the Cbc distortion in the cascode configuration, 3 different techniques have been developed in this report. The first technique, a dedicated out-of-band matching has been proposed to cancel Cbc distortion. However, when considering the complete cascode lineup, it proves that the out-of-band currents from the CE-stage interfere with this Cbc compensation. Different methods have been proposed for cancellation of these currents, but only the use of an intermediate transformer between the CE- and CB-stage seems to be the most promising option. The second technique developed aims for passive in-band Cbc compensation. A compensation circuit containing a series combination of an inductor, a resistor and a multiplied copy of the Cbc capacitance can give exact compensation to Cbc distortion in a limited frequency band, however it proves to be quite sensitive to device parasitics. The last technique studied is active Cbc compensation. By sensing the currents in the base of the CB-stage, the nonlinear Cbc currents could be injected into the circuit with opposite phase, creating a much more linear amplifier. However, practical implementations also need to be stable to avoid oscillation. Adding stabilizing elements in the base of the CB-stage connection increases interactions between the Cbc of the CB-stage and the stabilization network. Due to IM3 currents from the CE-stage and phase deviations between these currents and the IM3 current from the Cbc of the CB-stage, the OIP3 will not increase when the Mextram model has been used. Although many linearization techniques have been developed and extensively studied, improvements are still needed to come to more practical, robust and product proven linearity enhancement techniques. Consequently, in the concluding chapter clear recommendations are given for future research followed by the overall conclusions of this thesis work.","LNA; Cbc; linearity; OIP3; base-collector capacitance; distortion; bipolar amplifiers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-29","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Microelectronics","",""

To make the back transformation possible an energy reflection problem was corrected in the model of the cochlea. An inverse filter, digital signal processing, approach in the frequency domain is used for the back transformation. To effectively simulate hearing loss the inverse filter uses the entire cochlear output which is systematically combined to form the resynthesized sound. Using the inverse filter of a normal model on the output from a model that simulates a damaged ear allows for sound to be created as a hearing disabled person would hear it. Results show that the effect of damage in one region of the cochlea propagates to other parts of the cochlea thereby being a more comprehensive hearing loss simulator than traditional digital signal processing methods. The developed techniques introduce a more accurate method to simulate hearing loss and form a solid base for future work on simulating hearing loss.","Simulating Hearing Loss; Transmission Line Cochlea Model; Cochlea Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","Computer Simulations for Science and Engineering","",""

This forces the government to respond to the cities needs, for now mainly on infrastructure and housing. Also Addis Ketema, an inner city neighbourhood known for its commerce and market, is under pressure of development. These changes have proven to be a thread for local communities and micro-economies that exist in these informal settlements, where people inventively produce goods in self built and extended dwellings. On the other hand these changes bring opportunities to improve living conditions. But current solutions for housing, mainly in the form of condominiums, have proven not to be sufficient in terms of preservation of social networks and the adaptability and appropriation of the apartments. The design proposal intervenes on a small scale according to historical plot division to provide an urban backbone. This secures the current urban pattern without disrupting it. Next to that it gives freedom for other developments to take place within the set boundaries by the design proposal. This creates a diverse and vibrant part of the city. The building blocks consist of a support structure with brick cores, in which the piping, bathrooms and kitchens are located, and a concrete skeleton providing structural safety. In this support structure public space and street connections are secured. This support on its turn provides freedom for the dwellings that are in it. Different combinations can be made, varying from a relatively big dwelling with a shop downstairs to two small studio spaces sharing the support facilities of bathroom and kitchen. This concept of providing a more permanent support giving freedom for adaptability for the dwelling infill is present in the materialisation as well; the support is made of brick and concrete while the floors and walls of the infill is mainly made of bamboo and cement screed.","housing; slum; informal; renewal; support; infill","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Architecture and Dwelling","","9.026605, 38.734455"

The purpose of this research was to find suitable solutions for the renovation of porch apartments in the Netherlands. The 2nd skin that will be applied in this design should not only be energy efficient, but should also trigger the occupants to use it in an energy efficient and healthy way. The target group on which these designs were tested are elderly. Because of their different deterioration aspects and the fact they have to live independently longer, we should make sure they are able to use this façade too (in an energy efficient and healthy way). This research has resulted in a few integrated final designs that mainly consist of two parts; a design for a home energy management system (HEMS) and a façade element design. The HEMS designs focus on how to trigger different user profiles of elderly to live energy neutral and besides that make elderly aware of the necessity to ventilate regularly (to improve the health of their indoor climate). The façade element mainly focuses on the comfort preferences of elderly and the improvement of their mental and physical health. Besides that of course the façade element meets the stricter rules regarding to the energy efficiency. All designs are projected on a reference project; the BAM 2nd skin project in Rotterdam.

Introducing in MidCity an ICT related project, the Urban Lab, will constitute the chance to achieve a structured environment and to organise services in space where single workers or team of creatives, entrepreneurs, start-up can gather together, start a business, develop ideas, in the major frame of the benefit fostered by the provided common facilities (FabLab i.e.), the social relations enhanced (networking) and the cooperation promoted (co-working).","Chicago; Urban; Lab; Coworking; Startup; Spine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Complex Projects","",""

(mentor)","2015","Underactuated grippers are developed to grasp objects of varying shape and sizes without the need to rely on sensors and feedback systems. This main aspect makes underactuated grippers efficient in their ability to automatically distribute the actuation force to multiple outputs. Besides actuating multiple phalanges by the actuation principle, it is also possible to drive multiple fingers. An interesting approach is to give the actuator a spatial degree of freedom and suspend it such that it can provide its power both to the shaft as to the unconstrained degree of freedom. There already exist designs that apply this working principle to distribute a force to two and four fingers, without the need for additional differential mechanisms. In both cases the fingers are divided into two pairs, where one pair is connected to the rotor and the other to the stator. When the actuator is activated a force is transferred to the fingers connected to the rotor. The reaction force, caused by the actuation force, is acting on the stator and this force is transferred to the fingers connected to the stator. The aim of this report is to determine how the floating actuator principle can best be implemented such that the number of outputs is as high as possible. The theoretical maximum number of outputs a floating actuator differential can achieve is seven, namely six spatial degrees of freedom and the actuated shaft. In this report it was found that it highly unlikely that this system can provide seven outputs for a sufficient workspace, due to kinematic restraints introduced by dependencies between the orientation and the position of the actuator. For the concept with a maximum of six outputs the floating actuator principle can provide ample torque for a sufficient range of motion for the fingers. The prototype, as developed in this report, shows that the floating actuator principle works for a system with six outputs.","Underactuated Gripper; Floating Actuator; Differential Mechanism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); De Jong, P. (mentor)","2015","The built environment is one of the major causes of climate change that is felt around the world. Therefore there is an increasing global and local focus on strategies that address the causes of climate change and these strategies are continuously being designed and developed. The built environment contributes about half of all greenhouse gas emissions and this problem needs to be tackled. This can be realized by tempering the demand for energy, land and materials resulting from new developments by taking better care of the existing building stock. Investments are necessary to increase the sustainability of the built environment. Cities like Melbourne and Sydney are already actively promoting building adaptive reuse as a strategy that supports their programme for developing carbon-neutral cities, while in the Netherlands building adaptation is mostly driven by vacancy. Office vacancy is another major problem in the Netherlands. Long-term vacancy is very unfavourable because of the continuing energy use and maintenance while the building is not used for any function. The embodied energy in buildings lowers due to reuse and recycling of building materials, which also reduces waste. This is one of the clear advantages of adaptation. However, new constructions with recyclable materials, possibly retrieved from demolition works, also reduce waste. So the question here is, which one of the two strategies, adaptation or demolition & new build, is considered to be more environmentally sustainable. Both strategies can be used in order to reduce office vacancy in the Netherlands. The combination of the environmental problems, of which the built environment causes a major part, and the problem of office vacancy is the starting point of this research. To compare Adaptation and Demolition & New Build as a strategy for office buildings when concerning environmental sustainability, a Step-by-Step Decision Support Plan named the ADNB Indicator was developed. The ADNB Indicator consists of four steps, where step 1 is a veto checklist to determine whether this plan is suitable for the office building in question. Step 2 entails adjusting the weighting to user preference and leads to step 3 with a score card that consists of statements that need to be answered with yes or no. These statements are part of the aspects Location, Building design, Energy, Material use, and Services. And finally step 4 shows the result of how the two strategies score. To use the ADNB Indicator in practise, it is developed in Excel.","Adaptation; Demolition & New Build; Environmental sustainability; Step-by-Step Decision Support Plan","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","","",""

(mentor); Bakker, K.J. (mentor); Pasterkamp, S. (mentor); Robbemont, A. (mentor); Reinders, K. (mentor)","2015","Widely deformable subsoil verifies a predominant concern in the design and construction of high-rise buildings. Extensive total and differential settlements are observed that are usually not in accordance to the predictions. In the Netherlands, the problem appears to be more intense in Rotterdam, the city that counts the largest number of skyscrapers. For this case, settlements are caused mainly due to an increase of stresses on deep “Kedichem” layers below pile tip. This master thesis attempts to deal with this problem, in terms of a consistent modeling approach for the interactive system (building and sub-structure). The developed method should sufficiently consider essential interactive parameters, predicting more accurate settlements with the minimum possible cost. Cost is defined as invested time, knowledge, effort and financial outcome through the design process and it is desired to be balanced between geotechnical and structural engineer. The investigation is done through a real-built case, de Rotterdam, and the results are compared with measurements one year after the end of the construction. The stiffness of the system (slabs, cores, pile foundation and subsoil) and load distribution are verified as important aspects for a consistent interactive modeling. The proposed modeling method concerns a simplified FE (Finite Element) coupled model in a geotechnical software (Plaxis), so that advanced constitutive models can be applied. Equivalent elements are incorporated for slabs, cores and pile foundation. The validation of the imposed simplifications is examined through comparison with more accurate models. The way that interactive system affects soil response and load redistribution is also examined. Special attention is paid on core modeling, since, as vertical elements, their considered stiffness is associated with the building height in the model. A comparative study between the developed models, both in 2D and 3D modeling is implemented, considering the deviations in results from the most accurate model against the invested cost (as described above). The results reveal that core stiffness is sufficiently considered, when a reduced building height (e.g. basement) is incorporated in the model. By furthering increasing the height, slight differences are observed. As an outcome of the research, differential settlements calculated with the proposed approach come closer to reality. Even though deviations from measurements are noticed, a similar settlement distribution yields for most models, even for the most detailed. This fact indicates that the observed deviations are not related to applied simplifications, nor to the modeling of the building. On the contrary, the more even settlement distribution is probably related to underestimation of pile shaft friction. By incorporating in the model a lower value of the shaft friction or of its distribution length, load transfer above pile tip is reduced compared to reality and deep Kedichem layers are activated in a smaller zone. However, a better simulation of pile foundation is achieved and building stiffness is modeled in an accurate way. As a result, improved results are observed, compared to the conventional approach and we can conclude that the aim of this research, as a better modeling approach for the interactive system, is achieved.","soil-structure interaction; Kedichem layer; high-rise buildings; pile foundation; building stiffness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Building Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

The rate of preterm births has increased remarkably. Prematurity of birth can predispose neonates to undesirable cessations of breathing, a condition termed as Apnea of Prematurity. The prevalence of this condition poses problems, because when untreated or inadequately treated Apnea of Prematurity, may impair development. This thesis investigates the automated central apnea detection in preterminfants based on raw waveform analysis of one-lead ECG and chest impedance signals. For this purpose, 18 novel features and 34 features of existing research that characterize different aspects of chest impedance and ECG signals were extracted for automated apnea classification. Features aim to extract information regarding respiratory and cardiac regularity, estimated from chest impedance and ECG signals. These features are indicators of some properties of cardio-respiratory physiology, which is not independent of the presence of apnea and thus can be in turn used to classify apnea. The objective is to find the most discriminative subset of features from one-lead ECG and chest impedance signals that can be used by a machine-learning approach to study and accurately detect central apnea. This was achieved by applying feature selection algorithms in order to remove redundant or irrelevant features without incurring much loss of information. In this thesis, nine hours of continuously recorded data of ten very low-birth-weight infants (birthweight < 1,500 gr) undergoing continuous cardiopulmonary monitoring in the NICU at Maxima Medisch Centrum from 2008 were included in the analysis. The dataset was annotated by two neonatologists. Results from this work indicate that the analysis of chest impedance and ECG signals with a support vector machine can automatically detect Apnea of Prematurity.","central apnea; apnea of prematurity; classification techniques; apnea detection; respiratory; cardiac; cardio-respiratory features","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Signals & Systems","",""

(mentor); Trichias, K. (mentor)","2015","Virtual Sectorization (ViS) is proposed as a solution to cope with the exponential growth of data traffic in mobile networks. Through the use of an Active Antenna System (AAS), two vertically separated beams (serving two distinct cells) are created within the original coverage area of a macro-cell. One of these cells, referred to as virtual cell, can be flexibly placed anywhere within the original coverage area because the large antenna array is capable of producing very narrow beams. The position of the virtual cell is done by choosing an electrical azimuth and downtilt such that the virtual cell’s footprint is as much as possible steered towards an area of relatively heavy traffic (a traffic hotspot). The key advantage of the approach is that, depending on the choice for deployment, either the spectrum or the transmit power is reused in the same geographical region, which provides an increase of traffic handling capacity. With an antenna beam directed to a specific area of high user density, more users can potentially benefit from better antenna gain and hence experience higher Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) values compared to the non-ViS case. However, the involved trade-offs make the deployment of ViS non-trivial. Using ViS implies a reduction of either transmit power or bandwidth for the macro-cell, and one additional interferer in the network, both of which can have a negative effect on performance if not addressed correctly. In order to cope with the complexity of these trade-offs, SON algorithms capable of dynamically share the spectrum or power resources between virtual and macro-cells, as the ones presented in this thesis work, are needed. The key functionality of these algorithms is to find an optimum configuration for the given resource sharing scheme which is able to maximize the network capacity while minimizing the aforementioned negative effects.","SON; LTE; AAS; ViS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Telecommunications and Sensing Systems","",""

(mentor)","2015","When a disaster strikes a human-engineered environment, it can be difficult and dangerous for rescue workers to search for survivors. Collapsed buildings, fire and other hazards can make specific areas too dangerous to send in a human or dog. In this case, urban search and rescue (USAR) robots can be useful. Various researches have been conducted on small legged robots navigating over rough terrain. The design of these robots varies amongst researches, ranging from short four-legged robots to long flexible centipede-like models and even modular robots. Often, a new body morphology feature is tested by incorporating it in a new design and testing the performance of the robot on a rough terrain landscape. However, in this way the new feature is tested but not compared against other body morphologies on the same landscape. Therefore it is difficult to say which design is the most promising. In this thesis project, different body morphologies are tested and compared in simulation on various obstacles. A model of a modular centipede robot was designed, consisting of small bipedal units that can connect together and form a centipede of various lengths. Extensive simulations were conducted to be able to compare different connection types between the units (one or two active/passive degrees-of-freedom), and different robot lengths (changing the number of connected units). The results show that on a fractal landscape, adding degrees-of-freedom to the mechanical design of a modular centipede robot will not result in a better performance. Also, increasing the length shows only little improvement if the robots consists of more than 5 units. For a step or gap obstacle, an actively controlled pitch motion must be incorporated in the spine, preferably with a high torque. Increasing the length of a centipede robot with an actively controlled spine will enable it to cross a larger gap or climb a higher step. This thesis project has laid the ground work for the design of a new urban search and rescue robot using modular bipedal units. The results may be used as a guide for the mechanical design of such a robot.","centipede; search & rescue; USAR; zebro; RHex; spine; flexible robot; rough terrain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BioRobotics","",""

(mentor)","2015","Monitoring of coastal hydrodynamics over a relatively large spatial extent and a long temporal period is essential to assess the impact of coastline interventions on several functions. An example of a recent coastline intervention is the Sand Engine, a pilot project for optimization of (future) coastline maintenance. This innovative pilot project is therefore subject to an intensive research and monitoring program that allows for development and validation of new measurement techniques. Continuous series of spatial hydrodynamics measured by remote sensing instruments have the potential to complement the temporally and spatially limited measurements of in-situ instruments. In this thesis, the accuracy of hydrodynamics measured with a land-based X-band radar at the Sand Engine is examined. The mapping of the sea surface by an X-band radar results in wave dispersion patterns in the radar domain over time. This allows for the extraction of spatial maps of the hydrodynamic parameters d and U by spectral (Fourier) analysis of wave dispersion patterns on a limited spatial scale (computational cube size). Previous research has shown that the spatial and temporal scale of wave dispersion analysis are critical factors for the accuracy of remotely-sensed currents. The recently developed open-source XMFit algorithm (Friedman(2014)) is used to extract X-band radar currents. It is not exactly known what X-band radar derived currents exactly represent. In addition, there is no agreement whether a radar measures Eulerian or Lagrangian currents. Therefore, the objective is to find the relation between spatial scale of wave dispersion analysis and X-band radar current measurement accuracy at the Sand Engine by performing point and spatial validation of currents obtained by analysis of wave dispersion on different spatial scales. The Sand Engine study site was selected due to availability of both Eulerian ADCP and Lagrangian drifter measurements. The relation between measurement accuracy and computational cube size was found to be hyperbolic for both the point and spatial validation, which is connected to the hyperbolic relation between cube size and spectral resolution dk. In-situ current estimates are consistently overestimated by XMFit for grid points within the first 500 m from the coastline. Non-linear wave effects cause anomalies in the image spectrum compared to the definition of a useful spectrum. These anomalies do not follow linear theory on which the method is based and therefore have a negative effect on the current estimate of XMFit. In the point validation at two ADCP locations, XMFit current estimates were compared to pseudo-Lagrangian ADCP currents. The pseudo-Lagrangian ADCP currents are obtained by correcting Eulerian ADCP measurements for the surface Stokes drift. A direct comparison of XMFit to the Stokes-drift corrected ADCP measurements proves that the correlation in cross-shore direction is high. This supports that X-band radar currents are Lagrangian. The spatial validation by drifter measurements is performed for another temporal period. The accuracy is significantly lower then during the point validation period: a significant offset in current direction between drifter and radar measurements is observed. A sensitivity analysis showed that, for this period in time, malfunctioning of the spectral filter to remove aliased spectral energy causes this offset. It was proven that no offset in direction is observed when optimal spectral filtering parameters are selected. Finally it is emphasized that optimization of spectral quality is the key to even more accurate current estimates.

(mentor); Scarano, F. (mentor)","2015","Aircraft noise has come under severe scrutiny due to growing number of airports and airline operations. The noise generated by high lift devices is now comparable to the turbofan engines due to increasing bypass ratios. A Gurney flap is a suitable starting point to study trailing edge flap aeroacoustics due to additional lift characteristics and a simple geometry. The thesis aims in using Time-Resolved Particle Image Velocimetry to understand the dynamics of flow as well as identifying structures responsible for the tonal noise in a Gurney flap. TR-PIV was used to obtain, at a high spatial and temporal resolution, the flow dynamics associated with a Gurney flap at low Mach and high Reynolds number. A part of the thesis focussed on validating the two modes of shedding as an additional lift increment mechanism in a Gurney flap in case of a fully developed turbulent boundary layer. Flow statistics showed an upstream recirculation region, upper and lower separating shear layers and a main recirculation region whose size varied with Gurney flap size and angle of attack downstream of the flap. The instantaneous velocity and vorticity fields showed the flapping motion of the von Karman wake and corresponding vortex roll-up and shedding process. The power spectral density of flow fluctuations as well as the acoustic spectra, however, did not indicate any second mode of shedding. The Strouhal numbers of the vortex shedding for various Gurney flaps were close to that of a bluff body in a flow. Stereoscopic PIV measurements showed the periodic vortex shedding to be highly correlated in the spanwise direction (correlation length of 4cm). The large spanwise correlation length indicates the use of serrations can be useful in breaking-down such coherent structures. The tonal peaks were clearly audible and correspond to the vortex shedding frequency. Causality correlation between pressure fluctuations generated in the far-eld and the near-field fluctuations indicate a high correlation with unsteady vertical velocity in the wake (associated with unsteady lift). It was found that the dynamics in the upstream recirculation region (cavity) was not responsible in the production of noise. Further, the results indicate the location of the actual source of noise to be the flap. The high values of correlation further downstream are due to the presence of an upstream source (the flap) and are not sources of sound themselves. Thus, TR-PIV in a way clears the ambiguity expressed by other researchers in the past in interpreting the high values of correlation to be sources of sound.","Gurney flap; Aeroacoustics; Causality correlation; Flow dynamics; TR-PIV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","","Aerodynamics","",""

(mentor); Stroux, S.A. (mentor)","2015","The topic of the research is the added value of the architect in adaptation-projects of State listed monuments. An adaptation-project is a construction project in which the function of the building changes. The research focussed on State listed monuments. These buildings are of national importance and therefore law protects them. This results in a more complex process due to the involvement of several additional actors. Despite the increasing complexity, a lack of knowledge was detected about the roles, besides designing, which the architect should perform in current adaptation-projects of monuments in the Netherlands. The research tried to reduce this lack of knowledge by answering the following question: What are the roles of an architect in an (contemporary) adaptation-project of a State listed monument, which contribute to enhancing the success rate of the adaptation? By means of a case study method and a focus group method, the research defined different roles besides designing, which are important for the success of the adaptation. For the case study method, five successful adaptation-projects of State listed monuments were studied. With the focus group method, a group-discussion was organized and participants with different perspectives joined the discussion. These methods allowed answering the research question. A scheme is made, which forms the result of the research. In this scheme, the situations are described, which occur in adaptation-projects of monuments and which can lead to fundamental challenges. Different roles are described for an architect in each of these situations. The scheme also describes the importance of the roles for the situations, why the architect should perform the roles, and what the influences in the project are for an architect to be able to perform the roles. Finally, the scheme also describes which knowledge and skills an architect should possess in order to be able to perform the roles. Based on this result, recommendations are written towards (future) adaptation-architects and towards clients and project managers in adaptation-projects of monuments.","adaptation; state listed monument; architect; transformatie; rijksmonument","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Management in the Built Environment","","Adaptive Reuse","",""

(mentor); Schouten, J.J. (mentor); Zijlema, M. (mentor); Vuik, V. (mentor); Cao, H.J. (mentor)","2015","As human beings are becoming more and more aware of importance of the environment, resorts to clean energy have provoked great interest for the past decades. As a sort of clean power, wind has been widely considered as an ideal energy source to generate electricity. That is why the offshore wind farm plans have been drawn up, specifically in North Sea in Europe. Besides, in order to comply with marine spatial planning which aims to make use of marine resources sustainably, seaweed aquaculture will also be operated among wind farm zone under wind turbines, which provides the food necessity for mankind. The introduction of seaweed aquaculture may have influences on local hydrodynamics as seaweed attenuates waves, which may further affect the environment. This effect has not been understood. Therefore this study is conducted to investigate the impact of seaweed aquaculture on wind waves. As a relatively young sector, few studies have been found on the effect of floating vegetation on waves. Since there is no ready-to-use hydrodynamic model which can deal with floating seaweed, it is required to set up a numerical model and calibrate this model with experimental data. In this research the wave modelling program SWAN is used owing to the fact that there exists a vegetation model in SWAN. In this model the vegetation is schematised as stiff cylinders mounted at the bottom. The energy dissipation by vegetation is calculated as work carried out by the drag force induced by cylinders. However, the function of this vegetation model in SWAN is somewhat different from what is required for this study.  Firstly, the SWAN deals with bottom-mounted vegetation while in this research floating vegetation is addressed.  Secondly, in SWAN model stiff objects are considered while in current research the vegetation possesses flexibility. With flexibility the drag force will become smaller as the relative velocity between water particle and vegetation gets smaller. On the other hand, the inertial force may have an impact on the wave energy dissipation. Considering these two differences, corresponding measures need to be taken to meet the requirement of this study. To model the floating vegetation, the original vegetation model has been modified. In the beginning, the floating vegetation model is achieved by dividing the vegetation into two vertical layers and making the lower layer virtual. There is drawback in this model: only flatbed can be applied. For sensitivity analysis and calibration this model works well, but it is not applicable in the case study as non-flat seabed is implemented in the model setup. It leads to a second modification in the SWAN model. The method is to alter the interval of integration of dissipation term by vegetation, which results in further change in the source code. To account for the flexibility, the bulk drag coefficient is adjusted. This parameter accommodates the influence of flexibility of vegetation and uncertainty of other parameters related to the model. To test this floating vegetation model a sensitivity analysis is performed. Relevant parameters in this model are varied to see its individual influence on the wave dissipation. It has been observed that a larger wave height results in a higher dissipation rate. The opposite has been seen for wave period. Wave with a larger peak period gives a smaller wave height behind the vegetation field. It has been also demonstrated that larger vegetation length, larger vegetation diameter and larger vegetation density give rise to greater dissipation rates. In addition, spectrum analysis shows that the energy dissipation rate varies along the frequency domain with the greatest magnitude of energy dissipation observed at around the peak frequency. To calibrate this model the experimental data is used, obtained from flume test in Technology University of Braunschweig. The calibration is conducted by adjusting the bulk drag coefficient until that the floating vegetation model describes the experiment data. By this method a fitted drag coefficient is obtained for each wave condition. It has been verified that drag coefficient depends on both the wave condition and vegetation parameters. The relation between wave condition and vegetation characteristic is indicated by KC-number or Reynolds number. Through this calibration a relation between drag coefficient and Reynolds number or KC-number is obtained. With the calibrated model, a case study is conducted in the North Sea. The dominant wave data for the period 1991-2010 is used, as well as corresponding wind information. The vegetation parameters (vegetation density, vegetation width and vegetation length) are set according to local cultivation. With this information and the drag coefficient function obtained from the calibration stage, the drag coefficient for the field condition is obtained. Implementing all relevant input parameters in the model, the result shows that the dissipation is species specific. Also from the results it is shown that wave attenuation occurs mainly in the local scale. Behind the vegetation field waves develop due to the directional spreading. At the South boundary 85% of the wave height remains. Reflecting on the uncertainty associated with this study, such as measurement data, calibration of drag coefficient and parameterising the vegetation diameter in the field condition, it is still questionable whether seaweed aquaculture has a significant impact on the wind waves or not.","floating seaweed; wave; numerical modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","51.758979, 3.038888"

In Control by Interconnection (CbI), the controller is another PH system that is connected to the plant through a power preserving interconnection to add up the energy functions. However, a major issue in this is that the choice of Casimir function and controller Hamiltonian is left to the discretion of the designer and requires experience to make a good choice. In this thesis, an attempt is made to eliminate this problem by using machine learning algorithms (in particular, reinforcement learning) to let the computer ""learn"" the best controller design. Moreover, the assumption that both the plant and the controller must be passive leads to what is known as the dissipation obstacle, which means that dissipation is allowed only on those states/coordinates of the energy function which do not require shaping. This imposes restrictions on the applications. Here, it is attempted to try to go beyond this dissipation obstacle and achieve a dynamic feedback controller.","port-Hamiltoninan systems; Reinforcement Learning; Control by Interconnection; Dissipation Obstacle; Actor Critic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-04-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems and Control","",""

It supports power system operation by providing ancillary services, and facilitates a seamless transition between grid-connected and islanded operation. In this work, previous small-signal modelling and analysis carried out for a VSM implementation has been adapted and expanded to include a synchronous machine (SM) with a control scheme similar to those of traditional generation units and to the one used in the VSM implementation. A nonlinear state-space analytical model has been developed for a traditional power generation unit in grid-connected mode (SM system). The model allows the study of the SM system in similar conditions/context as the grid-connected VSM implementation (VSM system), and facilitates their comparison. Moreover, it can represent the most relevant dynamic characteristics of a round or salient-pole rotor SM, including the amortisseur circuits or the representation of the corresponding damping torque in the swing equation of a reduced-order version of the model. The developed model has been linearised analytically, to obtain the respective small-signal model. The eigenvalue analysis of the modelled systems has indicated that most of the SM system eigenvalues (modes) are slower or not as well damped as the VSM system ones. Moreover, most SM system modes have shown to be relatively fixed and determined mainly by non-tunable parameters. The modelled exciter has presented little capability of increasing the damping of oscillations, and its integral gain has demonstrated to be the tunable parameter that can most easily cause instability in the SM system. The location of the 4 slowest and least damped SM system eigenvalues has shown to be limited by non-tunable parameters, indicating that the performance or robustness of such system cannot be significantly improved. A trade-off has been observed in the placement of the VSM system critical modes: increasing the virtual inductance improves the damping of oscillations, while making the system response slower. However, parametric sweep analysis has indicated that a good compromise between performance and robustness could be achieved by decreasing the virtual inductance and increasing the phase lock loop proportional gain.","Distributed generation; Energy conversion; Inertia emulation; Power electronic control; Small-signal stability; Small-signal modelling; Small-signal analysis; Virtual synchronous machine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","European Wind Energy Master","",""

Robotics decision-making problems are of importance and provide interesting applications for reinforcement learning; however, since real-world robots have many degrees of freedom, high-dimensionality arises when applying reinforcement learning algorithms. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have the potential to reduce the high-dimensional state spaces without losing information. A low-dimensional representation is generated by training a multilayer neural network with a small central layer to reconstruct high-dimensional input vectors. Back- propagation algorithms can be used to tune the weightings in this neural network with the help of the gradient descent method. The objective of this project is to develop approaches of applying deep neural networks with reinforcement learning, hereby, efficiently generating dynamic policies in robot motion-control ap- plications. More specifically, the objective of this project is to overcome the high-dimensionality challenge in reinforcement learning with the help of deep neural networks, a stacked auto-encoder, and using various types of sensory inputs like angles and angular velocities in the manipulator. Experimentally, a simple segway system, which consists of a link and a wheel, is used to test per- formance. The main approach to improve the learning performance is to develop a low-dimensional representation replacing the original inputs that describe the current states of the segway system in the learning process and using a stacked auto-encoder instead.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems and control","",""

(mentor)","2015","Novel and solvent-free routes for producing solid-state electrolyte membranes for lithium ion batteries containing Li[N(CF3SO2)2] (LiTFSI) and Arnitel® copolymers produced and provided by DSM are proposed and elaborated in this graduation project. Other lithium salts such as Li[B(C2O4)2] (LiBOB) and LiCl have also been tested, but more research has been focused on LiTFSI. Arnitel materials with variable proportions of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) have been used. The presented solvent-free methods of incorporating the lithium salt are intended as an alternative to the solvent route, that involves the use of hazardous HFiP, previously investigated in internal DSM research. The methods proposed in this work are based on two different concepts: one involves melting the polymer and mixing in the lithium salt (referred to as melt-mixing), while the other two techniques make use of water as a medium to carry and incorporate the salt in the polymer chains. This has been performed on Arnitel pellets (method named water soaking) and on thin films of the same material (referred to as thin film soaking). The water can then be removed by complete drying. Samples produced through melt-mixing and water soaking have then undergone hot pressing and thus thin (150-200µm) free-standing electrolytes have successfully been prepared. DSC and electrochemical analysis such as impedance measurements between room temperature and approximately 65°C, cyclic voltammetry and lithium plating experiments are presented. The samples prepared during this research proved to have room temperature conductivity as high as 10-5 S/cm. Electrochemical stability seems instead to be an issue in the lower voltage, but this is ascribed to the inherent behaviour between the lithium electrolyte and seems to be independent of the production method used. Such electrochemical results are aligned with the internal DSM data on samples produced via the solvent route: it is therefore possible to consider the proposed production routes as feasible alternatives for cheaper, safer and more environmentally friendly methods to produce Arnitel-based solid-state electrolytes for lithium ion batteries.","PEO; electrolyte; lithium ion; solvent-free","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Material Science and Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Veen, G.J. (mentor); Langelaar, M. (mentor)","2015","The design of high performance instruments often involves the attenuation of poorly damped resonant modes. These resonant modes are a limiting factor to the performance of these instruments. Current design approaches typically start from a baseline design and introduce stiffening or damping reinforce- ments to tune and/or damp these modes. However, the influence on the structural damping of these reinforcements is difficult to predict and often results in trial and error-based design approaches for the design of damping reinforcements. A common solution is to introduce viscoelastic material in baseline designs to increase structural damping. These materials dissipate energy when subjected to deformation and should therefore be located at positions which undergo large deformations during vibration. Typically, the viscoelastic material is placed in conventional (un)constrained layer damping configurations. However, to achieve optimized damping characteristics both the location as well as the geometry of viscoelastic material should be optimized. In this thesis, a multi-material topology optimization routine is presented as a systematic method- ology to develop structures with optimal damping characteristics. The proposed method applies a multi-material, parametric level set-based approach to simultaneously distribute structural and vis- coelastic material within the design domain. The developed optimization routine allows for the design of freeform, viscoelastic dampers without the limitation to conventional (un)constrained layer damp- ing configurations and is thereby able to achieve improved damping characteristics. The structural loss factor is applied as a performance measure to compare the damping between different viscoelastically damped structures and as objective function during the optimization. The viscoelastic material behavior is represented by a complex-valued material modulus, which results in a complex-valued eigenvalue problem. The formulation of the structural loss factor is modified to account for the complex-valued eigensolutions, resulting in accurate assessment of the structural loss factor for designs containing viscoelastic material with high material loss factors. The optimization routine maximizes the structural loss factor for single or multiple selected eigen- modes. An adjoint sensitivity analysis is performed to provide an exact expression for the structural loss factor sensitivity. Based on this sensitivity information, the optimization routine is able to de- velop structures with optimized loss factors for the specified eigenmodes. The method is also able to generate damping solutions for existing designs containing badly damped resonant modes.","viscoelastic damping; topology optimization; multi-material optimization; level set method; loss factor; modal analysis; constrained layer damping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

Using these ideas, we compute a detection measure which is given as the weighted sum of individual dissimilarity measures and we present techniques that can speed up some standard change-point detection methods.

(mentor)","2015","A lot of research is being done in the field of Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) for use in telecom, datacom, optical sensing and visible light applications. Optical packaging of these PICs is still a challenge; increasing complexity leads to a higher number of interconnects and, combined with the need for sub-micrometer accuracy, this places a significant burden on the overall packaging costs. One proposed method of optical packaging of multichannel PICs focusses on the alignment of waveguides using an actuator integrated into the waveguide beam. The waveguide itself consists of a small silicon nitride core surrounded by a thick silicon oxide cladding (TriPleX). Typical dimensions for these waveguide beams are 16 ?m in thickness and width and 250 to 1000 ?m in length. By depositing of a layer of polysilicon on top of the waveguide beam, it is effectively turned into a bimorph actuator. Heating the polysilicon, and subsequently the TriPleX beam below, causes a deflection of the endpoint of the waveguide in vertical direction. This deflection can be varied to find the optimal alignment between waveguides. Due to the characteristics of the deposition process, mainly the high temperature, layered structures are subject to residual stress when cooled down to room temperature. This residual stress consists of a thermal part, caused by the difference in thermal expansion coefficient between the two layers, and an intrinsic part, which is related to, among others, impurities introduced during deposition and structural mismatch at the interface between layers.

(mentor)","2015","Around the world, more and more public transport operators opt for automated fare collection systems by means of smart cards. The data registered by such a system contain valuable information for transport planning. This research aims at increasing the usability of this data for the description of public transport travel demand. Travel demand is generally described by OD matrices, specified by purpose, mode and time-of-day. Accurate stop-based matrices by mode and time-of-day can be derived from the transactions registered by the smart card system. However, smart card data lack information of activity locations (Origins and Destinations), as access and egress legs are not available. Moreover, the travel purpose is unknown, limiting the interpretability of the data. In order to add this information, this research investigates the enrichment of smart card data with information from survey data. Travel survey data do contain all this information, which allows for the estimation of relations between the information to be added and available trip characteristics and land-use characteristics. The relations are presented by three specific (logit) enrichment models for (1) the origin zone allocation (2) the destination zone allocation and (3) the travel purpose inference. These models are projected onto smart card data for the construction of purpose-specific OD matrices. We developed two approaches, based on different representations of travel: a trip-based and a tour-based approach. The resulting OD matrices are compared with the observed matrix of the travel survey, at different levels of spatial resolution, in order to assess the accuracy increase at each level. The results indicate that access and egress legs have a substantial effect on the representation of travel demand in spatial resolutions commonly used in regional and urban transport models. The tour-based approach results in the most accurate construction of purpose-specific OD matrices. This report presents recommendations for model developers regarding further development of this method of data enrichment. Moreover, the report includes recommendations for transport planners and public transport operators regarding the applications of the results.","smart card data; travel survey data; data enrichment; public transport; OD matrix; travel purpose inference; travel demand modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Mulder, M. (mentor)","2015","Loss Of Control In-flight (LOC-I) is currently the largest cause of accidents for the world wide commercial jet transport fleet. To decrease the occurrence of this type of accident, procedures have been modified and pilot training has been increased. However, current training devices lack the appropriate flight models and motion capabilities to be fully representative of these accidents. With the SUPRA generic transport aircraft model and the Desdemona simulator it is possible to provide a representative flight model and to simulate the positive g-loads experienced during upsets and upset recoveries. To better understand the pilot response in these manoeuvres a descriptive pilot model was developed in this thesis. This provides insight into which indications are used by the pilot and how they are interpreted. Additionally the effect of three simulated motion conditions was explored; no motion, extended 'hexapod-like' motion and centrifuge motion. Ten civil transport pilots from several different airlines with varying levels of experience flew two types of stall scenarios in the Desdemona simulator. Both scenarios were repeated 12 times with variations in cockpit indications, control loading and motion condition. Based on the experiment data and pilot feedback a basic descriptive pilot model was developed. Using an iterative fitting process the pilot model response was matched to the experiment data. The resulting pilot model provides a reasonable fit for the average pilot response in the no motion condition. The variation between experiment runs can partially be reproduced by varying the pilot model control gains. No accurate representation could be determined for the effect of the speed tape and the pilot model does not fully reproduce the typical discrete control input behaviour. The experiment also showed a significant effect of the extended 'hexapod-like' motion condition on pilot control behaviour in the unloading phase of the stall recovery. A significant effect of the centrifuge motion condition was found in both the unloading and loading phase of the stall recovery. These effects could not be reproduced by classical negative motion feedback in the pilot model, but were best represented by a small decrease in the pilot model open loop control gain.","Desdemona; SUPRA; pilot model; upset; LOC-I","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-10-28","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Simulation","","","",""

An increased stiffness during the start will facilitate in immediate propulsion, while the circular shape increases the forward lean and maximizes the horizontal component of the leg force.

(mentor); Yoon, J.K. (mentor)","2015","In current behavioural approaches to Design for Sustainability, collectively labelled Design for Sustainable Behaviour (DfSB), the main focus is on “mitigating, controlling or blocking unsustainable or inappropriate behaviour by users” (Lilley, Lofthouse & Bhamra, 2005). The concept of sustainability appears limited to restraining the environmental impact of behaviours, often at the detriment of people’s subjective wellbeing. However, as positive environmental psychology and UN recent efforts testify, personal and environmental wellbeing are not only compatible, but even mutually supportive aspects of sustainability. A research has hence been conducted to explore how design can address environmental sustainability and subjective wellbeing as complementary aspects of sustainability. An analysis of current DfSB theory and practice has underlined numerous key differences between DfSB and Positive Design culture, highlighting the need to increase the positivity of Design for Sustainability. Positivity has been here defined as consisting of five components: possibilities, rather than problems, as design driver; centrality of people, rather than products/technologies; optimistic, rather than critical, view on users; focus on wellbeing and experiences, rather than behaviours only; affirmative support of people’s goals, rather than their obstruction. Moreover, the research has stressed the necessity of theoretical and practical supportive means for designers addressing sustainability. Through observations of sustainability-related design activities, a rich map of factors influencing the design approach has emerged. Key factors include: detachment from/overcoming of traditional DfSB thinking; confidence in Positive Design mind-set and methods; confidence in sharing unconventional ideas within the team; amicability and playfulness of the design environment; interest and empathy towards people’s positive experiences. Focusing on the last factor, a design method and a set of design tools and techniques have been conceived and developed to validate the effects of an experience-driven approach on the positivity of Design for Sustainability. The proposed methodology is built around three key points: positive experiences as focus of preliminary design explorations; empathic understanding of the components and mechanisms underlying the experiences; exploration of short- and long-term effects of experiences on both personal and environmental wellbeing.","sustainability; wellbeing; positive Design; design for sustainable behaviour; research through design; positive emotions; positive experiences; sustainable behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

There are two reasons for the development of this method. Firstly, a small acoustic signature is important for naval and research vessels, due to operational requirements concerning detection and interference with acoustic equipment. Furthermore, anthropogenic noise underwater is an issue that receives increasing attention from the international community. This is due to the increase of underwater ambient sound levels over the last decades and concerns about the impact on marine life. The method uses Statistical Energy Analysis to model the vibration levels on the hull, using a simplified representation of the vessel. These levels are converted into the source level of the vessel using the radiation efficiency. The method is validated with measurements. The simplification of the vessel is shown to perform well, compared to a complete model for the underwater acoustic signature. The output of the method shows resemblance to measurement values for frequencies of 200 Hz and up, but further validation is necessary to incorporate the method in the design process.","Underwater radiated sound; Prediction method; Steel surface vessels; Statistical Energy Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Ship Hydromechanics and Structures","",""

(mentor)","2015","Identifying unknown forces and system parameters belongs to the field of force and system identification. A specific area of this field is concerned with performing this identification based on physical models and measurable response data. The physical model which is used for this so called model-based identification has to resemble the structure on which the identification will be performed. In this thesis a model based and measurement driven identification approach is used to identify a hydrodynamic load, a system parameter and the response behavior of an offshore wind turbine mono-pile support structure. Having the opportunity to improve knowledge on uncertainties such as hydrodynamic loads or e.g. stiffness and damping properties, may allow to generate more accurate input for response calculations which in return can lead to a more cost efficient design. This work is based on the principle of adaptive filtering. Adaptive filtering is a concept used in state estimation which allows to augment the state vector by additional variables which are to be estimated. For problems in structural dynamics the state is typically defined by the set of displacements and velocities which are required to describe the response of the structure. However, augmenting the physical model and the state vector by a parameter to be estimated allows for the joint estimation of the states and a parameter. Extending this concept such that response governing forces are included in the ""augmented state vector"" and the ""augmented system"" allows to perform a joint estimation of response governing forces, parameters and the systems state. As a consequence of estimating a parameter in conjunction with forces and states, the system will inherently become nonlinear. Therefore the extended kalman filter, which is a well known non-linear state estimation technique, is selected as method in order to identify equivalent wave loads, parameters, and the systems state. In this thesis a realistic finite element model of a 6 megawatt offshore wind turbine in 40 meter water depth is used. based on this model artificial measurement data is generated using hydrodynamic loading associated with normal and extreme sea states. The finite element model is subsequently augmented, modally reduced, and coupled to the extended Kalman filter. In order to investigate the properties and the applicability to a practical problem three different types of estimation are performed: First the concept is applied to jointly estimate an equivalent hydrodynamic load and the states of a offshore wind turbine support structure using a limited number of response measurement data. For this case the model is assumed to be known perfectly. The results show that the select method is capable of identifying equivalent forces which resemble the exact forces up to a high degree. Secondly the method is used to perform a non-linear joint force-parameter-state estimation. This technique is used to perform a free decay test to identify one modal damping parameter in conjunction with the states and a equivalent force. Further the same technique is used for the normal sea state conditions to demonstrate the potential in estimating one equivalent wave load in conjunction with one global stiffness related parameter and the states of the system. The results show that the proposed method is capable of tracking both the hydrodynamic loading and a response governing parameter of the support structure. Third. The concept will be used in order to perform a joint parameter-state estimation which aims at identifying the modal damping properties under the assumption that parts of the system and the hydrodynamic load are known. The results for this case show that the method is capable of accurately identifying the selected parameter.","Force identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","MT - Ship and Offshore Structures","",""

The digitization of music has eased the way for users to gain access to large collections of music through the Internet. With all this music around us, it would be expected that music discovery is a settled field of research when in fact it is quite the contrary. Novel music discovery remains a challenging and a tedious task for users. Existing techniques such as content-based and collaborative filtering approaches recommend new music based on the past listening history of users. While there are obvious merits to such approaches, they also have some serious limitations with regards to music discovery. By focusing on the past, it becomes increasingly difficult for users to discover music that is different from what they have listened to in the past. Using accuracy as an evaluation metric, as the system become more `accurate' at giving you the same kind of music recommendations, serendipity and novelty often take a backseat. Cold-start is a well-known challenge that affects content-based and collaborative-filtering based music recommender systems. When a new user joins the system, because they have not yet rated or listened to anything yet, there is very little available information based on which any credible recommendations can be made. Lastly, traditional approaches to music recommender systems do not take into account the user's surroundings for music recommendations---thereby missing out on an opportunity to overcome the challenges put forth above. Our goal for this thesis is to design, implement and evaluate a learning-free novel music recommender system that allows users to easily discover new music based on their current surroundings.","Sensors; Context-Aware; Music; Recommender; Fuzzy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-01-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Signals & Systems","","52.0087830, 4.3481380"

Its population consists over one million inhabitants, making it the fifth largest city in Colombia. Due to its strategic location, the port of Cartagena has grown into the largest port of the Caribbean coast, making it very important for the Colombian economy. The city is famous for its colonial centre ’Centro Historico’, that is a UNESCO world heritage site since 1984. Together with Centro, the peninsula of Bocagrande, Castillogrande and El Laguito, attract a lot of tourists thanks to its wide stretching beaches. The areas are however prone to flooding. The focus of this project is to provide a well-structured analysis of the flood problems in the neighbourhoods Centro, Bocagrande, Castillogrande and El Laguito, because of their major importance to the touristic, economic and cultural values of Cartagena. From this analysis an integrated conceptual solution is performed to improve the drainage and coastal protection system to ensure the future development of the city in a political and social desirable way. In the current situation the studied areas suffer from frequent flooding. The coastal protection and drainage system are insufficient. The surface level gradient is too small and the outlet drains are constructed as holes through the coastal protection, allowing the seawater to intrude during high water levels at sea. Flooding already occurs at mild conditions, such as spring tide or a single heavy rainfall event. These floods cause a lot of damage to properties and the infrastructure. The salt water intrusion causes damage to cars and buildings. Also hinder to all kind of commercial activities due to significant congestion, or even inaccessibility, results in a huge loss of revenue. Prognosis is that the frequency and intensity of these problems will increase in the future, due to the expected sea level rise and land subsidence. In recent years, various studies have already been performed on these problems, but the municipality has never given priority to implement these proposals. The decision makers do not see the urgency of the problem. Since most political functions have a maximum term of four years, this hampers decision making with a long-term vision. Also there is only a very small budget available for disaster prevention, leading to a limited investment budget. Another issue is the large amount of public and private organizations that operate without good collaboration, causing a haziness of their responsibilities. A program of requirements was established after analysing the problem, to which the design levels were equipped. For feasibility of the design, it is necessary to obtain additional investors next to the municipality. Therefore an extensive stakeholder analysis was performed to indicate all potential public and private interested parties. The studied areas were divided in smaller areas and global solutions were developed on element level, where the coastal protection and drainage were distinguished. A multi criteria analysis (MCA) was performed on these global solutions to indicate the best elements for the final solution. In order to let the solution succeed, the stakeholders that have authority to start a project should sense the urgency of the problem. These stakeholders are the mayor of Cartagena, the Bolívar department and the Ministry of ADS. Since the water levels at sea are expected to increase considerably in the upcoming years, the future development of Cartagena is at stake. In order to let all parties collaborate to implement a solution, the final design is constructable within four years and will be performed in phases, where the most flood prone areas have gotten the highest priority. From the MCA, the best elements were combined to create a final solution. The final solution includes elements that bring additional value to the peninsula by constructing a marina and a promenade to attract private investors. The safety is guaranteed by upgrading the current coastal protection system and will be implemented by a strongly revised drainage system. The surface gradient will be increased by heightening two roads, the outlet drains will be equipped with check valves and a comprehensive pumping system will be installed.","Cartagena; flood; coastal protection","en","student report","TU Delft section Coastal Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","10.393304, -75.549085"

It enables a stable stance, ambulation, and an effective transfer of force through the lower limb. Although state-of-the-art humanoid robots feature highly advanced kinematics, the robotic foot has seen little research resulting in humanoids equipped with simple feet. Simple feet limit the capability of bipedal robots to deal with uneven terrain or to performpushoff. This thesis describes the design, fabrication, and evaluation of a robotic foot which aims to maximize the support polygon on uneven ground contours. The design of the foot is based on a study on human foot functions during gait. The designed foot contains two actuated toe joints which are coupled by a differential. The differential is able to distribute the force to the toes symmetrically even if the toes contact the ground at different heights. The foot is equipped with multiple sensors to measure orientation, pressure distribution, and to detect impact. Two experiments are designed to evaluate the foot. The first experiment evaluated the division of the force between the toes on uneven ground. Results showed that this force is divided evenly, with maximum deviations of 24%. The first experiment demonstrated that the toes coupled by the differential have the same properties as a single jointed front segment, but with the capability to adapt to ground contours. This could especially be useful during toe-off on uneven ground. The second experiment evaluated the stability of the foot on uneven ground. Each experiment was conducted twice, once with the toes able to move and once with the toes unable to move. When the toes were unable to move the foot was reduced to a rigid foot. Results showed that on average the peak-to-peak values of the pitch of the foot decreased by 51% compared to fixed toes. The average peak-to-peak values of the roll of the foot decreased by 54%. The result also showed that the left and right toe contacted the ground È 99.9% of the experiment time. With locked toes, on average, the left toe contacted the ground 68% of the experiment time, and the right toe 17% of the experiment time. The results from the second experiment demonstrated that the toes contribute to a larger support polygon and thereby improved stability properties.","robotic foot; differential; foot","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-12","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BioRobotic Design","","52.001015, 4.372054"

By combining the datasets a a land use classification can be done, relating a pixel with the actual situation on the ground. The collection of the ground data is labour intensive since enough data is needed in order to make a correct classification. This data collection could also be done by citizen science (volunteers that collect data for scientific research), which would allow to collect more data on a larger geographic and temporal scale (Cohn 2008). This paper looks at the possible factors that can cause error in the collection of ground truth data for land use. If one knows these factors it might be possible to minimise the error and have an idea on the accuracy of the data collected by citizens. With this in mind the different elements are described with the help of the available literature. This was followed by an experiment to study more in detail the relation between the error and the heterogeneity of the site, the training of the data collectors, and the specific land use class of the site. The experiment consisted of a photo experiment and a field experiment done with the help of Hanoi University of Natural Resources (HUNRE) in the Day River basin in Vietnam. This indicated that heterogeneity certainly made the classification more difficult. The difficulty of the classes was heavily influenced by the list with predefined classes given to the participants. To find the sites it might be easier to use smart phones with GPS applications to help the classification. It is recommended for certain experiments to be repeated in order to gain a deeper insight in these relations.","ground truth; citizen science; land use classification","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

To meet the CO2 reduction goal of 75% compared to 2005 levels, set out by the European Commission report 'Flightpath 2050', more assessment on future aircraft technologies and their potential in meeting these goals is needed. Analysis of these technologies requires increased amount of disciplines being involved in the conceptual design stage through the use of physics-based methods. With the amount of computational budget and knowledge needed by specialists during this stage increasing, methods for effective management is needed. Multidisciplinary collaborative design aims at reducing the analysis burden placed on engineers by distributing computational load among numerous involved parties. Collaboration comes with technical and non-technical issues. Work at DLR in the last few years has focused on tackling some of these issues with the development of the Remote Component Environment (RCE), an integration framework, and the Common Parametric Aircraft Configuration Scheme (CPACS). From projects, such as ""VAMP"", it has been shown that issues in effective communication between teams of experts with different specialists still exist in large collaborative design projects. Identifying common knowledge among the involved specialists, such as inter-disciplinary correlations, has shown to assist in this effective communication. In this project a visualisation tool has been developed in order to easily identify and present these correlations. This is accomplished through the use of Response Surface Modeling techniques in order to generate real-time functioning 2D and 3D plots from given data sets. The functionality of this tool is demonstrated throughout this report with the data obtained from analyses in this study. In order to assess the potential of advanced technologies a study is performed. Fuel consumption can be assumed to be directly linked to CO2 emissions, thus within this study analysis of fuel consumption is performed. Cost savings in future aircraft will also play a crucial role for airliners and passengers, and therefore is also analysed within this study. In order to perform this study an analysis workflow system was developed for the design of a mid-range conventional passenger aircraft from top-level requirements. This workflow was developed in the RCE collaborative integration environment and from joining tools from a physics-based toolkit developed at DLR. So-called adjustment modules were developed and integrated into this workflow in order to artificially adjust basic parameters at different stages of the analysis workflow, thus mimicking the effects of certain technologies. These technologies included retrofittable technologies, such as winglets, geared-turbofans, and lightweight cabin materials, as well as non-retrofittable technologies, including Natural Laminar Flow (NLF), Active Load Alleviation (ALA), and composite structures. Through these adjustments two analyses were performed. One in which the wing was fixed to the reference aircraft planform, and another in which the wing area was adjusted according to the reference wing loading and changes in MTOM from the artificial adjustments. From these analyses the potential fuel and cost savings of a number of case studies were performed. For a case in which technologies were retrofitted onto an A320-like aircraft, a potential fuel savings of 16-24% and cost savings of 4-6% was estimated. For a case in which a number of both non-retrofittable and retrofittable technologies were implemented at the start of development of the same aircraft, a potential fuel savings of 26-36% and cost savings of 9-13% was estimated.","Multidisciplinary collaborative design; technological assessment; artificial adjustment; conceptual aircraft design; workflow integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

Comments are challenging to analyze due to their short lengths and informal style, meaning that any individual comment provides very little data to work with and is highly variable. However, comments capture innate and an explicit opinion of a user that makes it invaluable towards personalization. In this work, we explore the possibilities of exploiting comments towards the end of personalized recommendations. Over the course of this work, we investigate the particular domain of news recommendation and report our findings through use of different recommenders evaluated offline. Our contributions include an evaluation strategy that allows for simulation of recommenders offline, a simplistic hybrid filtering technique that exploits the advantages of its root recommenders and various findings related to news recommendation in general. We perform a preliminary study into investigating whether users maybe attributed by comments they make and find that they are indeed attributable if the right features are considered. Utilizing the property of authorship attribution through comments, we achieve user-user similarity that ultimately aids in delivering recommendations. We find that freshness is an important aspect in news recommendation and therefore for the design of our recommender we build upon the freshness aspect while also achieving personalization by exploiting content, user-user similarity and the user neighbourhood.","recommendation systems; information retrieval; machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Multimedia Computing","",""

(mentor)","2015","Fuel efficiency is an important factor for the shipping industry both regarding new build vessels and existing vessels. A method to reduce the fuel consumption of existing vessels operating in off design conditions is to trim a vessel in the most optimum trim condition. The current approach to determine the most efficient trim condition is to perform propulsion tests under different trim conditions in a towing tank. To determine the usability of the CFD program PARNASSOS a trim variation study is performed on a vessel that is already tested in one of the tanks of MARIN. The trend of the propulsion from the tank tests is used to validate the trend of the resistance from the CFD calculations. Before validating the trend of the resistance with the trend of the propulsion it was checked whether or not the change of the resistance is dominant over the change in propulsive efficiency. It turned out that the change of the resistance is dominant over the change of the propulsive efficiency and therefore the trend of the propulsive power can be used to validate the trend of the resistance. The uncertainty of the CFD calculations is determined using a grid refinement study according to the method developed by Luis Eça and Martin Hoekstra [Eça andHoekstra, 2014]. According to this method the uncertainty of the performed calculations is estimated at 3.5%. The uncertainty of the tank tests is estimated at 0.9% according to Martijn van Rijsbergen [van Rijsbergen, 2014]. Unfortunately the uncertainty value obtained using the current method for estimating the uncertainty is not small enough to validate the trend of the resistance with the trend of the propulsion from the towing tank tests. The fact that the uncertainty determined is not small enough to validate the trend obtained from the CFD calculations doesn’t necessarily invalidate the assumption that the results of the CFD calculations are correct. It is expected that the uncertainty of the difference is smaller than the relative uncertainty, an expectation that is supported by the fact that the fits of the power series estimation for the resistance coefficients of the even keel condition and the 1.5m aft trim condition show the same trend and the two fits do not cross each other. There are at least two ways to further reduce the estimate of the uncertainty. The first one is to use finer grids. The second one is to further optimize the method to determine the uncertainty of these CFD calculations and reduce the influence of data scatter and non-similarity of the grids on the estimate of the uncertainty. The results of the CFD calculations are analyzed as if the data is validated. Trimming the vessel aft resulted in an increase of the total resistance. Trimming the vessel forward reduced the total resistance. The total resistance, the frictional resistance and the hydrodynamic pressure resistance increase when the vessel is trimmed aft while the hydrostatic pressure resistance reduces. These results show that the change in frictional resistance and the hydrodynamic pressure resistance are dominant over the change in hydrostatic pressure resistance. For moderate changes of trim the change in wetted surface is dominant over the change of shear stress regarding the change in frictional resistance. For extreme changes in trim the cause of the increase of the frictional resistance is a sheet vortex developing at the bow of the vessel and running aft along the bilge of the vessel. This sheet vortex influences the local thickness of the boundary layer and therefore influences the local shear stress. At the transom of the vessel the local hydrodynamic pressure resistance is reduced caused by the submergence of the transom. Trimming the vessel aft reduced the pressure recovery at the stern of the vessel, which has a negative influence on the local hydrodynamic pressure resistance. At the forward shoulder of the vessel the hydrodynamic pressure resistance increases as well when the vessel is trimmed aft. Trimming the vessel aft resulted in an increase of the hydrodynamic pressure resistance, which shows that the effect of the pressure recovery at the stern of the vessel and the increase of hydrodynamic pressure at the forward shoulder of the vessel are dominant over the effect of the presence of a dead water zone behind the transom of the vessel.","CFD; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Trim Variation; Hull Flow; Physical explanation; Validation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime & Transport Technology","","Ship Hydromechanics & Structures","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Technical University of Denmark (degree granting institution)","2015","In the past, the vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) lost the competition to its horizontal axis counterpart, having (wrongfully) presumed disadvantages like increased fatigue and low efficiency. Little research and development into the VAWT led to a large gap between the maturity of technology of both turbine types. Now that due to modern techniques the VAWT experiences renewed interest, topics like airfoil design are reinvestigated. One phenomenon particularly, plays an important role in VAWT aerodynamics: flow curvature. Due to the VAWT airfoil’s rotation about an offset centre, there exists a chordwise angle of attack variation. Also, the added rotational velocities will alter the pressure distribution and boundary layer of the airfoil, leading to a change in force distribution and turbine efficiency. This research sets out to chart these flow curvature effects and implement suggested models to cope with them. Furthermore, using a pitching airfoil model, an implementation in the airfoil analysis code XFOIL will provide the possibility to investigate inviscid and viscous flow curvature effects. What effect these have on airfoil design shall be found using an airfoil optimiser, generating optimal airfoils for various levels of flow curvature. This thesis has applied six models authors suggested to investigate flow curvature. By applying transformations to virtual airfoils, leading to added camber and incidence angle, the researchers thought to mimic rotating VAWT airfoils in straight flow. Comparison with each other and a solution of a verified panel method showed that their approximation is reasonable within bounds. When the pitch rate and location is kept to practical values, also the difference between the methods is very little. Therefore the methods can be used interchangeably. A pitching model has been devised, showing that the chord-to-radius ratio an be simulated by the pitch rate of a pitching airfoil. As the chord-to-radius ratio determines the amount of variation of angle of attack over the chord due to flow curvature, this model can be used to investigate flow curvature effects. The model has been applied in XFOIL and the results show a good comparison to the benchmark panel code. There still exists a discrepancy between the solutions, inherent to the difference calculation methods and dependent on the pitch location. The latter determines the arm to the surface and therefore the magnitude of rotational velocity, which increases the error with respect to the benchmark. Cambered airfoils and airfoils at a larger pitch setting showed less susceptibility to flow curvature. The modified version of XFOIL is used in an optimisation campaign to investigate the impact of increasing chord-to-radius ratio. The method proved to be slightly unstable and therefore little data is obtained. Of the dataset the following trends can be obtained, using the least-squares method. With increasing chord-to-radius ratio, the camber tends to become more negative and shift forward. This is the optimiser trying to maintain optimal power, by choosing airfoils which will stall later to avoid power loss. Also, this results in thinner profiles with their maximum thickness more aft. Finally, the optimal airfoils have been applied in a two-dimensional VAWT analysis model. This showed that there is very little power gain, and possible power loss when applying the pitch optimised airfoils.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Communication in CPS has tight constraints regarding reliability and latency, while traditional networking primitives can not guarantee these constraints. We base our thesis on the Chaos networking primitive which is a new paradigm that overcomes these limitations of traditional networking primitives. The current radio standard on which Chaos relies, is used more in science and industry, but less in everyday devices. We want to bring Chaos from the lab to the real world by porting the primitive to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This thesis presents Chaos BLE: an implementation of the Chaos communication primitive on Bluetooth Low Energy. We characterised the capture effect on BLE and achieved accurate time synchronisation among nodes (< 2.5?s), both of which are key for the operation of the Chaos primitive. We validated our design and implementation on a 25 node BLE testbed that we have build at Delft University of Technology. In order to improve the performance of Chaos BLE and to mitigate channel interference, we propose a multichannel approach. The Chaos Multichannel primitive enables the network to use multiple channels in parallel, such that smaller sub-networks arise. Chaos Multichannel outperforms the single channel primitive in terms of reliability and latency. It achieves reliabilities close to 100% while finding a consensus among the nodes up to 2 times faster, compared to the single channel approach.","Cyber-Physical Systems; Communication Primitives; Wireless Embedded Systems; Internet-of-Things","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-10-20","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software and Computer Technology","","Embedded Software","",""

(mentor); Sukirman, E. (mentor); Beekman, A.Q. (mentor)","2015","Project goal The healthcare sector is subject to change resulting in a more private character. Healthcare organizations are strategically reorganizing and rehousing their activities for them to have a stronger position while aiming to be more patient centered. For the development of buildings healthcare organizations turn to building consultancies for guidance throughout the process that can take up many years. For this project is aimed to envision the future user experience of healthcare in support of the fuzzy front end of the building design process. Aimed is for healthcare organizations to address their user needs to a better extend and for building consultancies to anticipate on this future experience in the development of a new design. Project focus The focus of this project is on how medical specialistic healthcare for chronic conditions is provided, this accounts for a great part of the use. The interaction between users and healthcare mainly takes place within the building environment. The interaction however may change in the digital future, and eventually ask for a different environment. Users with chronic conditions have a long term relation with healthcare. In general the use involves regular check ups, occasional treatments and continuous limitations and adaptations within daily life. The understanding of this use was later used to form a healthcare user journey in a future context. User research To obtain knowledge on the user needs for healthcare, research activities were conducted. Observations in the entrance area of various hospitals where made order to identify the user behavior within the context of use. Interviews where conducted with several users of healthcare supported by generative tools to obtain deeper knowledge on the current user experience and their needs. The user needs for healthcare were then determined to be; comfort, convenience, certainty, trust, autonomy, ambition and acceptance, which were shown to be interrelated. Developments The historical development of hospital healthcare is looked into in order to understand the evolvement developments in the industry over time. Learned is how driving forces within the context influenced the way healthcare was organized, provided and experienced. Trends and developments that will influence the healthcare system of the future is looked into. The trends and developments led to the creation of the projects future context. This future context is developed in which the possible future user-healthcare interaction will be placed. This enables to stakeholders how the healthcare system can use a user-centered approach in envisioning the future. Future context The government will withdrawal further, citizens will take up more responsibility. Due to the increasing demand of healthcare, both because of the increasing users with chronic conditions and the improved medical innovations, healthcare organizations will increasingly continue to seek for efficiency. While doing so they aim to address their users that are increasingly independent. Increasingly is People keep on searching sought for the purpose within our their lives. People will seek to life live more balanced. Digital systems are more in bedded within our lives, and we will will rely on them more and more. User needs Goals for the future vision on the user experience of healthcare are identified by placing the identified user needs within the future context that is sketched. For the future vision for the user experience is aimed for the healthcare to be provided in an efficient and effective manner while supportive of the user needs. Four scenarios are sketched to explore the possible ways healthcare may be provided in the future and how this then is experienced. These scenarios all explore an aspect of the future context. After evaluation the scenario of ‘Medical Monastery’ is selected, as it addresses the set goals the most, and. It is developed further into the future vision. Future vision The future user experience of healthcare is envisioned in the concept of the 'Medical Monastery', where medical specialistic healthcare is provided for chronic conditions. Multiple healthcare providers co-operate in order to provide holistic healthcare for the user. The fixed contact person, the ‘Medical Mentor’, aims to align the healthcare provided and aims to provide the user with the right support. Users seek for a balance within their lives, between ambition and acceptance. The 'Medical Monastery' is a place where users can learn how to improve their lives, both physically and mentally. The environment and to come at ease and reload before entering the modern society again. Evaluation The future vision on the user experience was evaluated with users and a medical specialist. Despite some personal preferences, depending on the situation of use, in general can be said that with the 'Medical Monastery' a more positive experience can be established. The clarity that is provided through information allows for a certain comfort and even freedom. The 'Medical Mentor' improves the co-operation of various healthcare providers and thereby more effective and efficient. For the users it provides a certain safety net when necessary. The ability to withdrawal after a consult is appreciated as users can get it together before being confronted with others. Emphasized is that the needs vary between the moments, the condition and the user and wherefore the Medical Mentor may not always be necessary. A limitation of the evaluation however is that the business perspective is not consulted. The evaluation self enabled users to give their own interpretation to certain aspects that where pointed out. The users actively thought about how a certain aspect could be valuable for their own experience. It inspired them to think in their desired future experience. Recommendations Various practical recommendations can be made towards the healthcare organizations in order to improve their user experience. For instance by improving the informations systems the amount of steps a user has to undertaken can be limited, reducing the users frustration. Up to date information on the appointment enables users to move more freely and thereby has consequences on the spaces that users can spend their time. Furthermore it is recommended to involve the medical staff as end-users within the redevelopment process. The medical staff is one of the influences on the user experience. When medical staff is satisfied with the environment, because it enables them to do their work well, eventually will effect the user experience. Last is recommended for healthcare organizations to create a vision including the user experience. The 'Medical Monastery' aims to inspire concerning the future user experience, for companies however it is important to have a vision of their own. Discussion This project and the vision that is created enables healthcare organization and building consultancies to be inspired by in the early phase of the building development process. It provides insight into how user needs can be fulfilled in the future to enhance the user experience. It also shows how certain trends and developments can influence the interactions and activities that take place, that in their turn influences the building environment. It enables inspiration for creating a future vision on their own with the user experience taken into account in aiming for a more integrated approach of the building development.","experience design; user centered design; future vision; healthcare; fuzzy front end","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Hoogreef, M. (mentor)","2015","The aircraft industry has seen many evolutionary changes in the past decades. Since the Boeing 707 however, the general shape and configuration of transport aircraft have remained similar and so has the aircraft design process. Since the aviation community is about to face a revolutionary breakthrough featuring new aircraft concepts like blended-wing body aircraft and Prandtl planes it is time to adapt the design process as well. The aircraft design process may have been extended by computational novelties and has been largely computerized, but the fundamental design process is still similar to what is used for conventional aircraft. This research investigates the effect of the design process on the design outcome and strives to find a method of automatically generating an aircraft design process given a set of computational modules, initial values and design goals. A software architecture based on a strict separation of components and process modelling approach is proposed. A framework based on this architecture is developed in which design parameters and computational modules are modelled as nodes in a graph. A subset of the conceptual aircraft design process is simplified and implemented. Twelve Algorithms are proposed to perform the automated ordering of the computational modules. The ordering is based on the module run time, estimated impact of the module on the design or the current state of the aircraft design, among others. The design process used in the Initiator aircraft design software is used as a benchmark. Two test cases are formulated, representing Class I and Class II design problems. Two additional Class II test cases are formulated to rule out the impact of the scheduling overhead by simulating the module runtime of fully-featured modules. Each test case is then solved by the proposed algorithms. The result is a system capable of generating a feasible (but sub-optimal) design process out of a set of stand-alone computational modules. This is achieved with no prior knowledge on the design process. From the test cases it can be concluded that the design outcome is not affected by the design process order that is employed, if the used set of modules is not changed. It is also concluded that the classical, fixed design process outperforms the design processes generated by any of the algorithms for Class I and Class II design problems by 20-40%. From the designed algorithms, the algorithm that orders modules based on the expected change of re-evaluating the module versus the expected run time of the module, performs best for the complex (Class II) design case. The impact of the scheduling overhead is shown to be negligible. Since the system is capable of generating feasible, but sub-optimal design processes, it is recommended that it be used as a tool to generate new design processes for unconventional aircraft configurations. Finally it is recommended that the process modelling based and separation of components based software structure that is presented is adopted for a next version of the Initiator.","aircraft design; process modelling; automated; software","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","AWEP","","FPP","",""

It potentially offers high dynamic strength and reliability at a lower cost thereby assisting the decrease in cost of wind energy. The design is based on a self-locking principle through vertical settlement of the joint. The objective is to investigate the settlement behaviour of the DSJ through an experimental set-up. Three experiments including multiple tests were conducted. Experimental results have been compared with results from a finite element model in Ansys. The self-locking behaviour of the DSJ under various loading configurations including irregular environmental loading is confirmed. The DSJ settles through downward slip motions in the direction of the loading. Settlement depth increases when horizontal/vertical loads exceed previous applied loads or when their direction is changed 180 degrees. As the TP vertically settles the joint becomes stronger and more slip resistant. Slip will reduce to zero for suficient settlement. The conducted experiments led to a better understanding of the settlement behaviour and provided a benchmark data for validation of finite element models of this process. First the reader is introduced into the subject, the project definition and the approach is presented. Next, an explanation of the experimental set-up is given. Afterwards it is described how the scale model was designed and fabricated. The loading strategy is explained for three experiments. Then, the measured parameters and the data acquisition system is presented. The methods used to process the data is discussed. The most interesting results are presented in combination with a discussion and interpretation. Conclusions are made and lastly recommendations for improvement of the set-up, further testing and general development of the DSJ are given.","connection design; transition piece; offshore wind; support structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-10-19","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore engineering and dredging","","European Wind Energy Master","",""

(mentor); Ubacht, J. (mentor); Van Den Hoven, J. (mentor); Reijkens, H. (mentor)","2015","The digital age we are currently living in, with its exciting innovations in the Information and Communication technology field, has opened up new business models, created new services and opportunities for companies and their consumers. One industry reflecting very well this digital transformation is the payment and banking industry: consumers nowadays have new payment instruments besides cash, ranging from debit and credit cards to mobile and online payment instruments. They also conduct their banking activities more and more from their own homes, in the online environment, as opposed to several years ago when everything needed to be done in the headquarters of the banks. This is an indicator that retail banks have started shaping their mindset and strategy towards an IT company’s approach, and to adapt to this new technological context. Nonetheless, high-tech companies, both incumbents and start-ups, have recently stepped in the payment industry and gained significant ground by offering their customers alternative payment methods with added value on the user experience and on additional services created on top of the payment service itself. There is a pressing need for innovation on the retail banks’ side in order to gain competitive advantage over these high-tech players and to survive the digital transformation. This is where the practical contribution of our research comes in: we give retail banks an approach on how they could improve their service offering by creating Value-Added Services on top of payment, and seamlessly integrate these with the existing digital payment instruments. For this purpose, a technical system which allows the implementation of such services was designed within our research. Not only did we design a system which satisfies the business stakeholders, like merchants, regulatory bodies, or equipment manufacturers, but we also payed explicit attention to the social values that the solution supports or hinders. This approach is taken firstly to insure that the end-users will adopt the new technology, but also to increase the social responsibility of engineers and system designers. Technologies are intrinsically value-laden which means that besides supporting some values and hindering others, they also introduce new values in the society. It is our responsibility to insure that these values will be the ones with a positive effect and not a harmful one. To reach this purpose we took a Value Sensitive Design approach, which is a research methodology that specifically accounts for human values before and during the design of a technical system. We combined this with the Design Science Research Methodology to offer a more sequential structure to our research, and with other concepts like Boundary Objects and Constructive Technology Assessment in order to overcome some of the methodological limitations of Value Sensitive Design. Taking this value-centric approach of designing technical systems, improving it on a methodological and conceptual level represents the scientific contribution of the current thesis. The research effort is structured in several sections: the first chapter, Introduction presents the practical and scientific problem along with the research design. In the second chapter, Domain Background, the contemporary digital payment methodologies and digital Value Added Services are presented, along with their relevance and current implementations in the Netherlands. Further on, in the third chapter, Stakeholder Map, the stakeholders’ role and interests are identified, after which their values are extracted. Trade-off and prioritization mechanisms are offered for selecting only the most relevant values to be introduced in the design of the new technical system.

(mentor)","2015","The joint venture between Boskalis and VolkerWessels is responsible for installing 70 jacket foundations for the Wikinger offshore wind farm. The critical phase in this installation procedure is lowering a jacket foundation template through the wave zone. This installation phase will induce large dynamic loads on the hoisting wire. Lowering through the wave zone is a difficult process due to the occurrence of a wave slamming forces on the template. This slam force is highly uncertain and rather difficult to estimate. The aim of this thesis to investigate the effect of the wave slamming force on the dynamic behavior of the template and the dynamic tension in the hoisting wire. The wave slamming force on the template and the dynamic tension in the hoisting wire was analyzed using the OrcaFlex software. In order to determine the wave slamming force a range of characteristic slam coefficients were used. The range of the slam coefficients were investigated for different wave periods. A total of 4 test were performed. The first test focused on the behavior of the wave slamming force. The second test was dedicated to the influence of the vessel motion. In the third test the effect of the buoyancy, inertia and drag forces was analyzed. Finally, the effect of irregular waves was evaluated. The performed tests showed a large influence of the wave slamming force on the dynamic tension of the hoisting wire. The influence decreased when the vessel motions and the other wave forces were taken into consideration. The influence of the slam coefficient decreased as well. In regular waves a scatter of 25 % was found in the prediction of the dynamic amplification factor (DAF) for all considered slam coefficients. When comparing the scatter with results obtained by the methods used in guidelines a possible maximum error of 18 % was found. Due to the extreme environmental conditions used in the performed tests this was considered to be within the project safety margins. It was concluded that the wave slamming force will not limit the operational condition in the Wikinger project. Furthermore it was concluded that specialized analyses like CFD will not significantly improve the prediction of the range of the wave slamming force.","wave zone; mud mat; slamming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-10-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore","","EWEM","",""

(mentor)","2015","Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is a system present which enables the car to autonomously maintain a certain speed, and based on the location and the speed of the predecessor, change the speed of the vehicle. This research is meant to determine the influence of ACC on the behavior of the driver, and on flows and safety on the road. Three databases are used: a literature review, a questionnaire, and a Field Operation Test. The questionnaire, containing 56 questions, was distributed among as many ACC users as possible. This was done mainly with help of the Dutch Motorists’ Organization ANWB. In total 200 valid responses were collected from users with Adaptive Cruise Control experience, and 25 responses from a reference group without ACC experience. The field test consisted of eight participants. Their driving behaviour was analysed during normal use of their leased ACC-equipped car on the highway. In total these eight drivers provided 48 hours of driving data. The recording was done by two cameras: one facing the road in front of the vehicle, and one facing the dashboard to record the ACC settings. Also a data logger was installed in the OBD-II port of the cars, recording speeds. The results of these three databases provided an overall analysis of the influence of ACC on the driver, on traffic flows and on safety. ACC leads to larger headways, but also to more constant speeds and headways, less lane changes and more car-following driving behaviour. This results in more homogeneous traffic. These characteristics enable ACC to prevent shockwaves and head-tail collisions. ACC leads to more relaxed driving and a relief of the driving task. Two third of the drivers indicates that this does not lead to a decrease of attention level, but another third does indicate they loose attention when driving with ACC. Half of this group uses this opportunity to perform more secondary activities. Preparation before using ACC is very important, since prepared users do encounter unexpected situations when using ACC less often. Also they use ACC more prudent: they do perform less secondary activities and stay alert. 22% of the respondents of the questionnaire did not receive any instructions at all. They learn to operate ACC by using it in practice. They show less insight in the risks of using ACC. This means this group might use ACC in an unsafe way. ACC systems which are active at all speeds are rated more positive compared to systems with a lower limit. Despite that, all systems, regardless of their range, are barely used on rural and urban roads. ACC is a system most fitted to be used on highways. Users tend to get used to ACC quite quickly and are willing to accept the working of ACC, despite it not always performing well. They seem to easily adapt to using ACC. This is hopeful for the further development of improved ACC systems and other ADAS-systems. ACC is less intelligent: it only looks to one predecessor. Therefore its driving style is sometimes too defensive (it brakes much too early) and sometimes too offensive (it breaks too late). Other safety risks are in the lack of preparation of some users, resulting in an invalid assessment of the risks of using ACC. Preparation before using ACC is important to guarantee safe usage, and a proper assessment of the risks by the user. Therefore instructing drivers beforehand increases safety. ACC has a positive influence on traffic stability, but the headways increase very much. By designing an ACC system which looks further ahead than only one car, the average headway can safely be decreased. The car will be able to anticipate on its predecessors and the surrounding traffic much better. Even better is Cooperative ACC, where communication exists between different cars, which leads to even more stable driving behavior.","Adaptive Cruise Control; Human Behavior; Advanced Driver Assistance Systems; Field Operational Test; Questionnaire","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-10-16","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Schlangen, H.E.J.G. (mentor); Houben, L.J.M. (mentor)","2015","An increasing number of activities are moved into Arctic regions. As oil and gas companies are exploring the options in these regions, structures are required which can withstand the severe environmental conditions. Existing structures are subjected to heavy mechanical loads due to moving ice sheets. For concrete structures in particular ice abrasion damage has been observed on the surfaces. In extreme cases, ice abrasion has caused deterioration of the entire concrete cover on offshore structures. Most research on concrete-ice abrasion is quite empirical. Little is known about the material science of concrete-ice abrasion. As the theoretical frameworks supporting the concrete-ice abrasion process are quite limited, it is very difficult to predict service life deterioration of concrete structures and to define measures against ice abrasion damage. A numerical model in which the onset of wear in the concrete-ice abrasion process is simulated, is defined in order to increase the understanding of the mechanics of the abrasion process and to define measures against ice abrasion damage. Onset of wear is de?ned as the crack initiation and propagation in the concrete material due to ice loading. Hertz contact theory which predicts excessive tensile stresses on the concrete surface due to sliding of ice asperities is used as an analytical basis for the numerical model. In order to define an appropriate numerical model for the simulation of cracking in concrete, several modelling approaches can be employed. The simulations are performed on meso-scale, which means that concrete is modelled as a three-phase material in which paste, aggregates and the interface transition zone are distinguished. This is one of the main reasons to use a lattice model for the concrete. Contact between concrete and ice is decoupled. Decoupling of the two materials is justified as long as the materials exhibit linear elastic behaviour in the contact area. On meso-scale, ice crystals fail in a brittle compressive way under the loading conditions employed in this report. This means that decoupling is justified. The loads exerted on the concrete surface by the ice crystal follow from Hertz theory and are applied externally on the concrete surface. Two numerical models are defined, namely a model with a smooth concrete surface and a model with a rough concrete surface. A rough surface profile is generated in a simplified manner by using roughness parameters found in experiments performed in the NTNU lab. Even though the rough model does not have a flat surface, the assumptions made in Hertz theory with respect to the loads in the contact area are still valid. Roughness parameters found in the experiments are quite large compared to the dimensions of the contact. Several numerical simulations are performed on the smooth model. The difference between normal and sliding contact is simulated on a homogenous concrete to make validation possible with analytical solutions proposed by Hertz. Sliding contact is applied on both a homogeneous and a heterogenous concrete to see whether this influences the results. The influence of the coefficient of friction on the onset of wear in the concrete surface is discussed by simulating sliding contact for increasing coefficients of friction. The influence of the concrete compressive strength on the initiation of damage is also simulated by using different concrete qualities. The influence of surface roughness on the onset of wear is simulated by applying sliding contact on various concrete surface profiles. Four different surface profiles have been generated and their response to the sliding ice loads is compared to the response of a smooth concrete surface. It can be concluded that a numerical model which simulates sliding contact between ice and concrete on meso-scale can be used to simulate the onset of wear during the concrete-ice abrasion process. Such model is able to capture both surface and subsurface cracking in the concrete. However, simulations show that (sliding) contact between concrete and ice is not purely a Hertzian thing. The locations at which the cracks initiate on the surface do not coincide with the location of maximum tensile stresses predicted by Hertz theory. This might be due to the loss of accuracy in decoupling the contact between concrete and ice. Nodal equivalent forces in the contact area deviate from the exact contact pressure. Also, the size of the contact area is not updated in each load step during the sequence of linear analyses. It is recommended that coupled contact is implemented in future research to increase accuracy of the results. Simulations have shown that high concrete compressive strength increase resistance against cracking due to sliding contact between ice and concrete. Also, reducing friction between these two materials and keeping the surface roughness to a minimum, increase the resistance against the onset of wear in the ice abrasion process.","concrete; ice; abrasion; micro-mechanics; numerical modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Yang, Y. (mentor)","2015","In some situations, concentrated vorticity which forms a vortical flow is involved in the inflow of a propeller. The impingement of the vortex on the propeller has several detrimental effects, e.g., foreign object damage during ground operation, impact on the propeller performance, unsteady loading on the blade, and tonal noise generation. The research presented in this report is conducted for the concern of the effects of the interaction between inflow vortex and propeller, in terms of vortex response to the propeller and vortex impact on the aerodynamic performance of the propeller. The impact of impinging vortex on the propeller is studied by experimental and numerical methods. The variation of the propeller performance caused by the impingement of vortex is dependent on the relatively rotational direction of the vortex and the propeller. For the counter-rotating case, the thrust and torque coefficients are increased by the vortex impingement; and vice versa for the co-rotating case. The variations of the thrust and torque coefficients are proportional to the vortex strength. And it becomes more significant as the radial impingement position moves inwards and the advance ratio increases. However, the impingement of vortex does not evidently affects the efficiency of the propeller. The response of vortex to the propeller is investigated by PIV measurement. The variation of vortex behaviors is dependent on the phase angle of the propeller blade. At the phase angles when the wake of the blade is away from the impinging vortex, the vortex core circulation is independent from the impact of propeller. Due to the contraction of the stream tube caused by the propeller suction, the vortex core radius observed in the measurement plane downstream the propeller is smaller than that in the flow field upstream, and the magnitude of vortex vorticity and the maximum tangential velocity becomes larger. At the phase angle when the vortex core coincides with the propeller blade wake vortices, characteristics of the impinging vortex are dependent on the sign of the vorticity of the impinging vortex and the blade wake. For the case that the impinging vortex and the blade wake have the opposite sign of vorticity, the impinging vortex and the blade wake break each other into fractions with smaller core radius and circulation; for the case with the same sign of vorticity, they merge together, forming a new pattern with higher magnitude of vorticity.","vortex; propeller; interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy, Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","The subject discussed in this thesis is the dosing of droplets in the femto (10-15) liter range. In this study, droplets were dispensed using a hollow cantilever atomic force microscope (AFM). Dispensing small volumes finds its applications in for example in single cell manipulation, where a drug is delivered inside a single cell to study the reaction of the cell to the drug. The working principle of an AFM can be compared with a vinyl player: a small needle is scanning a surface, which can be used for imaging with atomic resolution. For controlled dispensing of small droplets the needle and the cantilever were made hollow and a commercially available AFM system was adapted for fluidic applications. The hollow cantilever AFM chip is connected by tubing to a syringe which acts as fluidic reservoir. Small droplets of water will evaporate almost immediately; to increase the “lifetime” of the droplet a climate controller was added to increase the humidity. Therefore the influence of the climate controller on the AFM system was studied. With the described system droplets in the femto liter range were dispensed on a surface, however controlled dispensing remained a challenge. Therefore this research investigates the parameters influencing the droplet size and how these parameters can be controlled to dispense a desired volume. Two different ways of dispensing are experimentally investigated: just by touching the substrate and using the surface forces to pull liquid from the cantilever onto the substrate and by applying pressure to the liquid reservoir. For dispensing by surface forces, parameters such as surface energy and contact time are investigated to deliver a desired volume. A trend was observed that with increasing contact time an increase in volume is dispensed. For dispensing with additional pressure, a correlation was found between the time of applied pressure and dispensed volume. Dispensing of droplets of around 0.4 ? with a variation of 0.05 ? has been shown.","Hollow Cantilever AFM; dosing; femto liter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

The spatial domain is meshed into elements, each of which has its own angular mesh. The basis is formed by a discontinuous Galerkin method both in space and in angle. The resulting discretisation is fully arbitrarily refinable in space and angle. No assumptions are made with regards to the shape of the domain. This could form the basis for a deterministic charged particle transport code. A novel approach to spherical diffusion is presented in chapters 2 and 3. It is based on a spherical adaptation of the symmetric interior penalty method. It is developed both for regular discontinuous Galerkin methods and for cell-centred Galerkin finite element methods. Chapter 4 introduces spatial streaming. The weak form is derived. For spatial basis functions of order p, the numerical solution converges with order p+1 as the spatial mesh is refined. It converges to the exact value. That is, there is no approximation other than the Fokker-Planck limit.

The reason for writing this report is to investigate the safety and stability of the quay structure, which was built in 1990, throughout its service lifetime while the toe of the combined wall was deformed. The focal point is the behaviour of the quay structure, specifically the combined wall. The method based on finite element method, Plaxis 3D, which takes into account the 3-dimensional effects of the quay structure and considers the actual soil behaviour during calculation is a more sophisticated manner for modelling a quay structure. For this thesis a calibration model (which is the actual designed of the quay structure) and a series of models with different penetration depths of the combined wall are modelled in Plaxis 3D. A comparison is made between the calibration model and model 2B (which was the actual situation of the combined wall in reality). The calibration model which is modelled with or without surcharge turned out to be stable enough to withstand the design loads as did model 2B. After safety analysis (phi, c-reduction) of the soil parameters in both models the safety factor proved to be slightly smaller than 1.5 which indicates that the safety margin used in the previous design calculations were correct. It is advised to design quay structure with relieving platform structures with finite element method, Plaxis 3D. This provides a 3-dimensional view of how the foundation elements and relieving platform structure work and the stability of the quay structure can be modelled in detail. The finite element method, Plaxis 3D, is a better simulation program of the reality however this program is very time-consuming when accurately trying to model the quay structure in Plaxis 3D.","stability analysis; quay wall Amazonehaven; Plaxis 3D; safety analysis; phi/c-reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","","51.9477777, 4.06938888"

The reason for this thesis topic is because of clear regulations and demand according offshore decommissioning. Abandoned offshore structures require to be decommissioned after their lifespan. The low oil prices these days and the pressure on the decommissioning market gain opportunities for companies such as IHC IQIP to enter the market. As a result of a preliminary study, IHC IQIP might develop a new hydraulic shear cutter tool. In order to develop and design a shear cutting tool, preliminary investigations on the requirements have to be performed. The main interest were the required loads during the shear cutting action. An analysis by means of analytical and numerical model needs to determine the load cases during the cutting action. It is shown that a pipe subjected to opposite loads starts to deform plastically. Once the pipe is completely crushed between the loads, shear cutting takes place. This load will eventually be the design load. A numerical model is performed with advanced implicit non-linear models in NX Nastran. The analytical model is based on 2 phases. First a ring, composed of rigid shells and plastic hinges, is crushed by homogeneous blade shapes. Secondly the guillotine cutting load is determined by amusing the crushed pipe to be flat plate. Determine an equilibrium between the required force for penetration of the blades and the bearing capacity of the plate after penetration, results in the required cutting load. Finally both analytical and numerical, models are validated by an experimental setup. It is concluded that the numerical software used was not capable of shearing the deformed pipe. However the required load for crushing the pipe were satisfied according the experiments. The analytical model however underestimates the measured maximal load. Further studies are recommended for modelling non-homogenious blade shapes and improvements in the cutting model.","Guillotine; Shear Cutting; Decommissioning; Tubes; Pipe Crushing; Pipe Cutting; Offshore","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-14","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore Engineering","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Bogaert, H. (mentor)","2015","Stiffened panels at the water line of a ship experience in-plane loads due to ship bending and torsion, as well as out-of-plane loads due to wave impacts. Wave impacts weaken the panel with respect to in-plane loads, but are hard to predict because of complex physics. The in-plane strength of the panel supports the surrounding ship structure. Hence, it is important to know in what detail the wave impacts should be determined, while making minimum error in the in-plane ultimate strength. The importance of load details is evaluated as follows. First, the complex loading is applied to the structure and the ultimate strenght of the structure is evaluated. Then, details of the load are omitted, in this case by changing the resolution of the load. Finally the effect of omission of details becomes clear, by comparing the ultimate strength of different wave impact load resolutions. Non-linear finite element calculations are performed to assess the unloaded ultimate strength, as well as the ultimate strength for different load resolutions. The load is a breaking wave on a rigid wall. Applied resolutions range from 0.1 m to uniform pressure over the stiffened panel. It is found that the ultimate strength under static loading either over- or underpredicts the ultimate strength of the panel independent of resolution. Further, the ultimate strength under a dynamic uniform loading is also not representative. Different resolutions are, again, of minor influence. Tests with a different panel confirm the findings. It is therefore concluded that, for the load and structure under investigation: there is little effect of load resolution, as long as it grossly resembles the pressure map. Dynamic calculations should be performed at all times.","stiffened panel; wave impact; ultimate strength; load simplification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-10-14","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime and Transport Technology","","Ship and Offshore Structures","",""

(mentor)","2015","MARIN has developed the computer program WINDOS for the calculation of wind loads on vessels and various offshore structures. To account forwind shielding effects,semi-empirical relations based on Schlichting’stheory for free turbulent flow are used within the program.An extensive WINDOS investigation is carried out in comparison with the wind tunnel experiments that were carried out for the Offshore Operability JIP’s with an emphasis on the wind shielding effects during tandem offloading operations. Models of a shuttle tanker and an FPSO in 1/250 scale were used during the study. During the wind tunnel measurements the shuttle tanker was rotated over the full range of headings in ballast condition at 300 meters and 450 meters full scale downstream the FPSO in fully loaded condition with a heading of 30° relative to the undisturbed wind. Thewind load coefficients over the full range of shuttle tanker headings were calculated for both positions. The same situation is modelled within WINDOS and the shuttle tanker coefficients for both positions are gathered. There is a significant error between the wind tunnel and WINDOS results. The disturbed velocity distribution behind an asymmetrical object relative to the flow direction is asymmetrical. Schlichting’s relation in its original form only calculates the variation in longitudinal wake velocity for growing distances and is only able to calculate the disturbed velocity distribution at a certain distance behind a symmetrical objectcorrectly as the output is always a symmetrical wake velocity distribution. In the wind tunnel the velocities at a distance of 300 meters downstream the FPSO in ballast condition with a heading of 0° and 30° relative to the undisturbed wind were also measured. A transformed form of Schlichting’s relationfor free turbulent flow is presented that attempts to calculate the asymmetrical wake distribution behind a rotated object. From the investigation follows that the semi-empirical relation shows acceptable results for the FPSO with a heading of 0° (symmetrical in flow direction), but still gives, despite the transformation, unacceptable results for the FPSO with a heading of 30° (asymmetrical in flow direction). A prediction method is proposed based on Schlichting’s relation in its original form with fundamental assumptions and additions to account for asymmetry. Thelongitudinal force coefficients show a better agreement for both positions, especially when compared to the coefficients obtained with WINDOS. The transversal force and yaw moment coefficients still lack in accuracy but show potential when the relative distance is increased from 300 meters to 450 meters full scale. Overall the obtained results are closer to the measured values.","Shielding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-13","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime and Transport Technology","","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","",""

In the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), which features high non-linearity and complexity, the non-intrusive Stochastic Collocation method (SC) gains great popularity by the virtue of easy implementation and high convergence rate of its spectral basis. The main idea of SC is to constructs a surrogate response surface in the stochastic space by globally interpolating the sampling values obtained from the deterministic simulations. Therefore, like any other spectral method, it shows limitations in capturing local parametric steep gradient or discontinuity in the stochastic space. Besides, the convergence rate is deteriorated due to the Gibbs oscillations. These spurious oscillations, which amount to unphysical realizations, could result in falsely enlarged full confidence interval, e.g., the pressure distribution along the upper surface of a transonic airfoil. To provide more robust stochastic analysis, the Gibbs oscillations in the stochastic space need to be eliminated. To this end, the robustness concepts from the CFD community, Local Extremum Conserving (LEC), Monotonicity Preserving (MP) and Essentially Non-Oscillatory (ENO), are reformulated for the multi-dimensional stochastic space and incorporated into the Stochastic Collocation method. The proposed method is termed Stochastic Collocation with Essentially Non-Oscillatory (SC-ENO) robustness. Different from the traditional Stochastic Collocation method, the SC-ENO method first resolves the locations of the discontinuity in the stochastic space by enforcing the robust limiter to the surrogate response surface. Then the whole stochastic space is partitioned into disjoint smooth sub-domains bounded by the discontinuities. All the deterministic sampling points are classified into each smooth sub-domain. Finally, the model surrogate in each smooth element is constructed by interpolating the sampling points of the same class. The proposed discontinuity detection method is implemented for the $1$-dimensional space and extended to the multi-dimensional space by the so-called dimension-by-dimension approach. Hence, the deterministic multi-dimensional sampling points are structured and formed by the tensor product of $1$-dimensional nodes. As for the surrogate construction, the performance multivariate interpolation methods, \textit{i.e.}, Sauer-Xu Lagrange interpolation and the least interpolation, are compared in terms of the robustness and the accuracy. The least interpolation method is better than Sauer-Xu algorithm but it lacks robustness for certain distribution of the sampling points. To remedy this, a element-wise interpolation method matching the proposed discontinuity detection method is developed. One remarkable feature of the proposed SC-ENO method is being completely non-parametric. It is essentially a post-processing of the input sample realizations. When the deterministic sampling points are structured, it has been proved that SC-ENO is able to choose automatically either a piecewise or a global polynomial approximation based on the smoothness of the target solutions in each dimension of the stochastic space. Therefore, the robustness of the surrogate model is ensured while the efficiency of Stochastic Collocation method is maintained. The accuracy and convergence property of the proposed SC-ENO method is investigated for some numerical test functions with jump discontinuities. Although there is no obvious improvement of the convergence rate, especially for the statistical quantities, the issue of the Gibbs oscillations is solved. To see how SC-ENO performs for real problems with jump discontinuities or steep gradient in the stochastic space, it is applied to the shock tube problem with uncertainties in initial conditions and the transonic viscous flow over the RAE 2822 airfoil with uncertainties in inflow conditions. In both of these test cases, the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the SC-ENO method are illustrated. It is shown that there are no unphysical overshoots in the full confidence intervals of the interested quantities with sufficient deterministic sampling points. Meanwhile, the performance of another approach dealing with the stochastic discontinuities, Subcell Resolution (SR), is investigated for these two test cases. It is concluded that the SC-ENO method is more suitable for the viscous flow problems whereas the SR approach performs better for the inviscid case. Using the same set of the deterministic sampling values, the results of some interested quantities of smooth nature are presented, where the spectral convergence property is obtained. Since the SC-ENO method works on the tensor product sampling points, it is prone to the curse of dimensionality for high-dimensional stochastic spaces. To reduce the computational resources, the proposed approach is combined with the sparse grid approach of both isotropic type and dimension-adaptive type. However, the numerical experiments shows that the robustness property of the SC-ENO is lost for the sparse grid case. A more efficient and robust scheme suitable for high-dimensional space is a future research topic.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics","","","","52.370216, 4.895168"

(mentor)","2015","The incumbent (chemical) plant engineering industry is under pressure for two reasons. At first, the rising internationalization of the economy results in low-cost competitors putting pressure on prices and lead times of projects. Secondly, the decreasing oil prices result in major investment cuts in the oil & gas and chemical industry. As a result, fewer projects are initiated by clients and there is thus increased pressure on the few projects which are available to tender for by the plant engineers. These two pressures result in various challenges for the plant engineer such as; reducing costs, speeding up project development and the reduction of complexity. A potential solution to this problem is the modularization and standardization (M&S) of the plant projects. However, this 'M&S business model' in plant engineering has not really been the topic of research in the academic world. Furthermore, the industry has been experimenting with the M&S business model but did not publish their result due to M&S' strategic significance. Thus, it remains hard for plant engineers to predict or assess whether M&S has potential for them or whether they should stay with their current 'traditional' business model. The aim of this research is therefore to develop a framework that can help plant engineers to assess whether the M&S business model might be relevant for them or whether they should stay with their 'traditional' strategy. The main research problem has resulted in the following main research question: Under what conditions will the M&S business model, in relation to their ‘traditional’ business model, be of added value in the incumbent plant engineering industry? In order to answer the main research question an appropriate research approach was determined. The main data sources used are the Literature study and a Case study at Technip. The Literature study is subdivided into two parts the (first) and (second) Literature study. The (first) Literature study focuses more on the creation of a proper conceptual background while the (second) Literature study focuses more on the core of the problem statement. At first, the (first) Literature study is used to collect background information that helps to familiarize the readers with the term used is this research (Chapter 2). Secondly, with the (first) Literature study a relevant theory was found that can be used during analysis to give the readers a more comprehensive and conceptual understanding (Chapter 2). Thirdly, the (second) Literature study was used as general data source to obtain academic and practical literature that differentiates the 'traditional' and M&S business model (Chapter 3). Fourthly, the data from Chapter 3 is analyzed and the relevant information that differentiates the 'traditional' business model from the M&S business model is condensed in a 'list of conditions' (Chapter 4). Fifthly, the Case study will be introduced in Chapter 5, the Case study gives additional information that differentiates the 'traditional' and M&S business model. Sixthly, the data from the case study and expert interviews was analyzed and the information that differentiates the 'traditional' business model from the M&S business model is condensed in a second 'list of conditions' (Chapter 6). Seventhly, the information from the 'list of conditions' (Chapter 4 and 6) was used to create an assessment framework. The analysis from the (second) Literature study and Case study resulted in a 'list of conditions'. The 'list of conditions' will be a list of the factors/criteria that differentiate the 'traditional' and M&S business model. The 'list of conditions' is subdivided in conditions from a plant engineering perspective and conditions from a clients perspective. The conditions of relevance from a plant engineering perspective are; Modularity, Procurement discounts, 'Learning curve' effect, Parallel manufacturing, Using a fabrication yard, Owning a fabrication yard, Standardization, Design variation, Technological improvements, Market segment fit, Plant capacity, Module size and Company commitment. The conditions of relevance from a clients perspective are; Investment costs, Schedule, Energy efficiency and Risk. In the associated chapter it explained exactly why these conditions differentiate the 'traditional' and M&S business model. The conditions that are of relevance from a plant engineering perspective are used to create the assessment framework. The output of the assessment framework can help the plant engineers to decide whether to stay with the 'traditional' business model or to further investigate the M&S business model.","modular; modularity; plant engineering; chemical plant; standardization; M&S; EPC; standardization in plant engineering; assessment framework; customized vs. standard; customization plant engineering; standardization plant engineering; trade-off","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","","",""

Over the decennia which have past since its establishment, the company has been improving its New Product Development processes and they have constructed a very strong R&D department, driving product innovations. However, aware of the present importance of service offerings, they have started to integrate New Service Development into their existing processes. The company its R&D department has initiated a new function, which goal it is to drive service innovation projects, the Service Innovation Drivers. These SIDs have explicated to experience a certain level of inefficiency in their NSD projects. The goal of this thesis was to design a service innovation toolkit, to guide both them, as well as their project members through the NSD process, to increase efficiency in their NSD projects. A comparison between literature on services and NSD and a case study on NSD at the R&D department of Company X, resulted in six main subjects which could be improved to achieve more efficient NSD: (1) NSD knowledge and experience, (2) NSD process management, (3) shared understanding and knowledge sharing in NSD, (4) customer involvement in NSD, (5) organizational processes and (6) the company mindset. The first four subjects, which provided the most opportunities for this project, were molded into design criteria after which ideation commenced. Through multiple iterations a final concept developed, which was prototyped into detail. The concept is a mostly analog service innovation that consists out of multiple layers. The first layer is a new NSD framework, the second layer fixed goals per phase, the third layer a choice of actions, broader process steps, that can help in achieving the goals, the fourth layer a variety of specific methods for every action, and lastly specific templates which can be downloaded digitally. This concept aims to provide handles for NSD process, it aims to increase shared understanding, and it stimulates continuous discussion and reflection on the process and its different steps. The ultimate goal is to increase efficiency and perfomance in NSD projects at the R&D department of Company X.","service innovation; new service development; toolkit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","PIM","","Master Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Zandbergen, B.T.C. (mentor)","2015","Ionic liquid ions sources (ILIS) are under investigation for their application in micro-propulsion for small spacecraft as well as their potential bene?ts for mass spectrometry. Micro-fabricated ILIS based thrusters have been under investigation at the École Politechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Yale University in academia and Busek in industry for their potential to provide highly propellant ef?cient, low mass and small size propulsion systems for small satellites such as Cube-Sats. There is a need for more capable propulsion systems for such satellites in order to increase their capabilities such that more can be achieved with less expensive space crafts. However, electrochemical degradation of the ionic liquid propellant causes detrimental performance decreases. Although effective mitigation techniques have been proposed the assessment of their ef?cacy is hampered by a lack in suitable metrology that can detect and quantify any present electrochemical effects. A possible solution would be the detection of the decomposition products by means of mass spectrometry. Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry is a mass spectrometry methods that is used is ?elds such as biology, medicine and chemistry and physics. It is one of the main diagnostic tools in ILIS development. Commonly ion sources used in mass spectrometry operate under atmospheric conditions. Their emission has to pass through vacuum stages to reach the test area which is at high vacuum. In this process much of the emitted current is lost leaving a sensor current on the order of a few to a few tens of nano Ampéres. ILIS operate under vacuum and can have emission currents of tens to hundreds of nano Ampéres. There is thus a possibility of signi?cantly increasing the signal strength, and thereby resolution, of Time-of-?ight mass spectrometers. A master thesis project has been conducted at EPFL’s Microsystems for Space Technology Laboratory (EPFL-LMTS) investigating the possibility of effectively usingTime-of-?ight mass spectrometry to detect and quantify electrochemical reaction products in ILIS emission. To avoid the complication of the actual electrochemical effects and the associated performance decreases of the ion source the addition of decomposition products to the ionic liquid propellant has been modelled by preparing mixtures of different ionic liquids with ionic liquid additive at different concentrations. In this way it is possible to study the effect of changing concentrations of additive on the resulting relative quantities of particles in the mass spectra. Moreover ion transport effects that transport the additives along with the main ionic liquid propellant to the emission site can be investigated. For this purpose the ionic liquids 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMI?BF4), 1-ethyl- 3-methylimidazolium bis(tri?uoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMI ?Im) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium di- cyanamide (EMI?N(CN)2) have been mixed in the combinations EMI?Im & EMI?N(CN)2 and EMI?BF4 & EMI?N(CN)2 in the ratios 80%-20%, 50%-50% and 20%-80% by mass. The density, surface tension and conductivity of these mixtures have been measured to provide the necessary characteristics for analysis. Time-of-?ight mass spectra were measured of the emission of these liquids using EPFL-LMTS’s porous ILIS devicesatemissioncurrentsof2200V,2400Vand2600V. From the results it was observed that there is a clear response of the emission mass spectra to the con- centrations of the ionic liquid mixtures. The exact nature of this response and the possible in?uences of ion transport and association effects could not be established. Due to this unclear nature and due to the fact that electrochemical reactions are expected to produce decomposition products at a very slow rate time-of-?ight mass spectrometry can currently not be effectively applied to quantify electrochemical effects occurring in ILIS devices. Although detection is theoretically possible it is not achievable with the current setup in an useful manner and will likely not be achievable with any Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry setup optimised for ILIS based thruster diagnostics without decreasing its effectiveness as a diagnostic tool for thruster perfor- mance. In the context of general mass spectrometry it is concluded that EPFL-LMTS’s porous ILIS devices are of interest as they are able to emit combinations of ionic liquids with a relatively high emission current in vacuum. Currently knowledge of the composition of the liquid to be sprayed is required for identi?cation of the detected particles. For the identi?cation of unknown particles reference mass spectra would have to be established for known substances to facilitate identi?cation by comparison.","Electrospray; Ionic liquids; Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry; Binary mixtures; Propulsion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-05-01","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Vink, P. (mentor)","2015","What came before Each year hundreds of patients have to be returned to the Netherlands from all over the world. These medical transports are also referred to as repatriations. Due to the expensive and difficult circumstances of existing medical transport services, an innovative design was required that would enable a secure, flexible and more affordable alternative. It was up to Medness, a team compromising of six students including the author of this report, to design such a medical unit. Their final result is called the Guardian. The Guardian is an Intensive Care environment for repatriation purposes on long-haul flights. It consists of a small, modular cabin with three walls and a diagonal entrance. The dimensions of the cabin allow installation in airplanes such as an Airbus A330-300 and a Boeing 777-300. In order to carry the patient in- and outside more easily, a diagonal entrance was chosen. The interior consists of a medical stretcher, a variety of medical equipment and two seats for an intensivist and a nurse. The medical team is specially trained for these repatriations and continuously remains close to the patient, in order to enable a secure transport. The exterior of the Guardian The Joint Master Project ended with a conceptual design for the construction of the cabin walls and a business model. However, the impact of the Guardian on its surrounding environment was not yet fully considered. The goal of this project is to create optimal conditions for those directly and indirectly interacting with the cabin. Optimisation can be achieved by detailing all communication possibilities, the exterior appearance of the cabin and the overall protocol for those involved, henceforth referred to as users. This report recognises five different user groups:  Family members Key challenge: Even though they sit nearby the cabin, they are not informed on what to expect from the flight.  Regular passengers Key challenge: They are unfamiliar with this new medical unit and have no way to receive additional information.  Cabin crew Key challenge: Their assistance could be necessary during emergency situations inside the Guardian, yet they have not been briefed and do not know what to expect.  The medical team Key challenge: They have had no chance to prepare their repatriation properly. Therefore, they are not entirely aware of the Guardian's possibilities. Also, they receive no guidelines on how to interact and communicate with family members and cabin crew.  The patient Key challenge: Although in most cases heavily sedated and unconscious, he/she does not benefit from a medical team working under suboptimal conditions. Repatriation analysis By interviewing four intensivists, all experienced with repatriation, a complete overview was formed of the steps all of the users go through during a repatriation on board of an airplane. This user journey helped to form three different scenario's:  Scenario 1 | First impressions The moment where each different user group experiences the Guardian for the first time.  Scenario 2 | A quiet flight In most cases, repatriation involves an uneventful flight with no serious problems for the patient.  Scenario 3 | Emergency Despite the secure environment of the Guardian, emergencies concerning the patient are possible and the Guardian has to accommodate accordingly. The scenarios were necessary to compile an overview of remaining issues. These can be summarized in three main problems:  Main problem 1 Users are not properly informed on the purpose of the Guardian.  Main problem 2 Users experience problems with communication between different user groups.  Main problem 3 Current forms of repatriation revolve around the cabin and do not fully accommodate users' interactions. Instead of producing a universal design to fit all users, a holistic approach was taken by considering the relationship between a few separate designs and the Guardian concept as a whole. The designs should function on their own for each user they are meant for, but a combination of them is supposed to optimise Guardian repatriation in its entirety. Separate user studies with different participants, such as regular passengers, cabin crew or intensivists, were required in order to form four final designs.  Final design 1 | Information for Family / Passengers By providing family members and passengers with two brochures, they can be fully informed of what the Guardian entails and what they can expect.  Final design 2 | The Guardian Guide The guide is meant to support the medical team during three stages: before, during and after the flight. By providing an overview of all the on-board equipment and medications they can prepare the repatriation beforehand. It also informs them in what ways they can brief the cabin crew and how to keep the family informed during the flight. Lastly, the guide advices them to prepare the transfer of the patient in a pre-specified document.  Final design 3 | The Guardian Wearable During an emergency, situations might occur where the medical team requires assistance from a cabin assistant. The Guardian Wearable helps them to instantly contact someone without having to leave the cabin. A small, wireless device, worn by a cabin assistant, enables this form of contact.  Final design 4 | The cabin walls The walls enable passengers to immediately get some notion of the purpose of the cabin. On each side the Guardian logo is featured, along with the words: Secure Patient Transport. This only has to communicate the utmost basic essence of the cabin, since further information can be found in the Information for Passengers brochure.","repatriation; Guardian; patient; transport; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master specialisation Medisign","",""

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Van den Bos, J. (mentor)","2015","The Van der Meer formula for amour stability takes the Iribarren number, number of waves and damage level into account. It also contains a factor P which describes the “notional permeability” of the breakwater. This factor is based on the fact that a more permeable structure dissipates more energy and hence requires less heavy armouring. Its value depends on the different layer designs of the breakwater. The notional permeability (P) was empirically determined by van der Meer [1988] for three different standard situations, to be exact the P=0,1, P=0,5 and P= 0,6. It is difficult to find the exact value of this parameter. From a physical point of view the value of P should depend on the Forchheimer coefficients. These coefficients describe the permeability of the filter layers and core of the structure. Without these coefficients a breakwater cannot be accurately calculated in a numerical model. The intention of this research is to use the IH-2VOF model and to determine the pressures by the transition zone from the core of the breakwater with impermeable core and permeable layer. In the Großer Wellen Kanal (GWK) in Germany tests were done for a dike with impermeable core and permeable Elastocoast layer with a porosity of 0,388 and a stone diameter of 34mm. The maximum pressure which is measured in the GWK is 5,6 kPa. In this study the results of these GWK tests are compared with the mathematical model. This test is simulated in the IH2-VOF model with non impact regular waves with Hm = 0,18m, Tm = 5,93 sec and a water depth of 3,40 m. For this study 190 combinations of Forchheimer coefficients are run with the VOF model. The Forchheimer coefficient ? is varied between 200 and 2000 and the coefficient ? is varied between 1,0 and 1,9. Finally, twelve possible combinations of the coefficients gave an error less than one percent and two of these combinations gave the smallest error of 0,3 percent. This combinations are ? = 200 and ? = 1,7 and ? = 1700 and ? = 1,7. By the impact regular wave test with Hm = 0,98m and Tm = 2,99 with the same Forchheimer coefficient as above, the model gave an error of approximately 45% in the prediction of the pressures. In the next step of this research it is tried to improve the value of the Forchheimer coefficient by using a constant value ? = 1700 and ? = 1,7 and change the stone diameter and the porosity to find a better agreement with the maximum pressure. The porosity is varied between 0,25 and 0,55 and the stone diameter is varied between 8,5 mm to 136 mm. The results of the tests are close to each other. Only the tests with a porosity of 0,25 and stone diameter of 8,5 mm are not near to the real value of 10,77 kPa. The porosity and the stone diameter have an impact on the maximum pressure. However, after a certain value, the impact is noticeable. Hence it is possible to choose by a porosity of 0,388 a stone diameter between 0,017 m and 0,136 m and by a diameter of 0,034 m a porosity between 0,35 and 0,45. These values have not a big impact on the maximum pressure. The dike is also tested with Irregular waves with number of waves of 400 and the wave height Hm = 0,8 m. Different tests are run with the model for different Iribarren numbers which is varied between 1,0 to 5,0. It is visible that the Iribarren number and the maximum pressure are related to each other for both plunging and surging waves. In contrast to what has been mentioned above, the maximum pressure and the filter velocity for surging waves gave quite irregular results, whereas by plunging waves there is a regularity with the filter velocity and maximum pressure. The main conclusion of this research is that when using a VOF model to predict pressures inside a breakwater, it is essential to have a correct value of the Forchheimer coefficients. Simply using a standard value on the basis of the grain size only is not accurate enough.","Forchheimer coefficient; IH-2VOF; breakwater","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Herder, P.M. (mentor); Scholten, D.J. (mentor)","2015","Sustainability has gained considerable interest at all levels in society during the last decades. Climate change has been a large contributor to this mentality change. As current energy systems are inefficient and contribute to climate change, a transition towards more efficient energy systems is sought. The share of local produced energy in the total energy mix increases, for example through small scale solar installations at household level. Integrated Community Energy Systems (ICES) is a community energy concept that looks into the optimal integration of distributed energy sources and engage local communities, as a solution to the drawbacks of the current energy system. These drawbacks include: notable transmission losses, significant carbon emission, flexibility limitations and a primarily one-dimensional structural design. ICES deals with these drawbacks and allows energy exchange between community members. This multi-source multi-product energy network framework is a broad and flexible concept that involves all facets of energy within a community. Within this research, focus lies on household level energy demand and production, although ICES is able to cover a wider variety of energy forms and carriers. This research uses a bottom-up approach and analyses different demand profiles at household level and a selection of available energy generation technologies (with its typical production profiles). Thereby the flows of energy within ICES are studied and evaluated for different technology mixes, different community preferences and different community compositions. The goal of this research is to determine to what extent ICES can contribute to energy autonomy and at the same time, to the reduction of CO2 emission. Therefore a multi-objective optimisation of ICES is performed, in which the different available technologies, community preferences and community compositions are considered. The three optimisation preferences are: energy costs minimisation, CO2 emission reduction and energy autonomy maximisation. The main focus lies on the impact this optimisation has on households. A literature study and a stakeholder analysis are performed to identify the most suitable technologies to implement. A state-of-the-art ICES model is designed in MATLAB, to provide founded outcomes and to underpin the answers to the research questions. With this tool, the optimal technology mix is determined, based on different community specific parameters, valued on their technical, economic and environmental impact. Model input parameters include: demand profiles, weather data, and production profiles. The ICES model consists of two main parts. First a model on household level is designed, which is used to select the optimal technology mix for each type of household and for each optimisation preference. Different technologies are implemented to fulfil energy needs. Energy exchange with the electricity grid allows households to trade excess energy. The four types of households that are considered are: one adult household, two adult household, family household and pensioner household. Three performance indicators are mapped to quantify the performance of the technology mix at household level: energy price, CO2 emission and energy autonomy. The optimisation process at household level results in twelve optimal technology mixes. These twelve sub-results are used in the ICES model. Results of the household level model are stored and loaded in the ICES level model. With the ICES level model, the selected households with their optimal technology mix are combined to form an energy community. Stored household parameters are initialised (e.g. performance indicators, residual energy demand and excess energy profiles). An algorithm is developed, to distribute any excess energy among households that could not fulfil their own demand. Community ideology has a central role during the distribution of energy within ICES. Energy is imported from other community members at average levelised costs of energy production (LCOE). At each particular hour of the day, all households that import energy from ICES pay the same price per kWh for this energy. Households that export energy to ICES receive their full LCOE. Thereby they cover their investment costs, but are not stimulated to over-invest or over-produce. Energy is allocated to the demanding households in ratio to their demand. Energy exchanges within ICES is encouraged by this pricing mechanism. Energy that is being exported within ICES, is allocated to the exporting households in proportion of their total production in relation to the total ICES production. Exporting revenues and benefits from importing, thereby are equally distributed amongst contributing households. Energy that is not being used within ICES is exported to the grid at APX price. Demand that cannot be fulfilled within ICES is being supplied by the grid, at retail price. The outcome of the household level optimisation shows, for a purely financial optimisation preference (over a lifetime of 20 years), a 10% energy costs reduction is possible. This also results in a 25% CO2 reduction. With the use of ICES, energy costs and CO2 emission both reduce by another 10%. There are slight variations between results from different community compositions (less than 5% variation). The initial optimisation preference is of higher influence than the community composition. CO2 emission optimisation shows a larger CO2 emission reduction is possible, however energy costs increase quickly when opting for a large reduction of carbon emission. A 50% CO2 reduction is conceivable at ICES level, however this will increase the energy costs by 60%. In the case of CO2 reduction maximisation, almost all reduction is ascribed to the implemented technologies and ICES has little impact. This is also due to the fact that a low carbon intensive configuration exploits as much distributed generation as possible, implying a high energy autonomy at household level. Energy autonomy optimization is expensive and inefficient at household level. The technology mix that is able to supply peak demand, is largely over dimensioned during low demand hours. This is expensive, since investment is made for the full capacity. It is inefficient because technologies operate most of the time far below their optimal operating point. Also low annual energy production in comparison with the installed capacity causes high LCOE. Demand peaks will result in a technology mix that is able to supply the occasional occurring demand peaks, but essentially for the largest part of the time is over dimensioned. Without ICES, the export of excess energy is less profitable. Of all performance indicators, the largest contribution of ICES is observed in energy autonomy. Besides the different community compositions and technology mixes, a selection of additional scenarios is analysed. The different scenarios that are studied are electric vehicle (EV) penetration, stationary storage penetration, carbon pricing, scale effect and non-energy-producing household implementation. The electricity exchange price exponentially increases at high EV penetration level. A low EV penetration level has no negative effect, as long as there is sufficient available excess energy within ICES. The first EV owners and the last households without EV will benefit the most from ICES. The time mismatch between EV charging hours and renewable peak production asks for a solution, such as load shifting or temporary storage of renewable energy that is not used at time of production. The effect of stationary storage at household level, strongly relates with the effect ICES has on the performance indicators at household level. A high penetration ratio of stationary storage increases households’ individual performance, but this also means the contribution of ICES becomes less. When batteries are installed at all households, the total energy exchange within ICES reduces with 85%. Due to the (still) high capital costs of batteries, the total energy costs are lower when using ICES instead of batteries, while the overall performance is comparable. The financial effect of carbon pricing is relatively small, compared to the total annual energy costs and is calculated to be 150 on annual base at most. The effect of scale shows that an increased number of households slightly increases the carbon reduction and energy autonomy. Adding non-energy-producing households is possible without noticeably reducing performance indicators, up to a level of 20%. This research shows ICES has potential to reduce carbon emission (with maximum 50%), increase energy autonomy (up to 100%) and reduce energy costs (with maximum 20%). The multi-objective optimum is found at 20% CO2 emission reduction, 95% energy autonomy and 20% energy costs reduction. This shows ICES can be a promising solution in the trajectory towards a more efficient and low-carbon energy system. When the observed barriers are reduced and the right technology mix is used, ICES offers a valuable contribution to the reduction of CO2 emission at affordable costs. It offers perspective to an energy system that emphasizes on community engagement and equity for its community members.","Integrated Community Energy Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

However, due to rapid oxygen transport in yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), a common TBC material, premature oxidation is a major problem. This thesis investigates the feasibility of coating MoSi2 sacrificial particles with a protective Al2O3 shell to prevent this oxidation, while still retaining particle availability upon damage. Two different chemical methods, namely a sol-gel procedure and atomic layer deposition with residual chemical vapor deposition were successfully utilized to coat MoSi2 healing particles. The microcapsule composition and integrity has been investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that after calcining at 1200 °C for 1h in argon ?-Al2O3 shell can be formed and the shell remains intact. Subsequently the heat treated encapsulated particles were embedded in YSZ matrix followed by healing tests at 1100 and 1200 °C. The crack-healing tests proved that the shells produced by both methods remain intact at high temperatures, but also the coatings have a protective effect compared to uncoated MoSi2. Moreover, the embedded particles show a crack healing effect, indicating the feasibility of this self-healing concept.","self-healing; thermal barrier coating; high temperature oxidation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science & Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","Johnstone and Coleman (2012) were among the first to opt the idea of wind farms with mixed tower heights and predicted an increased power production due to the decrease of losses to TKE production from the mean kinetic energy balance. In the current study, the performance of infinite wind farms with alternating tower heights imposed by a neutrally stratified half-channel boundary layer is investigated. A LES approach is selected by using the existing LES code DALESURBAN. To model wind turbines, the non-uniform actuator disk model is selected and its implementation into DALESURBAN described. Three wind farm configurations are investigated and compared: a farm with only high turbines, a farm with tower heights alternating in row configuration and a farm with tower heights alternating in staggered configuration. When comparing the two alternating configurations, no significant difference in power production is found. For the farm with tower heights alternating in staggered configuration, the fluctuation of power production is found higher and the fatigue life expected shorter. When comparing the alternating configurations with the farm with only high turbines, an increased power production of 4% to 5% is found. However, the source for this increase is primarily the decrease of tower drag surface and not the result of decreased losses to TKE production as proposed by Johnstone and Coleman (2012). Furthermore, the fluctuation of the power production increases and the fatigue life of the high turbines is expected to decrease. As an undesirable side-effect, in the alternating configurations the fatigue life for the high turbines is found to be shorter than for the low turbines. Investigation of tower height alternation in the infinite wind farm gave results against its application. However, the effects of flow development along the wind farm are not taken into account. Therefore, it is recommended to perform future research on wind farms with tower height alternation within an inflow-outflow model description.","wind farm; wind turbine; tower height; mixed tower height; alternating tower height; DALESURBAN; LES; infinite wind farm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Fluid Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Van de Geer, S.G.

Thereupon an educational approach to the practice of shaping objects was developed, which integrates theory about creativity, design methodology, and the application of new technologies and design media in design practices. Digital design media such as CAD modelling are increasingly integrated into the design process, replacing many functions of the conventional, physical media. However, design practice experiences problems with the extensive use of CAD. Thus, it wandered: what does the continuing integration of digital design mean for the design process of the industrial designer of the future, who learns to design with the computer being his most vital tool? And thereupon: how should design education adapt to these changes, in order to enable an optimal learning experience? The research answers these questions over the course of three parts, using literature, design reasoning, and the outcomes of 11 interviews conducted with experts from the field. The first part of research focusses on the principles to learning design. The second part of research deals with the practice of creation while exploring how designers are able to define an object from scratch. The last part of research evaluates different design media by a number of properties, whereupon a vision is constructed on how these should be used in design practices. Based upon the research results, it is proven that the (early) extensive use of digital design media leaves its traces on the effectiveness of a designer’s design development process. Simultaneously, it is found that a student’s learning process of design is negatively influenced, when relying solely on digital design media. Thereupon the educational theoretical model is introduced, which relies on a principle of design development through iterative representation, facilitated by a process of alternating design activity and design media. Finally, the developed theories were discussed with 3 experts, whereupon an evaluation was done.","Design representation; Design education; Creativity; Digital design; CAD; Design tools; Learning design; Design development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Typical characteristics of this evoked activity are (1) an increase in firing rate of neurons, (2) a decrease in trial-by-trial variability and (3) an increase or decrease in spike count correlations. Considering the importance of variability and correlations within the rate coding paradigm, it is crucial to understand the origin of these modulations. Different networks in the brain are typically connected through divergent-convergent connections. In a recent work, the correlations in the convergent connections of the feed-forward input have been found to be able to reproduce the above characteristics. This thesis expands this work by also considering correlations in the divergent connections. Through large-scale network simulations, we can show that correlations in the divergent connections have a significant impact on the output correlation coefficient and a small impact on the output firing rate. Moreover, we investigate the question whether keeping the pairwise correlations constant and varying the higher-order correlation structure can influence the network dynamics. We find that this influence is very small suggesting that higher-order correlations in the divergence connections carry only a limited amount of information. These findings can significantly simplify the analysis of neural data.","computational neuroscience; higher order correlations; feedforward; neural networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-11-17","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","Computer Simulation for Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2015","Suction caissons are used in a variety of bottom founded and floating offshore applications, in shallow and deep waters. The present research focuses on the analysis of suction-assisted installation in sand. Suction pressure measurements from a number of field projects and laboratory centrifuge tests in sandy soils led to find that, in 70% of the studied cases, the critical suction pressure is underestimated by current design methods. The main goal of the present thesis is to improve the understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. More reliable assessment of the critical suction pressure will result in more cost-effective foundations. Five hypotheses were introduced as possible driving mechanisms of the attainment of critical suction: H1: Change in void ratio (?e) and permeability (?k) of the sand plug. H2: Soil arching caused by friction at the inner caisson wall. H3: Uplifted soil particles of the plug surface at the final phase of installation. H4: Soil internal stability (internal rearrangement of soil particles). H5: Transient versus steady-state flow pattern during installation in sand. A physical model was used to investigate the validity of hypotheses H1 through H4, namely the Laboratory Upward Flow Test (LUFT). LUFT is a normal ground gravity (1g) experiment based on ASTM standards for measuring the permeability of granular soils, using a constant head method. It constitutes a simplification of the suction caisson installation process. Twenty five LUFT experiments were performed. An experimental parametric study was carried out by varying: relative density (Dr), sample gradation (sand grain size, coefficients of uniformity (Cu) and curvature (Cc)), sample height over sample diameter or aspect ratio (?) and hydraulic head difference (?h). The term “experimental critical hydraulic gradient” was introduced in order to express the mean value of the hydraulic gradient along the sample when the critical condition occurs. It is proven that the assumption of steady-state conditions during suction-assisted caisson installation in sand (hypothesis H5) is valid, based on Finite Element (FE) analyses. The experimental approach of the hypotheses H1 though H4 is well based. It is concluded that the aspect ratio (?) and the coefficient of uniformity (Cu) influence the experimental critical hydraulic gradient. The hypotheses which are linked to those two parameters are H2 and H4. Hypotheses H1 and H3 do not affect the experimental critical hydraulic gradient, based on LUFT results. Experimental critical hydraulic gradient values 15% higher than the “theoretical critical hydraulic gradient” were observed for non-uniform samples with ? of 1.0 and 1.5 (most common in practice). This can be explained by presence of fine particles in between the coarser ones, increasing the soil structure stability that results in higher pressure differences. Higher experimental critical hydraulic gradient values are obtained with greater ? in dense samples. Interface (soil-wall) shear resistance increases with sample height and greater seepage forces can be applied before failure occurs. The observed failure mechanism for uniform samples is piping. Absence of finer particles facilitates pipe creation through the soil structure. Non-uniform samples with ? > 0.5 fail with sample separation, which is thought to be a shear failure mechanism. Voids between coarse particles are obstructed by finer ones and water cannot escape through. The internal soil resistance is higher than the shear resistance at the wall and shear failure occurs.","Suction; Caisson; Installation; Sand; Critical hydraulic gradient; Critical pressure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Offshore Engineering","","Master Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Yex, however, sees opportunity in creating added value for their customers. Yex want to help their customers sell the exotics fruits and vegetables in the store, with the focus mainly on supermarkets. For this reason, Yex created Discovered, a sub-brand targeted towards end consumers. The problem that the exotic product category faces is that most people do not know about these exotics. In this thesis, several qualitative as well as quantitative research have been conducted. The results reveal that there are three main reasons why most people do not buy the exotics in the supermarket. The first one being an overall low product knowledge people have concerning the exotics. They do not know what to do with it, how to prepare and what benefits there are. The second reason is price, exotics are overall more expensive than regular fruits and vegetables. Lastly, not all stores sell exotics, which makes availability also an issue. But aside from the three problems found, Discovered as a brand does not have a well-established brand equity in the current market. The brand is considered empty and without personality. Yex on the other hand has a lot of personality. The final outcome of this thesis is a two-fold design, the first one being a new brand element design for Discovered. The design uses the personalities of Yex and connects them with Discovered. This connection manifested as a character design called Yexxi. The second design is in the form of in-store touch points. Explorative touch point design has been created, which enhances the in-store experience. Both designs strengthen the brand story of Discovered, which is how the brand can gain brand equity in the near future.","exotics; brand elements; POP design; brand story; brand equity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor); Broekhans, B. (mentor); Wijdeven, B. (mentor); Mooij, M. (mentor); Yeh, P. (mentor); Jing, Y. (mentor)","2015","Ports have evolved into an essential part of a nation’s economy [Schipper et al., 2015]. In order to obtain economic growth and prevent loss of trade and competitive position, the worldwide growth in port development will not stop [PIANC 2014a]. At present the port development process typically results in environmental mitigation and/or harm. This translates into a need for integrated sustainable port master planning [PIANC, 2011]. The aim of this research is to develop a practical tool for sustainable port masterplanning in the form of a framework which can be employed by the port planner in order to systematically guide him/her towards a sustainable port. Developing this framework requires knowledge of the traditional planning process and its missing elements, a clear understanding of what exactly defines a sustainable port and how this port can be obtained through a sustainable process, and various existing knowledge about sustainability of ports through the means of existing sustainable philosophies and well-known global maritime organizations. Case studies can be used for the purpose of enhancing and testing the degree of applicability of the framework. To start with, the question should be asked: Why does traditional port planning result in environmental harm/mitigation, and hence does not result in a sustainable port? By analysing the traditional port process, it shows that its main objectives aim to integrate the economic, environmental, safety, technical and social aspects and consider enough flexibility to support the long term development. It therefore would be expected that the traditional approach would not result in environmental harm. However somewhere along the process, several elements are missing which limits the achievement of these main objectives. It turns out that in general the port authority selects the port location and an engineering company is responsible for the design process on that specific location [Schipper et al., 2015]. Here it can be found why the main objectives of the traditional approach are not obtained in the end: although the traditional process indeed considers all relevant disciplines, the party responsible for the location selection does not base its choice on the same disciplines and therefore disciplines such as the environment, will only be considered after the location is selected. If the traditional process does not have the most suitable location for sustainability as starting point, it perhaps inevitably will result in environmental harm from the start. Clearly a new sustainable framework is needed that includes the location choice in the design process, so all the disciplines can already be considered early during the location choice. Developing a sustainable framework requires a clear understanding of a sustainable port and a sustainable port masterplanning process towards this port. The issue encountered with the existing definitions, is that both definitions are intertwined and no clear distinction is made which characteristics belong to the sustainable process and the resulting sustainable port. A sustainable port has obtained and maintains a balance of the economy, environment and society now and in the future, where it also anticipates and considers the needs of future generations, besides their own benefit and the prosperity of the surrounding regions. Furthermore, the definition of a sustainable process can be characterized by the following process ambitions: the location choice as part of the design process, the consideration and search of the multiple perspectives balance of the interlinked economy, environment and society in an early stage, active and early stakeholder involvement, consideration of long term uncertainties and a continuous learning process. I propose a framework including all the characteristics of a sustainable port planning process which unlike the traditional process, already integrates the significant important location selection in the design process to develop a sustainable port: Integrated Sustainable Port Design (ISPD). The ISPD framework is focused on system level and is aiming to find sustainable opportunities while socio-economic values are created as well. This can be achieved by considering and integrating the physical, environmental, governmental and socio-economic disciplines in order to find the most suitable location for these opportunities. With the consideration of long term uncertainties and the help of stakeholder involvement, it provides a framework for the port planner to achieve and maintain a balance of the economy, environment and society now and in the future, resulting in a sustainable and future-proof port. The ISPD framework adopts relevant aspects from existing sustainable philosophies (such as Building with Nature) and fills in the missing aspects of the traditional framework. From start to finish, this framework follows seven basic steps: (1) Define the project needs and objectives, (2) Find physical suitable locations, (3) Understand the systems and select most suitable locations, (4) Develop alternative designs based on key values, (5)Test the alternatives, (6) Evaluate the qualities of each alternative and (7) Create the final design. Three real life case studies have been used for the enhancement of the ISPD framework: the Jebel Ali New Container Terminal (Dubai), the Badagry Port Project (Nigeria) and the New Doha Port (Qatar). Their port planning processes and resulting masterplans were analysed, to discover the extent of influence of the planning process on the sustainability of the masterplan. These cases dealt with critical challenges such as limited expansion area due to bad masterplanning of surrounding projects and coastal erosion. Besides the encountered limitations in practice, they also provided several good examples of sustainable planning measures. These learned lessons were used to enhance the framework for better implementation in practice. The degree of applicability of the ISPD framework was investigated through the application on the Badagry Port Project, which was selected as most suitable to serve this purpose. The illustrative case was designed to follow all seven basic steps of the framework and to discover which (dis)advantages will be encountered along the way. The most significant issue which was encountered is the general thought that sustainable measures require higher costs and bring along more risks than traditional measures. Therefore they require more research, and thus more time and money than traditional measures. These limitations however will always be present in real life and hence should be dealt with in this research as well. For example the important initial location choice, it is up to the port planner to decide if he/she wants to take the risk of possible resistance and limitations of the location on the port design and operation resulting from a rather incomplete initial research, or if the port planner decides to consider this uncertainty by investing more time and money in the research for the most suitable location. It is the responsibility of the port planner to make grounded decisions and the port planner, besides the environmental benefits, should convince the client of the socio-economic benefits of sustainable measures as well. Furthermore, other limitations of the case study were the limited data available of other locations and limitations set by RHDHV. In order to continue the ISPD despite these limitations, the location system of Badagry was analysed and the values, opportunities and challenges of Badagry were specified. The values were prioritized into key values and possible sustainable planning measures were developed. Systematically and focused alternative development based on these key values and planning measures, is a significant advantage of the ISPD framework because less optimization may be necessary in later stages. Three alternatives were developed and after testing and evaluating them, one final alternative masterplan layout is recommended. Since this research does not cover the more detailed design on construction and material level, the final step is not executed. In the evaluation, the resulting ISPD masterplan is compared with the existing Badagry Port Project masterplan based on predefined criteria which represent the main environmental issues currently resulting from port projects. Despite the limitations of the evaluation, such as the inability to discuss several criteria due to a lack of more detailed level design, subjectivity and exclusion of socio-economic aspects and a quantitative evaluation method, it turns out that the ISPD masterplan shows less negative and more positive impacts concerning these environmental criteria and hence this masterplan can be considered more sustainable than the existing masterplan resulting from a traditional process. A very rough cost analysis is also performed and it shows that based on only the large investments, the costs of the ISPD and existing masterplan are approximately from the same order of magnitude. Finally the application of the ISPD framework itself is evaluated: it shows that the extent of successful implementation of the ISPD framework in practice depends on mainly the port planner, the available capital and time for the project, the client, category of port, global and local context and the proof of feasibility and benefits of sustainable measures. The lessons learned from the evaluations are used to finalize the ISPD framework in the form of an ISPD user guide. Concluding this research, the Integrated Sustainable Port Design framework can be successfully implemented in practice and despite the presence of limitations, the framework results in a more sustainable port masterplan. Although there are many recommendations for further development, great potential is expected for the application of the ISPD framework in the future.","sustainable port masterplanning; integrated sustainable port design; location selection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Rivers, Ports & Waterways and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); De Gijt, J.G. (mentor); Bakker, K.J. (mentor); Braam, C.R. (mentor); Broos, E.J. (mentor)","2015","The persistent increase of container vessel dimensions requires ports to adapt their wet infrastructure in order to compete with their competitors. However, in some cases waterway tunnels are expected to restrict the maximum depth. The Beneluxtunnel in Rotterdam is an example of such a tunnel. To allow more depth, the possibility of lowering this tunnel is studied. The Beneluxtunnel consists of two immersed tunnels constructed in 1967 and 2002. They consist of prefabricated elements that are immersed and connected to land parts on either side of the waterway. To allow lowering, various design options have been proposed in this study:  Regarding the land part, the options are proposed (1) to do nothing, (2) to make local adjustments utilizing the space provided by the dewatering cellar or (3) to apply general lowering which would affect the entire structure.  Regarding the immersed part, the options are proposed (1) to adapt the river bottom, (2) to lower the elements while they remain immersed by utilizing the limited freedom of rotation in its joints or (3) to re-float the elements to be re-immersed on a lowered bed.  Regarding traffic requirements, an option is to lower the maximum speed which would allow for steeper slopes. These options and their combinations have been analysed to determine their feasibility and value. To do so, first all aspects regarding the functional design are determined. The relations between traffic requirements and navigation channel dimensions have been determined, resulting in an overview of possible vertical profiles for all relevant design combinations. Apart from a first estimate of the effectivity of the design options, it also showed that the 1st Beneluxtunnel is governing because of the shorter length of its immersed part. For the technical design, the design of the original tunnel is analysed and for some important aspects, the structural capacity has been determined. This information is used to determine the effects of lowering on the tunnel and to estimate the associated lowering capacity in terms of vertical displacement profiles. This analysis shows that for all realistic design options, the structural capacity is sufficient. Apart from the lowering, also the effects and limitations of joint rotations have been determined. Both for the segment joints and the immersion joints, the rubber water stops are critical in determining the maximum rotation. The applied rotations must however be less as additional settlement could increase them. The vertical profiles associated with these rotations show significant depth increase, ranging up to 4.5 m. ? To determine the technical feasibility, the design must also be constructible. Hence, for four of the design options, the construction methods have been determined and proposed:  To lower the immersed part while it remains immersed, the soil must be removed below the elements by special dredging equipment. Also the supporting tiles must be removed. The large longitudinal pressure is expected to allow this without supports. However, for the lowering process, applying pre-tensioning and temporary supports is required. Special components connected to the pre-tensioning should allow to control the lowering process. Finally, the soil can be returned and the tunnel can be finished.  To re-float the elements, the closure joint must be re-opened. Next, the weight of the elements must be reduced by removing the ballast. Instead of re-floating it is chosen to lift the elements which allows better control of the process. The elements can now be transported to a location where they can be stored and adapted. When the bed is lowered and the land parts are finished, the elements can be re-immersed.  To locally adjust the land part, access is required which requires for the connecting element to be removed and for a watertight screen to be placed. Next, the old transition point can be demolished and the new transition point can be constructed within the existing abutment, utilizing the space provided by the dewatering cellar.  General lowering can be achieved by wet reconstruction. First, additional anchors have to be inserted in the walls. Next the land part can be flooded and the entire abutment and underwater concrete floor must be demolished. A new floor should be constructed at a few meters below, but first additional anchors must be inserted into the soil to provide vertical stability. Finally, water could be pumped out and everything could be reconstructed. Finally, the construction sequences are used to estimate the costs of the design options and their combinations. The results were combined with the maximum navigation depth increase to determine the most cost effective solution for different lowering ranges. Also the long and short term traffic costs (traffic jams) have been taken into account. The results are: Depth increase Land part Immersed part Costs (millions) 0.0 - 0.9 m Local adjustments on both sides Remain immersed  295 0.9 - 1.9 m General lowering on one side Remain immersed  415 1.9 - 3.2 m General lowering on both sides Remain immersed  500 3.2 - 3.6 m General lowering on both sides Re-float  665 > 3.6 m New immersed tunnel  730 This study has proven that lowering the Beneluxtunnel is technically feasible and a cost effective method to increase the navigation draught.?","Immersed tunnel; Beneluxtunnel; Lowering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic structures","",""

(mentor); Hoogenboom, P.C.J. (mentor); Van der Meer, F. (mentor); Borgart, A. (mentor)","2015","This master thesis presents research into buckling of thin hyperboloid shells structures. This type of structure is typically applied as the large cooling towers at coal fired electricity plants. However, modelling cooling towers is not the objective of this research. The objective of this research is to understand the buckling behaviour of shells with negative Gaussian curvature, which cooling towers have. In previous research it was found that negatively curved shells are not very sensitive to imperfections and that the first buckling mode provides the most critical imperfection. This research starts from the assumption that a design formula can be derived for predicting the ultimate load of negatively curved shells. A step in this direction is understanding how hyperboloid shells buckle and determining what parameters influence the ultimate load. A finite element model was developed with suitable properties. The influence of the boundary conditions has been studied. The element size and the aspect ratio have been optimised. Various methods of adding imperfections have been considered. The buckling modes have been studied for a large range of curvatures. The influence of the imperfection amplitude on the load displacement curve has been determined by geometrical nonlinear analysis and the arc length method. A parameter study has been performed of a large range of geometries. Varied are the radii of curvature, the thickness, the height of the hyperboloid. Also varied are Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio. In total 700 geometrical nonlinear analysis have been performed. The results have been stored in a large data base in Matlab. This includes the support reactions, membrane forces, moments and stresses at each load step. A series of Matlab scripts were developed to generate various graphs. The graphs were used to form a detailed understanding of the buckling behaviour of negatively curved shells and to identify remarkable features. A two-phased curve fitting method has been used is to obtain a formula for the ultimate buckling load and a formula for the peak membrane force of inward buckles. The main conclusion is that hyperboloid shells of significant curvature carry load in three ways: the outward buckles, the inward buckles and the material in-between. First the outward buckles fail then the inward buckles fail and finally the material between the buckles fails. A design method is proposed based on the local linear elastic stress state.","shell; buckling; arc length; finite element analysis; geometric nonlinear buckling analysis; koiter; curve fitting; buckling load path","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Mechanics","","52.0017, 4.3725"

Communication to Mars will suffer from significant delays, potentially endangering a mission if assistance is needed immediately; therefore a high level of independence from ground control is necessary to be able to cope with non-nominal situations. An electronic partner (ePartner) can support human-robot teams by reasoning about the current situation and provide appropriate assistance. Different ePartner versions have previously been developed and tested, resulting in an extensive Requirements Baseline. In addition to these previous ePartner designs, the ePartner in this research will model the solution space in terms of functions (objectives), work processes and resources. This research will present a formal representation of the different abstraction levels to be able to reason about the mission status, make suggestions in non-nominal situations, and provide explanations. This should increase the users effectiveness, efficiency, trust and situational awareness. To evaluate this concept, an ePartner has been implemented as a mobile application on a tablet and user experiments have been conducted at the Delft University of Technology. The final conclusions of these experiments confirm an increase in effectiveness, efficiency and trust. Because of measurement limitations, the expected improvement on the situational awareness could not be proven.

(mentor); Duinkerken, M.B. (mentor); Lukosch, H.K. (mentor); Hoondert, P. (mentor)","2015","HEINEKEN Nederland Supply continuously strives to improve its logistical processes in order to be able to serve its customer better, but at the same time to reduce costs. Within the Zoeterwoude Brewery, the Customer Service & Logistics department is responsible for the supply of the materials to the packaging lines, but also for the loading process of the pallets arriving at the warehouse. Increasing output from the packaging lines have caused regular spill-back of finished goods towards packaging line 2, 4 and 7. This spill-back causes standstill of the filling machine and therefore a drop in the performance of the packaging lines. HEINEKEN Nederland Supply has a large number of open sales orders and is already producing in over-time. This means that every lost production hour leads to sales losses for the company and the potential loss of valuable customers. The objective is to improve the loading process such that the capacities and planning are better aligned with the supply of the packaging lines. This leads to the following research question: How can the loading process at the Zoeterwoude Brewery of Heineken Nederland Supply be improved such that the capacities within the process and the corresponding planning are better aligned with the supply of packaging line 2, 4 and 7? This research is framed within the DMAIC methodology (and performed by following on the Theory of Constraints). This research starts by analysing the current loading process and influencing factors. It is found that the amount of pallets that is being processed by CS&L is growing at a fast rate. Especially the loose-loaded pallets are leading to an increase in pallets. The share of these pallets grew in total from 6% in 2012 to 12% (even 43% for packaging lines 2, 4 and 7) in 2014 and is expected to grow even further. The process is found to be a complex socio-technological part of the brewery and is influenced by many factors, both controlled internally and externally. The next step in this research was to collect data related to this process and to obtain valuable information from different viewpoints. From the analyses the root-causes of the problem are found. From the bottleneck analysis it is found that the transfer car between the cross-docks and the loading stations is not able to handle certain product combinations entering the warehouse. The capacity of the loading operators is sufficient, although requiring two skilled operators. Unexpected disturbances lead to buffers (cross-docks) being occupied, after which the process is not able to restore itself because of a lack of over-capacity of the transfer car. From the remaining analysis it was found that the unexpected disturbances to the process are problems with the availability of containers, human errors, lack of communication, lack of skilled operators and the lack of warehouse capacity. The loading process can be improved by reducing the input to the cross-docks. This can be done by limiting the flow from line 41 and 42 by removing the pallets locally. Another solution is to introduce an alternative for the current transfer car that provides a capacity of 263 pallets per hour, such that full advantage of the downstream capacities can be taken in when clearing the cross-docks. Also by connecting the cross-docks with each other, the buffer capacity can be better utilised. The main disturbances can be reduced / eliminated by introducing strict rules and penalties regarding the delivery of containers. Also communication between the planning, packaging and CS&L department shall be more frequently with an end-to-end focus. Besides extra training and increased maintenance on critical machines, more responsibilities for the warehouse coordinator decreases the number of errors made by the operators. It is expected that 80% of the OPI losses can be eliminated by the implementation of a new transfer car and by better alignment of the downstream processes. This adds up to a yearly non-cash saving of  41.700 for the packaging lines under study. Based on the fact that currently customer orders are being denied due to capacity shortages, these savings may increase. For packaging line 7 only (up to July 2015), a total sales loss of  40.000 was encountered. The increased capacity reduces to time to clear the cross-docks (100% occupation of cross-dock 21, 22 and 7) from almost 7 hours to a little more than 2 hours.","cross-docking; Heineken; logistics; packaging lines; spill-back; cross-docks; production","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Larger and more extreme events in Asia and the Americas have shown the devastating effects that these low-frequency high-impact floods can have. This thesis contributes to the development of an Early Warning System (EWS) for marine coastal hazards. The relevance of an EWS is supported by the UN who have identified it as key in reducing casualties and economic losses due to flood events (UNISDR, 2002). For coastlines with sandy shores (beaches and dunes) the response of the coastline to high impact events is very large (e.g. dune and beach erosion). Current flood hazard models do not include these morphological processes and are therefore not sufficient for these types of coastlines. Process based models such as XBeach (Roelvink et al., 2009) are capable of modeling the coastal response but are not very useful as an EWS due to the long duration of the computations. A solution is found in utilizing a probabilistic model as a surrogate for a process based model. The probabilistic model is fed with data that is created with the process based model. This way the probabilistic model gains the same knowledge about the processes within the bounds that it is trained. More specifically a Bayesian Network (BN) is used as a surrogate for an XBeach model. As a case study site for the development and initial implementation the beach settlement of Faro, Praia de Faro, has been selected. Praia de Faro is pestered by yearly recurring overwash events and has experienced damages to houses and infrastructure due to severe erosion of the coastline. To be able to feed the BN with data a large storm dataset is needed. This dataset is created by using a local storm dataset to create bivariate distributions using copulas. These bivariate distributions are then used to sample a synthetic dataset that mimics the characteristics of the original dataset. The final BN is able to translate offshore storm boundary conditions to onshore hazard intensities. It can, however, only do this with relatively low complexity. For it to be useful in an operational EWS it will either need extra training data or increased complexity which implicitly also means more training data is needed.","Bayesian Networks; XBeach; Coastal hazard modeling; Copulas; Bivariate distributions; early warning system; Praia de Faro; Portugal; Probabilistic; Flood","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","37.004177, -7.990452"

(mentor)","2015","Cavitation is defined as the process of formation and disappearance of a vapor phase in a liquid when this liquid is subjected to reduced pressures, followed by an increase of pressure. One of the main challenges in the design and application of centrifugal pumps is the ability to control and limit the development of cavitation. It is generally unlikely that a pump will operate across its entire operating range without any cavitation. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used extensively to model cavitation in pump impellers. These models are almost always governed by empirical relations, which is no problem for cold water that has ample test data to be validated with, but makes the prediction of cavitation for hydrocarbons or amine solutions impossible. In the present work the cavitation development of water, butane and propane is described using a barotropic model assuming an isenthalpic expansion in the two-phase region. This barotropic relation should only be governed by the fluid properties, no empiricism should be involved. In order to validate the model, it is implemented in both 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional situations. In the 1-dimensional situation the Euler equations are solved for a single dimension in combination with source terms that model the varying area distribution of a Venturi-like nozzle. By forcing all three liquids through the nozzle at different velocities and pressures, insight is gained into the general qualitative performance of the model, both physical and numerical. In order to validate the model quantitatively with test data, the model is implemented into a 2-dimensional situation. A circular rod with a hemispherical head is pointed into the flow to obtain the pressure distribution over the head and part of the rod. This pressure distribution is then compared with data from experiments performed by Rouse \& McNown, in order to perform a simple quantitative validation of the model. Based on the work done in this thesis it is concluded that an isenthalpic barotropic model is a suitable approach to describe cavitation. Due to the independence from empirical relations, the development of cavitation for three different fluids can be modeled, based solely on fluid properties taken from a thermodynamic library. The general results from the 2D implementation are encouraging, but require more work to remedy the numerical instabilities and extremely slow convergence of the solution. The general recommendation for future work is to further develop and improve the numerics to make the solver more efficient and stable, thus viable for bigger simulations.","cavitation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Sustainable Process and Energy Technology","","Energy Technology","",""

(mentor)","2015","The biofuel consumption in Brazil is increasing rapidly. This leads to an expansion of sugarcane production, since this crop is the main source for the bio-based fuel. In order to assess the sustainability of this development, its resulting land use changes have to be investigated. Currently, the sugarcane expansion is tracked manually and on a yearly basis by INPE (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais) by means of visual inspection of Landsat images, which results in the Canasat maps product. Because this product only distinguishes between sugarcane and non-sugarcane, it is a binary classification product. It reaches a binary classification accuracy of around 98%, which means that 98% of the fields is assigned correctly to either the sugarcane or the non-sugarcane class. However, for an improved assessment of the sugarcane expansion sustainability, more information is needed. For example, it is beneficial to know the type of land use change, i.e. which land class changes into which land class, and to have more frequent classification updates. Furthermore, the Canasat maps approach is labor-intensive and is therefore a costly process. Therefore, there is need for an automatic land classification system that produces a division into multiple land classes. Previous studies on this topic did not provide the combination of features needed to improve the sugarcane expansion sustainability assessment in Brazil. Therefore, we developed an improved optical imagery-based automatic land use classification system and assessed its feasibility and potential by performing a case study on a small area around Monte Mor, São Paulo state, Brazil for a stack of 78 Landsat 5 images from the period 2003-2011. It is investigated whether the developed algorithm can reach a comparable performance as the manual method of Canasat maps while increasing the process efficiency and the information content. The algorithm ascribes the pixels the area is divided in according to the Landsat imagery to one of five land classes: sugarcane, pasture, forest, urban or water. This is performed by using a stepwise classification with Hypothesis Testing and Maximum Likelihood, 12 separate sugarcane growth stages, spectral time series by incorporating pixel values from up to three months back and conditional probabilities for class transitions. Our algorithm is innovative due to its recursive, multi-class and multi-temporal nature. The individual classification accuracies of the five classes, i.e. the percentage of pixels belonging to a certain land class that were classified as such, were assessed during the validation process. This yielded a classification accuracy of 92% for sugarcane, 67% for pasture, 93% for forest, 89% for urban and 92% for water, which led to an overall value of 87%. Next to that, by converting the obtained multi-class result to a binary one with a sugarcane and a non-sugarcane class, it was found that the algorithm has a binary sugarcane classification accuracy of 90%. Furthermore, analysis showed that the algorithm is capable of tracking land use changes in the study area and that its mapping features, e.g. the temporally dense multi-class land use division and the separation in 12 sugarcane growth states, will provide additional information for the sugarcane expansion sustainability analysis in Brazil with respect to the Canasat maps product. Because of the demonstrated potential and the available improvement options this research can function as a starting point for further studies on the topic of automatic land use classification.","land use classification; sugarcane; remote sensing; landsat; LUC; LULC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

This enabled us to focus on creating an intrinsically correct system instead of a fully featured one that needs a lot of patching and cleaning. The result was a well rounded, integrated IDE that has powerful Alan specific features, but may lack some more basic editor features. The IDE was not only developed to aid in model driven development, but was actually developed itself in a model driven way, using M-industries' platform. This allowed for a deep integration with Alan, where the language definition became part of the IDE. To do this, the concept of an ""editor state"" was introduced, which proved to be an essential an powerful concept for creating an editor for model driven development.","language design; MDD; Model Driven Development; M-industries; IDE","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

The company had the ambition to expand their business to the educational market and this assignment should aid this ambition. If Ask Roger is able to show an innovation/concept within the educational market to their potential customers, they believe will assist in convincing them of their company and differentiating their company from their competition. Since Skype for Business is a video based communication tool, a fitting target group was determined within the educational market, since that market is simply too broad and undefined. Video is a tool which can be used to communicate verbally and nonverbally. This is especially useful for target groups which have difficulty with verbal communication, leading to the choice to focus on deaf/hard of hearing students within secondary education. During researching the educational context and the hard of hearing target group it became clear cooperation between deaf/hard of hearing students and hearing students is difficult in class. Hearing students have trouble adjusting their behavior to benefit communication with the hard of hearing student, especially during group work. They initially change their behavior if the hard of hearing student requests it, but within five minutes their behavior falls back to what they are used to. Hard of hearing students experience a threshold for asking repeatedly for repetitions and the speaker to slow down, since they think they will be seen as an anchor for the group. It was discovered group work will be applied more as an educational method, an important development within secondary education. Legislature is being changed as well leading to more hard of hearing students following education on secondary schools with mainly hearing students. Thus the market shows a need for a tool which helps hard of hearing students cooperate better with hearing students. A design goal was set to create a more equal, inclusive, inviting and natural form of collaboration and communication between hard of hearing students and hearing students. It was envisioned by giving the hearing insight when behavioral changes could benefit the hard of hearing and by giving the hard of hearing a low threshold way of expressing appreciation to each other when someone has adjusted their behavior to their/another persons benefit. By giving the interaction qualities as compassion, attentiveness, sympathy, fun, camaraderie and insight, the interaction between the hard of hearing and hearing students via the product could improve. In the following ideation phase lots ideas were generated, with as a result three different concepts. These concepts were evaluated by hard of hearing students and the designer together with the supervisory team. After a concept was chosen, an interaction prototype was built to be able to test the envisioned interaction with a group of hard of hearing and hearing students. This led to the final concept. The proposed concept consists of three predefined messages: ""Good Job"", ""Could you repeat what you said?"" and ""Could you speak slower please?"". In the final design these are expressed via an app on a smart wearable/watch. The final design is an app which enables users to nonverbally send messages to and receive messages from other group members. Each smartwatch has a different colored band, these bands represent the person the message is sent to. The user tests with the prototype showed the hard hearing student experiencing a lower threshold to express themselves and as a result they felt more equal in being able to cooperate with hearing students. But the prototype test showed as well the interaction with the prototype was experienced as less natural, distracting and disturbing to the conversation. Therefore was chosen to develop a future vision for the final concept in the recommendations. These future versions use the same three messages as the final concept, but are designed to be less distracting and disturbing to the conversation.","communication; cooperation; group work; nonverbal; inclusive Design; hard of hearing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2015","Multi-limb robots have the potential to be dexterous in manipulation and be able to locomote in challenging terrain. In the future they should match or supersede the movement capabilities of humans and animals, thus becoming useful to support humans in their daily activities or perform those activities individually in environments which are dangerous to humans. Humans and animals carry out such tasks by means of skills such as pushing, pulling, twisting and grasping, and for the multi-limb robots to perform such tasks, they also need to possess such skills. This thesis addresses the pushing skill by developing a general controller for multi-limb robots. The controller tries to execute the pushing task in a way humans would do. This controller is novel because it considers the possibility of using surrounding objects as potential support for high force generation. The resulting optimization-based motion is surprisingly similar to how humans push large objects. The controller involves three major modules. The first module computes a Posture Tree, which takes geometric information about the environment and the robot, and generates a set of possible postures. These include the selected contacts in the robot and their respective location on the object. The second module is the Posture Optimization, which uses a cost function based on stability, friction at contact, joint and torque range to optimize each posture. The final module consists of an Operational Space Controller (OSC), which selects the least costing posture and executes it by dividing the complete posture into several tasks. Each task is operated within the null space of its higher level task. The force is generated by modifying the end targets of the end-effectors (pushing contacts) and the robot resists the destabilizing moment resulting from the reaction force, by moving the center of gravity in the direction opposite to an approximation of the ZMP movement. Initial verification involving first two modules was carried out with a humanoid robot of 29 Degree of Freedom (DOF) and its results are included in this report. For final verification, a more generic multi-limb robot of 8 end-effectors (Octobot 32 DOF) and a typical living environment were conceptualized, developed and evaluated. For validation of the complete controller a number of simulations were carried out in V-Rep. Simulation results depict the controller’s ability to identify the suitable posture for any multi-limb robot, given some pushing task in any given environment. The results collectively demonstrate the controller’s ability to handle heavy object manipulation, autonomous contact planning, adapting posture according to friction at the contacts and adapting posture according to the pushing force requirement. Unlike the present controllers, the complete control module developed here is more generic both in terms of the system (robot) and the environment in which the system operates.","pushing task; multi-limb robots; general controller; adapting posture; ZMP Compensation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-03-02","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); Govers, P.C.M. (mentor)","2015","People are increasingly tracking all kinds of aspects about themselves. For example: modern smartphones can recognise whether the user is walking, running or cycling, and estimates the amount of burned calories. The upcoming smartwatches will be able to measure the user’s heart rate. When the smartphone is placed underneath the pillow, it displays the next morning how long and deep you have slept. This is just a small range of the possibilities of the upcoming ‘Quantified Self’-trend, improving consumers’ health and self consciousness. At the same time people have an increasing interest in health, specifically nutrition and eating behaviour. Albert Heijn is an important influencer in many people’s lives regarding nutrition, and has adapted the role of helping this group in achieving a healthier lifestyle. This report’s project is focussed on supporting people in living healthier by applying the ‘Quantified Self’-trend. The developed concept in this report supports users in tracking the nutritional values of the food they consumed, getting insights from these collected data and finally maintaining a healthy nutrition pattern. The latter is done by suggesting recipes that fit the user’s needs. These needs are based on goals set by the user and may also incorporate other aspects of the user’s life, for example imported data from devices that measure physical activity and the user’s current bodyweight. Nowadays this ‘nutrition tracking’ is often done by registering manually what has been consumed, for example in a mobile application that connects to a large product database. This method is time consuming and requires much effort and therefore high engagement. The presented concept utilizes a smart kitchen scale. This is a kitchen scale that can connect to other devices via bluetooth with for example the user’s smartphone. When the user puts a product on the smart scale, the smartphone will ‘know’ how much weight there is on it, which leads to a broad range of opportunities. The combination of the smart kitchen scale and a smartphone can among others be used to prepare recipes. The smartphone shows instructions about the quantity of ingredients that are needed, while visualising the amount that is put on the scale. While doing so, it registers how much of each ingredient is used during the meal preparation. Because of Albert Heijn’s customer loyalty card, it is exactly known which products are used, as are the corresponding nutritional values. This information is used to calculate the nutritional values of the entire meal. If it is also known how much the user has eaten of this meal, the consumed nutritional values can be provided. With this being the basis of the concept, more functions can be added. When it is known how much someone has used of a particular product, it is also known how much is left of it. This results in a list showing products that are ‘in stock’. Except the fact that this list alone can already have much value for the user, even more functions are possible. When recipe suggestions are given to the user, these can be based on products that the user already has at home, to ensure they are consumed before the expiration date. Next to the fact that the user has to buy less products, it also supports the fight against food waste. Finally, also the concept of a ‘meal planner’ is introduced. By filling in when the user wants to eat with whom, recipes can be suggested that fit the needs of all these people. If the user’s ‘in stock’-list is kept up to date, it also has the ability to generate a shopping list. This list only shows the items that have to be bought for the preparation of the meal, and doesn’t contain the articles that the user still has in stock. The products on the shopping list are shown in the right quantity, so the right amount of food can be prepared that fits the needs and goals of all people joining the meal. The presented concept enables Albert Heijn to take a leading role in the field of nutrition tracking. In conjunction with other services that Albert Heijn is already offering, like the in-app shopping list, Allerhande’s recipe inspiration and the customer loyalty card, the concept of a smart kitchen scale is taken to the next level. The combination makes tracking what consumers eat much easier compared to existing solutions. On the one hand, people that are already doing nutrition tracking activities can be attracted to shop at Albert Heijn because of the ease at which it works. On the other hand, the concept is also valuable for other customers. By using the concept’s functions like help with meal preparation and keeping an ‘in stock’-list, people are unintentionally also tracking what they eat. For this group of people awareness can be created about their eating behaviour. In case this is not that healthy as these people may have thought, the possibilities to start living a healthier life are within reach with this concept.","Quantified Self; self-tracking; smart kitchen scale; Albert Heijn; Ahold; health","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Korevaar, G. (mentor); Geldermans, R.J. (mentor); Zhu, B. (mentor)","2015","Massive material flows that are mostly originating from the lithosphere are entering the cities, adding to and shaping the stock of the built environment. Due to concerns with material resource scarcity and the finiteness of virgin materials, resources will have to be measured and tracked. As a result of insufficient data on (average) civil infrastructure material usage and a lack of appropriate means for its determination, a four step methodology, termed Citymass, was created to fill this gap. By analysing the urban tissue, the quantity of different civil infrastructure typologies (buildings, water networks etc.) and their material composition and amounts can be assessed (with technical drawings, if necessary). Thereby, it enables the quantification and localisation of built environment stocks with a bottom-up model. The methodology was applied for a first validation or more so an illustration of its application to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) stock as a building material in Merkelbach, an Amsterdam neighbourhood of 0.013 km². It showed that the assessable stock consisted of underground water pipes and data cable protection pipes and totalled in 3,618 kg PVC, or 0.28 kg/m². In order to address the resource scarcity issue, it was further examined if the PVC outflows could be predicted, applied in the three circular economy loops and eventually connected with the inflows in the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area (AMA). It was concluded that PVC outflows can be predicted with a calculation method based on the (material) lifetime of the object or with an estimation from the share of PVC of C&D waste. Based on best practices and the principles of the circular economy (CE) it was found that even though the material can be reused and recycled within the AMA, PVC products in their current state do not have a place in the circular economy. By analysing the stock and predicting the outflows, the material flow analysis (MFA) is complemented and provided with a smart way of data generation. This method is facilitated over time as more case studies and validations aid in building up a database for average material usages per typologies. Moreover, it creates a bridge between MFA and CE where the latter provides a sense of purpose and direction to the analysis, which in turn generates transformational knowledge for a transition to a restorative future. The Master’s programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology.","material flow analysis; urban tissue; material stock; closing loops; resource recovery; circular economy; PVC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","","","","","52.381187, 4.857432"
