With the evolution of technology, speech has become one of the primary means of communication. Speech recognition is a form of multimedia content analysis, where the information carried in a speech signal is transcribed into a character string. Any information in the real world is perceived via several input channels. Each modality conveys some additional information about a real world concept. Likewise, the perception of speech in a human brain is bimodal in nature. We combine information from both visual and audio modalities to disambiguate speech. The system studied in here is a multimodal speech recognition system, where the features are generated by correlating visual and speech modalities using a multimodal Deep Belief Network. This thesis reproduces this system, and explores several aspects of its performance related to real-life conditions under which speech must be recognized. Since the limitations of multimodal deep learning approaches are not well comprehended, we would like to gain insights into the resemblance of such systems to humans in their ability to level multimodality. The experiments carried out by our study demonstrate that the visual modality complements speech modality, providing information such as place of articulation. Further studies are performed on the system to shed light on the limits of such a multimodal Deep Neural Network for Audio-Visual speech recognition. In real-life, Audio-Visual speech recognition systems will come across several perturbations such as reverberation and visual occlusion. The behavior of this system is analysed in a simulated environment replicating such real-life surroundings. Further, a study is performed to see the effect of the visual modality on recognition of phonemes, which are basic building blocks of speech. The study conducted in this thesis supports the conclusion that the multimodal Deep Neural Network is far from achieving human-like performance in the presence of perturbations. This demonstrates the necessity to conduct more research on the robustness of the multimodal Deep Neural Networks in real-life scenarios.","Speech recognition; Multimodality; Deep neural networks; Reverberation; Occlusion; Phonemes and Visemes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Barges with cargo, vessels and various offshore structures are towed from and to location. Boskalis participates in this industry through its subsidiaries Smit and Fairmount Marine. From experience with these transports, it was found that the preliminary calculations do not match with the experiences offshore and that the impact of wave drift on these calculations is most promising for further research. To investigate this impact, the problem is split into three parts: wave drift estimation for a stationary vessel, wave drift estimation for a sailing vessel and the analysis of the towing stability.From the literature, eleven methods are identified for the wave drift estimation of a stationary vessel. These are compared for the surge, sway and yaw force components. The different methods are computed using the diffraction program Delfrac, the strip theory solver ShipMo and own implementations in Matlab. With vessel velocities included, ten wave drift estimation methods for the sailing vessel are compared. Specific attention is paid to the wave drift damping, which relates the stationary wave drift to vessel velocities. It is implemented using Aranha's formulations and the panel pressure output of Delfrac. The most applicable methods with respect to the sailing tow resistance are the far field and near field methods in combination with the wave drift damping. With respect to the total tow resistance, the wave drift contribution is found to make up roughly 25% of the total resistance, irrespective of forward velocity. The dynamic behaviour of the tow operation is examined for two barges: one course stable and one course unstable barge. Their towing stability properties are assessed without waves present and for head waves conditions. It is found that the head waves do not affect the stability of the course stable barge assuming the towing tug has sufficient available towing force. For the course unstable barge, the main stabilising effect is identified as the extra resistance due to the head waves and not the direct wave drift moment. The relative contribution of the waves with respect to the wind and current shows that the head waves have a significant stabilising contribution to the towing stability although the specific relative contributions are highly dependent on the environmental conditions. Head waves either reduce the path width of the fishtailing motion or dampen these oscillations into a stable towing position. This was verified by simulations in the time domain. Irregular waves also promote the stability: they stabilise the unstable barge in the entire range of physically relevant wave periods, irrespective of towline length.Overall, the contribution of the wave drift to the tow resistance is significant, especially while sailing. Head waves are beneficial for the towing stability of a course unstable barge, both in regular and irregular sea states. This increased insight reduces the uncertainty in the tow resistance prediction and contributes to the understanding of the towing stability properties of unstable barges.","Wave Drift; Wave Drift Forces; Tow Resistance; Towing Stability; Course stable; Course unstable; Barges; Wave drift estimation; Delfrac; ShipMo; MATLAB","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Rossen, W.R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","One proposed method to delay the onset of gravity segregation between water and gas in enhanced oil and gas projects and extend the period of effective macroscopic sweep in “SWAG” is by separating the injection wells into two parallel horizontal wells (Stone, 2004). In this “modified SWAG”, the water injection well is aligned at a distance above the gas injection well, and both water and gas are pumped simultaneously to displace the reservoir fluids. The significant density difference between the fluids and the ensuing counter-direction flow impede the segregation process.<br/> <br/>Initially Rossen et al. (2007) investigated the effectiveness of the technique based on 2D modelling and found that it increased the fluid segregation length. Van der Bol (2007) and Jamshidnezhad et al. (2010) broadened the scope of study and observed a non-uniform gas injection profile and volumetric sweep in 3D. Injection instability occurred in most of the simulation cases, despite the assumption of an ideally homogenous reservoir in the model. Mahalle (2013) identified several factors that triggers instability such as gas saturation and relative permeability behaviors in adjacent grid blocks. Since the instability was found to originate in the near-wellbore region, local grid refinement was applied along the entire length of the horizontal well, with more uniform gas-injection profile observed. Using a different reservoir simulator, Ranjan (2015) extended the previous study by checking again the effect of local grid refinement. The result, however, contradicts with the preceding finding. Grid refinement near the injection well did not improve stability in Ranjan’s study. The author also checked the effect of gas injection rate on the non-uniformity. Again, contradictory results were observed. While Ranjan reported that doubling the gas injection rate promotes non-uniform behavior, the earlier study obtained the opposite outcome.<br/><br/>This thesis extends the previous studies by examining other parameters that may influence non-uniformity. We developed a method to quantify non-uniformity by calculating the coefficient of variation and max-min ratios for gas injection rate along the well. We looked at the effect of changes in well placement, reservoir properties, reservoir boundaries, reservoir fluids and operating constraints. We also fundamentally modified how the perturbation is applied along the gas-injection well by altering the skin factor while maintaining constant permeability. Results show that the type of perturbation significantly effects the non-uniformity of gas injection. We believe that perturbing permeability promotes the uniformity of gas-injection rate because of flow to neighboring grid blocks, and thereby more simulations are seen to be uniform compared the results with perturbation in skin factor. The results from this study suggests that non-uniformity is associated to the feedback between gas injection rate, water saturation and gas relative permeability, which is shown by the gas injection rate to vary more than proportionally to permeability or skin, even in relatively uniform cases. The effect of adjacent grid blocks also plays a crucial role, as we can see from the different results between the two types of perturbations. Finally, the mobility ratio of the fluids strongly influences the occurrence of the instability.<br","reservoir simulation; sweep efficiency; non-uniform injection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Technical University of Denmark (degree granting institution)","2017","Idling instabilities of large wind turbines in extreme winds is a relatively well known problem for manufacturers, at least in terms of the results in calculations. However, many are still sceptical of how realistic such instabilities are in actuality due to limitations in the current state of the art aeroelastic tools.<br/>The overall aim of this thesis is twofold. Firstly, through the use of analytical solutions for a parked blade developed by adapting existing formulations for the aerodynamic damping forces as well as numerical means in the form of the aeroelastic tool Focus 6, Phatas, versions 9083 and 10041 (kindly provided by WMC), this thesis aims to determine how parameters relating to the local angle of attack of a wind turbine blade contribute towards inducing idling instabilities in large wind turbines and to subsequently identify the underlying mechanisms that drive such instabilities to occur in simulations. Subsequently, from the results gathered from the analyses, the second goal is to then determine if the current state of the art aeroelastic tools are able to reasonably capture such instabilities. The reference wind turbine used in this thesis was the NREL 5mW turbine.<br/>The method used to obtain the results in the analytical solutions were first validated against existing literature and generally showed good agreement in the trends. The analytical solutions showed the aerodynamic damping values of a blade section at various nacelle yaw, rotor azimuth as well as blade pitch angles. The results from the analytical solutions showed that under certain conditions, idling instabilities were present.<br/>The results of the numerical simulations when first run with quasi steady aerodynamics and a constant wind profile showed good agreement with the analytical results (and also existing literature) and also suggested that the instabilities were driven by the edgewise modes of the tubine. Assessment of the outputs after the inclusion of dynamic stall (where simulations were largely limited to angles of attack between -45° and 45° as this was the range where the dynamic stall model was applied in its full extent) as well as turbulence to further simulations showed that Focus 6, Phatas still calculated instabilities at settings close to the analytical solutions’ predictions.<br/>As a final conclusion, this thesis provided a theoretical basis to argue for the case of idling instabilities being a possible issue. The numerical simulations largely support the findings of the analytical solutions where an assessment of the numerical results gave no indications to suggest otherwise.<br","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Broersma, Liekele (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Technical University of Denmark (degree granting institution)","2017","The use of vortex generators (VGs) is a prevailing technology in large modern wind turbines due to its potential to increase wind turbine annual energy production [39] by re-energizing the momentum energy in the boundary layer and, as a consequence, delay the flow separation. Many researchers have been extensively studying the effects of VGs on airfoil sections but none have included the VGs’ baseplate into their studies. This research aims to fill this gap and hopes to contribute toward the current body of work in VG research by studying the effect of the baseplate on the airfoil aerodynamics. The main goal of this thesis is to identify the effect of the baseplate of the vortex generators. The effect of VG positions, VGs with baseplate, Reynolds number, baseplate height and roughness model were studied in order to achieve the goal. Five baseplate shapes were studied in this research in order to cover all possible geometries in the real applications. Airfoil section with VGs were shown to be effective in delaying flow separation for both FFA W3-301 and DU 91 W2-250 airfoils. From the results of the simulations of airfoil sections with baseplate and VGs, baseplate shape no.2 (sharp bevel) shows an early flow separation and has the worst performance. The baseplate shape no.5 (”S” shaped bevel) shows results that were close to the airfoil without baseplate. In studying the airfoils with roughness, it was seen that by adding VGs, the loss in lift was restored. A reference wind turbine model was used in order to compute the wind turbine’s annual energy production. The rough airfoil had an annual energy production approximately 18% less than the clean airfoil for FFA W3-301 and approximately 13% for DU 91-W2-250. By adding VGs to the rough airfoil section, the AEP increased by around 10% for FFA W3-301 airfoil with VGs at 0.20c and approximately 5% for DU 91-W2-250 airfoil with VGs at 0.20c. Taking the baseplate (except baseplate shape no.2) into consideration, both the maximum lift and aerodynamic efficiency saw slight improvements in both airfoils. This could be a consequence of the baseplate which allowed the flow to pass resulting in accelerating flow being able to be energized by the VGs. From the studies, the baseplate shape no.2 (sharp bevel) had performed poorly in simulations with both airfoils, although the flow separation was seen to be delayed at high Reynolds numbers. However, due to the simplicity in manufacturing, this shape may still be used in practice and as such, it is highly recommended that the baseplate configuration is taken into accounted during the design process. This research has shown that it is advantageous to have baseplates with a smooth bevel likes baseplate shape no.1 (beveled edge) and 5 (”S” shaped bevel) in order to avoid unexpected flow separation. The effect of the baseplate could also be more important to account for in simulations as the height of the baseplate might increase in the future, if a larger VG is needed.","Vortex generators; CFD modelling; wind turbines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In CACC, individual vehicles, grouped into platoons, must automatically adjust their own speed using on-board sensors and communication with the preceding vehicle so as to maintain a safe inter-vehicle distance. The importance of CACC lies in the fact that it enables small inter-vehicle time gaps, which leads to a major reduction of the aerodynamical drag force applied on vehicles in such a driving pattern. Consequently, vehicle emissions, which play a main role in trucks and heavy automobiles, are expected to be highly reduced. <br/><br/>However, a crucial limitation of the state-of-the-art research in this control scheme is that the string stability of the platoon can be proven only when the vehicles in the platoon have identical driveline dynamics and perfect engine performance (homogeneous platoon), and possibly an ideal communication channel. <br/><br/>Thus, the objective of this MSc thesis is to address the problem of CACC for heterogeneous platoons under realistic inter-vehicle network conditions. In the first part, we propose a novel CACC strategy that overcomes the homogeneity assumption and that is able to adapt its action and achieve string stability for uncertain heterogeneous platoons under ideal inter-vehicle network conditions. In the second part, in order to handle the inevitable communication losses, we formulate an extended average dwell-time framework and design an adaptive switched control strategy which activates an augmented CACC or an augmented Adaptive Cruise Control strategy depending on communication reliability. <br/><br/>Stability of the proposed control strategies is proven analytically and simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical analysis.","Heterogeneous platooning; Cooperative adaptive cruise control; Adaptive control; Switched control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Treatment methods have to be developed in order to accelerate waste degradation and reduce emission potential preferably within the time-span of one generation. Aeration seems a promising treatment method but as yet has to be proven effective as a methodology to enhance waste degradation at full scale. Water content plays a crucial role in evaluating aeration, but the highly heterogeneous nature of a landfill body poses a big uncertainty in quantifying it and therefore also quantifying the effectiveness of aeration in reducing emission potential. To improve understanding of water within a waste body, Electrical Resistivity Tomography ERT is to be used to indirectly measure water content by obtaining electric resistivity information. However, full scale landfills have large areas and therefore a protocol needs to be developed for generating an optimum survey strategy, so that high resolution information is obtained while covering a large area. This thesis presents such a protocol consisting of four parts. First, optimum spread and spacing are defined by building a Pareto front with resolution and covered area as objective criteria. Second, array is designed in the previously defined grid, with standard and non-standard four-electrode configurations, by using a goodness function applied to multiple channel acquisition systems. Third, array design is tested with synthetic models showing that smooth resistivity models are well captured by data inversion, but array design performs poorly in a sharp resistivity model. Finally, practical aspects namely injection time, polarization effects and unstable configurations which are usually overlooked, are shown to have significant influence in data quality. This protocol is intended as a systematic approach to generate an optimum ERT survey strategy which could be extended to other geophysical methods.","electrical resistivity tomography protocol; landfill monitoring; optmization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Failure initiation in tension is identified using Hashin's quadratic failure criterion, which accounts for the interaction of shear stresses in the promotion of tensile failure. A bilinear softening relation was selected to represent the combination of fibre breakage and toughening mechanisms characteristic of the intralaminar tensile fracture of these materials. Effort was placed on the development of a procedure for calibrating the softening relation associated to this failure mode. Specifically, this work addresses the applicability of linking the definition of a bilinear tensile damage law in homogenized continuum damage mechanics models for woven composites to the shape of a crack growth resistance curve measured with compact tension tests.<br/><br/>The constitutive model was validated including it in a set of finite element models of unnotched and open hole coupons with different multistacking sequences, under quasi-static tensile loading conditions, and comparing the results obtained by the simulation of the coupons against an experimental benchmark.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","As technology advances, industry and academia rely more and more on the output of computer simulations or physical experiments of engineering systems under development. In some cases, the relationship between input and output of a system under study is too complex to model through analytical expressions or numerical methods. In other cases, existing models or experimental setups are too expensive to run every time a system prediction is necessary. Surrogate models are the main alternative to the previously mentioned approaches, requiring a much lower knowledge of the relationship between inputs and outputs and, generally speaking, being a cheaper and more computationally efficient option. <br/>Surrogate models are constructed with information obtained through sampling of a potential expensive model or experiment for different combinations of input parameters of the system. The sample allocation strategy is commonly referred to as Design of Experiments. Ideally, surrogate models are constructed on the base of a properly performed Design of Experiments. If the sample data is obtained from previously performed experiments it is likely that its distribution doesn't fit the needs for proper surrogate model construction. An untreated ill-sampled design space will negatively affect the precision of the surrogate model predictions. <br/>This study suggests a methodology to mitigate the negative effects of sample distributions exhibiting lower dimensional manifold clustering and/or distributions that only cover the design space partially in one or more of the design variables. The methodology consists on the application of a Sammon Mapping on the original sample dataset to eliminate the manifold clustering, following a second mapping of the data to a unit quadrilateral/cube such that the resulting design space is as fully sampled as possible. <br/>The proposed methodology was evaluated on test applications displaying only manifold clustering, only partial sampling and combinations of both problems, yielding precision increases in all of them. Once validated, the methodology was applied in the construction of a surrogate model for bypass duct pressure loss prediction and used to evaluate the prediction performance of an analytical tool used for the design and development of civil small and medium engines by Rolls-Royce Deutschland.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Recently an oxidation and reduction cycle of metals has been proposed as alternative for liquid fuel combustion. Out of several possible metals iron is an interesting candidate because the oxide does not form making it more easy to develop a cyclic process. As a first building block towards a computation or particle dust clouds here a computational model for the combustion of a single iron particle is developed. During high temperature oxidation of iron particle both iron and iron oxide remain in solid form and the combustion<br/>occurs in the form of a reaction zone at the interface between iron core and iron oxide outer layer. Because of the difference in density of iron and iron oxide the particle grows in size during the combustion process. The conversion can be either oxygen diffusion limited or kinetically limited depending on the temperature. After ignition the process is mainly diffusion<br/>limited.<br/>The model is developed for the case of a spherically symmetric particle. It consists of the transient transport equations of oxygen and of energy with boundary conditions for oxygen concentration and radiative heat flux to the surroundings. These are solved using finite difference and finite volume methods on a one-dimensional computational domain with radial coordinate as independent variable. A submodel is developed for the evolution of the reaction<br/>zone in the case of diffusion limited reaction. In this model the amount of oxygen available for reaction is obtained using penetration theory applied on the scale of the thin reaction layer.<br/>Particle volume increase is also included. The model is implemented in Matlab.<br/>Using the model combustion of particles with diameter in the range 2 tot 12 micrometer and for different levels of oxygen level and temperature of the surroundings is computed. The results show the development of oxygen concentration and temperature profiles over time and<br/>lead to the prediction of particle degree of oxidation over time. The evolving particle peak temperature results from the competition between heat loss to the surroundings and heat gain from the oxidation reaction. The radial temperature profile is nearly flat due to the high thermal conductivity.<br/>The predicted life-time of the particles is in agreement with experimental observations in the literature. The following observations are potentially important for process development: the combustion of the last 10% is slow due to the combined effects of particle cooling and oxygen diffusion limitation through an oxide layer of growing thickness. The energy released<br/>by combustion ends up in the sensible heat of the oxide and the gaseous surroundings. Energy efficient heat recovery should take the balance between these two heat sources into account.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Sustainable Process & Energy Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","During aircraft design,multiple tools are utilised to inspect the performance of the configuration. As the design matures, higher fidelity analyses are conducted to predict the flight dynamics of the aircraft. These analyses are conducted by using semi-empirical relations, numerically analysing flow behaviour, conducting wind-tunnel tests and performing scaled test flights. However, Semi-empirical relations might not hold for next generation aircraft and wind tunnel testing and scaled test flights are extensive and are also prone to accuracy issues. A best of both worlds can be found in numerical analysis. However, an increase in flow fidelity modelling comes with an increase in computational cost. Besides, complete analysis of all possible manoeuvres of a design increases the number of computations significantly. Current methods cope with this issue by using flight dynamics models based on so called stability derivatives, instantaneous values which couple flight state parameters to aerodynamic loads to predict aircraft flight dynamics. However, these models do not take into account time dependency. Therefore, these methods do not accurately predict the flight dynamics of agile aircraft, such as unmanned combat aerial vehicles, undergoing rapid manoeuvres where unsteadiness dominates flow behaviour. This conventional reduced-order modelling method, in which samples of the full-order model are taken in the form of stability derivatives, causes design iterations to be analysed inaccurately. The objective of this report is to investigate reduced-order modelling for flight dynamics prediction, thereby comparing conventional techniques to a method which does take into account unsteadiness in flow behaviour.<br/>The method investigated is based on indicial step response functions, which are samples in the form of unsteady aerodynamic flow behaviour functions of the full-order model. The idea is that once these samples are known, any flight manoeuvre can be analysed within minutes. Research found in literature has assessed some of the capabilities and limitations of this method, but not yet applied this to flight dynamics prediction. The research described within this report will address this gap by using two test cases. The first testcase is used to assess the assumptions made in literature, on aerodynamics loads modelling, by applying the method on a two-dimensional airfoil in subsonic flow conditions. It was found that the indicial step response functions are indeed representing the full-order model, thereby taking into account unsteady flow behaviour in aerodynamic loads prediction. In longitudinal motions, the angle of attack and pitch rate effect need to be taken into account to predict lift, drag and pitching moments. Multiple frequencies of the same manoeuvre can be analysed within minutes once the samples are calculated. Results show that the accuracy of the predictions becomes a trade-off issue between samples calculated and accuracy required. The second testcase is used to apply the indicial response functions to flight dynamics prediction of an agile<br/>unmanned bomber aircraft undergoing fast manoeuvres. A longitudinal-directional climbing manoeuvre was calculated by developing a flight dynamics model based on stability derivatives. The flow behaviour encountered during this manoeuvre was analysed to include highly unsteady and non-linear phenomena (e.g. vortices and flow separation) at higher angles of attack. By comparing the results of themethod under investigation to the full-order solutions, it was shown that aerodynamic flight dynamics predictions were accurate in capturing unsteady behaviour and weak non-linear flow behaviour. However, the samples proved to be inaccurate in representing behaviour in highly non-linear regions. Concluding, this means that indicial step response functions provide more accurate flight dynamics predictions than conventional stability derivatives in representing unsteady flow behaviour. The accuracy of the predictions are highly dependent on the samples chosen. Several samples suffice to predict the unsteady behaviour for linear and weak non-linear flow regions of the flightmanoeuvre. If surrogate modelling is applied, the method can become more computational efficient than conducting multiple full-order time-marching numerical calculations. It is recommended that more research is performed on indicial step response functions<br/>in capturing highly non-linear flow behaviour, as the research showed that the size of the samples affects the flow behaviour representation.","Reduced order model; Flight dynamics; Surrogate modelling; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; CFD; Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

Among them, the possibility to accurately control the thrust would open up new scenarios for nano- and pico-satellites applicability to include, for example, missions such as space debris removal and orbit transfer.<br/><br/>This thesis presents the design and the implementation of a closed-loop control system for thrust magnitude regulation in micro-resistojets. This is achieved by controlling the propellant mass flow in the micro-valve of the feeding system which is designed to make extensive use of off-the-shelf components. The Vaporizing Liquid Micro-resistojet (VLM) is one of the micro-thrusters under development at TU Delft and, for this reason, it is selected for performing the tests. The outcome of this work is meant to give insights into the design and performance level of future technologies for thrust magnitude control, which will be designed and manufactured at TU Delft. In order to develop appropriate controllers, a non-linear state-space model of the micro-valve system is developed analytically. The model includes different domains, such as electro-magnetic, fluid and mechanical, in order to bring together the complex dynamic behavior of the actuator. The performance of the analytical model is compared to a more sophisticated multi-domain analysis performed with finite element method (FEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Two controllers, namely PID (proportional-integral-derivative) and SMC (sliding mode control), are designed and tested using the models developed. <br/>The ON/OFF micro-valves are controlled with PWM (pulse width modulation) by tuning the operating duty cycle. A hybrid sliding mode control scheme is developed based on the insights gave by the experiments, which enables the thrust magnitude control of the comprehensive system. <br/>Finally, the closed-loop control system is implemented in the preliminary hardware design of the micropropulsion system. The experimental set-up comprises the propellant tank, the micro-valve, the micro-thruster, the feeding channel, pressure and temperature sensors and the processing microcontroller. The tests are focused on the performance of the controller, and the fine tuning of its parameters, and also in the validation of the design approach.<br/><br/>The controlled micro-propulsion system delivers the commanded input with a response time of ~1.5 s and a resolution of 50 mbar in the chamber pressure. As a first implementation of a control system for micro-propulsion at TU Delft, the results are promising and certainly pave the way for future developments on this research field.","thrust control; micro-propulsion; solenoid valve; VLM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In contrast to conventional chemical propulsion, the low thrust force generated by EP thrusters can deliver a momentum transfer to the spacecraft that is up to twenty times greater, for an equivalent propellant expenditure. Despite decades of heritage, the topic of low-thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization remains an active field of research, with many approaches available yet much room for improvement. This MSc thesis presents the development of a novel methodology for low-thrust many-revolution trajectory optimization. It employs the state-of-the-art hybrid technique to harness the strengths of both indirect and direct optimization methods. Its indirect nature efficiently reduces the number of optimization variables and its direct counterpart provides an unmatchable flexibility in terms of a configurable force and perturbation model as well as operational constraints handling. This methodology was already shown in literature to be highly reliable for minimum-time trajectories. The research hereby presented maintains these results while enabling it to optimize minimum-propellant trajectories through a mechanism that allows for coasting (non-thrusting) arcs. This approach is additionally combined with an orbital averaging scheme to reduce the propagation load at the expense of accuracy for the rapidly changing variables. Nonetheless, it retains the continuous integration scheme to enable final geodetic longitude targeting in combination with propellant-minimization, which the former hybrid methodologies were incapable of solving for. The trajectory simulator is coupled with an enhanced objective function that reduces the user fine-tuning effort, and with a differential evolution algorithm that leads to a flexible global optimization process with a practical computational effort.<br/><br/>This research is the outcome of the cooperation between the author, Delft University of Technology, and GMV Innovating Solutions, a technology business group with a strong leadership in space engineering. The specific interest of application of this research lies in many-revolution planetocentric trajectories, such as an orbital transfer to Geostationary Earth Orbit, where there are growing market opportunities for all-electric satellite platforms. The resulting software, integrated as part of GMV's Flight Dynamics solution, allows the user to include orbital perturbations and perform a multi-objective optimization with respect to time-of-flight, propellant expenditure, and final geodetic longitude. This research constitutes a quantum leap for the hybrid optimization method because it shows that its accuracy in propellant-minimization is comparable to the analytical global optima despite the simplified co-state dynamics. Furthermore, it is a significant advancement for space mission design and satellite operations because it demonstrates the superior convergence performance of the hybrid methodology relative to GMV's implementation of the indirect approach, particularly in complex problems that combine multiple optimization objectives with varied orbital perturbations and operational constraints fulfillment.","Low-thrust; many-revolution trajectories; Hybrid optimization; Propellant-minimization; Coasting arcs; Longitude targeting; Multi-objective optimization; Control parametrization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-13","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Therefore, the study of the tree growth dependency with hydrostatic pressure is needed to understand the behaviour of the insulation material used in subsea connectors. Silicone rubber (SiR) is used as an insulation material for these applications thanks to its higher viscosity characteristic in comparison with other solid insulation materials used in subsea cables.

SiR samples, with a needle to plate electrode configuration, have been put into a pressure vessel to grow the electrical tree in the material under high hydrostatic pressure conditions. The electrical tree growth has been divided in three stages (initiation, intermediate and final or pre-breakdown stage) and tests have been performed at 1, 20 and 60 bar.

In the three-terminal configuration, two scenarios are performed: with and without possibilities. The reliability modelled is performed using two approaches: analytical approach and Monte Carlo simulation. The reliability model of the subsystems and systems involve the availability, unavailability, outage duration, energy not transmitted, failure frequency, average duration per interruption, and the range of time between failures. After having the model and the reliability parameter, the reliability analysis is performed.<br/>From the analysis, it is found that the highest unavailability and thus the outage<br/>duration in onshore and offshore converter station are the transformer and the converter reactor, respectively. The offshore converter station is found to have the highest unavailability. The failure frequency, the average duration per interruptions, and the range of time between failures, which is produced by Monte Carlo simulation, can be applied for further action regarding the asset management of the system. The energy not transmitted through the point-to-point and three-terminal system is useful as a further research to choose which scenario is the most profitable.","Reliability Modelling; Multi-Terminal HVDC; Half-Bridge MMC; Converter Station; Point-to-Point; Three-Terminal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A traditional fluorescent lighting system consists of a fluorescent lamp(s) and a magnetic/electronic ballast. A direct replacement of a fluorescent lamp by a LED lamp with the same formfactor and pin connection avoids any rewiring or removal of the ballast, which is known as the retrofit concept. The retrofit LED lamps further guarantee a minimal total cost of ownership.<br/>This work investigates the compatibility issues between the T5 Retrofit LED lamps and the legacy electronic ballasts. The compatibility design focuses on the following points: 1. The LED lamps should generate stable light output at the specified lumen level; 2. The lifetime and reliability of the LED lamps and ballasts fulfill the given specifications; 3. The driver design should fit into the T5<br/>tubes.<br/>Two methods to ensure the compatibility have been studied, a passivemethod and an active method. The passive method utilizes inductance and capacitance to increase the load impedance seen by the ballasts so as to reduce the ballast output current and control the ballast thermal issues. Four structures with inductance and capacitance haven been analyzed by means of mathematical analysis and simulations. The active method realizes the LED current control that is absent in the passive method. Efforts are conducted to reduce the size of the two proposed active circuits. After the simulation analysis of each designs, a demonstration board has been built for experimental verification.<br/>Combining the passive methods with the active ones, four possible solutions that satisfy the design requirements are found. The comparisons between these solutions and the design suggestions are given in the last chapter.","Retrofit TLED; LED driver","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-18","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Cvetkovic, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","In a cordless kitchen system, the appliances do not make use of a power cord. The system consists of a power channel and a communication channel. There are various resonant topologies which can be implemented in the power channel[9]. The chosen topology should meet the functional as well as non-functional equirements of the system. Presently, a series resonant topology is used in the system. The topology is easy to understand, to implement and could meet the functional requirements like the amount of power and high efficiency of the system easily. But, it is difficult to meet the non-functional requirements like overvoltage protection, EMI and simple control of the system. This master’s thesis is mainly focused on design and realization an inductive power transmitter which addresses the following research questions:<br/>• EMI: The present inductive power transmitter is based on a series resonant inverter which has a disadvantage of high dV/dt’s across the inverter bridge and the transmitter coil. Furthermore, ZVS of the power switches can be lost at low duty cycles or low loads. Both mechanisms causes high dV/dt’s in the system, which results in increase in common mode noise problems.<br/>• Overvoltage: The present series resonant topology with the calculated circuit components and given load conditions (coupling factor (k) and load resistance (RL)), is observed to be operating in the capacitive mode of operation, when the load is disconnected/removed. Therefore, disconnection of the load causes overvoltage on the transmitter as well as the receiver coil. The overvoltage, in the absence of ’expensive’ protective means, can damage the system components and the system may fail to operate.<br/>• Simple control: The present system is a 4th order system. Due to weak coupling between the transmitter and the receiver coils, there exists multiple operating points where the voltage gain is the same. Therefore, it is difficult to find an optimal operating point for the control loop. Also, as mentioned in previous point, the load disconnection results in capacitive mode of operation of the system. To protect the system the control loop should take care that the system operates in the desired inductive mode of operation, as fast as possible and without causing significant losses. <br/>The report proceeds with an introduction about the cordless kitchen project. It is followed by the description and the analysis of the present system. Next, the detailed analysis of other possible topologies and selection of the alternative topology is described. It is followed by the description about the new proposed model. The report concludes with the conclusion and a paper publication.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","When offshore platforms have reached their end of lifetime, they have to be decommissioned. The topsides will be removed first, whereafter the jacket structure will be removed. Typically, the structure has to be removed up to 3 meters below seabed level. Decommissioning of jacket structures in clayey soils will result in large uplift forces due to suction below the mudmats of the jacket structures. Uplift velocities are relatively high to limit offshore operational time. The combination of high uplift velocities and low permeability of the<br/>clays will lead to undrained conditions, in which a reverse end bearing failure mechanismwill occur.<br/>The aim of this research is to find the most suitable mitigationmethodology which reduces the force to uplift<br/>a mudmat and to quantify the effect of this method with a numerical model. Subsequently, the numerical<br/>model is validated and applied to a case study to see what reduction in uplift force can be obtained.<br/>Several mitigation methods were investigated from which applying perforations in the mudmat was found<br/>to be the most feasible. Depending on the drainage condition, the reduction in uplift force due to perforations<br/>can be attributed to an earlier onset of suction breakaway and the reduction in length of the drainage<br/>path.<br/>With the use of Plaxis 3D a numerical model has been built to simulate the uplift of both non-perforated and<br/>perforated mudmats. A consolidation analysis in combination with a Mohr-Coulomb soil model was used<br/>with the undrained shear strength given as direct input. The model was validated by comparing the results<br/>with an experiment conducted in a geo-centrifuge.<br/>Three different mudmat types (to be named type B, P1 and P2) were lifted during this validation experiment<br/>in undrained conditions. Type B is a non-perforated mudmat, while types P1 and P2 are both perforated.<br/>Both type P1 and P2 have the same perforation ratio (area of the perforations over the area of the mudmat),<br/>but type P1 has a small number of large perforations, while type P2 has a large number of small perforations.<br/>Fromthe experiments it was found that a reduction in uplift force of 45%and 74%was obtained compared to<br/>type B for type P1 and P2, respectively.<br/>Initially, the model showed an unrealistic excess pore pressure distribution when the validation experiment<br/>was simulated in the numerical model, which was caused by stress oscillations. Accuracy generally increases<br/>with smaller time steps, but there is a threshold value for consolidation analyses. Time steps taken smaller<br/>than the critical time step might lead to stress oscillations. The critical time step depends mainly on mesh<br/>size and the permeability of the soil. The stress oscillations were caused by a critical time step which is too<br/>high. As the finest mesh possible was already used, the permeability should be increased to decrease the<br/>critical time step. Therefore the soil in the numerical model was modelled 20 timesmore permeable than the<br/>soil in the experiment. It was found that this has only limited effect on the uplift force.<br/>With the approach as described above, the numerical model for type B showed good agreement with the<br/>experimental results in terms of uplift force and excess pore pressure. Similar uplift forces were predicted by<br/>the numerical model for the types P1 and P2 mudmat, indicating that the smaller drainage length of the type<br/>P2mudmat did not influence the results. It was concluded that the reduction in uplift force in the experiment<br/>was attributed to the earlier onset of suction breakaway, which cannot be included in the Plaxis model. The<br/>earlier onset of suction breakaway is related to the gaps between the mudmat and the soil which are formed<br/>around the perforations in uplift and decreases the contact area between soil and mudmat. This allows water<br/>to flow through the gaps in order to penetrate the adjacent soil from there. The numerical model is not<br/>capable of modelling those gaps, leading to longer drainage distances. The uplift force obtained with the<br/>numerical model for the type P1 mudmat showed reasonable agreement with the experimental results. This<br/>indicates that the earlier onset of suction breakaway has limited influence on the type P1 mudmats.<br/>Finally, a case study was conducted to investigate the reduction in uplift force that could be obtained. Perforation<br/>ratios up to 25% were investigated from which the maximum reduction in uplift force found was<br/>about 10%. It should be noted thatmost likely more reduction will be obtained as the earlier onset of suction<br/>breakaway is not taken into account.","mudmat; uplift","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-25","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

As a result, many<br/>different state of the art technologies exist. However, in darkness or without a direct line of sight, much<br/>less technologies are capable of this. The choices become especially limited when the setup needs to<br/>be portable.<br/>A method for person localisation and tracking is implemented. This method consists of a localisation<br/>part, which works with any range-based detection method. Least square estimation is used to determine<br/>the location from the radar detections. With two or more people, it is mathematically impossible to<br/>distinguish which locations are correct, if only the current measurement is taken into account.<br/>Thus, the first problem to be solved is connecting ranges to targets. This is done using target association.<br/>After this is done, one-dimensional tracking can track people at lower computational cost.<br/>The tracking is both in one dimension (per-radar) and in two dimensions. The Hungarian algorithm<br/>is used for keeping track of people using a Kalman filter. The Kalman filter considers the predicted<br/>next location and the measured next location, and makes a best guess. A neural network was used for<br/>the optimisation of location-specific noise parameters, something that has not been done before in this<br/>context. Single person tracking and two person tracking works as expected. The tracking is relatively<br/>cheap in terms of computational complexity. While the tracking has no limits on the maximum number<br/>of people present, the localisation gets increasingly difficult with a complexity of O (n^n). Detecting<br/>the correct peaks is a non-trivial problem because of multi-path reflections. In combination with UWB<br/>radar detections, single and dual person tracking in a room is achieved. More people can be handled by<br/>the tracking algorithm, which is detection-method-agnostic, but not by the localisation. There is some<br/>room for improvement in the dual and triple-person case. However, going further than this is currently<br/>unfeasible, because of the many reflections that occur. Furthermore, the large amount of possible person<br/>locations also has an effect.

Two test cases are investigated, modelled after the low temperature geothermal fields of Middenmeer in The Netherlands and Soultz-sous-Forêts in France.

(mentor); Khodadadian, M. (mentor)","2017","In this work, gas phase toluene was degraded as model contaminant in an annular LED-based photocatalytic reactor under various light irradiance and illumination modes as a means to enhance the efficiency in illumination. The effect of controlled periodic illumination was first studied by exploring the effect of the duty cycle and the period and compared to continuous illumination at equivalent light irradiance. Controlled periodic illumination is based on the hypothesis that introducing photons in an alternate fashion rather than continuously avoids the buildup of charges and consequently, diminishes electron-hole recombination. The results show that under a kinetic-limited regime, there is no difference between the conversion of toluene under controlled periodic illumination and continuous illumination at equivalent average irradiance. Consequently, the photonic efficiency for controlled periodic illumination and continuous illumination at equivalent irradiance is also the same. Nonetheless, the photonic efficiency diminished with increasing average light irradiance. This behavior is ascribed to increasing electron-hole recombination with increasing duty cycle for controlled periodic illumination and with increasing light irradiance for continuous illumination. The second illumination technique investigated was the following of different radiation profiles along the reactor length. The LED array of the annular photoreactor was controlled with five different power supplies, each controlling one-fifth of the reactor length; thus, allowing to test experimentally different light irradiance per section of reactor. It was hypothesized that since at the inlet of the reactor the mass transfer driving force is larger than at the outlet of the reactor, a lower irradiance at the inlet would still yield good toluene conversion while at the same time decreasing the energy input. Experimentally, both an increasing and decreasing light irradiance profiles were tested and compared to a uniform profile at equivalent light irradiance. The results show that an increasing irradiance profile yielded a slightly higher conversion than uniform illumination; however, the difference was not statistically significant. In addition, a mathematical model of five photocatalytic reactors in series was developed to further explore the effect of following different irradiation profiles. By solving an optimization problem to minimize both the irradiance and outlet concentration of toluene, it was noted that the highest toluene conversion is always achieved under a uniform illumination of the reactor. Finally, this thesis presents the experiments to design the irradiation process control. The effect of relative humidity and toluene inlet concentration perturbations on the degradation of toluene, production of carbon dioxide, and mineralization are also analyzed. The results show that increasing the relative humidity to a certain value will stop catalyst deactivation and will augment the mineralization of toluene. In contrast, an increase in toluene inlet concentration will diminish the mineralization of toluene. Furthermore, a PI feedback controller was designed and validated manually. The feedback controller was able to maintain the conversion of toluene at the set-point at experimental conditions with no perturbations and at experimental conditions with perturbations such as catalyst deactivation, and changes in relative humidity and toluene inlet concentration.","photocatalysis; electron-hole recombination; UV-LEDs; controlled periodic illumination; continuous illumination; average irradiance; kinetic-controlled regime; radiation profile; process control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Process and Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology (SET)","",""

The TSI-USM was generalized to allow the propagation of a spacecraft trajectory in a central gravitational field subject to any pre-set thrust profile, without the need to adapt the internal working of the propagator. The three-dimensional thrust profile should be specified a priori, and with respect to time, by the user or by an evolutionary algorithm.

A combination of a Reference Network Model (RNM) and a menu of profit-sharing contracts has been used in this thesis to address these problems in electricity distribution. RNM is a tool which can be used by regulator to estimate the investment cost needed by distribution system operators (DSOs) and thus, the problem of information asymmetries between regulator and DSOs can be mitigated. <br/><br/>Menu of contracts, as defined in this thesis, is a regulatory scheme with the revenue determined ex-ante and reviewed ex-post, albeit based on some pre-defined rules. It ensures DSO to receive the greatest reward when the forecast investment cost coincides with the true expenditure in that regulatory period. Therefore, the use of menu of contracts can encourage truth-telling and hence avoid strategic behaviour of DSOs. Consequently, this regulatory mechanism has drawn some attention from regulators as a mean to tackle the aforementioned increasing uncertainties.<br/><br/>The sharing factor is a key parameter that is needed to build a menu of contracts. It determines the strength of the incentive given to the DSO, i.e. how much network companies would benefit from cost reductions or how much they would be penalized for an increase in costs as compared to allowances. In a conventional profit-sharing contract, the sharing factor is a constant value. However, under the menu regulation considered in this thesis, this parameter is obtained as a function of the ex-ante investment cost estimation submitted by the DSO. <br/><br/>Four sharing factor functions have been designed: two functions with a different rate of change when the DSO/regulator ratio increases (increasing and decreasing rate of change respectively) and two functions with an asymmetric sharing factor dependent on whether the difference between actual expenditure and allowed revenue is positive or negative. These sharing factor functions are applied in the menus of contracts, together with the network expansion cost estimated by RNM at different levels of PV penetration to assume different realizations for regulator’s forecast cost, DSO’s forecast cost and actual expenditure in menu of contracts. <br","Menu of Contracts; reference network model; sharing factor","en","master thesis","","","","","","Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Economics and Management of Network Industries (EMIN)","","","","","","","",""

In an MRI setting this can be used to map the electrical properties of tissue. These values can be used as a different contrast mechanism, for hyperthermia treatment or the improvement of antenna design for specific applications. There are different methods used to obtain these electrical properties, however these often use differential operators on measured data. This leads to reconstructions corrupted by noise, thus in this thesis the work on contrast source inversion based electrical properties tomography is continued. This method uses an integral approach and is therefore more robust with respect to noise.<br/>The work presented continues from the two-dimensional Matlab based simulations and extends these to a more realistic measurement setup. The RF-shield is numerically implemented and an extension is made to the existing algorithm to handle the transceive phase based on Maxwell's equations. This is done by implementing a forward problem into the inverse problem of getting the contrast from the measured radiofrequency field. After this the algorithm was tested with three-dimensional FDTD simulations and finally a phantom study was done to test with an MRI scanner.<br/>From the results of the two-dimensional simulations it was seen that this method is indeed very robust when it comes to a realistic measurement setup. In the three-dimensional simulations it was observed that the electrical properties are underestimated. Nonetheless CSI-EPT is more precise than the standard Helmholtz based methods. Plus the improvement made to the algorithm makes it possible to map all the RF fields inside the scanner which has not been done before.

In order to provide insights for the demand driven building heating energy management at IDE building, TU Delft, this research develops an approach to access real time occupancy information by applying supervised machine learning (ML) classification algorithms on the indoor CO2 data collected from a wireless sensor network (WSN) in the IDE building. Three types of ML classification algorithm including K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine(SVM) and decision tree (DT) have been applied to build the models, then the models are evaluated and compared with the aim to find the best ones for this case. Data collected from one single occupancy room and one double occupancy room based on the WSN are used to train different classification models, then the models are tested not only on these two rooms (local occupancy modeling), but also on another test room (global occupancy modeling). Results show that, as long as the CO2 sensors are located in the similar distance with occupants, the models trained at one room can be applied for another room with slightly lower accuracy. At single occupancy room, the binary occupancy detection (two classes: 0 or at least 1 occupant) models can reach the accuracy range from 90.6% to 93.8% for local occupancy modeling and from 86% to 89.1% for global occupancy modeling. The SVM (linear) model yields the highest accuracy. At double occupancy room, the binary occupancy detection (two classes: 0 or at least 1 occupant) models can reach the accuracy range from 96.2% to 97.2% for local occupancy modeling and from 89.1% to 91.6% for global occupancy modeling. The KNN (K=10) model yields the highest accuracy. The occupants number estimation (three classes: 0, 1, or 2 occupants) models can reach the accuracy range from 90.2% to 93.7% for local occupancy modeling and from 83.5% to 90.5% for global occupancy modeling. The SVM (linear) mode yields the highest accuracy. It is also found that SVM (linear) model yields the most stable prediction results with less overfitting in the time series, thus it is concluded as the most fit model for both binary occupancy detection and occupants number estimation with the aim to apply for demand-driven heating energy management.","Machine learning; occupancy detection; demand-driven control; heating energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy Technology","","Master of Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

A bored tunnel is one of the possibilities to create this subsurface infrastructure, but the construction process of a bored tunnel is a complicated one. Many loads and aspects are present in this construction process that can be divided into six phases. In each of these phases, different loads and aspects are acting on the tunnel lining or the surrounding soil which can cause the lining to deform. <br/><br/>The increasing complexity and demands of problems have led to the use of the finite element method. A computer based method which allows one to model the problem.<br/><br/>For finite element modelling, numerous programs are available of which several claim to be able to model bored tunnels. However, it is not yet clear what the exact differences between the different programs are. With many aspects to be modelled, many differences between programs occur, either in the soil, the tunnel lining or a combination of both.<br/><br/>This research has focussed on the possibilities of modelling the different construction phases of bored tunnels in two widely used programs: DIANA and Plaxis. Simple two dimensional (2D) models were created to which the different construction phases were added before continuing with three dimensional (3D) modelling. This approach has led to a good assessment of the possibilities and limitations within these two programs. <br/><br/>DIANA is not yet suitable for modelling the construction process of bored tunnels completely. The construction phases are modelled undrained to account for the relative short time they are acting. A consolidation phase in which the pore pressure can dissipate cannot be modelled in DIANA, which is essential for modelling the construction phases.<br/><br/>Plaxis, on the contrary, is not able to model joints in the segmental lining appropriate for 3D. In 3D, Plaxis only allows to model a joints as ""fixed"" or ""free"". In DIANA different theories can be applied to the joints, including Janssens. For 2D, both programs have a rotational springs besides the free and fixed connection for modelling the joints.<br/><br/>For the model in which the material models were changed, the difference with the main impact between the two programs occurred, especially for the bending moment. This means the Modified Mohr-Colomb material model in DIANA is different than the Hardening Soil model in Plaxis.<br/><br/>Including the construction phases leads to more favourable internal lining forces for tunnels, something of which clients should be convinced. However, not until the models have been benchmarked with measured data from a tunnel project. <br/><br/>While 3D models have been investigated in this research, they should be extended in order have a better understanding of the different 3D phenomena that are present in the construction of bored tunnels. This will both assess the possibilities of modelling this process and more potential differences between programs can be investigated.<br/><br/>Besides extending the 3D models, other programs should be investigated on their capabilities too. In order to come to a proper assessment of the possibilities, program experience is strongly recommended. These programs should also be compared with measured data for benchmark purposes.","Tunnelling; FEM; Lining Forces; Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

CFD analysis is the most commonly employed approach. However, it has the drawback that a very high computational cost prevents the use of detailed chemistry models. This master thesis, which focuses on NOx emissions, uses a more unconventional method of emissions prediction: Chemical Reactor Network (CRN). The advantage of this method is that, as it does not use fine discretisation, closure models nor fluid dynamics equations, it allows the implementation of detailed chemistry mechanisms.<br/><br/>A CRN is developed first for a single-element Lean Direct Injection (LDI) combustor and then the CRN is adapted for a Multi-Point LDI (MPLDI) combustor. CFD and experimental results are used to set up the CRN. In the base case scenario, in which kerosene is the fuel choice, the NOx emissions predicted are very close to experimental measurements. This is particularly meaningful given the high uncertainties of modelling this highly complex turbulent combustion process.<br/><br/>The developed CRN is also used to predict NOx emissions for the same combustor when the fuel choice is varied. Namely, the alternative fuels considered are kerosene enriched with hydrogen, methane and methane enriched with hydrogen. In comparison to kerosene, higher Lower Heating Values (LHVs) of these fuels lead to lower combustor temperatures for the same power input. Consequently, the thermal NOx pathway is weakened and the NOx mass flow generated is reduced. Nevertheless, these fuels with a higher LHV come with an increased operational risk that must be overcome before their implementation in aviation becomes possible.","Emissions; Modelling; Chemical Reactor Network; CRN; Lean Direct Injection; LDI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

(mentor)","2017","For μCHP applications, micro gas turbines offer many potential advantages in comparison to other conver- sion technologies due to their compact size and high specific power, low vibration and noise, low mainte- nance requirements, low emissions and high-grade residual thermal energy. Optimisation of MTT compressor with a vaneless diffuser (OCVLD) was performed to determine the signifi- cance of various geometrical parameters on MTT compressor performance. The blade angle at impeller inlet played a major role in reducing the performance of the MTT compressor followed with radius at inducer hub, radius at inducer tip and radius at impeller tip. Further increase in efficiency was observed by performing an optimisation of MTT compressor with a vaned diffuser (OCVD). However, incorporating optimised impeller design is not a cost effective option for MTT as a new compressor scroll has to be designed to accommodate the optimised impeller. The most cost effective option to increase the performance of the MTT compressor is by incorporating pre- whirl and vaned diffuser with existing turbocharger impeller. It was observed that, approx. 2.2% increase in electrical efficiency for MTT CHP unit can be achieved by incorporating a positive prewhirl and an airfoil shaped vaned diffuser. The recuperated micro gas turbine developed by the Dutch company Micro Turbine Technology B.V. (MTT) utilises offthe- shelf turbocharger impeller for their micro gas turbines to reduce manufacturing cost. How- ever, adopting the turbocharger impeller for micro gas turbine applications mostly results in operating the compressor at off-design conditions, thus reducing it’s performance. Improvement in micro gas turbine performance can be achieved by suitable modification of turbocharger technology, especially considering that turbochargers usually employ centrifugal compressor with a vaneless diffuser to minimise production cost and maximise flow range, whereas micro gas turbines require higher efficiency and pressure ratio for a confined operating range. Thus, the main objective of this thesis is to de- termine a cost effective option to increase the performance of the MTT Compressor. Form the 1D meanline results, it was observed that the incidence at the inlet of the impeller played a sig- nificant role in reducing the performance of the MTT compressor. The adoption of turbocharger impeller for MTT compressor was the primary reason for the reduction in MTT compressor performance. However, the losses due to incidence were mitigated at the expense of pressure ratio by providing a positive pre-whirl at impeller inlet. Significant increase in performance of MTT compressor was observed by replacing the vane- less diffuser with a vaned diffuser.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

This study focuses not on the long term compaction, but rather on the possible triggering of fault slip by the transient flow regime surrounding a well which has undergone a sudden rate change. Assuming a unilateral decoupling between displacement and pressure, numerical experiments are conducted using a sequential finite volume-finite element solution strategy that fully incorporates second order terms in the radial flow equation. Solving for short time scales, a spatial and temporal maximum in slip-promoting stress is observed and explained physically. Although present, the transient effect is of a magnitude that raises questions about its significance, especially as the geometric irregularity of a fault with nonzero displacement causes even greater stress concentrations that grow monotonously in time.","porous media; natural gas; reservoir engineering; poroelasticity; induced seismicity; transient flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Engineering","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

The biorefineries were modeled using black-box mass balances for biofuel production and electricity and heat cogeneration. The results of this model, along with local costs factors, were used to estimate the economic performance of biorefineries in each country where each feedstock is available. Estimates of capital expenses, operating expenses, and annual earnings were used to calculate the minimum selling price of the biofuel, which is used as an indicator of economic performance. The environmental performance of each combination was estimated using the indicators of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, sulfur dioxide emissions, nitrogen oxide emissions, and non-renewable energy use. The economic and environmental indicators for each feedstock-technology-country combination are compared to each other and also compared to reference values for other marine emission-reducing technologies, including liquid natural gas, emission scrubbers, and soy biodiesel. The results are subject to sensitivity analysis to determine the influence of uncertainty of capital costs, feedstock costs, biorefinery scale, biorefinery siting, biorefinery configuration, biofuel yields, biofuel blending, and environmental impact allocation. The biofuels modeled in this study have significantly lower life cycle greenhouse gas and sulfur dioxide emissions and non-renewable energy use than those of heavy fuel oil, but have higher life cycle nitrogen oxide emissions, due to the lower quality of the fuel produced and combusted. Economically, none of the biofuels are competitive with current fossil fuel prices when estimated with the scale and cost factors in this study. The feedstock-technology-country combinations with the lowest minimum biofuel selling price, when considered as a ratio to the current local price of marine gas oil, are the hydrothermal liquefaction of barley straw in Sweden, and the fast pyrolysis of corn stover and rice residues in Brazil. Each of those combinations has a minimum biofuel selling price ratio of 3.2 times that of marine gas oil. Performance trends between technologies and feedstocks are weak, and superior economic performance does not correlate with superior environmental performance.","Biofuels; Technoeconomic assessment; Life Cycle Assessment; Brazil; Scandinavia; Industrial Ecology; Marine Biofuels","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-04-23","","","","Industrial Ecology","Horizontal International Project",""

A coupled numerical model that is built in Comsol Multiphysics is presented in order to estimate the thermal recharge during the first 30 years of production from a typical high enthalpy geothermal reservoir. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to find which parameters have most significant impact on the thermal recharge by free convection and reservoir lifetime. The sensitivity analysis is mainly focussed on fault properties. The developed model consists of a reservoir with two confining layers and vertical faults. This model is used to calculate the produced energy, extracted energy from the reservoir and the recharge by conduction based on which the thermal recharge by free convection can be calculated. Results show that free convection is a significant part of the produced energy. Therefore, it is important to take free convection into account by estimating the recoverable energy. From the results can also be concluded that fault aperture, fault height, fault permeability and thermal conductivity of the confining layers have a significant impact on the thermal recharge by free convection of a faulted geothermal system. Fault density also has impact on the thermal recharge, but the relation between fault density and thermal recharge by free convection is less clear. Thermal conductivity of the reservoir rock has no impact on the thermal recharge by free convection according to the results of this model.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

In this thesis we present a novel methodology that combines three forms of intelligence.<br/>The sensor mote and base station both maintain a neural network-based predictor of the environmental state, which the sensor mote uses as input for different controllers (both handmade and based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes) that determine the actions performed by the sensor mote. Armed with the prediction mechanism, a model of the environment, the controller executed by the sensor mote, and the reported measurements, the base station performs computations akin to those commonly used with Hidden Markov Models to form an accurate environmental state estimation.<br/>We apply our techniques to real world data sets and reduce the required number of report operations by over 90% whilst incurring only minimal accuracy penalties.","wireless sensor networks; Machine Learning; POMDP; neural networks; planning; energy conservation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the often used analytic geometric and energy methods, it is difficult to incorporate deformation of the faces in non-rigid origami. However, deformation of the faces can play a significant role in their mechanical behaviour. This thesis aims to investigate and improve the design of non-rigid origami structures by using the Finite Element Method (FEM), which is well suited to model all deformations of these structures.<br/>In collaboration with the Bertoldi Group at Harvard University, FEM is applied on the new bistable non-<br/>rigid origami structure called the Star bellow. The suitable building blocks of the FEM approach, are<br/>finite rotation shell elements to model the faces of the structure, torsional spring elements to model the crease lines, and a Newton-Raphson arc-length control solution procedure. In addition to the numerical analysis, experimental work is performed. A parametric study, FEM simulations, and physical load tests of prototypes, are performed to understand the mechanical properties of the Star bellow structure and to improve its bistable behaviour. In addition, the Star bellow structure was considered as a unit cell and tessellated into a 1D-array to create a Star bellow metamaterial. Simulations and physical load tests were performed to investigate the influence of the tessellation on the bistable properties of the metamaterial.<br/>A design improvement was successfully proposed with a decrease of the minimum force value of 0.11<br/>[N]. The tessellated Star bellow metamaterial into a 1D-array is feasible and keeps its bistable proper-<br/>ties, although the bistability is reduced compared to a non-tessellated, single Star bellow structure.<br/>The application of FEM to study the Star bellow structure enhances the design process of the Star<br/>bellow. It has been shown that a parametric study using FEM is a way to gain understanding of the<br/>structure’s mechanical properties. Furthermore, a design change of the Star bellow was proposed<br/>which improved its bistable properties. It is also found that the results of the FEM simulations, for the<br/>force values, did not match the results of the physical load tests for various reasons. To improve this,<br/>another load testing setup and a more advanced implementation of the torsional spring elements to<br/>model the crease lines is advised.","Origami; Finite element method; parametric study; finite rotation shell element; non-rigid origami","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, it has been claimed potential for passive flow control of transonic buffet. Although the underlying mechanisms of how SCBs favourably influence buffet onset are thought to be understood in broad terms, no experiments of SCBs in an unsteady flow field exist that verify this (Bruce and Colliss (2015)). Two different SCB geometries which have already been investigated in a steady flow field, experimentally and numerically, were investigated in buffet conditions. Image post processing was used to detect the oscillating shock wave position from schlieren images and velocity vector fields. It thus became possible to divide the velocity field into the time-average, the cyclic component and the turbulent component, known as triple decomposition. The time-averaged and the phase-averaged flow field were analysed in respect to the shock position and boundary layer separation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","","",""

To protect space vehicles from these heat loads and their resulting temperatures they are equipped with a Thermal Protection System (TPS). Heat loads are typically the largest during flight through the atmosphere. The research question addressed in the thesis is: how robust is a thermal protection system design for a spaceplane wing-body configuration to variations with respect to the design parameters or trajectory taking into account heat transfer through radiation and conduction in three dimensions?<br/><br/>To answer the research question a tool was developed which is capable of designing a TPS and optimizing the insulation layer thickness. Furthermore, a trajectory simulation was made for the reentry phase. From the trajectory specifics the heat flux over the vehicle over time could be generated, which is the source of the temperature increase. In the TPS design tool the first major task is to divide the vehicle into different TPS areas, based on the temperatures that are experienced at each of these areas of the skin surface. A thermal analysis is performed, taking into account both conduction in three dimensions and radiation to outer space as well as to the inner subsystems of the vehicle. From this analysis the maximum experienced temperature can be deduced for each area. When the TPS design is found, it is aimed to optimize the insulation layer thicknesses in all TPS areas. The goal is to find a design that is as light as possible, thus with a minimum insulation layer thickness, while not exceeding the maximum temperatures of the TPS types and underlying structure. A sensitivity study was performed to investigate the robustness of the TPS design resulting from the tool. The performance of the TPS design was tested when small changes were made to it, for the nominal reentry trajectory of the reference vehicle. Furthermore the TPS designs performance was analyzed for small changes in the trajectory. <br/><br/>From the analysis of the results of the developed tool it was found that a TPS design can be developed for a simple wing-body configuration, under the specified conditions. However, the functionality of the TPS design is limited. Improvements must be made to the developed tool to increase its performance, so that it can come to an acceptable TPS design. It is suspected that with suggested improvements the tool will work properly, and a well functioning TPS design can be made. However, further research is required to ensure this.","spaceplane; thermal protection system; SSTO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Current methods of production of nanoparticles are expensive and make use of harsh reagents. Because of these limitations, nanoparticles are not yet widely available, limiting the use in medical applications. To commercialize nanoparticle production, it is necessary to develop a nanoparticle synthesis process that is cheap, safe and environmentally friendly. Earlier research has shown that biosynthesis of nanoparticles is possible in many different organisms using certain reducing peptide sequences. Biosynthesis of metallic nanoparticles is cheaper, safer and occurs under physiological conditions, making it an ideal process for the up scaling of nanoparticle production. However, shape and size of the nanoparticle are hard to control and yields are low when biosynthesis is used, limiting the use of biosynthesis. To overcome the problem of shape and size control, it is proposed to use viral capsids as protein cages to restrict the size of synthesized nanoparticles to the inside of the capsid. To implement this, metal ion reducing peptides were fused to the monomers of self-assembling capsids in a way that they were displayed on the inside of the capsid. It was shown that with the adjusted monomers, the capsids still self-assemble.

This development increases the risk of instability and congestion in the grid, posing great challenges to system operators in the near future. In order to optimally allocate resources and plan grid enhancement, distribution system operators need new tools to monitor the local energy transition and assess its future impact. Smart meter data is an important resource in gaining this insight, but unlocking the full potential requires new analytical methodologies. Recent research focused on identifying typical daily energy consumption patterns - load shapes - but a clear interpretation of these results is lacking. This research proposes a latent lifestyle model, which models energy consumption as a mixture of different lifestyles, each of which is defined by a distribution over load shapes. This extra layer of abstraction proves to be an effective way of identifying lifestyle-like patterns, that allow for a clear interpretation. Consumers can then be grouped based on their mixture of inferred lifestyles, serving as an input for grid simulation. Such a simulation showed that the all-electric homes cause the aggregated load to nearly triple compared to conventional consumers, due to their increased peak demand and simultaneity.","Load shapes; Energy consumption; Lifestyles; Simulation; Congestion; Peak demand; Energy transition; Smart meter data; Topic Modeling; Statistical analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-07-14","","","","","",""

Some connections have be found and discussed in the Post- Modernism period, between the values defended by citizenship and educational architecture. Although this relation has been explained generally but has not been illustrated through tangible architectural means. Therefore, the narrative architectonical aspects remain unnamed. Through this research and design proposal, I intend to analyse tangible architectural means that are narrating the values of citizenship in order to apply some of them in my design proposal. This research consists first of literature studies to enlighten the broad and complex meaning of citizenship and reveal its different aspects. The second part consists of three case studies Burgerweeshuis (1960) by Aldo van Eyck, Parque educativo Saberes ancestrales, (2013) by Taller Sintesis and Ambiantes de Aprendizaje (2014) by Colectivo 720. These case studies will serve as analysis projects in order to point out the architectural means related to the citizenship’s notions. Through this research, I found out that by defending civil, political and social right, citizenship is a term which enhance degrees of activity and participation. Thus, the notions within the citizenship definitions are on different levels related to tangible aspects. Their safekeeping could even be depending on the spatial configurations and architectural means of the environment where these rights are being applied and put to practice. The notions that are tangible can be divided into two categories: the spatial identity and the spatial aspects. From the spatial aspects the boundaries or delimitations are the closely related to architectonical means. The values of citizenship are narrated through the range of existing delimitations. In the realised case studies, these delimitations are used as a pattern or code that contributes to the comprehension of the building’s program and the proportion of imposing delimitations is not superior to the amount of endorsing delimitations, which is important in order to generate a participative dialogue between the user and its environment, also called ‘realm of citizenship’.","Citizenship; Education; Degrees of participation; Educational environments; Educational architecture; Architectural delimitations; Narrative architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","",""

In order to assess the stability of the slopes the geotechnical characterisation of these quarries needs to be improved. This report provides the justification for a working plan for a thorough but quick assessment of existing slopes in clay mines. Literature is consulted for the information for the types of measuring and monitoring equipment for slopes, what instabilities look like in the field, how the safety factor are calculated, what information can be gathered outside the mine and what a field investigation should concern. To come to a working plan a field investigation was conducted to try out the different measurement equipment. For field testing, the needle penetrometer and hand vane shear came out as useful tools for correlating undrained shear strengths parameters of different layers. For thorough correlations, between layers and a dataset of geotechnical parameters, Atterberg limits are used to minimise the number of geotechnical parameters that have to be tested. The parameters are tested with different machines based on the timespan over which the slope has to be stable. Short-term slopes with insitu conditions are best tested with triaxial tests, but UCS and a theoretical strong shear box can provide useful data as well. Long-term slopes are better tested with either a shear box or ring shear because remoulded or weathered properties are needed. Monitoring is found to be done best by using InSAR monitoring provided a suggestion is added to increase the number of data points inside the mine. The working plan is presented as a flowchart for a good overview.","clay mines; geo-engineering; stability","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Damage in materials and structures is unavoidable, leading to the time deterioration of its functional properties (e.g. barrier, load bearing, aesthetics) and ultimate repair or replacement. Lifetime extension can be achieved by using materials with initially higher performance or using materials that can repair themselves (self-healing). The latter are materials capable of repairing themselves autonomously or with little human intervention, thereby partially or fully restoring their original material properties and performance. To be able to heal macroscopic damages a first key requirement is initial contact between broken faces. Only after this first step will the subsequent molecular processes be able to proceed with the healing at the molecular scale. In most studied concepts the contacting stage is performed by hand placing, limiting potential applications and highlighting the need for research to facilitate this necessary first step. This MSc research project addresses this problem by exploring the potential of magnetically induced damage closure. The main underlying idea states that magnetic forces at the crack plane should be sufficient to promote the bridging of broken parts, thereby facilitating the interfacial phenomena leading to healing. Such a concept can conceptually be implemented by using magnetic healable polymers, pending magnetic particles in the polymer or embedding particles as extrinsic phases. In a preliminary stage it was decided to study the latter experimentally as well as computationally. A hydrogel-composite consisting of poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer matrix mixed with iron-oxide (magnetic) particles was used as model system. Experiments showed that the presence or absence of a magnetic field does not affect the ultimate interfacial healing achieved.

This mismatch is anticipated to grow further due to an increasing number of households (between 300,000 and 1,000,000 until 2040) and the many barriers in the development process of inner city locations. The Dutch residential development sector stands for a great challenge.<br/>Objective – The objective of this thesis is to explore the functioning and possibilities of revolving funds for inner city development. The hypothesis of the research is therefore that a revolving fund provides a solution towards overcoming (some of) the barriers in urban development, particularly in the inner city.<br/>Methods – The research is divided in three components: literature review, empirical study through a comparative case study, and the translation from the case study towards a revolving fund design for residential development in inner city locations. <br/>Results – The case study has established that there are six structural elements that characterize revolving funds: goal focus, goal limitation, size of the fund organisation, distance to the responsible governmental body, risk acceptance and steering ability. A variant study shows different possibilities of the design of a revolving fund with different characteristics in regard to the six structural elements. <br/>Conclusion - In general, the results imply that the use of a revolving fund can stimulate certain residential development projects that experience financing issues. The study has also established that there is a support base for a revolving fund in inner city development, both from a public and private of view. A revolving fund for inner city development should have an equal focus on societal and financial yield (goal focus) and should have a medium goal limitation. In terms of organisation, the fund should have a rather small organisation in relation to the fund volume and should be sufficiently distanced from the responsible governmental body. Regarding the financial structure, the risk acceptance should be relatively high to carry out the predefined tasks of the revolving fund. This results in a revolving fund through which governmental objectives can be carried out with high steering ability. <br/>Keywords: inner city development, revolving fund, planning instruments, comparative case study","inner city development; revolving fund; urban planning; planning instruments; comparative case study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This field can be characterized only relying on the volume allocated to the antenna and thus independently from the specific antenna. The observable field is composed by a single spherical wave that first converges in the origin and then diverges to infinity. The power associated to the converging wave is the available power for the considered antenna domain. Previously, an estimation of this spherical wave was obtained by truncating the spectral spherical modal series representation of the incident field. Here we provide a more applicable approximation of the observable field, by truncating a spatial integral representation of the incident field that is based on the use of equivalent ideal currents. Eventually, for the vast majority of antennas, the estimation of the available power that can be obtained by approximating the observable field via the ideal currents is more accurate that the estimation that would be obtained via the spectral modal expansion. The ideas are first set considering the case of single plane wave incidence.

In the past years interest has been shown by researchers and engineers to use XBeach for longer simulation periods (multiple years). XBeach has multiple modules: stationary mode is often used during calm conditions and surfbeat mode is often used during storm conditions. In this study was investigated whether the coupling of the two modes can increase the performance of long-term models compared to the separate models, while focusing on the cross-shore processes. Also the added value of (quasi-)2D models was studied. The high frequency bathymetryic data of Vlugtenburg, an alongshore uniform beach in The Netherlands, was used for creating 1D models for a period of 1 year. To compare the difference between singular and coupled models, first the potential performance of the stationary and surfbeat modules was investigated separately by optimising the settings for asymmetry, skewness and groundwater flow. It was found that the skill of the stationary and surfbeat models with default settings was negative. Erosion was overestimated (especially in surfbeat mode) and the models showed no seasonal effects. Settings for asymmetry and skewness proved to be effective measures to improve the model performance and were able to introduce seasonal effects. The optimised stationary model was able to predict the profile development reasonably well. The groundwater flow module did not affect the model stability as much as was found in the studies of Zimmermann et al. (2015) and Pender (2013). In order to validate whether a coupling between stationary and surfbeat mode would benefit the model performance, it was investigated whether stationary mode was able to restore the dune and beach erosion of the surfbeat model. Therefore surfbeat was run during the first 100 days of the year (during more extreme conditions) and stationary mode during the remainder of the year (more mild conditions). Stationary mode appeared not to be able to restore the eroded surfbeat profile. The performance of the coupled model was better than the surfbeat model, but the stationary mode was found to perform better than the coupled model for long-term modelling on the most criteria. It was found that a deficiency in XBeach is the ability to transport sediment from the intertidal zone (and just above) further up the beach and dunes. The erosion volumes in the dunes in stationary mode were in the same order of magnitude as the onshore directed aeolian transport. Therefore is expected that the results of long-term models can be improved by coupling XBeach with a wind model. The quasi-2D model was found to have a better performance than 1D models due to the spreading of infra-gravity waves in 2D; in both the separate and coupled models the erosion volumes were not overestimated as much as in the 1D models.","XBeach; long-term modelling; coupled models; stationary; surfbeat; Vlugtenburg; infra-gravity waves; asymmetry; skewness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","","52.00675, 4.13156"

This simulation system consist out of a central Hydraulic Simulation Unit (HSU) that runs a hydraulics simulation and controls various electrical components. This thesis describes the Ethernet communication between that HSU and the electrical components.<br/>As per Requirement 4, the communication system has to be designed to operate on a 1 millisecond tick. Every millisecond the HSU communicates new data with the various electrical components. This data consists of currents, voltages and operation modi for the components. Various Ethernet protocols were considered and in the end raw Ethernet communication on the OSI data link layer was selected. This is the most lightweight possible communications protocol through Ethernet to ensure the communication is fast enough and lightweight on processing power.<br/>Every millisecond the HSU broadcasts a big packet with all the data to every component. These components will then extract information relevant to their operation. This design choice moves the computational effort of selecting relevant data per component from the HSU to the components. This is desirable since the HSU needs enough processing power to run the simulation as well as the communication in parallel. The components will then process the data and provide their response with unicast packets.<br/>For every component to know exactly what data from the broadcasted packet is relevant to them, an initialisation phase is required. This phase is executed before the 1ms tick communication and ensures the components know at what offset they can find their relevant data.<br/>This communication system was then tested to check if it does meet the 1ms requirement. It turns out the communication has some issues achieving the 1ms Requirement 4. The problem could be the non-realtimeness of the Linux kernel running on the HSU which leads to packets not meeting the 1ms requirement. A possible solution to this problem would be to program the HSU on a realtime OS or even baremetal C.","hydraulic engineering","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-01","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

To this end, Chapter 1 elaborates how a prioritisation of interests contructs a dominant collective mode that excludes alternative tendencies. Chapter 2 elaborates on the fallacies incorporated in the process of abstraction to come to such a priority of interests for a collective. Chapter 3 suggests an alternative, Deleuzean, attitude towards power which promotes differences over their abstraction. Chapter 4 then applies this Deleuzean understanding of power to a housing block in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The advice is to start with opening up the most blatant fixation of use and form in the municpality’s place-specific ‘Bestemmingsplan’ law. Afterwards, chapter 5 concludes that by steering away from fixated hierarchies constructed through abstraction, we arrive at a post-humanist, flat ontology.

Therefore, the implementation of a 2DH XBeach model for dune safety assessment is evaluated. A transformation from 1D to 2DH becomes necessary and several hydrodynamic effects come into play, which are not relevant for a simulation in 1D. Additionally, the definition of a new limit state is a challenging task in order to define failure properly: The legal definition needs to be transformed into a technically feasible one. In this thesis five different limit states have been defined in order to evaluate the influence of a limit state on its consequences. These five limit states are then applied in a case study on the Delfland coast and the consequences of the different definitions are evaluated. Additionally, the safety development of the Delfland coast over the last two decades was analysed. It was found that all nourishment strategies applied at this coastal stretch contributed to an increasing safety.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) (degree granting institution)","2017","Wind power to cold climate sites is attractive because of favorable wind conditions and low population density. However, icing of wind turbine blades remains one of the main challenges for cold climate sites. Ice formation on wind turbine blades causes several problems, such as the loss of power production, unbalanced loads in drive train and ice throw. Most of the existing detection methods need special sensors installed and would be expensive to achieve a satisfied accuracy. In this research, an alternative model-based ice on blade detection method is proposed. There are mainly two advantages of the method. Firstly there are no additional measurements are needed. Secondly the detection method can be implemented for any kind of blade aerodynamic changes, not only ice on blade. <br/>The basis of the mode-based ice-detection method is a reliable linearized wind turbine model. The accuracy of the model is mainly influenced by the number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) and the number of operation points (OP). The most efficient model is the one with less DOFs and OP but without losing much accuracy. The relative importance of DOF and OP is revealed and suggestions are given for an optimum choice of DOF and OP for different quantities. Specifically, for power production properties, increase the number of OP is more efficient. While, for blade and tower related properties, increase the number of DOF is a better choice.<br/>The ice on blade influence of aerodynamic force, power production and structure loads is studied for three ice conditions, which are start ice, light ice and moderate ice. Based on the ice on blade influence and the reliable linearized wind turbine model, the concept of model-based ice-detection is proposed as follows: Firstly ice on blade changes the aerodynamics and the blade mass. Therefore it can be considered as one wind turbine system changed to a different system. That means the outputs of the two systems, with ice and without ice, are different, even the inputs are exactly the same. From the ice-detection point of view, if the difference of outputs between iced system and cleaned one is much larger than modeling error, ice on blade can be detected. <br/>With the proposed model-based detection method, the ice-detection capability of different output quantities is studied. It has been found that the power production related quantities usually have the highest ice-detection capability, while the blade and tower properties have relatively lower capability. In order to verify the ice-detection method for a broad working conditions, implementations are performed for above and below rated wind speed conditions. Successful detections have been achieved for both of them. <br/>For possible measurement errors in reality, they are efficiently considered by introducing uncertainty factors. The ice-detection capabilities with measurement error have been analyzed for three ice conditions and detected based on different quantities. Although a drop in the detection capability has been observed if considering the measurement error, all the quantities still can detect the ice successfully to some degree.","Ice detection; Model based; Land based wind turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM) | Offshore and dredging engineering | Bottom Founded Structures, Arctic and Wind","",""

At the same time, the cost efficiency of two affordable housing programs is calculated based on the federal affordable housing portfolio of the New York City Housing Authority. Cost efficiency and political and public support (which is also referred to as ideology in this research) are often conflicting goals. This report examines what affordable housing policy decisions have been based on and how cost efficient the two considered programs have been. The main research question is: “What has been driving federal affordable housing policy choices in the United States and how cost efficient have they been?”<br/><br/>The information about the bases of past policy decisions and the cost efficiency of these programs over the years that this study provides can contribute to future policy decisions and make policy makers more aware of what their decisions are founded on. The history of affordable housing policies is an essential part to understand the current system. Both the history of affordable housing policies and current affordable housing programs are analyzed based on ideology. The cost efficiency study can be used to determine how cost efficient different housing programs – and thus affordable housing policies – have been. <br/><br/>This study finds that cost efficiency has not played a significant role in decision making related to affordable housing policies in the United States, especially before the 1970s and 1980s; decisions have instead been based mainly on ideology. Over the years, affordable housing policies have moved from public-administered, project-based assistance to tenant-based assistance using the private market<br/><br/>Since the 1970s, multiple cost efficiency studies have been conducted; however, they are self-admittedly disadvantageous towards public housing. The cost efficiency study conducted as part of this research concludes that public housing has been more than twice as cost efficient as housing provided through the federal government’s Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. It can thus be concluded that cost efficiency has not been a large part of affordable housing decision making, with housing policy decisions instead being driven mainly by ideology – which has resulted in decisions that are not necessarily cost efficient.<br/><br","Federal affordable housing programs; affordable housing policies; public housing; Section 8; housing vouchers; LIHTC; cost efficiency; NYCHA; policy decisions; historic analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The literature study performed here iden- tifies roughness as one of three major causes for the decreased performance of the additive manufactured alloys (along side porosity and residual stresses). In order to eliminate the two other causes for poor fatigue, and isolate the surface roughness, a hot isostatic pressing (HIP) treatment was performed on every sample. Luckily, a first set of tests proved that chemical treatments, specifically electropolishing and plasma- polishing, greatly improve the surface quality. A second series tests (rotating bending fatigue tests) concluded that, although specific roughness parameter such as Ra reach lows of 0.2μ there was no statistically sound relation between fatigue performance and an improved surface roughness. Upon further investigation of the specimens, it was discovered through CT scans, that their porosity was in fact much closer to that of non HIP treated specimens. This master thesis illustrates once more that the effect of surface roughness on SLM Ti-6AL-4V alloys cannot be properly identified if the bulk material shows internal defects.","additive manufacturing; Ti-6Al-4V; Fatigue; electropolishing; surface roughness; fatigue test; chemical etching; plasma polishing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Although novel technology can bring benefits and opportunities, it may cause unintended and undesirable consequences to environment and society. In order to prevent future ecological disadvantages, environmental analysis is carried out to estimate the impacts of a certain innovation. Environmental assessment of technologies is usually carried out when they have been already launched in the market. As a result, reoriention of the technological development towards better environmental performance in the later stages of Research and Development (R&amp;D) becomes more complicated. Anticipatory Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been developed as a framework to assess the environmental impacts of new technologies by exploring possible paths of the technological development. The thesis project demonstrates the application of Anticipatory LCA for the analysis of the innovation at the early phase of R&amp;D. The aim of the following work is to guide the Netherlands Organization of Applied Scientific Research (TNO) coating innovation technology based on LCA impact results. The novel coating is being synthesized at laboratory scale and has a great potential to be launched in the market. The scenarios method was used to scale up the coating production process to pilot and industrial scales. The LCA results showed that the novel coating manufactured at industrial scale would have approximately the same environmental impacts as conventional coatings in the future. In this study, environmental impact of implementation of the new coating was studied with the help of Sensitivity analysis. Depending on feedstock and logistics, reductions could be achieved with respect to environmental impact while implementing the same innovation.","Life Cycle Assessment; scenario; coating technology; greenhouse glass; Netherlands","en","master thesis","","","","","","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology.","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Non-destructive testing is used to find cracks and determine their geometry. Lamb waves are applied to determine the presence of cracks in the tie rod and to estimate their positions. The cracks are located using eddy current testing. Finally the geometries of the cracks are determined using active infrared thermography. Experimental testing in the field of fracture mechanics is done to determine the fracture toughness of wrought iron. Combining the geometry of the crack with the fracture toughness of the material, leads to an estimation of the critical crack size.<br/><br/>The tie rods are made of wrought iron. The material properties are very heterogeneous. A tie rod is made out of multiple wrought iron bars of 1-1.5 meters. These bars are welded together under an angle of 27°. Cracks of two damaged tie rods are found to be under such an angle. The search for cracks will be concentrated on inclined cracks with a repetition of 1-1.5 meters. <br/>Lamb waves is the first technique applied. An ultrasonic tomograph A1040 MIRA is used for testing. The modelling of Lamb waves travelling in tie rods and the signal processing are based on the possibilities of the MIRA. The dispersion behaviour of Lamb waves is modelled to understand the wave propagation in tie rods and the influence it has on the testing done with the MIRA. Using this knowledge, proper testing settings are found. Subsequently, signal processing is considered. The main objective of this part is to be able to identify cracks present in the tie rods. <br/><br/>The position of the cracks in the tie rod is determined using eddy current testing. Commercial eddy current probes are too sensitive to discontinuities to be applied to tie rods. Therefore, new probes are developed to overcome this drawback. Two probes are designed, both for the horizontal face and for the vertical face of the tie rod. The vertical face of the tie rods are best accessible. Therefore, on-site testing is done with the probe specially designed for that face.<br/><br/>Active infrared thermography is implemented to establish the geometry of the crack. A finite element analysis has been performed to model the propagation of heat through a tie rod. This is followed by experimental testing in the laboratory carried out on a broken tie rod. Finally, the results of the modelling and of the experimental testing are compared. <br/><br/>The last part has a fracture mechanical nature. The fracture toughness of the material is determined assuming both linear-elastic and elastic-plastic material behaviour. Also the fatigue behaviour is evaluated. The values obtained from experimental testing have been applied to a simplified model of the crack geometry to determine the critical crack size of the tie rod, for monotonic loading, and the threshold crack size, for cyclic loading. Fatigue life is predicted taking the threshold crack size as the initial crack size and the critical crack size as the final crack size. <br","Non-destructive testing; Fracture mechanics; wrought iron; structural assessment; Duomo di Milano; tie rods","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

In the recent past, video imagery has been used to analyze waves in terms of several hydrodynamic parameters and to indicate matching coastal features. Whereas these measurements have been acquired using static cameras mounted on large poles situated at beaches, this report exploits a recently developed method using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as a means to map coastal morphology. After recording aerial imagery in combination with several Ground Control Points (GCPs), several time series of georectified coastal images are compiled. Subsequently, for all of the points in a predefined grid, pixel intensities are stored throughout the time of the recording. Consequently, hydrodynamic data like wave celerity and phase are estimated, which in turn are used to invert water depths for every location in a predetermined area of interest using an algorithm called cBathy. Using reference measurements with an accuracy in the order of five centimeters, this report benchmarks the bathymetry as computed using the drone imagery by calculating the root mean squared error, the root mean squared error divided by the water depth and the mean error of three different sub areas within the area of interest. After calibrating parameters as used by the cBathy algorithm, it is shown that the best computation yielded a bathymetry with a root mean squared error of 0.37 meters for a total area of approximately 2500 square meters. It is also shown that the other datasets yield errors of approximately twice the error of the best dataset. It is shown that the total error can to a large extent be attributed to errors in the rectification part of the algorithm. The large errors and the large discrepancy between the errors make the method currently unsuitable for coastal monitoring purposes. Hence, before the UAV bathymetry mapping method is to replace traditional methods, more research should focus on standardizing the process and thereby decrease the variance between the errors of different datasets.","uav; drone; bathymetry mapping; computer vision; romete sensing; coastal engineering; video imagery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the effect of biotic factors on wave energy dissipation is small, the presence of a salt marsh indirectly affects wave attenuation. The salt marsh vegetation enhances sediment accumulation, which leads to a higher bottom profile elevation compared to the bare foreshore.

A potential candidate to replace these conventional systems is the lithium metal battery. However, replacing the anode of lithium-ion batteries with lithium (Li) metal comes with its own challenges. Safety concerns and capacity loss during cycling (discharge-charge) are caused by internal dendrite formation and infinite volume change of the Li metal. In this work, two different strategies have been explored to counter these issues:<br/> <br/>1. 3-dimensional metallic host for Li metal<br/>2. Surface layer deposition<br/> <br/>As the 3D metal host, a 3D porous nickel (3DPNi) substrate was used. It was fabricated in-house through a facile template-free electrodeposition process. Detailed electrochemical Li cycling tests were performed using a symmetric cell to investigate the performance of the substrate. Different aspects of the Li cycling like substrate structure and morphology, electrolyte modification (with LiNO3), kinetics of Li+ diffusion and the electrochemical impedance performance of the substrate were investigated. The 3DPNi substrate was also tested for its compatibility with sodium metal. To investigate the effect of surface layer deposits, atomic layer depositions (ALD) of Al2O3 and TiO2 were done on planar nickel substrates. Each of these were subjected to electrochemical Li cycling tests. <br/><br/>Our results show that the 3DPNi substrate can be effectively cycled with Li for up to 300 cycles at a capacity of 0.5 mAh⋅cm-2 and a current rate of 1 mA⋅cm-2. Increasing the capacity to 3 mAh⋅cm-2 (6 times) at the same current rate resulted in up to 60 cycles. It was also found out that this substrate could be used for sodium metal cycling. ALD on planar substrates have enabled the Li metal to be cycled for more than 300 cycles without failure, albeit at a capacity of 0.25 mAh⋅cm-2 and a current rate of 0.125 mA⋅cm-2. Hence, our study confirms that both the methods significantly improve the performance of the lithium (and sodium) metal anodes.","Lithium metal battery; dendrite formation; atomic layer deposition; 3D porous nickel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-31","","","","","",""

For 3D intra-cardiac-echography technical borders are reached since blood vessel size limits the dimensions of the array. This dimensional limitation lowers lateral resolution. To solve part of the problem, non conventional ways of lateral resolution improvements are needed. For linear arrays R. Reeg [1] proposed null subtraction imaging (NSI), which resulted at best in 30 dB lower side lobes and a width reduction of up to 25 times for the main lobe. This is a non-linear image processing technique based on implementing multiple apodizations in post-processing. Three images are made from which one has a sharp drop to zero in the middle which can be exploited by subtracting it from the other images. This results in a improvement over a regular apodization scheme.<br/>To verify the technique for 2D phased array imaging, simulations are done using Field-II [2, 3] while taking array dimension into account. Measurements take place on an artiﬁcial phantom with evenly spaced line scatter targets. For the experiment a P4-l phased array transducer was used in combination with a Verasonics Vantage 256TMwhere a sub-aperture of 30 elements is used. The experiment is done on a CIRS 040GSE Phantom, where evenly spaced line scatter targets and lateral resolution targets are looked at. To form an image a simple delay-and-sum (DAS) algorithm was used. The eﬀect of NSI on the speckle in an image is also measured, where for normal developed speckle a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 1.91 is expected. Results for simulation were as expected with an average beamwidth reduction of 22.5 times and on average higher main lobe to side lobe ratio (MSR) of 33.4 dB for NSI imaging opposed to using a rectangular apodization. Experimentally an average beamwidth reduction of 5 times and an on average higher MSR of 20.5 dB are realised. The beamwidth reduction is lower then expected, this is due to rounding errors in the DAS algorithm, where data can only be delayed by integer elements. For the lateral scatter targets no extra targets can be distinguished when using NSI imaging opposed to rectangular apodization imaging, only the targets that where already visible show reduction in beamwidth and side lobe levels. When using NSI speckle SNR is reduced from 1.78 to on average 0.50 and seems to scale with energy present in the image. An hybrid image between the NSI image and rectangular apodization image is made to solve this. It results in reduced beamwidth, restored speckle SNR but the MSR is reduced. It can be concluded that the method works for phased array imaging under perfect conditions, the simulation. To get the full potential of the technique more research is needed towards the eﬀects of improper sampling. Which in this case resulted in less then ideal ’sharp’ drops, lowering the reduction in beamwidth. Also the reduced speckle needs further research to understand it well. Once this is all achieved the next step to 3D imaging can be made.","Medical; Transducers; Beamforming","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The outcrop near the village of Echternach is characterised by two rock types visible as horizontal beds<br/>and lenses: one well cemented and a less cemented sandstone. The less cemented zones tend to be better resistant to weathering and this causes the less cemented rock to overhang the cemented rock. The cemented zones have been cemented with calcite crystals and minor amounts of quartz cement.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","A new concept in the field of air-based contactless positioning has been explored. The concept is based on the variation of the outlet restriction of an actuator, which controls a net air flow starting from the inlet. The object to be positioned ‘floats’ on a thin air film with a thickness in the order of tens of micrometres. Since the film thickness between actuator and object is limited and around a factor thousand smaller than the size of an actuator it can be modelled with the Reynolds equation. Combining an actuator pin, with a flat top surface and an air flow inlet in the middle, and a plate, with a hole slightly larger in diameter than the pin, creates the core of the actuator setup. Air flows from the inlet over the surface and exits through the gap between hole and actuator pin. A relative movement of the pin with respect to the hole varies the continuous outlet restriction surrounding the pin and thus the net air flow. This net air flow actuates the object due to the viscous forces of the flowing air. An actuator has been made with seven pin/hole combination and an average gap width equal to fifty micrometres, meaning that the outlet was also modelled using the Reynolds equation. Since the actuator was designed for the positioning of thin substrates with negligible weight, the average pressure in the gap between actuator and object should be around ambient pressure. This means vacuum pressure is connected to the outlet and high pressure is connected to the inlet. The created setup was able to actuate a flying object in all planar directions. The numerical model has partially been validated with measurements. It is likely that the differences between model and measurements are caused by manufacturing tolerances and inaccurate measurements.","Contactless positioning; Thin film; Outlet restriction; Air bearing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

(mentor); Lissone, Mike (mentor); Mitici, M.A. (graduation committee); Elham, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The popularity of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) is growing at an increasing rate as an alternative to manned aviation for different purposes and applications. So far, most of their operations have been of military character, but the demand for civil and commercial applications is growing exponentially. RPAS have been allowed to operate in segregated airspace by restricting other users from entering the volume associated to the operation of the RPAS. This temporary solution based on accommodating their operations on a case-by-case basis is not feasible on the long-term. Moreover, the latest forecast carried out by SESAR Joint Undertaking (SJU) reveals that by 2050 RPAS will represent 20% of the fleet. The available airspace is a scarce resource and is already saturated, which means that additional unmanned operations would not be possible<br/>simultaneously. Integration in non-segregated airspace is the only manner in which the full benefits and capabilities of RPAS will be achieved, while maintaining the same levels of safety and efficiency as manned aviation.<br/><br/>In order to achieve a safe, efficient and transparent integration, a common regulatory framework and new technologies are currently under investigation. However, neither operational nor performance standards of RPAS integration have been addressed properly. For that reason, this project is focused on the development of a methodology to determine minimum operational and performance requirements by assessing the impact of RPAS operations on the Air Traffic Management (ATM) Network. The scope is limited to the en-route phase as a starting point since none of the flight phases have been analysed yet. This project is carried out in collaboration with EUROCONTROL. <br/><br/>RPAS are well known for presenting a wide range of performance characteristics, especially in terms of cruise speed and rate of climb. Thus, two different unmanned performance models have been chosen from the available performance models in the EUROCONTROL database: RP01 (MQ-9), which presents a similar performance to commercial aviation aircraft, and RP02 (RQ4A), which is considered a low-performance<br/>RPAS in terms of cruise speed and rate of climb. Building on a base scenario in the Paris Control Terminal Area (CTA),Monte Carlo simulations of the air traffic have been performed in order to randomly vary the main input variable: the set of en-route flights that is substituted by unmanned aircraft. Two different scenarios have been analysed separately in order to establish the requirements: one for same-performance RPAS, and the<br/>other for low-performance RPAS. In order to assess the impact, three different Key Performance Areas (KPAs) have been selected: capacity, efficiency and safety. These KPAs are in turn characterized by their corresponding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), namely sector capacity, sector overload, flight time efficiency, flight path efficiency and number of potential conflicts.<br/><br/>Based on an analysis of the current occupancy of the flight levels, operational requirements are defined in terms of altitude segregation. RPAS are not allowed to operate in the most occupied flight levels (FL): from FL300 to FL400. Therefore, depending on their operation and performance characteristics (i.e. ceiling), they will adapt their cruise FL to operate below FL300 or above FL400. The optimal value of performance requirements for same-performance RPAS has been found to be a minimum cruise speed of 390 kts, while for low-performance RPAS this minimum cruise speed is of 280 kts. Additionally, for low-performance RPAS, it is found that the rate of climb of 1,000 fpm results in the best performing case when changes in FL are required.<br/><br/>The results show that the values of the key performance indicators for the base scenario are difficult to reach when RPAS are sharing the airspace. However, the establishment of minimum operational and performance requirements contributes to a significant reduction of the negative impact that the integration of RPAS operations implies.<br/><br/>The development of this methodology and its application to the characteristics of each airspace sector will contribute to the full integration of RPAS in non-segregated airspace.","RPAS; Integration; Performance requirements; Operational Requirements; Non-segregated airspace","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-07-13","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Evaluating system aging through circuit simulations is very complex and time consuming. In this thesis, a framework is proposed, which allows for the evaluation of long-term aging effects of ICs and the corresponding measures to counteract premature failure. The focus of this work lies in the abstraction of low-level aging models to system-level models, in order to facilitate swift high-level simulation, without any knowledge of underlying circuit dynamics. Two major aging mechanisms, namely Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) and Channel Hot Carrier (CHC) degradation are considered for analysis. System-level aging management is performed with the prototype of a System-on-Chip (SoC) including a Management Unit (MU), which counteracts aging by employing Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS), Dynamic Frequency Scaling (DFS), and Adaptive Body Biasing (ABB). The simulation platform prototype is based on System-C AMS and a 65-nm technology library. This SoC simulation computes path delay using characterized models, which represent the aged behaviour of individual circuit elements. Results show that the obtained values are within 2% of circuit-level simulation values at the cost of a simulation time which is 15x lesser than conventional circuit simulators (e.g. Cadence NCSim).","System-level aging; IC lifetime; NBTI; CHC; Dynamic voltage scaling; Dynamic frequency scaling; Adaptive Body Bias","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Antonakas, Panagiotis (mentor); Metrikine, A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","With the conversion of a heavy transport vessel into a crane vessel, Boskalis aims to strengthen its position in the offshore wind and decommissioning markets. The BOKALIFT 1, as the crane vessel will be named, is equipped with a 3,000 tonne crane and a class-2 Dynamic Positioning system. In order to utilise its exceptional large and strong deck area to its full extend, the crane is installed amidships at the starboard side of the vessel. Offshore lifts are consequently performed in transverse direction of the vessel, resulting in a large heeling moment during the lift operation. As the conversion is currently ongoing no operational experience has been gained yet. This thesis is therefore an assessment on the behaviour of this new asset and the crane loads during a lifting operation close to the maximum crane capacity. This is the case for a single-lift decommissioning operation, lifting a topside from a jacket support structure.<br/><br/>Two transient phenomena can occur throughout the decommissioning operation: snap loads and impact loads. Both phenomena cause large peaks in the crane loads. Snap loads occur in the rigging lines during the pre-tensioning. During this phase the rigging lines become taut and the motions of the crane hook are constrained. Impact loads can occur during the final lift phase of the topside. This phase is estimated to last several minutes and is driven by the capacity of the dedicated anti-heeling system. Its purpose is to compensate the large heeling moments. Since this operation will last multiple wave periods, the wave induced motion at the crane tip causes tension variations in the hoisting system. When this tension exceeds the required lift tension the topside is temporary lifted, with impact loads as a result.<br/><br/>An OrcaFlex model is built to perform time domain simulations of the pre-tensioning and lift phases of the decommissioning operation for several irregular sea states. For both phases, a crane load comparison is conducted for two different lifting schemes. In the first scheme the hoisting speed is dictated by the anti-heeling system in order to maintain even-keel conditions. This is favourable for the operation limits. For the second scheme this is disregarded and the maximum hoist speed is applied. The latter is expected to reduce the duration where impact loads are present.<br/><br/>In the pre-tensioning phase, the higher hoisting speed results in a larger amplitude of the load variation since the snap loads are dictated by the relative velocity of the crane hook. During the lift phase, the higher hoisting speed reduces the time during which impact loads occur and thereby also reduces the crane loads. However, the topside motions are significantly increased. The crane tip- and topside motions have shown to be the limiting criteria for the lift operation. Limiting the topside motions by bumpers, guides or extra tugger lines can increase the workability for sea states where the peak period is close to the vessels natural heave and pitch period. Conclusively this thesis shows that the BOKALIFT 1 is a very well-suited vessel for offshore decommissioning operations.","Decommissioning; Heavy Lift Vessel; Transient operation; Snap loads; Impact loads","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-11","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering | Bottom Founded Structures, Arctic and Wind","",""

There are multiple systems that all work integrally. Some of these systems need to be placed together, others need to be separated and some systems probably need to be both at the same time for different objectives. The preliminary ship design phase is all about finding the balance between these objectives and possibilities within the arrangement. Automated general arrangement generation methods, such as the TU Delft pack- ing approach and IECEM, have created an algorithm and methodology that are able to generate thousands of feasible ship designs corresponding to the desired requirements. These approaches combine a bin-packing and a genetic algorithm in order to create a diverse set of possible designs. Although optimisation approaches can efficiently generate and search for a set of designs, it can not automatically select a design, van Oers et al. (2008). Out of the cloud of generated designs, choosing and evaluating those designs that are of most interest seems to be a more difficult task, DeNucci et al. (2008). Human rationale deems necessary to decide what properties of an arrangement can be analysed as “good” or “bad”. Using computational force to assist with design selection based on qualitative properties needs a way of capturing this rationale, which is demon- strated by DeNucci. Subsequently, this captured knowledge needs to be applied in a methodology to actually analyse the data by this rationale.<br/><br/>Design selection of computer generated arrangements is currently based upon performance parameters fo- cusing on numerical characteristics of the designs. Spatial relations within the interior layout can now only be manually analysed, which is merely possible for a singular design. This results in a lack of understanding of spatial and physical relationships, or qualitative properties, within the designed arrangement. This thesis proposes a method that is able to quantitatively compare these qualitative properties by creating a measure of effectiveness of the interior layout, or arrangement, of the designs. This is done by creating a simplified representation of the 3D arrangements using network theory.<br/><br/>By converting system objects and connections of these systems into nodes and edges, a mathematical net- work description of the arrangement is possible. Using eigenvector and betweenness centrality measures, rank and weights are given to these system objects. Design rules based upon rationale captured by DeNucci are set up and used to analyse connections between these systems. A scoring algorithm is created that is able to combine the ranks of the systems with the captured rationale to give a singular performance parameter, or measure of effectiveness of the interior layout characteristics of the designs. Application of this method to a data set of small cruise ship designs shows the capabilities of this methodology and the ability to quantita- tively compare the qualitative properties of these designs.<br/><br/>A data set of over 20,000 cruise ship designs created by the TU Delft packing approach is analysed by the use of the method. This demonstrates that the proposed method can be used on an entire data set allowing design selection based on the quality of the provided arrangements. The proposed method can be used to filter the data set of those arrangements whose quality seems to be too poor to be taken into account in design selection. Having these arrangements in the data set is still necessary, as this allows the genetic algorithm to create enough diversity within the design space. The proposed method can find specific physical properties of the arrangements and should lead to improved design space exploration of layout features of the generated designs.<br/><br/>Capturing the quality of the design into a single measure of effectiveness brings problems as well. It allows the possibility of direct comparison of a large number of designs, but does not relate back to why designs score differently. Splitting design rules into different design objective scores, and possibly summing this later, could allow the designer to relate back to the design rationale and why a design scores better or worse. This would lead to more understanding of possibilities and problems within the proposed arrangements.","General Arrangements; Network Theory; Network; Packing Approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells based on the polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) passivating contact is becoming one of the most promising solar cell structures that enable high efficiency due to the minimization of metal contact recombination. The interdigitated back contact (IBC) crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells based on poly-Si passivating contacts is investigated in this thesis. The optimization of IBC solar cells with poly-Si passivating contacts, in this work, is focused on two aspects: (1) the enhanced passivation of poly-Si passivating contacts, and (2) the optimized front surface passivation. The optimization of poly-Si passivating contacts is investigated from the following three aspects: (1) the implantation dose of poly-Si as back surface field (BSF) and emitter, (2) the annealing condition to the ion-implanted poly-Si, and (3) the formation of tunnel oxide. Experimental results, obtained with symmetrical test structures, show that the J0 for n-type poly-Si samples achieved 4.5 fA/cm2 with implied VOC higher than 730 mV. For p-type poly-Si samples, J0 is 12.9 fA/cm2 and implied VOC is 714 mV. The optimization of front surface is achieved by optimizing the front surface field (FSF) ion-implantation dose and the passivation layers with double-sided textured n-type float zone wafers with symmetrical structure. The optimized J0 for the FSF, implanted with the dose of 1×〖10〗^14/〖cm〗^2, is as low as 6.5 fA/cm2 which is covered by a-Si:H/SiNX stack. The deposition conditions for a-Si:H and SiNX are 22nm at 250 °C and 75 nm at 400 °C, respectively. After the application of above mentioned improvements, the efficiency of our IBC poly-Si passivating contacts solar cells has reached 21.9% for 9 cm2 cell and 22.5% for 0.72 cm2 cell. Meanwhile, the highest FF of 83.2% achieved with 0.72 cm2 cell shows the high efficiency potential of our solar cells.","IBC crystalline silicon solar cell; poly-crystalline silicon passivating contact; tunneling oxide; ion-implantation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-11","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Sustainable Energy Technology","","Photovoltaic Material and Device","",""

(mentor)","2017","Scoliosis is a three-dimensional deformity of the spine most prevalent in adolescent females. As the etiology is often unknown, treatment focusses on preventing curve progression and ranges from observation for mild cases to brace treatment and eventually surgery for the worst cases. This report consists of three different studies, which are aimed to develop a patient specific method to improve the efficacy of brace treatment for scoliosis patients. The first study consists of a literature review of applications of the Finite Element Method (FEM) in scoliosis research, with a focus on brace treatment. It is concluded that the finite element method has great potential to improve both surgical and brace treatment. However, it has only been applied in a few commercially available braces. Current methods are still quite inaccurate, and thus recommendations are made to improve the quality of FEM models. The second study aims to establish the forces experienced by spinal implant rods during intra-operative scoliosis correction, in order to validate and improve an existing FEM model of the scoliotic spine. The forces that were found were inconclusive, due to various measurement uncertainties. Therefore, validation of the FEM model based on this data was not possible. However, recommendations were made to improve the study, such that conclusive results should be found. In the final study a patient-specific FEM model of the scoliotic spine is developed and simulated to establish the location, magnitude and direction of force application for optimal curve correction. By varying the angle of the thoracic force vector over a 180° range in the transverse plane, the curve correction was established for these angles for four patients. The influence of the lumbar force on curve correction was found to be minimal. An optimization algorithm was subsequently employed to more establish the optimal force direction. The algorithm allowed more variables to be evaluated on a smaller scale, while maintaining a low computational cost. From the three studies it is concluded that FEM models of the spine can be a valuable addition to scoliosis studies. However, spinal behaviour is complex, and many elements such as material properties and interpersonal variation in stiffness remain unknown.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","Tissue Biomechanics and Implants","",""

Refineries are mature industrial installations, however, unplanned shutdowns still occur due to equipment failures. Refineries have petabytes of process control data available from the past years, however, all of that data is unla- belled. The goal of this research project was to evaluate, whether useful information can be extracted from the process control data. The resulting approach had to be compatible with Shell IT, scalable to larger sections of the refinery, reusable in other parts of the refinery and capable of detecting the components that cause the potential faults. During this research project, multiple solutions based on artificial neural net- works and statistical approaches were implemented to model the normal behaviour of the monitored systems. Abnormal predictions for the modelled systems were then used to predict failures in advance, where the prediction horizon reached more than a month for some use cases. 4-layer GRUs with tanh activation functions and an input sequence length of 4 samples provided the best results. GRUs were 7% faster to train than LSTMs while reducing the prediction error by 15%. Furthermore, the predic- tion error was less than 3% for the normal operating conditions while reaching more than 15% prior to failures. Therefore, machine learning models can predict failures in petrochemical refineries without any industry-specific knowledge, if the model is trained with clean data that does not contain abnormal time series.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Coastal regions are therefore facing the threat of such events causing damage to dike-positioned structures and buildings. Research in this filed is often conducted using scaled-down 2D hydraulic physical models, which introduces so called scale effects that can bias the results with regard to measured wave-structure impact forces. This thesis therefore attempts to determine the effects of scaling for post-overtopping wave impacts. To achieve this, large scale physical modelling tests were conducted at Deltares’ Delta flume and compared with a small scale model of similar configuration. A second thesis aim stems from the application of measurement devices in an innovative manner while conducting the large scale tests, and their applicability is assessed here. <br/>The model comparison shows that in general the small scale test performs very similarly to its large scale counterpart, and scaling effects did not appear to bias the impact events considerably. This was also observed for the pre-impact flow evolution, where the wave interference mechanisms and resulting bore characteristics were also largely similar. The force-time signal for the largest impacts also is related to the pre-impact mechanisms observed. Classification of the extreme bore impacts according to their impact peak ratio did outline a discrepancy between the two models, which was also linked to the difference in entrapped air pocket impacts.<br/>The four measurement instruments assessed are a Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS), waterproof action camera(s), optical phase detection probe (OPDP) and a high speed camera mounted behind an opening in the impacted wall. Data from the former two was also used in this analysis and their performance was determined to be good.<br","physical modelling; wave impacts; scale effects; Froude scaling; overtopping; storm wall; impact force; post-overtopping flow; terrestrial lease scanner; , measurement techniques; bore impacts; pre-impact flow evolution; CoMEM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

This has introduced continuous modifications to the natural characteristics of these coastal regions by means of coastal structures and engineering interventions. The design of such coastal structures has evolved significantly since the first quarter of the XXth Century, when more scientific design methods and formulae were developed. Nevertheless, further research is required given the stochastic nature of the environmental loads involved, the remaining uncertainties regarding the response of these structures to the applied loads and the growing impacts of climate change and sea level rise. Four knowledge gaps are identified regarding the “Damage assessment of coastal structures in climate change adaptation”. Based on these, the objectives of this thesis are summarized as follows. First, climate change adaptation: demand for validated upgrading alternatives. Second, damage characterization concepts: demand for unified damage characterization concepts. Third, damage characterization parameters: demand for universal and more accurate damage characterization parameters. Fourth, damage characterization measuring techniques: demand for validating the suitability of innovative survey methods. These knowledge gaps are addressed using physical modelling results from two test campaigns (UPorto deep water and Deltares shallow water tests. In consequence, this study includes the validation of the damage criteria required for a precise assessment of a coastal structure (second knowledge gap), the validation of an universal damage parameter for rubble mound structures (third knowledge gap), the validation of the benefits of innovative measuring techniques when carrying out physical modelling tests (fourth knowledge gap) and the validation of upgrading alternatives for climate change scenarios (first knowledge gap). Thus, it can be stated that with these definitions, parameters and measuring techniques, a complete method for damage characterization of coastal structures is presented. It was also defined how this damage characterization method can be used to precisely and accurately describe the damage to conventional and non-conventional coastal structures. Furthermore, this method was also used to describe the effects of not only current environmental forces acting on the structures but also future and more energetic scenarios. For such future scenarios, adaptation alternatives for coastal structures were evaluated and berm configurations are recommended for their upgrading. Future research is needed in order to evaluate, adjust and generalize the conclusions made in this thesis, considering additional structure configurations and environmental loading conditions.","damage assessment; coastal structures; physical modelling; climate change adaptarion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

In order to understand the rocking behavior and validate the previously conducted research CUR C70 (1989) wave flume test has been conducted in similar setup. One of the important parameter of rocking behavior is the magnitude of impact velocity and the distribution of this impact velocity stochastically and spatially. This research investigates the order of the magnitude of the impact velocity and distribution of the impact velocity comparing, validating and concluding new findings those were not incorporated in CUR C70 (1989) research.<br/><br/>During this research a new type of sensor Tinyduino has been used inside a cube to measure the acceleration and angular velocity of the cubes. Eight of these sensors were used in eight different cubes. All the sensors were tested properly in Deltares to check the sensors working properly and better understanding the sensors. Before this research two test programs were performed by Deltares in tetrapod in double layer using this Tinyduino sensor in stand alone mode but the data were not analyzed. This research analyzed the data for the tetrapods provided by Deltares and compared with CUR 70 (1989). During this analysis and the testing of the sensors it is found that angular velocity measurement can be much more reliable than acceleration hence the angular velocity measurement is used during data processing of instrumented cubes in double layer. <br/><br/>For experiments eight instrumented cubes were placed using very flexible wire in a randomly placed double layer cubes with same size and almost similar density over a permeable filter layer. The slope 1:1.5 is used for the experiment same as the CUR C70 (1989) research conducted. The cubes were placed in one constant level but the water level is varied in order to demonstrate different slope position. Three slope position Y/Dn=0, Y/ Dn =-2 and Y/ Dn =-4 is used during the research program. Three different wave heights and two wave steepness were used during this test program. Due to time limitation 18 test setups within two days were performed. The data were collected real-time using wire and saved in text file simultaneously with eight instrumented cubes stored in a laptop provided by Deltares.<br/><br/>After the test program all the data is processed with matlab script and analyzed. The result of the analysis showed that the order of the magnitude of impact velocities is same as the CUR C70 (1989) research. It has also been found that the impact velocities are also dependent on the wave steepness which was not included in the CUR C70 (1989) research. So it is recommended for future work to update the equation incorporating wave steepness. Another important parameter is number of collision which was assumed to be 3 times is CUR C70 (1989) but found incorrect during this thesis. It is concluded that number of collision is dependent wave height, wave steepness, position over slope and also exposure to wave attack. It is also found that the number of collision is continuous during wave attack after a certain impact velocity. <br/><br/>One of the finding of CUR 70 (1989) was the location of maximum impact velocity over slope. It was concluded in CUR 70 (1989) that the maximum impact velocity lies on Y/Dn=0 meaning on the water level but during this research all the sample those worked observed that the maximum impact velocity is located on Y/Dn =-2 over the slope under the water level. <br/><br/>For future research work it is recommended to use different types of armor unit in single layer to understand the rocking behavior and also it is recommended using the Tinyduino sensors which provides accurate data on movement of the armor units. <br","CoMEM; Coastal Engineering; Breakwater; Armor Unit; Rocking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

The pressure reduction on the landward wall of the caisson due to non-aeration of the overflowing jet gives rise to an additional horizontal force which increases the sliding force. The estimation of this additional horizontal force and the proper understanding of the physical processes which cause it are imperative in establishing stability of a caisson breakwater during tsunami overtopping.<br/>Tsunami is associated with accelerating flows with massive heads that results in detached overflow nappes. In this research, a simplified tsunami was modelled in the laboratory as a steady breakwater overflow and the respective pressure drop behind the overflow nappe is derived. The nappe trajectories are derived theoretically based on general projectile motion for both the aerated and non-aerated scenarios. This ballistic model is validated using measurements of the physical model. For the aerated nappe, the theoretical results and measurements are in agreement. For the non-aerated nappe, the ballistic model provides comparatively high deviations from the measured nappe. A sensitivity analysis of pressure reduction indicates the deviations can be attributed to the derived pressure drops.<br/>In addition, the governing physical processes related to caisson breakwater overflowing are investigated. The flow conditions below the overflow nappe are hydrostatic, which is implied by a time-averaged stationary water level below the nappe. The dynamic pressure arising from the stagnation pressure at the jet impingement on the flume bed is estimated and is compared with the pressure drop behind the nappe. The results suggest the above-mentioned dynamic pressure is negligible with respect to the pressure drop. Thus, it is concluded that the governing mechanism responsible for the pressure reduction is the air entrainment process during jet impingement. The air entrainment rate from the cavity behind the nappe is compared against the impinging velocity of the overflow jet. The results suggest that air entrainment rate increases with increasing jet impingement velocity, establishing the fact that higher inertia forces leads to rapid air entrainment. <br/>The ratio of additional horizontal force due to non-aeration to the total horizontal force is found to be between 0.15 and 0.25. However, some eccentricities are evident with extreme tail water depths and flow rates. Scaled-up forces are obtained using Froude scaling criteria. Reynolds numbers suggest that the flow is fully turbulent at both the lab and field scales, while Weber numbers show that surface tension effects might be more pronounced in the lab than in the field. <br/>As surface tension effects may affect the direct scaling up of model tests to field scale, the utility of numerical model simulations is apparent. In OpenFOAM, the k-epsilon turbulence model with the InterFoam solver is used for this purpose. Prior to investigating the validity of OpenFOAM to simulate the caisson overflowing scenario, the model is validated for open channel flow. The results indicate that OpenFOAM correctly simulates the open channel flow with respect to the logarithmic profile and the free-surface slope. Furthermore, simulation of the flow atop the caisson very closely matches that of the physical laboratory model test. The model results for nappe behaviour follows existing trends found in literature. The simulated overflow nappe is a clinging nappe rather than a detached one due to the inability of the 2D model to allow air into the void behind the nappe. <br/>The significance of the present study has various aspects. The ballistic model enables the derivation of the nappe’s trajectories during steady overflow of a caisson breakwater. As a result, an explicit relationship between kinematics (ballistics) and dynamics (forces) can be developed. The estimation of the additional horizontal force due to non-aeration effects pave the way to improve design guidelines for the stability of caisson breakwaters during tsunami overtopping. <br","Caisson breakwater; Tsunami; Additional horizontal force; Overflow nappe; OpenFOAM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

Delfi-C3 is a triple-unit CubeSat with a mass of 2.4 kg, developed by Delft University of Technology, which was launched on April 28th in 2008. Despite of its required lifetime of less than four months, Delfi-C3 is still operational and has been beaconing data for 8.6 years, which makes this CubeSat mission unique in terms of a continuous record of telemetry data. Recent inspections of Delfi-C3 telemetry data over five years from different temperature sensors have revealed surprisingly systematic patterns of periodic nature with an amplitude of 3.1 K and a period of one synodic year. First speculations associated this behavior to be correlated to the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. An analytical model of the temperature fluctuations has been established which associates the amplitude, phase and period of the observed temperature to the eccentricity, the argument of periapsis, and the period of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun, respectively. This analysis represented the first attempt to reconstruct the Earth’s orbit from satellite temperature measurements. To quantitatively estimate the Earth orbit parameters from in-flight telemetry data, a numerical least-squares estimator has been developed and applied to Delfi-C3 temperature data over the period 2008-2015. Preliminary results by using temperature data from the On Board Computer (OBC) Printed Circuit Board already showed that the estimated semi-major axis, eccentricity, and argument of periapsis of the Earth orbit differ from the true values of less than 1%, 3%, and 5%, respectively. An additional filtering of raw data further demonstrated that the achievable accuracy of the estimation can be refined up to better than 0.05%, 2% and 2.5%, respectively. In this thesis, the sensitivity of those results to initial conditions, filtering schemes and estimator settings are addressed. Furthermore, a refined analytical thermal model is created for<br/>Delfi-C3 internal stack, in order to check if a comparable accuracy can be obtained also for other instruments that are less sensitive to external temperature fluctuations, in cases where the internal dissipation requires a better representation of the thermal paths in the internal stack.<br/>In addition to the above analysis, the attitude determination systemon board Delfi-C3 is also reviewed by analyzing the telemetry data fromthe AutonomousWireless Sun Sensor (AWSS) and from the four photodiodes<br/>located on the deployable solar panels. By adopting an analytical model for the Earth albedo, the possibility of retrieving a three-axis attitude determination from these simple sensor is assessed for the case on hand. This<br/>ismade bymonitoring the influence of the albedo termon the determination accuracy for several periods in Delfi-C3 telemetry. It is expected that this analysis will contribute to the understanding of the accuracies of a coarse three-axis attitude determination that makes use of only Sun sensors. Furthermore, the results can be used to determine key factors in the hysteretic process in-orbit, which occur when a PassiveMagnetic Attitude<br/>Stabilization (PMAS) is chosen, by comparing the analytical models for the satellite dynamics with the in-orbit attitude obtained from the deterministic method herewith reviewed. This is expected to contribute to a better understanding and improvement of models used in the design of future CubeSat missions.","Delfi-C3; Thermal behaviour; Attitude Determination; Estimation Theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

They have developed a modular headphone, which they provide to customers as a subscription. Customers pay a monthly or yearly fee for the use of the headphone, which entitles them to free repairs and upgrades over time. The company has been growing steadily but too slow to become a sustainable business. One of the challenges they face is that need a better understanding of their customers in order to effectively build a brand and grow their business. The following assignment was therefore formulated for this thesis:<br/> <br/>Refine and validate Gerrard Street’s target segment and redesign its touchpoints with Gerrard Street.<br/> <br/>The analysis focused on creating a clear definition of Gerrard Street’s most important customer segment and on repositioning the brand. The synthesis and final design demonstrate how this should be implemented within Gerrard Street’s service through the design of a touchpoint.<br/> <br/>Refining the target segment<br/>Through a analysis of Gerrards Street’s internal environment was found that their business model is still in the early phases of adoption. It was therefore decided that Gerrard Street should focus their energy on targeting early adopters to build a strong brand before going after the early majority. The literature helped with describing the early adopters of services as young, well educated, having a high social status and do not mind taking risks. Customer research was used to develop a deeper understanding of the early adopters of Gerrard Street’s headphone service. Qualitative exploration through interviews provided direction for the target segment. A survey is used to sharpen that direction and to test some of the insights gathered during the qualitative research. Based on the customer research the target segment is described as:<br/> <br/>Young educated men that live in an urban area, who listen to music at every opportunity and use music as a social connector, he values progress and change and works toward self-fulfillment. The need for self-fulfillment is divided into three sub audiences that Gerrard Street can use for specific targeting: <br/> <br/>The passionate musician looking for musical fulfillment<br/>The young achiever looking for Professional fulfillment <br/>The Sporty lifestyle looking for Athletic fulfillment <br/> <br/>Repositioning the brand<br/>Gerrard Street’s mission is: “We will take the next step towards a circular economy by developing circular consumer electronics” Gerrard Street noticed that the market for people that are into the circular economy and headphone is too small. Therefore it is decided that they should demonstrate that the circular economy benefits the consumer more that traditional solutions, instead of focusing on the environmental image of their service. <br/> <br/>The headphone market, the competitive landscape and the environment of the consumers has been explored. Headphones have transformed from rather technical devices to lifestyle products. This led to many new entrants and a highly fragmented market, making it difficult to Stand out. Gerrard Street is competing in this market based on product form for a premium price with fewer features than its competitors. They also lack a specific lifestyle or a strong legacy. It is therefore concluded that they should put the emphasis on developing their service, which is the main differentiator from the competition. Based on new the target segment and the findings of the analysis Gerrard Street has been repositioned as: <br/> <br/>Gerrard Street, the audio service for doers, not talkers, for users, not owners, that connect through music and desire a great sound, carefree.<br/> <br/>Five design principles were created that provide guidance on how to express the Gerrard Street brand: <br/>Be Bold Confidence - Outspoken - Direct - Unapologetic - Doers<br/>Why so serious? Surprising - Fun - Professionally avoiding Seriousness - Don’t speak your parents language<br/>Quality is usability Making sure that you can always enjoy great sound experience - Here to serve - All grown up - keeping you online <br/>Circular products are better For everyone, but especially for our customers - Smarter choice - no brainer - Modularity - Repair instead of waste<br/>Engaging - A relationship - join the gang - Steer towards conversation instead of statements - Customer community - Honest about taste<br/> <br/>Synthesis<br/>To implement the new positioning for the newly formed target segment a touchpoint strategy was created: Adding value through the service by delivering a personal and social experience. <br/>An analysis of Gerrard Street’s current customer journey map pinpointed how they should adapt their service in order to deliver the desired experience. Ideation sessions on these on these different phases were used to develop a desired customer journey that serves as a vision for the development of Gerrard Street’s service. Moments of truth were allocated to parts of the Desired Journey that were especially relevant for achieving this vision. The moment someone’s headphone breaks down has been selected as the moment of truth. The repair experience is truly unique for the Gerrard Street’s brand, since it is the moment where they deliver on their brand promise of providing a great sound carefree. <br/> <br/>The final design<br/>The moment someone's headphone breaks down is usually considered as a very negative experience. The repair experience has been designed to radically change the perception by providing a moment where negative energy becomes something great and sharable. The customer should feel empowered by fixing their headphone, since they do not have to throw it away. The aim of the design was to let the customer consciously experience this moment, providing positive feedback and adding extra satisfiers. The final design serves as an example for Gerrard Street on how they can implement the findings of this thesis.","Branding; Customer Research; Service Design; Marketing; Startup; Headphone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

The phenomenon of Drifters, migrants in Beijing, started to draw the attention of the whole society since the 1980s. Economic and political restrictions made the life adventures of Drifters hard enough.<br/><br/>This project aims to find alternative solutions towards overcrowding densities and housing shortage crisis in Paradise Gateway, Beijing.

Congestion can easily happen anywhere, especially at the peripheral of the city center, which is a clear sign of the overcrowding. Various measures towards congestion have been carried out, from the license-plate lottery to odd-and-even license plate control rule. There are rumors about tolls on ring road are going to be charged in the coming 2017. 'The song for the fifth ring' gains huge popularity among Citizens in Beijing, expressing the mixed feelings about the city's infrastructure. Another part of the motivation of this project is the attempt to reveal the primary cause of congestion in Beijing.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the project will aim toward counteracting the quality effects of the mega-residential communities in Beijing.

This is an attendant seat for TTL, which can be folded out into a resting facility with a leg rest and a reclined back rest. The OEM, the buyer of the C3CR, values durable products in a small space envelope. They implement the C3CR in the aircraft, when it is sold to an airline. The airline on its turn values small space so they can spend more space on the passengers. When the C3CR is out of use, it may not bother the process of in- and egress. Therefore, the product may have limited measurements when folded in. The end-user, the cabin crew members, need to rest during a break. In the flight, the blood pressure is lower, so the blood runs to their lower legs and feet, so when resting they want their legs up in the air. Further they want a feeling of security when seated, to prevent falling out. During TTL, they want to be able to work from their seat and sit sideward. <br/>The graduation company is an AIM, which want to add a high class C3CR to their product portfolio which outstands current and possible future competitors<br/>The comfort during resting is more important because this is experienced in a duration between 60 and 90 minutes.

The net is thin and forms to the back of the user. Together with curvature in the frame of the netted back rest, a comfortable back rest is formed, which will also decrease space when the product is folded in, because the seating compartment can be pressed in the net. To provide an ergonomic back rest during TTL, a lumbar support is pressed in the lower part of the back rest when it is positioned in the upright position. A division is made in active seating during TTL and passive seating during resting. The active seat has a sphere shape to encourage the user to move in the seat. This component can be folded out into a leg rest. When folding out a passive seat pan appears which has a flat mattrass-like surface. This passive seat pan can slide forward over a horizontal brace to recline the back rest. When the back rest reclines, the lumbar support will stay behind in the wall-mounted storage case because lumbar support is unergonomic in a reclined position. A research is done into the ideal angles of the back rest, seat pan and leg rest in a limited horizontal length. The results show the back rest should be positioned in an angle of 45 degrees, the passive seat pan in an angle of 15 degrees and the leg rest in an angle of 5 degrees, all to the horizontal.","Crew rest; Cabin crew members; Resting; TTL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

This tool automatically generates tens of thousands of ship designs in order to fully explore the design space. This is opposed to the traditional way of ship design, where just a limited number of designs can be elaborated. The result is a set of ship designs that can be used both to obtain initial sizing parameters of the ship, and to relate the impact of design decisions on performance characteristics.<br/><br/>It is questioned whether resulting sets of designs really contain tens of thousands of different ships, or just a couple of really different ships that have only minor variations. It is thus questioned whether such a set of ship designs can be divided into families. This is investigated in this thesis.<br/><br/>In order to attack this problem in a generic fashion, the ship designs were approached from a numerical perspective. It was found that in the field of data science, clustering algorithms exist which are devoted to find clustering structures in data. Therefore these techniques, such as PCA and k-means, were applied to data at hand. In a test case this method is applied to divide the set of designs from a mine countermeasures vessel into families. <br/><br/>First it was questioned whether families could be used in order to assess the survivability of machine systems of these ships. The resulting families matched the families regarding the position of the gun, which were already known upfront. Although these families are not sufficient to fully assess the survivability of these ships, this analysis showed that most probably no other structure is present, stimulating more straightforward definitions of families.<br/><br/>In a second test case the same MCMV was divided into families regarding the layout of the designs. It then appeared that the dataset at hand was built by ten distinct runs of the packing approach which were combined to this one total set. The method showed that it could be pointed out, just by looking at the designs, which design was generated in which run. This showed that the dataset might not be as diverse as it seems. Since it is the core idea for the packing approach to explore a big part of the design space, thus generating a diverse set of ship designs, this motivates new research to tackle this issue.<br","Design; Concept exploration; Packing Approach; Clustering algorithms; k-means; PCA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Being able to mitigate the erosion while simultaneously improving nature development is something that is increasingly strived for in coastal projects. This report utilizes the building with nature philosophy to explore integrated solutions for a coastal erosion problem in Negril, Jamaica. Erosion of the coast is threatening the many hotels and resorts along the beach near Negril. The hotel owners and the local community are looking for a sustainable solution to the erosion problem. The building with nature approach starts with the system in mind, not the intervention. First the cause of coastal erosion is better understood. A combination of factors is responsible of which the intensification of storm events and degradation of the environment are two of the main causes. A reduction of the sediment production rates could also have led to increased coastal erosion. Due to the lack of data in this phase of the project, the exact reason cannot be identified. Therefore, both scenarios are considered. From there, different solution strategies are explored and alternatives are identified. The strategies range from environmental solutions to soft, hard and hybrid solutions. These designs are simulated to understand their effectiveness by relative comparison. Alternatives that do not work as intended are excluded. The evaluation of the remaining alternatives shows what the strengths and weaknesses are of the different solution strategies. A social evaluation method is also applied to assess the applicability of this type of evaluation method and gain a broader perspective on the alternatives. If restoration of the natural sediment production leads to large production rates and a large improvement in overall environmental quality, then this solution strategy could be very positive. Nourishment strategies work well from a social and technical point of view but less ecologically. The nourishment strategies can be improved by adding environmental improvements to the alternatives. A hybrid solution has the potential to provide a positive effect on the technical, ecological as well as social aspects of Long Bay. However, this depends on the applicability of Reef Balls in breakwater designs and the effectiveness of coral transplantation. The BwN approach ensures that a wide range of solutions is considered. The results give more insight in the cause of the coastal erosion and possible solution strategies for Negril. Using the knowledge gained in this thesis, more detailed alternatives can be obtained in the future.","Hydraulic engineering; Coastal engineering; Sustainable; Building with nature; BwN; Jamaica; Coastal erosion; design; Artificial reef; Nourishment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","18.313285, -78.341661"

However, the placement of this unit is not always done as randomly as it should be and consequently, the stability of the armor is affected. In order to overcome this problem, Delta Marine Consultants is developing a new armor unit called Xbloc+ that has a regular placement. In this research, the hydraulic performance of version 1 and 2 of this block are analyzed. Small scale tests were performed in a 2D wave flume in order to analyze the damage, rocking and the (partially and fully) displacement of units. In total, 1 series of tests were performed with Xbloc+v1 and 6 series with Xbloc+v2. To analyze the influence of the wave steepness and the slope angle, three wave steepness were tested (Sop = 2%, 4% and 6%) and tests were conducted in two different slope angles (1:2 and 3:4). Each series is formed by several sub tests conducted with increasing wave heights (and wave period in order to maintain a constant wave steepness). Tests were carried out until the failure of the armor slope was reached in order to completely define the failure mechanism. Furthermore, tests after failure where also executed to further investigate the stability of the armor after the damage has started.<br/>Results obtained from the laboratory tests provided an overall understanding of how the Xbloc+ performs under certain conditions. It was perceived that the permeability of the armor layer is low as it happens often with single layer units. Thus, the pressure gradient between the underlayer and armor layer is significantly high creating an uplift pressure that leads to a revetment-like failure mechanism.<br/>Although the failure mechanism can be related to both slopes used during the laboratory tests, (3:4 and 1:2), the behavior of the armor layer differed completely between slopes. On a steeper slope, the armor layer remained undamaged for wave heights significantly higher than the design wave. However, once one unit was fully displaced, the damage was quite destructive.<br/>In contrast, on a milder slope, failure occurred much faster but the damage was not as aggressive. Moreover, after the failure was reached, the structure gained a new level of stability in which remained to provide shelter without reflecting significant damage.<br/>Furthermore, the wave height variation did not have much influence as the wave steepness. There was a noticeable difference between the performance of the structure during swell and wind waves. During swell waves, it could be seen that not only failure was achieved faster but it caused much more damage to the structure, while during wind waves the structure had a higher stability.","CoMEM; Breakwater; Xbloc+; Physical modelling; concrete units; stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

(mentor); Lourens, E. (mentor); Hoogendoorn, Bob (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Heerema Marine Contractors is building the world’s largest semi-submersible crane vessel ‘Sleipnir’. During the design phase of this vessel, model tests were performed to evaluate the hydrodynamic properties. In the model test, a significant roll motion at a period of 40s was found. Because this response is not within the range of first order wave excitation, it received great attention. Later, the 40s is proved to be the natural roll period of the vessel which can be excited by the difference frequency of the two first order wave components, thus it is called a 2nd order roll in this thesis. The aim of this thesis is to explain this phenomenon in a better way and to investigate whether this 2nd order roll identified in the model test will be a true problem in reality. In the first part of the thesis, the physical reasons for the existence of 2nd order roll as well as the methodology to quantify 2nd order roll are discussed. Besides the resonance effect, the nonlinear excitation is proved to be quite considerable and the damping ratio is low within the natural frequency range because of the ship’s shape features. For the nonlinear excitations, Quadratic Transfer Functions (QTF’s) are firstly calculated based on the Pinkster’s theory. The second order forces and moments are further simulated by three methods in both frequency domain and time domain, where the advantages and limitations of each method are discussed. For the damping, special attention is paid to the linearization method in the frequency domain and the application of Cummins’ equation in the time domain. The use of a cubic damping term is proposed to fix the inaccuracies of the current methods. Furthermore, the second order roll motion is simulated both in the frequency domain and time domain. All simulations are validated by comparing the results with the measured data from the model test. Multi-directional wave conditions are also simulated to make the methodology applicable in the real world. The second part of the thesis discusses an important phenomenon in the second order roll, i.e. the variance of the standard deviation of each simulation is quite large. The reasons for this phenomenon are the non-uniqueness in the excitation and the low damping ratio. Thus 2nd order roll should be predicted as a probability distribution instead of a specific value because it has a much larger variance compared to the first order motions. The sensitivity of the factors makes the model test and the real situation different, and the factors causing a difference in the real situation are discussed by an explanation of the physical reasons supported by simulations. In the third part, the discussion is moved on to the reality. The second order roll is identified from offshore measurements of the existing semi-submersible ‘Thialf’, in both the free floating and free hanging stage. It is further used to validate the simulation methodology and the discussed characteristics for 2nd order roll. In the end the operability of the Sleipnir is evaluated, and it is concluded that the 2nd order roll actually has a dominant contribution to the overall roll motion. However, with the 2nd order roll included, Sleipnir’s roll motion is still acceptable. The overall roll motion stays below a maximum amplitude of 0.5 degree in the normal operational sea states (HsTp2 &lt; 75). As mitigations, bilge keels, tuggers and DP systems are proposed for the 2nd order roll phenomenon.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-08-01","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Herder, P.M. (mentor); De Vries, Laurens (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Intermittent generation behaviour of wind and solar power units requires Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to activate balancing power to maintain a stable grid frequency. With the current strong growth in installed renewable energy capacity in The Netherlands, it is therefore expected that the volumes of activated balancing power will grow accordingly. In the Dutch balancing power market system, the activation of balancing power is remunerated against the highest activated balancing power bid in the respective time-block. Without a proportional increase in affordable balancing power bids, the economic costs of grid balancing in The Netherlands are expected to increase as a result. Imbalance power prices for positive balancing power, the counterbalancing of net shortages of power supply, may see a particularly strong rise, as the opportunity to quickly increase grid frequency places influential restrictions on the operation status of suitable power assets. <br/> The financial opportunities inherent to this trend have gained the attention of non-traditional suppliers of technical positive balancing power potential, amongst which the energy-intensive industry and greenhouse farmers. However, limited insight into the exact value potential of market participation, and contradictory developments in the German market are currently preventing these parties to invest in unlocking their technical balancing power potential. A limited supply of new balancing power bids will further increase the economic costs of grid balancing. This study therefore sets out to identify a method to quantitatively determine the profitability potential of providing positive balancing power to the Dutch balancing power market to an individual market participant. A case study is conducted at AkzoNobel, whose sizeable chlorine plant possesses significant balancing power potential. <br/><br/>It is found that a Unit Commitment Model based on a Mixed Integer Linear Programming solver can be used to successfully replicate the market environment. To simulate market profitability to AkzoNobel over time, it should be supplied with input data of the future development of balancing power activation, the merit order of balancing power bids, and balancing power capabilities of the AkzoNobel plant.<br/>Whilst the balancing power capabilities of the plant can be relatively simply and accurately modelled into a Unit Commitment Model, the same does not hold for the future activation of balancing power and respective prices in the merit order of balancing power bids. On the one hand, the future development of the various factors that comprise these sub-systems is characterized by significant uncertainty, as power system dynamics are notoriously hard to predict. On the other, both are the emergent behaviour from complex systems of interacting power system agents and assets. Their actions result from a large number of factors that may vary strongly on a short time scale. This causes difficulties in obtaining accurate projections of their behaviour on the required minute-by-minute time scale. <br/>The activation of a high balancing power bid price in general also implies a strong grid frequency deviation. This implies that the profitability of providing balancing power is particularly sensitive to deviations in high imbalance power prices. As imbalance power prices are primarily determined by the specific height, volatility and frequency of high balancing power activation peaks relative to the height of prices in the merit order for those respective fifteen-minute time blocks, the choice of a method to obtain the input data of balancing power activation and the merit order must be based on a clear substantiation of their accuracy. <br/><br/>Various approaches to obtain data projections with the required accuracy have been assessed, for which the following conclusions are drawn. To determine the development of the future activation of balancing power bids it is advised to evaluate a combined method of statistical convolution of probability distributions and hidden Markov chains. However, this method must be preceded by significant additional research on critical complexities and uncertain developments in the balancing power market, for which it may not be possible to draw definite conclusions. <br/>To obtain scenarios of the various potential developments in the volume and price elements of balancing power bids in the merit order it is suggested to use a stochastic modelling approach, such as Monte Carlo simulation, to evaluate the range of different compositions the merit order may take over time. It will, however, be difficult to strategize on the results, as the potential range of states of bid prices and volumes placed by individual agents with balancing power technologies are very wide. <br/> <br/>These methods must be synthesized into an approach to determine balancing power market profitability based on the above combination of methods. Projections of the development of the key determinants of profitability in the balancing power market will inherently be associated with strong uncertainty. Considering the sensitivity of model output to inaccuracies it is very questionable whether the effort of further research weighs up against the benefits. It is concluded that it is not deemed feasible to obtain quantitative long-term indications of balancing power market profitability to an individual market participant. As a result, it is not advised to proceed with the execution of the suggested methods. It appears that alternative approaches to ensure the future affordability of balancing the power grid are more worthwhile pursuing.<br/>It is instead advised to focus continued research on public incentive schemes to attract non-conventional suppliers of positive balancing power to provide their technical potential to the market if the market fails to find an economic optimum. Continued research could also focus on enhanced regulatory designs to reduce total balancing power requirements.","Intermittency; Secondary Control Reserve; Balancing power market; Unit Commitment Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management (SEPAM)","",""

Research showed that blind people are interested in going to museums and exhibitions in general. But most museums do not provide enough information for them to enjoy a museum experience. <br/>This project, in collaboration with the Van Abbemuseum, started with an extensive literature study and field research to gain a deeper understanding of meaningful museum experiences for blind people and how blind and sighted visitors can be connected to each other. This research revealed five main challenges concerning the topics social inclusion, power balance, embedding interpretative resources in interaction, hasty sighted visitors and dialogue. A design, Art Valise, has been developed that empowers blind and sighted visitors to experience art independently together in the museum. Their different perspectives on artworks will enhance each other’s experience. This design exists of a wooden suitcase that presents three artworks within a theme of a collection in the Van Abbemuseum. Translation material in the form of a booklet and 3D objects per artwork are embedded in interaction, in which dialogue leads to complementation between the blind and sighted ones. The evaluation of Art Valise with the intended target group consisted of two parts. In the first evaluation the design was tested in what way design features can be improved in relation to the design goal. After the first evaluation the design has been optimized and a new prototype has been built. The second evaluation consisted of two tests with the intended target group to see in what way Art Valise fits the qualities of the design goal. In the end the design is based upon conveying two key-components. The first one is going beyond social inclusion, by bringing the blind truly in the museum, they can be recognized as visitors, being part of the museum crowd, who are independent meaning makers who use the museum to fulfil their identity-related needs.The second one is emphasizing the multimodal experience of art, in which a meaningful connection is created between the visitor and artist rather than only seeing the artwork. A change of understanding between the different communities can be reached, which could have a positive effect on the self-esteem of blind people and the ability to take greater control of their lives.<br","blind; museum; social inclusion; accessibility; visually impaired; design; art; multisensory; touch; dialogue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

In long temporal and spatial scales, traditional “hard structures” for coastal defense can become infeasible. Incorporation of soft engineering methods for coastal defense can then be a viable solution. Vegetation belts along the coasts can be a prominent soft engineering application. <br/>Many previous studies have been done to identify the protection offered by coastal vegetation. This thesis aims to identify mangrove vegetation interactions under hazardous wave conditions. Moreover, the study includes a comprehensive parameter space by accommodating the variation in wave climate, vegetation and bathymetry observed in the field. <br/>The hydrodynamic-mangrove interactions are analyzed from the perspective of coastal hazard mitigation by vegetation. The study focuses on wave attenuation, setup variation and runup reduction by mangroves. <br/>The investigations are carried out using a numerical modeling scheme, XBeach-Surfbeat.<br/>Mangrove vegetation can substantially mitigate the effects of coastal hazards by waves (wave energy, wave induced flooding) faced in the hinterland. However, the level of mitigation depends on several factors. The most important factors are, vegetation density, mangrove forest width, wave height and water level. <br/>Denser mangrove vegetation and wider forests increases the wave attenuation while deeper water depths in mangrove forests reduces the attenuation capacity. <br/>The improved understanding of the hydrodynamic-vegetation interactions gained in this study can be used as a foundation for a Bayesian network. A better understanding of the effect of the different parameters on flood mitigation can then be attained. <br","Wave Attenuation; Mangroves; XBeach; Runup Attenuation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

Although the existence and geometrical properties of SAG are well-documented ever since the 50’s, the literature concerning specifically the hydrodynamics around them is sparse. This study provides a characterization of the 3D flow patterns found on SAG formations, and a sensitivity of that flow for a set of short wave and SAG geometry parameters, as well as for alongshore and long wave forcing. Its main interest is to provide scientists predictive capability of the flow conditions for a set of conditions commonly found on coral reef systems with SAG formations. Delft3D-FLOW coupled with SWAN/XBeach (3D phase-averaged) was applied to model schematic SAG formations. <br/><br/>Shore-normal shoaling waves on top of SAG formations are shown to drive two circulations cells, the first in deeper waters with offshore spur and onshore groove depth-averaged velocities (offshore cell), and the second in shallower depths with offshore groove and onshore spur depth-averaged currents (onshore cell). In the offshore cell, the cross-shore velocity profile shows vertically monotonic currents - onshore to grooves and offshore to spurs -, except for the bottom, at which velocities are always onshore. In the onshore cell, the velocity profile shows offshore surface velocities and onshore bottom currents for both spur and groove, with resulting depth-averaged offshore groove and onshore spur velocities.<br/><br/>The mechanism driving this flow results from the wave forcing being mostly balanced by pressure gradients both in the cross-shore and alongshore, and the mismatch between those is balanced by horizontal turbulent forces, that are higher in deeper waters, and friction, larger in shallower waters. Variations of this pattern are associated with changes in the velocity profile, that fundamentally depend on the wave, SAG geometry and alongshore forcing parameters.<br/><br/>The waves are the main driving of the SAG flow, and as such wave parameters play a fundamental role in the SAG hydrodynamics.<br/><br/>Wave heights are the most important parameter associated with the flow strength - higher waves induce significantly stronger circulation cells. When wave heights start breaking due to depth limitation, the SAG circulation cell is lost, and the velocity profile shape starts having onshore surface and undertow with maximum values at mid depth.<br/><br/>Wave periods have moderate influence on the velocity values found on SAG circulation cells - higher wave periods induce slightly higher velocities. When the wave steepness reaches the breaking limit, the whitecapping results in changes of the velocity profile similarly to the case of depth-induced breaking waves.<br/><br/>The role of varying wave directions and directional spreadings could not be accurately evaluated due to uncertainties related to the importance of refraction and diffraction using a phase-averaged model. An initial assessment of their importance with a model neglecting refraction, thus with unchangeable wave direction, was performed. Results showed that oblique waves result in alongshore transport systems, i.e., cross-shore currents become significantly lower than in the alongshore. In those cases, the SAG offshore cell is lost, and the onshore cell gets wider and stronger.<br/><br/>The SAG geometry has a very important role associated with the resulting SAG hydrodynamics. Overall, the spur height, SAG wavelength and the SAG shape provide the biggest influence on the hydrodynamics.<br/><br/>The spur heights have significantly influence in the strength of SAG circulation cells - higher spur heights are associated with stronger flows.<br/><br/>The SAG wavelengths moderately influence the strength of the flow, with longer SAG wavelengths resulting in not much stronger SAG circulation cells. Shorter SAG wavelengths do not present the offshore SAG circulation cell, due to higher alongshore mixing of momentum that gives offshore spur and groove currents in that zone.<br/><br/>The shape of the SAG formations is, together with the wave heights, the most important parameter influencing the strength of the flow. SAG formations with peak spur height located further onshore (Buttress type) have SAG circulation with higher velocities involved and the zonation of the SAG circulation cells changes accordingly, i.e., lower peak spur height depths have circulation cells shifted onshore, with widening of the offshore cell.<br/><br/>The reef slope, without significant interference in the strength or velocity profile shape, also affects the zonation of SAG circulation cells, with steeper slopes providing wider SAG offshore circulation cells.<br/><br/>The groove width, the differential roughness between spur and groove, and the reef flat widths were shown to have a minor role in the SAG hydrodynamics.<br/><br/>The alongshore forcing leads to an alongshore transport system. The degree of the alongshore dominance is directionally proportional to the alongshore forcing. In the cross-shore direction, the onshore SAG circulation cell was persistent, while the offshore cell can be undermined with large alongshore forcing.<br/><br/>Long waves were shown to result in negligible influence in the mean SAG hydrodynamics, associated with the low long wave forcing observed in the SAG zone. They are primarily more important as approaching and within the reef flat, and the water exchange between this and the SAG zones was concluded to have limited influence in the SAG flow.<br/><br/>In terms of coral growth and health, bottom shear stresses were found to be systematically higher over spurs than grooves, resulting in a higher potential for coral development over them due to increasing water motion. Accordingly, sediment transport potential is higher over spurs, for which alongshore currents are higher than grooves, thus sediments would tend to drift towards the grooves, where they would more likely deposit due to lower shear stresses. The fact that SAG with distinct shapes - with significant different peak spur height depths - experience similar bottom shear stresses suggests the existence of a range of ideal hydrodynamics conditions for coral development.","Spurs-and-grooves; Coral reef environments; Wave hydrodynamics; Delft3D; SWAN; 3D flow; Shoaling zone; Pre-littoral zone; Fore reef hydrodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

To collect such data, IBM has started the Sense Umbrella Connection and Desensitisation project. For this project an umbrella was equipped with a piezoelectric sensor and a Bluetooth device to record the rain that falls on the surface of this umbrella. One downside of this umbrella is that, besides rain, it will also record other sounds which include recognisable human speech. Because IBM values privacy, one of the tasks was to make sure that no recording containing recognisable human speech would be uploaded to a server.<br/><br/>This bachelor project focuses on creating a mobile application to connect to the umbrella via Bluetooth and save the audio recordings of rain together with GPS data. After saving this data it would originally be analysed for presence of rain and it was also required to remove all human speech before it was sent from the phone to the server. Over the course of the project it became clear that because of a scarce set of sample data and the limited availability of audio processing libraries on Android, it would be difficult to process audio on Android devices. This is why the decision was made to upload all data, and the processing and analysing was moved to an external device supporting Java. <br/>The raw data will now be uploaded to a server which will make a database entry which includes GPS data, and saves the audio file. In the end an app has been developed that is able to gather data from the umbrella and send it to an external server. Additionally an implementation has been made to analyse the audio data gathered to classify which parts may contain rain.<br/><br/>This project focused on developing an Android app and not on other operating systems due to time constraints.","Android; Audio Classification; Umbrella; Rain; Bluetooth; Privacy; App; Database; Weather Witness","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Schipper, Roel (mentor); Lukovic, Mladena (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","In the year 2006, Delft University of Technology started researching ‘Strain hardening Self-healing concrete’ (SSC). The reason for this research was the desire to increase the durability of concrete. This depends mostly on the reinforcement.<br/> To ensure a certain lifespan of concrete structures, a minimum cover depth has to be applied. However, cracks occur in the concrete and cause a significant decrease in durability. <br/> Research by M. Sierra-Beltran in 2014 resulted in SSC that has the capacity to seal these cracks due to the addition of a healing agent. Also, fibers are added to keep the cracks small and speed up the healing process. <br/><br/>In this thesis SSC is compared with traditional concrete (TC). A structural design is made with both materials based on assumed characteristics. Also, tests are performed to check whether those assumptions are right and a short calculation with the results is made. <br/><br/>When making a structural design with the assumed characteristics for TC and SSC, one finds that it is possible to design more slenderly with SSC than with TC. This is caused by the decrease in cover depth and the absence of extra reinforcement to control the crack width. The only exception is the height of the bridge deck; the height of the bridge deck is smaller in a TC design, caused by the low Young’s modulus of SSC.<br/> The positive effect of SSC is expected to be most noticeable on the bridge deck at the locations with negative bending moments. Other locations where the positive effects can be noticed are at the beams and the tensile bars.<br/> The material costs of the bridge designed with SSC are significantly higher than the material costs of the bridge designed with TC. However, it is expected that the maintenance costs of the SSC bridge are much lower.<br/><br/>The results of the tests for the structural characteristics show that SSC mortar has a lower compressive strength and a lower Young’s modulus than TC mortar. Especially, the lower Young’s modulus affects the structural design. The flexural strength of SSC mortar is higher than the flexural strength of TC. <br/><br/>The tests on durability give positive results. The chloride migration shows that, before healing, the SSC and TC have similar migration coefficients. However, after the healing period the migration coefficient of the SSC is lower than the migration coefficient of TC, at the location of the crack as well as the uncracked surface. Although, the difference is not as large as expected, this might change with longer healing periods. Therefore, it is recommended to do more tests with longer healing periods.<br/><br/>When making a short calculation with the characteristics found in the results of the test, one sees that the height of the bridge deck and the beams increases a bit more than assumed due to the lower Young’s modulus. Furthermore, no large changes are found.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is recommended to research the possibility of changing the mixture in a way that the Young’s modulus is increased.<br","Self-healing; Strain hardening; concrete","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This way, the pursuit of the Agenda becomes an organized, globalized effort that can be tracked, measured and evaluated. While the achievement of many of these goals and targets are inherent in pursuing good politics, as, for example, there are few heads of state that will strive for economic decline (opposite of SDG 8), progress on the overall Agenda can in many other ways become complex. An example of this is when there exists potentially a conflict or synergy between targets of a goal - where improving on one target comes at the cost or benefit of another. This report aims to analyse the possible relationships between the SDG 6 targets. This is done through the comparison and juxtaposition of different data sets that are then evaluated with each other statistically. Given the considerable amount of data constraints, only few possible intralinkages could be identified. No negative trends were discovered, while positive trends were found between the access to drinking water (6.1.1) and the following: integrated water resources management (6.5.1), official development assistance for water (6.a.1) and water management participation (6.b.1). Other positive trends were identified with the not-published, national data on integrated water resources management (6.5.1) and: access to drinking water (6.1.1), access to sanitation (6.2.1), and official development assistance for water (6.a.1).

The second goal for this project was to keep track of the changes in the data in order to detect significant changes in distribution (concept drift) of the target prediction value.<br/><br/>These subjects were studied in literature, reviewing existing and upcoming valuation prac- tices in real-estate, steps needed to perform machine learning tasks, architecture to support big data processing, and concept drift. This resulted in a design made up of four different components: An ETL and data processing component, a modelling component, a Kafka con- nector, and a client-facing API. An important part to ensure efficiency and scalability of the system is the implementation of concept drift: models are only retrained when the distribu- tion of the target training value has changed significantly.<br/><br/>These components use storage in the form of a Postgres database, disk storage and Elastic Search logs. The logs (on model performance and concept drift usage) can be interpreted through a Grafana dashboard, which is editable through its own GUI.<br/><br/>Finally, to test the success of the project, a testing plan was set up and the code was reviewed by an external group (SIG). The code achieved all the testing milestones and received a 4.5/5 in a mid-development review on maintainability. With this project, the concept of automated valuation models inside GeoPhy’s new architecture has been tested and proved and the project is ready to be further developed and used in practice.","Machine Learning; software architecture; Big Data; concept drift; Real-estate","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","br/>This report presents the research into e-bikes for commuters and the design process of a laptop bag carrier for commuters. The project was carried out for Royal Dutch Gazelle in Dieren.<br/><br/>The project started with the question: How to make electric bikes more attractive to commuters? In order to answer this research question a literature study, user research and market analysis was done, all focussed on the Dutch bicycle market. In order to get a good insight in the commuter's needs and wishes in depth interviews were held with e-bike owners.<br/><br/>The main conclusion from the research phase are that in order to make the e-bike more attractive e-bikes should be more reliable, have a unique design and offer more practicality and ease of use. Under practicality and ease of use issues as charging possibilities, bringing luggage, maintenance and theft prevention are considered. Based on these conclusion a descriptive domain for the solution direction was formulated: Worry-free modern commuting.<br/><br/>Within the domain of worry-free modern commuting the design direction was developed further. As target group young family (wo)men were chosen and as a retail strategy a lease construction was selected. Also it was decided that the design focus would be on bringing luggage. The bicycle type would be a normal e-bike and the design would be based on the Gazelle CityZen model family.<br/><br/>Based on the formulated design direction the idea generation phase was started and along the way more design choices were made. It was for example chosen to focus on bringing your own laptop bag, which would be mounted on a luggage solution at the front or at the rear of the bicycle. After these design decisions thirteen concept ideas were generated. From these concepts two similar rear concepts were selected to be worked out in more detail.<br/><br/>The two concepts, Horizontal bracket and the Diagonal support, both feature a construction were the laptop bag is mounted diagonally along the rear seat stay. This way the bag does not get in the way of the pedalling motion, but can still be placed very close to the centre of mass of the bike. Also it is automatically integrated in the lines of the bike, as it follows part of the bicycles frame. The two concepts were developed further using mock-ups and by modelling and sketching. Based on the second iteration in mock-ups the 'Diagonal support' concept was chosen to be worked out as the final design. The Diagonal support concept is chosen because it works well in terms of looks and position on the bike and it scores more positive on the mounting factor.<br/><br/>The final design was further developed by use of CAD-software and resulted in the Gazelle laptop carrier. This luggage solution boosts a foldable support structure were a laptop bag can be safely mounted on the bike. By means of a elastic mounting strap the bag is securely locked in place and by means of rubber shock absorption the laptop bag is protected from road impact. The Gazelle laptop carrier will be offered as an option on a new commuter lease bike and can be leased from 2,50 euro per month.<br/><br","e-bike; luggage carrier; laptop bags","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2019-07-07","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Food and mood are inseparably connected to each other. What you eat has an influence on how you feel. On the other hand, the mood you are in influences what you (would like to) eat. Why do we choose certain products, and why do these products give us comfort? This was the theme of this graduation project.<br/><br/>Prior research on food and mood shows that eating behaviour and negative mood both affect physical and mental health. These studies often view food-mood relations from a psychological or nutritional perspective. Remarkable in these studies is that the focus is almost always on food in relation to negative moods. The full spectrum of moods is never looked at. <br/><br/>Instead of a psychological approach, this thesis focuses on the interaction between food and mood on different spectra of negative and positive moods. The aim of this project is to clear up the food-mood relationship and to use these findings in design interventions in order to make people improve their mood with food.<br/><br/>From extensive literature research on mood, mood regulations and comfort food the mechanism of how food influences mood and vice versa was mapped. Through this overview became clear that in current research contexts and situations of consumption are underexposed.<br/><br/>Qualitative research was conducted in order to find out more about the context and interactions in this mechanism. Twelve people were interviewed on their food is less unambiguous then expected. People have different food preferences and eating habits when it comes to a certain mood. It was even found that within one mood, an individual could act different from time to time and use food in different ways to regulate their mood. Throughout these interviews it also became clear that insights on mood regulations are hard obtain, because unlike emotions, moods do not have a direct cause. Most of these mood regulation strategies appear to be subconsciously, which makes it hard for participants to dig in their affective memory. <br/><br/>The found variety of strategies in these interviews, were translated further into three food roles per nuanced mood. These food roles represent the interactions within one mood. <br/><br/>Two moods with their respective three food roles were chosen to design for in the next cycle. For each role a context scenario was created that served as the design context for this thesis.<br/><br/>For each scenario an ideation cycle was done. This resulted in a collection of ideas per mood. It turned out quite some of the concepts had a reflective character. So it was decided to create a collection of products, designed for each scenario.<br/><br/>Eventually six designs were made in order to make people reflect on their own eating behaviour within a certain mood. Also these designs were meant to provide an opening to be able to talk about their own experiences and make these more tangible. <br/><br/>Prototypes were made to evaluate the six different designs. In a qualitative study ten people were interviewed in order to find whether these designs would evoke a conversation about their food/eating habits within these moods and make them reflect on their own behaviour. <br/>The designs were proven to function as a toolkit to talk about and reflect upon their mood.<br","Mood; Mood regulation; Comfort food; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Hendriks, M.A.N. (mentor); Veljkovic, M.V. (mentor); Pavlovic, M. (mentor)","2017","For the fatigue assessment of welded structures, several design methods are described by the design codes of IIW, Eurocode3 and DNV. The relation between the stress range and cycles to failures were derived from experiments: the SN curves. With the increased accessibility of finite element software to engineers, a more flexible approach emerged: the so-called hot spot stress method. Particularly suitable for welded structures, it assesses the influence of the geometric discontinuity on the stress distribution. A stress extrapolation procedure is required to overcome the high stresses computed by FEA at the notch. Normal stresses at the surface, perpendicular to the weld, are to be used. For curved welds and surfaces, e.g. in case of tubular joints, these stresses are complex to determine from FEA output. A method that automates the hot spot stress calculation as a post processor to FEA output would facilitate the process. Such an automated subroutine would further enable a study on the finite element modelling aspects, including the use of shell and solid elements and the inclusion of the weld profile, in relation to conducted fatigue experiments. This report describes the development of a subroutine as post-processor for FEA output to calculate the hot spot stresses. Read out points for stress extrapolation are located independently of the finite element mesh. In addition, for each weld node the local coordinate system is to be determined and subsequently the corresponding stress transformation is to be performed. Equivalent stresses at the read out points are determined by means of interpolation from a triangle-shaped plane formed by three element nodes. Cut-out specimens of an orthotropic bridge deck were tested against fatigue and strain gauges were used to measure the strains. This report shows that FEA stresses corresponded well with the measurements. Inclusion of the weld profile is important; ignoring the weld underestimates the stress levels by 10%. Use of shell elements resulted in 4% lower nominal stresses than solid elements, however in the weld region only the solid element model accurately reproduced the stress distribution. An alternative method for the fatigue classification described in EC3 is proposed, which represents better the observed stress levels for the crack initiation point at the weld root. Finally, this report considers stress concentration factors of tubular joints as recommended by CIDECT design guide. The FEA results are compared to the SCFs from parametric formulae. Good correspondence was found between the FEA and CIDECT results. A validation analysis of the boundary and loading conditions was performed, from comparing the joint model with the entire truss structure for shell elements. A correction function is derived to cover the small observed differences. Additionally, strain gauge measurements from experiments on large scale tubular joints in a marine environment are compared to the FEA results. Good correspondence was found between the measured and numerically computed strains. For solid element models, the weld leg size is found to be important for the hot spot stresses; each millimetre shift of the weld toe affected the stress levels by 3%. A characteristic SN curve was derived from the experiments. Fatigue assessment by means of the FEA hot spot stress in combination with the corresponding DNV SN-curve was found to be more conservative.","fatigue; FEA; FEM; hot spot stress; finite element analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

Rapid developments in IT technology, fuelled by the ever increasing need for businesses to reduce their costs make way for offices with a sometimes unhealthy appetite for facility and employee efficiency. The office building is transforming from a static piece of concrete towards a flexible shell with internet connected infrastructure, called smart buildings. These buildings, that heavily depend on digital technology, can quickly adapt to the changing need of the office workers. However, office workers turn out to be the rigid part of the equation, as they find it hard to work in a flexible manner. This is where Mapiq comes in, which is a smart building platform. Mapiq is a software platform that integrates all of the services and facilities that are available in an office into one interface that can be accessed on any consumer device. Among other things users can book meeting rooms from their laptop, find their colleagues with a kiosk at the entrance, and adjust the lighting above their desk from their smartphone. <br/><br/>However, the usage of Mapiq in an office does not yet guarantee flexible workforce that is essential for a truly smart building. Next to that, there is still an opportunity to create a more meaningful and engaging interaction between a smart building and its users. Currently Mapiq can only be accessed through a GUI, and the platform is not embedded into the architecture in any way that is meaningful to the office workers. In this project the context of the office has been researched through literature research and context mapping research, in which four flexworkers were followed throughout their working day. The research provided rich insight in the experiences of flexworkers, such as the need for community in order to break loose from fixed workplaces and the lack of control that employees have over their environment at the start of a working day. From the insights a future vision was created, to set the context of the design. <br/><br/>The design goal is to allow constellations of collaborators to feel like they belong to their temporary place in the office. The interaction can be characterised as arbitrary predictability, which is embodied by the metaphor of tuning to a radio station with music you want to lister to with a rotary knob on a receiver. Starting with the design goal, concepts were developed in an explorative and iterative way by making quick prototypes and learning quickly from the feedback from users.<br/><br/>The final design is Flocc: a system of team identities to connect users to their smart building. Every project team has their own unique visual and auditory identity. These identities can be embedded in multiple ways throughout an office building. The identities allow employees to associate themselves with the teams they are working with, thus increasing the sense of community. Next to this employees can locate each other quickly when they want to work together. The visual patterns that make up the team identities share the same visual language, but are still recognisable from each other. A large amount of unique patterns can be used as they are created in a generative way. In this project the system of team identities has been applied in three different designs that can be used in an office building. Together, these create one coherent experience for an office worker going about his day. <br/><br/>In the lobby of the office an interactive display is embedded in the floor. The display shows an overview of all the team identities that are working at any moment in the office. When a user walks over the patterns, he is identified by the smart building installation and user’s teams are highlighted on the floor. When the user walks over the highlighted patterns an auditory identity is heard. The sound, together with a line that emerges from the pattern, shows the user the directions to that particular team in the office. The line ends in a screen on the wall that provides more detailed wayfinding instructions, so the user can find its way to the team.<br/><br/>The teams are at work in big, open workspaces in the office. In the ceiling above every group of desks, the team identities are displayed as well. Every team will have their own team identity that lights up above them. The identity will follow a team throughout the office, creating a shared point of reference for the team members. By placing the identity in the vicinity of where people work, they will slowly start to familiarise themselves better with the patterns, which will increase the recognition of a particular team over time. The pattern bonds the team together, and gives them a fixed reference in a flexworking office.<br/><br/>At last Flocc can be integrated with the Mapiq smartphone application. In the application interface a personal overview of team identities can be viewed, with additional details on who is part of a team and where the team can be found. The application provides more in-depth and functional information about the team identities, as an addition to the ambiguous nature of the embedded installations. The smartphone application and installation are always synchronised in real-time through the smart building platform. This allows the user to open the smartphone interface while walking over the lobby installation, and receive relevant information. These features create a consistent experience across modalities. <br/><br/>To evaluate whether the concept of team identities could be understood well by the target group, and whether the interaction is as envisioned, a final user evaluation has been conducted. A full-size interactive prototype in a similar context has been created of the lobby installation for this purpose. The result was that most participants understood the system and found it valuable, if the way of working in flexible offices was clear to them. The usability of the lobby installation has been increased with some final adjustments in the way directions are given. It is recommended to conduct a long-term user evaluation to find out whether the design increases the feeling of belonging. Flocc demonstrates that a new direction of interactions can be facilitated by smart buildings, which serves the complex needs of office workers in an ambiguous manner.","Mapiq; flexworking; way of working; smart office","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Researchers ask for the development of conceptual frameworks to explore project complexity and for tools to manage these complex processes.<br/>Aim: This research focuses on collaborative complexity and aims firstly to provide an understanding of the complexity within the collaboration in heritage re-use projects and secondly to reduce this complexity with a clear overview on the role and responsibility divisions of stakeholders in the process.<br/>Research question: How can a clear overview on role and responsibility divisions contribute to a reduction of the complexity of heritage re-use processes? <br/>Methodology: The complexity is explored by means of a literature study, four empirical case studies including a cross-case analysis and a focus group discussion. The collaboration within empirical heritage re-use processes is mapped with the help of: 1) a timeline, which gives an overview on the iterative nature of the process; 2) a process description that explains the key activities mentioned in the timeline; 3) a relation structure explaining how stakeholders are linked to each other and which roles they fulfil; 4) a collaboration framework that explains the role and responsibility division between stakeholders per process step; and 5) a complexity assessment framework explaining which aspects increase the level of complexity. <br/>Findings: Complexity of heritage re-use processes cannot be reduced with a clear overview on role and responsibility divisions: These projects are unique, a clear overview on role and responsibility divisions in these types of processes could therefore not be made. The division of roles and responsibilities amongst <br/>stakeholders seems to differ within every project and changes occur during the process. Stakeholders <br/>cannot anticipate with certainty on changes as the dynamics are unknown at the start and they differ extremely per project. It might however be possible to steer on aspects that increase the level of complexity within the collaboration, or to deal with the complexity by implementing a step-by-step approach.<br/>Limitations of the research: Qualitative research is always subject to bias due to the interpretation of the qualitative information. Subsequently, the modest number of samples that is investigated in this master thesis may not adequately represent the target population.<br/>Practical implications: This research raises awareness on the complexity of heritage re-use processes and the limited action that is taken up until now to decrease the vacancy among cultural and historical <br/>valuable buildings in the Netherlands. It offers recommendations for initiators of heritage re-use processes to deal with the complexity within these processes to increase the amount of re-uses of heritage buildings in practice.<br/>Scientific relevance: This research tries to fill gaps in literature on process complexity and collaboration in heritage re-use processes. It argues that heritage re-use processes should not be set in blueprints as these models lack the ability to map the complexity of these processes. <br/>Originality/value: Limited literature is available on heritage re-use processes, this research increases the insight in these processes.<br","Stakeholder roles; responsibility division; vacant monuments; adaptive re-use; collaboration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Strict environmental regulations demand for the reduction of the pollutants emissions (e.g. NO$_{x}$ CO$_{2}$, CO, SO$_{2}$, etc.) that are responsible for the global warming of the planet and the formation of acid rain and smog. Since renewable energy sources cannot replace the use of fossil fuels in the foreseeable future alternative ways have to be investigated. Combustion of biofuels such as liquid ethanol, a well known and widely used alcohol, under MILD (Moderate or Intense Low-oxygen Dilution) conditions is a scenario on that direction. From the one hand, combustion of biofuels offers sustainability and lower greenhouse gas emissions and from the other, MILD conditions offer more uniform and lower peak temperature profiles reducing so the nitrogen oxides emissions and increasing the lifetime of the combustion chamber. However, modeling of ethanol spray turbulent combustion is a complicated problem since it involves many different phenomena that are coupled between each other including the injection of the spray, the atomization into droplets and the dispersion in the domain, the turbulence of the gaseous flow, the mass, momentum and energy exchange between the two phases and finally the combustion. The closure of the unresolved chemical source terms in the numerical analysis of such a problem is a challenge and the Flamelet Generated Manifolds (FGM) method appears as a perspective approach to deal with it. This method approximates the turbulent flame as an ensemble of laminar, thin, one dimensional, counterflow flames the so-called flamelets. In that way the chemical reactions can be decoupled from the turbulence field and be calculated separately. The results are stored in look-up tables that are retrieved during the turbulence simulation with the use of connecting variables. Not having found a way so far to relate a spray flamelet look-up table with the turbulence flow many researchers create a gaseous flamelet table instead ignoring the spray and evaporation effects in it. As it has been reported this omittance can possibly lead to over-prediction of the temperature and important species profiles in the modeling of the turbulent flame. In this study, both a gaseous and spray ethanol flamelet library are created so that a direct comparison between the two can be done. The interference of spray influences the structure of the flame making it deviate significantly from the gaseous flamelets. The results show that not only the strain rate (as for the case of the gaseous flamelets), but also the equivalence ratio implied in the fuel side and the initial droplets’ diameter influence the flame structure of the spray flamelets. A non-slip velocity between the droplets and the carrier gas is kept as a boundary condition for all the cases. Increased initial droplets' momentum due to increased strain rate and initial diameter makes the droplets survive and follow longer trajectories in the domain. If droplets manage to cross the stagnation plane and meet the opposing gaseous stream, one or more droplets' reversals are observed. The motion of droplets in the domain is associated with the evaporation process the location of which affects the viability of the flame. Enhanced evaporation at the stagnation plane favors the creation of a double reaction zone. If the ethanol vapor is brought in the reaction zone at a high temperature level a hotter flame compared to the gaseous case can be created. Moreover, if evaporation takes place in regions where combustion is not strong enough, local flame extinction might happen. Thus, not only the residence time of the reactants (as for the case of the gaseous flamelets), but also the location and the intensity of the evaporation affect the flame structure. Decomposition of the ethanol gas into intermediate species can occur for all the cases but is more apparent in the gaseous flamelets and for lower strain rates. Mass fraction profiles of CO$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$O indicate the outer flame structure and follow the temperature profile, while local presence of CO indicates that the reactions are weakened, incomplete or they have just started. Local evaporation of the droplets is also predicted by the evaporation source term of the continuity equation and at the location where a local peak is observed additional peaks of the ethanol and oxygen consumption rates are found which are in a stoichiometric ratio. For increased droplets' initial momentum, slip velocity effects are found that lead to increased drag force and the deceleration of the droplets. Increasing the equivalence ratio at the boundary two reaction zones are observed for all the cases, but it does not influence the motion of the droplets. Finally, as a result of the evaporation two or more peaks of scalar dissipation rate can be found compared to the single peak observed in the gaseous flamelets. It becomes evident that the motion and the evaporation of the droplets strongly affects the flame structure. More reaction zones, of varying intensity and location can be found in the spray flamelets. Temperature and species profiles show deviations between the two libraries and as a result the creation of a complete spray flamelet library and finding a way to relate it with the turbulence calculation is an important issue to be studied in a future study. Finally, it is also recommended that the influences of a slip boundary velocity condition should be studied for the spray calculations.<br","Spray Combustion; Laminar Flamelets; MILD; Biofuels","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the processes of aerosol-cloud interactions are still not adequately known and the associated lack of knowledge causes uncertainties in climate change prediction. Therefore this study presents different approaches to investigate those interactions, in particular the Twomey-effect, which states that an increase in aerosol loading leads to an increase in cloud drop number density and a decrease in cloud drop effective radius, considering constant liquid water path.<br/>The data analysed was obtained during the ASCII campaign 2016 at Ascension Island. Cloud and aerosol measurements were done by an ultra-violet (UV) lidar during the month September 2016. The cloud microphysical properties - cloud drop number density and cloud drop effective radius - were retrieved using the cloud property inversion retrieval algorithm. The cloud effective radius varied between 1.88 and 4.48 $\mu m$. The cloud drop number density had values in the range of 228-1690 $cm^{-3}$. Furthermore, the total aerosol profiles for clear sky scenes and the aerosol profiles below clouds were retrieved, solving the boundary-value-problem using the ’Klett’ approach. For the aerosol profiles below clouds an extra factor was introduced, accounting for multiple<br/>scattering inside the clouds. The aerosol loading arrived at Ascension Island came mainly from the South (Atlantic Ocean) in the lower 1200m or from the East (African continent, biomass burning events) above 1200m. The aerosol-cloud interactions were examined for both the clear sky and the below cloud aerosols with the cloud properties. Both approaches gave evidence for the Twomey-effect.<br/>Those results suggest that the UV-lidar is a suitable instrument for investigation of aerosol-cloud interactions. Future projects can use those approaches to gain more knowledge over the interactions, enabling a major improvement of climate change predictions.","Aerosol-Cloud Interactions; LIDAR; Aerosol profiles; Microphysical cloud properties","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ascension Island Initiative 2016 (ASCII)",""

A framework for functional robot developers, to apply animations in the designed behaviours of their products, is proposed. Second, it demonstrates the value of the incorporation of animated behaviours, as well as the effects, through application of the framework to a hospital transport robot.<br/><br/>Robots, belonging to smart machine technologies, are expected to be part of the most disruptive technologies over the next decade. Especially functional robots are on the rise, making the transfer from controlled factory floors to mundane environments, where people can also encounter them in everyday life. This requires new design strategies that tackle functional robots, not only as efficient machines but also as understandable agents that people can deal with, preferably intuitively.<br/>What sets robots apart from other intelligent agents, is that they are able manipulate our world not only digitally, but also physically. Since people are highly sensitive to physical movement, this trait can be used in the pursuit of more intuitively interpretable robots. The art of animation houses deep expertise in how to use movement, to dynamically communicate state and intention, and can therefore be the key to designing more intuitive robots<br/>This project has therefore set out to make effective application of animation practices available for functional robot developers, as to enable them to offer more intuitively understandable products and be a game changer for how we have to deal with robots today.<br/>A framework, that combines animation practices and functional robot development with knowledge of user-centred design, is proposed, to provide guidance throughout development towards more intuitively understandable products.<br/><br/>Over the last decade an increasing number of functional robots have been developed and employed to conduct the intra-logistics in hospitals. The main reason for implementation has been that hospitals are under a constant pressure to cut costs. However, especially in sensitive settings such as hospitals, there is urgency for these robots to be naturally understood to facilitate an intuitive response in people towards the robots. People in healthcare facilities often feel stressed and anxious, leaving them with only little capacity to deal with complex or confusing situations.<br/>Based on the identified urgency for more intuitive robots in this setting, a case study was conducted that aimed to answer the following question:<br/><br/>How can the application of animation principles in the designed expressivity of a hospital delivery robot evoke an intuitive response in hospital visitors, in such a manner that its expressive behaviour seamlessly integrates with its delivery function?<br/><br/>It was found that the proposed framework effectively stimulates a workflow that adopts animation practices. Also, it could be concluded that animated behaviours and ‘staging’ of robots movements through embodiment can indeed stimulate desired response in the human encountering the robot.<br/>Although the framework still requires validation through evaluation in real life robot development project, the current study shows its potential as a first step towards more intuitively understandable robots based on animation practices.","design; robot; animation; dynamics; movement; intra-logistics; hospital","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Octane number of high molecular weight hydrocarbons can be increased by selectively isomerizing and cracking them into low molecular weight hydrocarbons. Catalytic hydroisomerization and hydrocracking is an important process to selectively branch and crack high molecular weight hydrocarbons in the petroleum industry. Research in modelling of these reactions is primarily<br/>based on characterizing and quantifying the vast network of reactions taking place in hydroisomerization and hydrocracking. This particular work focuses on reaction modelling of hydroisomerization and hydrocracking of n-Heptane in bifunctional catalysts based on Single Event Microkinetic (SEMK) approach. SEMK is a novel approach, which takes into account every fundamental step occurring in the vast reaction network and accounts for contribution of each of these steps to overall reaction rate. Results obtained via modelling by SEMK approach were fitted to experimental results in order to obtain estimates of rate constants of elementary steps.<br/>An SEMK based model was created in three phases: reaction network generation, obtaining kinetic coefficients via SEMK model and development of rate equations and reactor model. The concentrations of individual species obtained from the model were fitted into experimental results to get estimations of kinetic rate coefficients of elementary steps. Estimations of these coefficients were obtained at three different temperatures (519K, 531K and 544K). A thorough analysis of results was performed in three parts. In the first part, the mass balance across the reactor is observed to ensure credibility of results obtained under steady state reactor conditions. In the second part, the product distribution of all components across the reactor was analyzed and compared with experimental results. It was observed that the product profiles fitted well with experimental observations for species formed in considerable amounts. In the third part, estimations of kinetic rate coefficents were obtained and compared with literature trends. It was observed that the parameters mostly followed literature trends. In the end recommendations are provided for overcoming the shortcomings of the present model for future study.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

This is because the discontinuous set of struts in the continuous network of proportionally thin cables makes the structures look like floating in the air. However, there has not been much application of tensegrity principle in the construction field due to the lack of design methods and its complexity. By developing a large-span structure using tensegrity systems, a design method and an analysis technique are introduced along to define double-surface tensegrity systems. The design approach explores an innovative way to determine the structural topology and geometry of such the systems. The form-finding process and structural analysis are conducted to discover an appropriate way of analyzing tensegrity and ensuring that the systems are stable.","tensegrity; double-surface tensegrity; form-finding; complex geometry; large-span structure; structural topology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

Located in the city centre Christiania is continuously being threatened to leave behind partially or entirely its self-organisational values and instead to embrace public and private investments. Therefore a prospective Christiania poses relevant threats of population decline, physical segregation and other implications due to the governmental plan for socio-economic normalisation. On this basis, the project focuses on investigating possible future scenarios which would give answers to above mentioned issues without affecting the character of Christiania. Through an experimental study contributing to alternative ideas, this project aims at finding the balance between contemporary development challenges and Christiania’s fragile cultural identity. Applying an inter-scalar design approach the interventions unfold through network, structural and programmatic design proposals, making culture the main regenerative catalyst for Christiania.<br/><br/>The essential aim of this prevails the preservance of the freetown identity as an inseparable element which defines Christiania as a culturally alternative neighbourhood of Copenhagen. The ending chapter is a catalogue of visualised design interventions of culture-led regeneration and it acts as a mediating tool for the Christianites to initiate their wishes and desires for the future.","self-organization; urban regeneration; culture; inter-scalarity; Christiania; Copenhagen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Design of the Urban Fabric","","55.67604249, 12.60811539"

Among the tools used to predict morphological evolution are the process-based models that make use of physical laws and empirical knowledge. Such models account for a considerable range of coastal processes and are rather complex, hence demanding substantial computational time. Usually, when using complex process-based models, reducing the size of the input parameters, named input reduction, is made necessary in order to reduce the computational effort.<br/>The scope of the present study is to understand the influence of reduced wave climate on simulated morphological evolution. Input reduction algorithms, sequencing methods, number of cases and duration of the reduced wave climate were investigated and evaluated with a 1D (cross-shore) brute force simulation of 3.3 years in Noordwijk, Netherlands. Noordwijk is a wave-dominated sandy beach characterized by a double sandbar system that has an inter-annual net offshore migration. The assessment of the methods was carried out through cumulative skill scores, temporal evolution of profile perturbations (bars and troughs) and profiles at the end of the simulation. <br/>Furthermore, the findings on the Dutch coast were validated with a 1 year-long, 1D (cross-shore) brute force simulation in Anmok beach, South Korea. Anmok is a wave-dominated sandy beach with crescentic bars in the nearshore morphological evolution.<br/>One of the conclusions of the present study is that input reduction methods that have more control on the definition of bins such as pre-definition of wave height and wave direction bins perform better than methods that are based fully on the statistical properties of the wave dataset. Also, the order of the wave cases in the reduced wave climate must resemble at its best the natural variability of the full wave climate. Finally, a less robust reduced wave climate (with less representative wave conditions) applied in a smaller timescale performs better in terms of morphology than a more robust reduced wave climate (with more representative wave conditions) applied in longer time-scales. <br","CoMEM; input reduction; morphodynamics; wave climate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

Government housing strategies have not been able to halt the informal production of housing, as according to UN-Habitat currently in Africa over half of the urban population (61.7%) lives in slums and by 2050, Africa’s urban dwellers are projected to have increased from 400 million to 1.2 billion. This thesis revisits the ideas of John F.C. Turner who in the 1960s argued that successful government housing strategies in this context, depend on the alignment of government action with the priorities and forces of popular settlement. To meaningfully address the insufficient housing quality and urban sprawl resulting from the informal production of housing, the main objective of this thesis is to produce design guidelines on the typology and housing strategy that best addresses the priorities of the main actors in informal settlements; the inhabitants and the government. Therefore the rationale behind the proliferation of the informal construction of housing is first introduced, clarifying the problematic. Then the theoretical background of existing housing strategies of the provider and enabler paradigm are discussed, while deducing from housing strategies the architectural typologies. To connect the strategies in a narrative, the priorities that form the criteria of a evaluation framework are presented. Evaluation of the strategies against this framework results in a decision making tool that schematically portrays the tradeoffs in priorities and the interconnected consequences of the housing strategies. Applying this tool, a case is made for the strategy of assisted informal multi-story housing; negotiating government priorities of reduced urban sprawl and increased housing quality, while allowing for the inhabitants priorities recognised in the informal production of housing. Case studies of prototypes of this housing strategy are undertaken with the aim to specify the benefits of the informal production of housing and identify solutions for an improved housing quality and urban density. The produced set of generic guidelines on the design of a strategy of assisted informal multi-story housing, informs the redesign of the typical Urban Swahili Housing in Dar es Salaam. This redesign provides an alternative scenario for informal urbanisation in Dar es Salaam: increasing housing quality and urban density.","Housing Strategies; Rapid Urbanisation; Urban Poor; Informal Settlements; John F.C.

Among others, these challenges interest the desolation of urban districts and the creation of large urban voids, one of the major problems affecting, nowadays, the Greek cities. This phenomenon is witnessed in a larger extent during the last years of the strong socio-economic recession, particularly in coastal zone areas. Therefore, currently, there is a large amount of areas waiting for regeneration projects in order to be reconnected to the cities’ built environment and society. Despite the large amount of such undeveloped areas, there is a lack of formal knowledge and experience in implementing regeneration strategies in Greece. For that reason, this research is seeking to identify and understand the motives, in terms of drives and barriers, of opting for (re)development schemes by focusing on an exemplary brownfield waterfront area in the seaport city of Piraeus, called “Lipasmata”.<br/>The purpose of analysing this case is to illustrate the conflicts between the stakeholders committed to the area, and the plans made until now, in order to examine the opposing views for the area’s future. Additionally, based on the main case study’s findings and the knowledge from the international practice of waterfront development, it is explored the possibility of implementing alternative strategies as a solution for the (re)development of the area. In particular the solution is searched within the boundaries of the community-orientated development approach, which has flourished in challenging socio-economic context, as the one in Greece. <br/>The expectations of this research are to contribute to the academic knowledge and a policy debate regarding the management of waterfront developments in the country. This will help policy-makers and other stakeholders search for more effective solutions for managing and implementing waterfront development projects.<br","Waterfront development; urban governance and planning; regeneration strategies; community-led developments; Greece","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","","37.9430, 23.6470"

The submarines sail submerged on electric engines and periodically recharge the batteries with diesel engines at periscope depth. The exhaust gases are dispelled at the back of the sail below water level. During the sea trials it was observed that the rising exhaust gases elevated the surface locally with a height of 1 to 2 m. This elevation limited visibility through the periscope, water flooded the air intake and the submarines could be easily detected. To remedy this problem model tests were performed. To enable evaluating several exhaust configurations for a replacement of the Walrus class a numerical model is studied to predict the surface elevation. <br/><br/>To model this situation a numerical method is used. The method applied in this work is the Volume of Fluid code ReFRESCO, which is a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver. Three test cases are studied, a rising bubble, a buoyant jet and an exhaust plume from a submarine sail. <br/><br/>The simulations for the buoyant jet show that the momentum in the jet is dominated by buoyancy rather than by the initial inflow momentum. The influence of different turbulence models on the width of the jet and the corresponding surface elevation are investigated. The choice of turbulence model influences the distribution of air in the domain, but does little to the surface elevation. It is concluded that the KSKL model yields the most physical results where the air spreads out in the domain. This model also has a satisfactory convergence behavior. It is concluded that both the density of the exhaust gas and the velocity profile at the nozzle have little influence on the final result. A parabolic velocity profile instead of a uniform outflow does improve the convergence. The dominant numerical error is the discretization error, which is in the order of 12% for the surface elevation. To this end the L∞ norm of the iterative error must be reduced to a satisfactory value, in the order of 10^-3 or smaller. Comparing the results with experiments is difficult due to a lack of proper experimental data, however it is concluded that the results are in a similar order of magnitude.<br/><br/>Finally the exhaust gases on a submarine sail are modeled. For the modeling three simplifications are made: only the flow surrounding the sail is modeled (the hull of the submarine is not modeled), the control planes on the sail are not modeled, and no incoming waves on the free surface are taken into account. Both in the experiments and in the simulations a pulsating behavior can be observed in the rising air. L∞ norms for the submarine modeling are generally in the order 10^-3, but occasionally less. The numerical results are validated against the experimental results. It is concluded that the use of the RANS code ReFRESCO is possible for the modeling of a submerged exhaust of a submarine. The estimated uncertainty for the result is in the order of 15%.<br","Submarine; Multiphase flow; Turbulent jet; ReFRESCO; CFD; Submerged exhaust","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Hydromechanics","",""

Design thinking methodology has three pillars, technical feasibility, user desirability and business viability. Every designer should design on the limits of new technology, make products that people want to use, all while maintaining a feasible business strategy. <br/><br/>Bende uses the term design doing for their way of working. The company focuses on making at an early stage in the design process. Use making as a means of detailing, in stead of detailing on paper or in virtual models. <br/><br/>“What is design doing?“<br/><br/>“How can design doing be applied in a business environment?” <br/><br/>CASE -The main question of the material exploration was;<br/><br/>“What is the impact of doing in stead of reasoning?”<br/><br/>In other words, what happens when a designer tries every material combination he/she can think of in stead of reasoning what the outcome will be? The goal is to do as much as possible and use the results as the criteria for success. When a new material combination is thought off, first thing is to apply it, test it and use the outcome of the test to see whether it is useful/interesting.<br/><br/>A total of 36 different materials combinations were tested during this phase. The outcomes were rated during a workshop. The highest rated experiments were the ones that had properties which are contradictory to what is expected of concrete. Concrete is heavy, hard, cold, geometric and sharp. It does not float, let light through or is shaped organically.<br/><br/><br/>OUTCOME - Design doing has proven to be useful in a business environment. Important factor in the use of design doing is to save the results and outcomes of the testing and experimenting and using it in future projects and this is an area where Bende can improve. <br/><br/>For this purpose a format was created which consists of three steps, document, evaluate and consult. The first step is to document all aspects of a project, the first sketch as well the final result. The second step is to condense all the information of the first step to a manageable amount that shows the essence of a project. Third step is to consult this information in later projects and use it to improve the making process.<br/><br/>For this last step a physical material bank was designed, made and installed in the office of Bende. This bank serves three purposes; remind, inspire and inform. The material is a reminder of all the projects and materials that Bende has worked with. The second is to use the material samples as inspiration during idea generation and setting up new projects. The last purpose is to use the materials to show future partners what Bende has done, is capable of and can offer in a project.","Design doing; making; learning by doing; concrete","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Commercial simulators typically combine multiphase porous media flow models with a separate module for the transport of tracers. By decoupling flow and transport, the transport equation can be solved using a more accurate and efficient numerical scheme than the fully implicit first order scheme that is commonly used to solve the flow equations. The accuracy of the numerical transport scheme is of high importance in Enhanced Oil Recovery modelling in order to accurately predict the influence of EOR techniques on the oil production. Of all numerical methods considered in this research, the explicit high-resolution flux-limiter method with the van Leer limiter performed best in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The accuracy and monotonicity of the numerical transport scheme strongly depend on the underlying flowsolution. To ensure monotonicity of the scheme in all model situations considered, a partially implicit method is introduced that switches to the monotone first order implicit scheme where necessary. In addition, care must be taken when modelling influences of the polymer and surfactant concentration on the flow. Bad choices can lead to instabilities or cause deviations in the model outcome. The conventional approach for modelling the hydrodynamic acceleration of polymer via a constant velocity enhancement factor results in an ill-posed system. To obtain a well-posed system, some form of a saturation dependent velocity enhancement factor could be used instead. However, which physical and numerical model is best suited for modelling the hydrodynamic acceleration remains an open question. When modelling surfactant flooding, the implementation of a discontinuous transition in relative permeabilities around the surfactant front results in oscillations in the numerical solution over time. These oscillations can be resolved or at least diminished by applying some form of interpolation between the two sets of relative permeabilities. However, there is no guarantee that the oscillations disappear completely and the interpolation function has to be carefully selected as it can have a large impact on the solution profile.","numerical method; enhanced oil recovery; monotonicity; high-resolution; hydrodynamic acceleration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the issues with the penetration of 3D printing technology is the required proficiency with creation software; and the lack of experience in design. This report describes the exploration into a novel means to empower users to create unique design files to 3D-print and in doing so aspires to increase the technology’s audience. The current users of the technology are mainly people with technical backgrounds or highly invested autodidact amateurs. The audience that is targeted with this project consist of creative, tech savvy early adopters; people who lack the skills but not the inclination. The idea proposed by this project was to find a compromise between freedom and ease of use, while maximising the perceived freedom and sense of authorship. The approach to achieve this goal is by the means of formalising a digital design process through an algorithm. By offering a set of instructions and options the user would be guided through the process. The objective is that the user experiences a successful DIY-type cycle with sense of genuine authorship over the outcome. It does so by combining several types of tools into a specific combination setting up a framework for other people to use for specific product types. It proves to be a multi-faceted problem consisting of: the algorithm; a user interface; a way to guide the user through the process called the Track; and guidelines to create an implementation of the framework, on a meta-level. Each of the facets is explored and combined to create the concept. After thorough analysis and ideation the concept proposal is the PDA (Product Design Algorithm)-framework. By making several prototypes and reviewing them, through quick user tests, a lot of insight was gained. This iterative process proved to be a productive means to get comprehension in the implementation of the proposal. This led to the creation of the final design case; Spectacle. Spectacle showcases the implementation of the framework with a full track, algorithm and user interface. It facilitates the creation of glasses and guides the user in specific steps through the process. By manipulating things like sliders, points and curves, the user forms the design of the glasses. It provides real-time feedback by displaying a representation both in 2D and 3D according to the specific step in the process. In some instances parameters are controlled directly and singularly and in others they form group for a more subjective feeling of control. It made use of augmented reality to combine map the model on the users face via a web-cam. The Spectacle was tested with group representing the target. Through observation; vocalising the thought process; and post use-interviews new insights were gained that were either implemented immediately wherever that was possible and otherwise included in the guidelines. This report suffices as an exploration into the world of creating specific algorithmic design tools. However this context is on the forefront of innovation and therefore constantly changing. While this project tries to make its recommendations as fundamental as possible it is likely that some things will change over time.","design; parameteric design; diy; software; application; 3D printing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

Typically, the fluid, whose motion is of interest, is seeded with micron scale particles and illuminated with a laser. Due to scattering inefficiencies of these micron scale particles the maximum measurement volumes were about a few litres. Development of the neutrally buoyant sub-millimetre scale Helium-Filled Soap Bubbles allows for much larger scattering cross-sections thus enabling large-scale measurements in air (Caridi et.al. 2015). <br/><br/>Large scale Particle Tracking Velocimetry has been used to study the flow in the wake of a cyclist at typical time-trial speeds. A novel PTV algorithm known as Shake-The-Box (STB) (Schanz et.al. 2013) has been used to obtain the particle tracks from the images acquired in a thin volume in the cyclist’s wake using the wake-scanning method. The Lagrangian particle tracking technique was found to be more accurate than the Time Resolved Tomographic PIV through another experiment. Particularly for large field of views involving scanning at different positions, it produces whole-field results free from the boundary effects that arise between different positions of the scans. This yields accurate velocity components and their gradients that are crucial for pressure reconstruction.<br/><br/>Flow-field results from 4D-PTV show that the wake structure is similar to those found in the literature. Two large regions of momentum deficit are present, one behind the thighs and one near the lower legs and the wheel axis. Furthermore, they reveal the presence of some vortices which were not reported previously. Based on the observed signs of the vortices the points of origination of these vortices are identified based on separation mechanisms. There is a good agreement in the flow-field results with the literature. Pressure fields reconstructed from the velocity flow-field show low pressure pockets in the regions of the vortex cores and separated flow over the lower back. <br/><br/>Wake flow-field is utilised to compute the drag using the control volume approach (van Oudheusden 2007) and compared with the drag forces obtained from an external balance measurement to obtain the accuracy of large scale 4D-PTV. In total, five measurements at different velocities in the range of 13m/s to 15m/s are analysed. The accuracy of the drag estimates from 4D-PTV is obtained within 5%. Out of the three terms of the drag force, the momentum term contributes approximately 95% and the contribution from the pressure term is less than 0.3%. Rest is contributed by the Reynolds stresses in streamwise direction. Almost all the variation in the drag force comes from the momentum term.","Laser diagnostics; cycling; wake; large scale; PIV/PTV; drag reduction; Accuracy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-07-08","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

(mentor); Hoving, J.S. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Heerema Marine Contractors (HMC) is a world leading marine contractor in the international offshore oil and gas industry. HMC specializes, among other activities, in the decommissioning of offshore located oil platforms. Current methods exist for safely removing topsides and substructures, yet research into new and cheaper ways is continuously done at HMC. Common practice now is to remove the topside with the use of a Semi-Submersible Crane Vessel (SSCV) and lift the topside onto a barge. With a new method, a reverse float-over operation, the SSCV would not be needed at all for this procedure.<br/><br/>This operation has not been performed before. The set-up for this research is a barge which will connect to the topside due to friction forces on the interface between these two bodies. The use of stabbing cones or clamps would increase the horizontal station keeping of the barge beneath the topside during this operation. As this would require a lot of work being done on the topside before this operation can take place they are not used in this research. Therefore it was chosen to have the barge stick to the topside due to friction. In computer simulations a model of the H-851, a HMC owned barge, is located beneath an earth fixed topside. The deballasting of the barge is simulated by applying an external lift force on the centre of gravity of the barge. External wave forces are acting on the barge. When the barge is being pushed against the topside, friction forces allow the barge to crawl beneath the topside due to a stick slip mechanism. This thesis looks into the crawling behaviour by making a new friction model. <br/><br/>A simplified model was created to improve the understanding of the friction forces between 2 bodies. A sensitivity study has been performed to analyse the crawling behaviour of the barge as a function of five parameters: Deballast velocity, vertical interface stiffness, horizontal interface stiffness, horizontal interface damping and coulomb friction coefficients. This is done by defining a base case and changing parameters to check the influence on the crawling behaviour.<br/><br/>Crawling behaviour is observed during two phases: The initial contact phase, where the barge alternately makes contact with the topside, and the compressed interface phase, where the barge is in constant contact with the topside. As waves travel in positive x direction, the barge shows crawling behaviour in negative x direction in the initial contact phase. In the constant compressed phase the barge shows crawling both in negative and positive x direction. During the initial contact phase more friction is applied when the barge moves in positive x direction.<br/><br/>Optimisation runs have shown the influence of the 5 parameters on the crawling behaviour of the barge. Increasing the horizontal damping reduces the crawling distance of the barge. When the friction coefficients are increased the barge reaches a stick condition sooner. With higher coefficients there is also more crawling behaviour in negative direction. Increasing the deballast velocity reduces the crawling distance of the barge. Varying both the horizontal and vertical interface stiffness changes the dynamical behaviour of the barge, and thus also the crawling behaviour.<br/><br/>The case used in this research is a simplified case. Further research into the crawling behaviour, and different behaviour, is needed to model a reverse float-over operation. <br","Stick; Slip; Crawling; Friction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","","","","","",""

However, besides the harsh phenomena that the country, as a whole, is experiencing - increased unemployment and illiteracy rates, poverty, brain drain, population migration, social exclusion, spatial and environmental degradation -, it is also demonstrating a few more, depicting the urgency of interfering. Despite being an important city of the Western Region of Greece, it remains unknown not only for people outside the country but also for the inhabitants of the country itself. Its recognition can not be compared to its former glory of the 19th and 20th centuries, during which it was experiencing a huge production and occupation in the primary sector with exportations of products to many countries. Over the years, along with the crisis, these qualities started to retreat, distorting the local identity. High levels of unemployment, shrinkage of population, environmental degradation, informal settlements, traffic congestion, urban sprawl that undermines the local quality, marginalisation of its components, inadequate infrastructures and public spaces are, in general, its basic characteristics. All of them are fiercely influencing the urban fabric and are clearly evident in the city’s tissue, in the sense of limited qualitative spaces.<br/><br/>This project is a design approach to alleviate the current issues of the city by developing a strategic vision not only for Agrinio itself, but also for the whole region since its qualitative characteristics can benefit each other. The main objective is to re-generate space, and especially the public one, with the belief that the intermediate scale, by using public space as a catalyst within its context, can be used as a strategic urban project , having the power to meld different scales, integrate different programs and spatial qualities, bind a city together, and advert the estrangement of the urban environment. Hence, it is attempted to re-create a spatial narrative of the city, by making use of its public space and heritage. By re-generating space, a strong and distinguishable identity is formed that, in its turn, generates a stronger and more sustainable economy. Ultimately, it redefines the role of the municipality in the context of Greece and brings Agrinio again to the front line of the competitive cities of the country.","economic crisis; public space; urban regeneration; identity; heritage; tourism; intermediate scale; strategic urban project; multi-scalar approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Urban Fabric Studio","38.624783, 21.409433"

Diabetes is one of the largest health care problems globally in terms of prevalence, cost and burden placed on individuals living with diabetes. It impacts these people and people around them every day and remains one of the leading causes of death. Although the great efforts that have been made in the treatment of diabetes care, many patients still do not achieve adequate glycaemic control and experience devastating complications that result in decreased length of and quality of life. Our healthcare system is designed to deliver acute, symptom-driven care, and is therefore poorly configured to effectively treat chronic diseases, and especially diabetes. The proposed design aims to increase the effectiveness of diabetes self-management in adult patients and thereby increase their metabolic control, quality of life and decrease healthcare-related cost.<br/><br/>Fundamentals <br/>The principles of the design are based on extensive literature research, user research, consults with healthcare professionals (HCP) and user participation design. The difficulty of diabetes treatment lies in its complex and personal character. The latter causes that patients cannot surrender the responsibility of diabetes management and are therefore mainly designated to self-management. Patients provide 98 percent of their own care and diabetes is fully woven into the fabric of everyday life. The complexity of diabetes makes self-management a daunting task. The main goal of treatment is to normalise blood glucose levels (BGL) to an as normal state as possible. To gain control over their BGL, patients need to uncover how they respond to a plurality of influencing factors. This does not only mean that they have to acutely adjust to different lifestyle factors, they also have to unveil patterns in their treatment regimen and adjust accordingly. Together, this places a high level of demand on patients and is highly intrusive in a person’s life. <br/><br/>Problem<br/>Besides the issues demonstrated above, user and HCP research revealed barriers to effective self-management. These were categorized in two sets of problems (A) ineffective self-management, which includes (1) lack of reference, (2) lack of knowledge and (3) lack of structure and (B) lack of support from (4) HCPs, (5) social environment and (6) others with diabetes. Together this leads to sub-optimal self-management, decrease in metabolic control, decrease in quality of life, decrease in health status and increase in cost.<br/><br/>Design proposal<br/>Together with patients, a holistic design was developed to support patients in their self-management. The design consists of a physical product supported by a smartphone application (see adjacent page). The essence of the design is described in three key user benefits.<br/><br/>1. Simplify, by providing one place for everything in one clean and simple design, automatically logging most relevant data and enabling the user to effortlessly log relevant contextual factors. <br/><br/>2. Structure, by providing the user with an action plan for self-management, personalised information and meaningful data overviews. <br/><br/>3. Support, by guiding the user with nutrition support, dose calculators, reminders, automation of repetitive actions and personalised feedback and messaging. <br/><br/>Evaluation<br/>The design proposal was evaluated together with patients and HCPs. User evaluation demonstrated that the concept is certainly promising in increasing self-management effectiveness and participants acknowledge the value of the holistic nature of the concept and its features. In addition, healthcare professionals indicate that they see the concept as a great addition to current treatment, think the design has the potential to increase patient insight and would recommend it to their patients. <br/><br/>It is concluded that, although the final design proposal has a huge potential to increase the effectiveness of diabetes self-management, this cannot be fully substantiated within the context of this project and needs to be validated in follow-up long-term research.<br","Diabetes; Self-management; Empowerment; Product-service-system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Since the station and highway, situated directly next to each other, cannot manage the amount of travellers and cars anymore, both have to expand. Unfortunately, the lack of space makes it impossible for both expansions at the same level. So a solution has to be found which makes it possible for both situations to extent. The government has chosen for tunnelling the highway in order to make room for the extension of the train station. An important fact is the desire for a station with an international appeal. Furthermore, the amount of nuisance for the users and visitors of this area should be limited. However, since the fact the Amsterdam South station area, also known as the Zuidas, is Hollands’ most important and busiest business district, locking down the area is certainly not an option. <br/>The main focus of this graduation project will be this extension of the train station. Applying a lightweight and prefabricated material will help limiting the amount of nuisance. Furthermore, Fibre Reinforced Composites (FRP’s) makes freeform architecture relatively easy achievable. This could contribute to the international appeal of the station. However, it is not reasonable and economically feasible to create only custom made moulds in order to produce the FRP elements.

Logistic space become more public now which can also be an exhibition space or study center. Through study of Aldo Rossi’s idea of stable form to a city and the development of Colosseum of Roma, a stable form which made by two thick concrete ‘wall‘ (include all the assistant primary space) can give the most strong identity to Alamar and face to the history and future with no change. In the central spine defined by the ‘wall‘ is the logistic and sharing wooden space which is designed for all Alamar people and workers. This includes restaurants, shop, exhibition, lecture, lessons, etc. On the two sides, steel frame make the flexible workshop which can be a showcase for the city.<br","Complex Projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Project","23.11360, -82.36660"

(mentor)","2017","The Netherlands is a country where people have to live with water, rather than fighting against it. This philosophy often requires interaction between infrastructure and waterways, where (hydraulic) structures are placed close to or even extending in the waterway, introducing the risk of ship collision. What makes this accidental load so problematic is the magnitude of these forces, caused by the combination of a very high mass moving with a sizeable velocity. Since structures are often not able to withstand the high impact energy, this requires the design of separate protective structures. This research focusses on the concept of mitigating these damages, limiting the plastic deformation to specific parts of the structure which can easily be replaced. In order to find an answer to the research question, it is important to gain more insight in the problem of ship collision and the solutions that are currently available. This achieved by gathering available data about shipping accidents that happened in the Netherlands, which show that the problem of ship collision is something that has a large impact on the design of structures, and has been for several years. Solving the problem of ship collision starts with a proper determination of the magnitude and the relation between both the collision energy and the forces required to safely disperse it. The methods prescribed by the Eurocode, the CETMEF and the AASHTO are consulted. Finally an overview of the currently available methods was established. At this stage of the research, some proper insight was gained in how the problem of ship collision was handled in the years leading up to this one. By taking a closer look at the techniques used in other branches, a set of three alternatives was brought up. Before making a selection between the two alternatives, a feasibility study has been executed, validating that the concepts actually worked as expected. A selection between the alternatives was made by a Multi Criteria Analysis, where each of the alternatives was scored on a list of weighed criteria. According to this analysis, the sandwich panels proved to be the better alternative. Since the design has been based solely on assumptions rather than properties of an existing location, a case was introduced. In December of 2016 a ship collided with a section of the weir in Grave, providing for a topical case, hence the design is based on the centre pier of the bridge/weir structure. Based on a combination of the original sketches and a risk analysis carried out a few years ago, it was possible to identify the static loads that act on the centre pier. Minor alterations to the design of the sandwich panels made it possible to fit them to the pier, where the dimensions of the hexagon mesh combined with the properties of the design ship resulted in a value of the resulting collision force on the pier. The high magnitude of the horizontally acting collision force might introduce problems to the stability of the shallow foundation of the structure. The method prescribed by the Eurocode was used to validate the stability of the structure both the current situation and the updated situation where the resulting collision force is acting on the structure. The results of the calculations showed that the structure proved to be stable under each of the checked loading situations. Validation of the stability was the final step of this thesis research. Future research is required to optimise the design and properly model the problem, but the resulting design is a strong starting point for this design problem.","Ship collision; Collision protection; Sandwich panels; RIMOB; Grave; Conceptual design; Hydraulic structure; MCA; Multi-criteria analysis; Feasibility study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","51.768923, 5.735676"

(mentor); Sloff, C.J. (mentor); Rutten, M.M. (mentor)","2017","The Ayeyarwady River is a river with large hydrological variations and an abundance of relatively fine non-cohesive sediment, causing the dynamic behaviour of the river with fast shifting channels. This dynamic behaviour, together with the large hydrological variations, is the source of a frequently flooding river with a moderate navigability. In order to reduce flood risk and to improve navigability, river training measures and sediment management are needed. For an effective and sustainable implementation of these measures, one has to be able to predict the effects of these measures. For braided rivers, of which their behaviour is regarded as complex and hard to predict, this still remains challenging. It requires a good understanding of all the processes playing a role in the morphodynamics of this braided river. The goal of this study was to explore the most dominant of these processes using both satellite imagery and the 2D depth-averaged model Delft3D and to test the ability of the 2D depth-averaged model to simulate the morphodynamics in braided rivers. The main physical processes were found from literature. The physical processes were investigated in an analysis of the system (mainly with satellite imagery), with a sensitivity analysis and with a comparison between model simulations and satellite imagery. The literature study showed that the many processes are related in different ways and all affect the morphology. Since the morphology also influences these processes, a positive feedback exists in which change in one process causes change in the other processes. With large hydrological variations and a large variability in sediment discharge, morphodynamic change can continuously be found. The main driving factor for the dynamics turned out to be the sediment discharge at the upstream end, where vegetation plays a dominant role in the decrease of the dynamics. The actual influence on the dynamics of bank erosion by failure still has to be investigated in more detail, since this was not included in the model. Other processes have minor effect on the dynamics, but do play an important role in how the morphology will develop. This means that they influence widths and depths of the channels and sizes and shapes of the bars. The most important of these processes are the hydrological variations, the sediment transport by primary flow and the deflection of sediment transport by spiral flow and bed-slope effects. With the uncertainty in the sediment discharge and the absence in the model of the processes vegetation and bank erosion by failure, it is impossible make exact predict with the model. The model showed, however, that it is able to simulate local morphodynamics. For engineering purposes, this means the model cannot be used to assess the time and location of erosion and deposition, for that it can be used to asses risk areas for erosion and deposition. In this way it can be used for impact assessment of different human interventions as river training works and sediment management.","Ayeyarwady River; Ayeyarwaddy River; Irawaddy River; braided river; morphodynamics; morphology; sediment transport; Delft3D; satellite imagery; Google Earth Engine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","21.981885, 96.035787"

I took this to mean, in general, ‘movement’ - rather than migration across countries for economic reasons or from danger zones as refugees. Instead, I decided to focus more on how the daily migration of people affects the spaces in which we live, and how this may negatively impact those places where people migrate in and out on a regular basis. <br/><br/>This led me to choosing my site, Slough, based on a daily migration of people in and out of the town for work, resulting in a daily turnover of inhabitants. This will soon be reinforced with the building of Crossrail - a high speed railway line crossing London, bringing central London much closer. In addition, access to Heathrow Airport will be improved, encouraging migration to further afield. The project, as it stands, combines these two aspects of migration as it links the Slough Trading Estate (where much of the daily migration happens), to Heathrow Airport and thus the world. <br/><br/>My case study is about Slough and Heathrow, and in particular what will happen to Slough if Heathrow is to expand, as planned, with a third runway. As something very unpredictable, the project became about how to create a shock absorber in Slough that could take any changes that might happen at Heathrow, which would greatly affect the town of Slough. The daily migration of people in Slough relies on the presence of Heathrow. <br/><br/>The approach of Design as Politics is generally to focus on research about both the project itself, but also a much wider social context. The parameters set by the studio are incredibly wide, which meant that it took a long time for this project to reach a point from which it could be developed. I undertook research into policy surrounding the Heathrow expansion and what this meant in real terms and political terms, as well as looking at plans for Slough and the area I am focusing on - the Trading Estate. This was an interesting approach as it really began from a much bigger picture, from which I had to distill the project down to something specific to the site, but still with the larger intentions. <br/><br/>In a wider social context, the project is not only a hub for Heathrow and the Trading Estate, but acts as a shock absorber for Slough. In uncertain times, where it is unknown whether the airport will decline or expand, the project aims to use architecture to take the shock of any eventuality, ultimately fortifying Slough in terms of economy and liveability through strengthening a partnership with Heathrow. In terms of migration, the scheme aims to balance the difference between those who commute into Slough and those who commute out - a difference which is based on education and skills. <br/><br","Slough; Heathrow Airport; Uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this project is to find shorter paths than the existing ones, without significantly degrading the plan quality. This is done by using Dijkstra’s Algorithm, as well as incorporating Hamiltonian paths and the Traveling Salesman Problem. With these techniques, we developed the OPA (Optimal Path Algorithm): an algorithm that finds Hamiltonian paths through the nodes, combined with the iterated process of interchanging nodes with adjacent ones. With OPA, the traveltimes for the CyberKnife have been brought down by 38.6% on average without degrading the plan quality.","Radiotherapy; Optimisation; CyberKnife; shortest path; Hamiltonian paths; Traveling Salesman Problem","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-06","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

At present, consumers are expecting companies to operate responsibly to address social and environmental issues (59% of global consumers have favourable perceptions of products with ethical or environmental credentials (Canadean, 2016)). Stable long term climate policy is not yet implemented in most developed countries, due to political instability. This makes it hard for countries to take swift action against climate change. In the mean time, conscious consumers are expecting large corporations to take their responsibility and provide them with responsible choices. The HEINEKEN Company wants to act on this problem and made ‘Brewing a Better World’ one of its six business priorities. Packaging accounts for 39% of the total carbon footprint of the HEINEKEN Company and is responsible for the largest part of the company’s CO2 emissions. Therefore the Heineken brand, the flagship brand of the HEINEKEN Company, desires to reduce it’s carbon footprint and will do so by changing their well known icon: the green bottle and its package. The innovation of the iconic bottle is ongoing and secondary complementary packaging needs to be developed to support this sustainable bottle innovation. Even though the paradigm around sustainability is shifting, it is not always associated with ‘premium’ in the eyes of the consumer (only 21% of the global consumers think ethical credentials make food and drink products premium (Nielson, 2016)). However, that is contrary to the vision of Heineken: being the best sold beer in the premium segment worldwide. Therefore the challenge is to boost this paradigm shift. This will be done by focusing on selling Heineken off-premise, through offline retail channels (e.g. supermarkets), hand in hand with making the iconic Heineken beer more environmentally friendly and premium than ever. Therefore, this thesis aims to answer the following question: How to reduce the carbon footprint of Heineken’s secondary packaging in a cool and innovative way to increase both the sustainable and premium perception of Heineken globally? To give an answer to this question, it is important to understand the possible options to reduce the carbon footprint of the existing packaging and prioritize them on their environmental impact and feasibility. Their possible environmental impact is judged with the use of the Circular Economy Framework (EllenMacArthur Foundation) and the Waste Hierarchy Model (Ad Lansink, 1979). The feasibility of the possible solutions on a global scale is studied by visiting suppliers, Heineken’s production lines in Zoeterwoude and talking to employees of different departments. Leading insights for this prioritization are the facts that returnable bottles are eight times more environmentally friendly than recyclable bottles and that only 70% of all glass bottles are currently collected and recycled in the Netherlands (MilieuCentraal, 2016). Solutions must be flexible for future innovations and have the least environmental impact to fully close the loop. Therefore, the possible solutions are: 1. Redesigning existing glass bottle; 2. Redesigning existing carton pack; 3. Increasing the recycling rate; 4. Increasing the volume of returnables; 5. Replacing glass by bio-degradable materials. Next to the environmental impact of packaging concepts, the consumer perception on sustainability and premium plays a key role in the succes of the packaging innovation. By means of qualitative consumer research, insights in these perceptions were gathered. Observations pointed out painpoints in the existing packaging journey, that are used in the ideation phase. Reusable packaging is perceived as having the most impact by the target group, and uniqueness and convenience make packaging premium. Next to this, confidence about a consumer’s beer choice towards friends is an important factor in chosing beer in the supermarket. With the input of the possible solutions priorization, outcomes of the consumer research and trends &amp; developments research, design roadmapping is used to create four future visions with complementary design challenges: Design brief 1: Reduce the packaging material used for one-way packaging and encourage the MOTW to seperate his glass waste to enable recycling of the bottle. Design brief 2A: Redesign the secondary packaging for returnable bottles to create a premium service. Design brief 2B: Enable local beer and packaging production with the use of bio-degradable materials. Design brief 3: Designing a healthy, sustainable and personalised beer consumption experience. The focus of the ideation was on the concept development for design brief 1 and idea directions are developed for the future design briefs and positioned in a roadmap for the Heineken Design team to get inspired. The developed solution consists of a bag made from old Heineken billboards and functions to store and easily dispose empty glass bottles and a mobile application offering the consumer discounts and prices based on the amount of disposed bottles. For the consumer the bag offers support by being more comfortable opposed to the bags and crates currently used for disposal, makes the consumer feel confident by its uniqueness and openly showing care about the environment. The app rewards the consumer afterwards. With this solution, Heineken shows commitment to reduce it’s footprint and the rewarding system is likely to increase sales. The environment benefits from this solution by stimulating the collection of empty glass bottles to increase the recycling rate of glass to 100% in the target markets.","design; sustainability; packaging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Moreover, the proposal, a strategic spatial plan, considers the governance aspect, thought as a key element for making the plan possible.<br/>And although the scope of the proposal goes at district level, it takes into account its context at metropolitan and even regional ones, in order to make a balance of how the proposed projects could have an impact in the bigger tourist route.","Tourism; Spatial Development; Collaborative planning; Sustainable development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The edges of the plateaus fullflil a communicating function together with the urban ensembles that occupy the platform. The development of these separate islands has always gone hand in hand with a specific economic ambition and has been instigated by firstly building a bridge (piece of infrastructure) to the new deserted plateau. In this respect we could classify the various plateaus as follows: Ville Haute plateau war economy and fortifications; Garer plateau, second industrial revolution and steel industry; Cents plateau, suburban lifestyle; Kirchberg plateau, service economy and the European Parliament. Within this system of intertwining plateaus there is one plateau that seems underdeveloped in relation to its potential within the current ambitions of Luxembourg to focus on the third industrial revolution. This plateau I call the fifth plateau.<br/><br/>The “Fifth Plateau” project imagines a new way to catalyse the urbanization of that empty plateau in Luxembourg Ville. It does so by proposing an architecture of an infrastructural scale on the edge of the plateau. By doing so the project, firstly participates in the system of communication of between the various plateaus, secondly provides a programmatic fuel injection to instigate future development. The project is proposed as a 500m long structure that sits on that edge facing the rest of the city. The structure allows for various sections to be hanged from it in accordance to the specific topographic condition. The horizontal surface on top of the Vierendeel trusses functions as a public promenade along the edge and is the address to the various programs below. The program is based on various aspects related to a third industrial revolution and is located in accordance to the opportunities the topography gives. Therefore the data centre is located where the structure enters the ground, where the project bridges a small valley the structure houses the restaurant, convention centre and hotel. The concave slope houses the robotics labs, where the concave slope facilitates the IT laboratories. Finally the soft, almost horizontal slope, closest to the Garer plateau will facilitate maker spaces for public use. The facade is a literal curtain wall that follows the movement of the topography and reflects the various longitudinal sections that facilitate the variety of programmatic elements.<br/><br/>The project is a contemporary approach towards the edge condition in Luxembourg by performing as a light weight, flexible structure that moves with and accentuates the topographical condition of the fifth plateau. It proposes an architecture that addresses the newest economic ambition of Luxembourg, namely The Third Industrial Revolution. It sets out to function as the threshold for the further development of the Fifth plateau so that it can play its role as a new chapter within the history of the development of the plateaus in Luxembourg Ville.<br","Luxembourg; Fifth Plateau; Topography; Third Industrial Revolution; urban catalyst","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","49.60532, 6.14713"

The first part consists of research in all currently available technology that could be used to create such a connection. The following section is about the design process of the AM connection and its engineering. The final part of the research further validates the design by means of structural tests and a rough price comparison to already existing glass connections. <br/><br/>The first part of this research focused on glass connections, additive manufacturing and topology optimization.

The connection was designed with the help of topology optimization. The idea behind the optimization was to reduce the stresses in the glass and to attach the connection to the glass without drilling. The result of the optimization was a connection that has the shape of a line and that would be bonded to the glass with Transparant Silicone Structural Adhesive better known as TSSA. This connection consists of a number of different elements. The first is a separate AM piece that would be laminated to the glass and could be inserted into the remainder of the joint that connects four corners of four different glass plates. The second element is adapted to allow for the free movement of the glass panels by locally removing material so it would be weaker in one direction. Alternatively, it is given a power joint, which is a rubber joint that allows for movement in all directions. This connection was calculated multiple times to see how the connection would perform.<br/><br/>In the final part of this thesis the joint itself was researched to further validate the connection. This was done by making a prototype of the connection to see how everything could work and if it was actually suitable for production. For this validation, process a number of tests were done on smaller specimens to show how strong the material is and to give validation to the calculations.

Although many issues,<br/>like drinking water, have been solved locally,<br/>but a stable electricity infrastructure cannot<br/>be provided by the people themselves. The<br/>instability of the electricity is traceable to<br/>the construction period. Alamar was built<br/>on the infrastructure of its previous plan.<br/>Plan ‘El Olympo’ was meant to become an<br/>American style suburb. The current 100.000<br/>inhabitants of Alamar are living in self-built<br/>prefab apartment blocks, which are built on<br/>the infrastructure designed for only 1/5th of<br/>the population. Subsequently, this overuse<br/>and material scarcity in times of construction<br/>resulted in the instability of the electricity<br/>net to withstand even the smallest storms.<br/>Heavy rainfall or strong winds can already<br/>result in power cuts. These black-outs can<br/>last up to three days. For a country that is<br/>on the edge of new prosperity, improvement<br/>of the living standard is impossible on such<br/>an instable foundation. Imagine Alamar<br/>growing in numbers of inhabitants on such<br/>infrastructure, the first thing we need to do is<br/>providing a stable electricity flow.

This paper argues that different metaphors/analogies play different roles to support different cognitive processes in urban design and planning, by constructing a framework to clarify the contexts, roles, and characteristics of M-A thinking. With case analyses, it further demonstrates that distinct characteristics related to the different roles can be explained with underlying cognitive patterns “organising” basic-form M-As, and that these patterns are inter-transformable. This framework could help lay the foundation of systematic research on this subject in urban design and planning, leading to addressing its wider implications.","metaphor; analogy; Urban design; planning; design cognition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Design of the Urban Fabric","",""

This controller changes the incoming DC voltage into an AC voltage of a variable frequency and RMS amplitude. The disadvantages of switching inverters, compared to a pure sine wave source, are the harmonics they inject in both the output as in the input of the inverters connection. At the incoming power line, it is necessary to damp these harmonics, in order to avoid resonance issues or issues regarding other systems, for instance, train detection. For this purpose of harmonic and transient filtering, generated within as well as outside the train, an LC filter is utilised. <br/>However, this LC-filter has also influence on stability. Due to the resulting impedance to current variation in the inductance of the LC-filter, the power flow dynamics towards the train are decreased. When applying a certain amount of power, the voltage over the capacitance can become unstable very quickly. In this thesis, a graphical user interface simulation model is made to simulate these stability phenomena in Simulink in order to find the optimum size of the LC-filter in a train on the Dutch DC railway. <br/><br/>The simulations are achieved with a model representing a generalised train. The model is simple to modify, and consists of the important parts for determining the stability of the system. <br/><br/>Different simulations have been carried out, in order to examine the effect certain parameter variations have on the stability. Two systems have been considered, a constant power controlled system and a system where the motors had no controlling regime. An important factor is the value of the capacitance and inductance. A larger filter inductor results in an unstable system. Likewise, implementing a higher value capacitance will cause the system to be more stable.<br/>Simulations have shown that a motor controller with a simple constant power control regime is unstable with normal values for the inductance and capacitance. However a damping branch can solve this problem up to an extent. A system without any controlling regime has proven to be more stable with smaller capacitance.<br/><br/>By utilising the model presented in this thesis, the stability of the system, consisting purely of a controlled constant power load or as a non-controlled load, can be investigated, and the impact of the LC-filter can be determined.<br","DC; railway; traction; power; stability; input; filter; LC; RC; resonance; train; ProRail; NS; Dutch","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

(mentor); M. de Jong, Minne (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Integration of bifacial photovoltaic module with a noise barrier (PVNB) has emerged as one of the promising innovation in the building integrated PV (BIPV) system application. By having the advantage to absorb both the light incident from the front and the rear side of the cell, bifacial PV module is suitable for a vertical installation especially when the module is configured to facing west and east direction. However, by nature, PVNB has some limitations that prevent the system to operate in its optimal condition. First, the azimuth of the module cannot be chosen freely, as it has to follow the orientation of the road. Furthermore, the carrying support structures induce an unavoidable self-shading to the rear surface of the bifacial module itself and substantially reduce the power generation of the bifacial PV module.<br/><br/>This project aims to provide a guideline in optimizing bifacial PVNB design to overcome the aforementioned limitations of PVNB application. This study employs a versatile energy yield model that was fully developed in a Python environment. The modeling framework couples a cell-level shading calculation based on vector algebra approach with a high-resolution electrical model that consider bypass diodes configurations in the module. To model the electrical characteristics of bifacial solar cells, two diodes equivalent circuit was modified to have two current sources that represent the contribution of the front and the rear side illuminations. Furthermore, the reliability of the model was proven by the good validation result between the model and long-term experimental data. <br/><br/>The results of this work show that the south-facing bifacial PVNB, in the case of the Netherlands, has the best yield performance when being inclined 15 from vertical. In contrast, the north oriented bifacial PVNB yield more energy when being installed strictly vertical. Whereas, a consistent performance was shown by the east and west facing module when the tilt angle was varied. Furthermore, the result of the annual energy loss caused by shading is in the range of 1% to 12% for different orientations. Six different bypass diodes layout scenarios were considered in the study. It was demonstrated that the energy yield loss induced by the shading can be mitigated significantly by applying a proper bypass diodes configuration in the module. Another efficient alternative to mitigate the shading that was investigated is by placing the cells away from the structures. Though the analysis focus on one specific PVNB design, the insights derived from this study are generally applicable for any future bifacial PVNB projects.","Bifacial; photovoltaic; BIPV; noise barrier; modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The performed data analysis shows that technological superiority, compatibility and brand reputation and credibility stand as key factors for technology dominance in this particular case according to experts. Furthermore, eight additional factors are found to be relevant for this technology battle. This research study contributes to scientific literature by delivering a first indication of which factors are relevant, and how important these are, for the standards battle between battery and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles. These findings may be useful for assessing other technology battles in the automotive industry as well as in similar sectors.

These global fields represent the objectives of the swarm, which are balanced with local interaction. Different fields are considered leading to still or sustained motion swarms where conflicting objectives between sub-groups or multiple swarms are gracefully resolved. The approach is implemented on groups of 2 and 4 Parrot Bebop UAVs, using an efficient on-board vision algorithm to locate neighbours and a motion tracking system for guidance. The experiments show promising results for further outdoor tests assessing the scalability of the proposed approach.","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; Autonomous Swarming; Computer Vision; Distributed systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

Their development has followed unique trends in different areas of the world, with sudden surges followed by down periods. The property industry is a supplier of capital goods, so demand for property is inevitably linked to the demand for investment goods in the economy as a whole. It supplies space and is affected by the economic factors that cause more or less demand. From a global perspective, we can expect skyscrapers development to follow finance to some degree, especially by clustering most projects in locations with high accessibility and low cost of capital, targeted by foreign investment and with positive expectations of financial growth. The symbolism of tall buildings has stimulated height competitions throughout the world, while their iconicity has attracted different kind of users. New technologies have allowed to reach new heights as well as making prohibitive applications feasible through research and development. As time evolves, new systems and applications are made available to reach height easier and cheaper. Over 70% of the world supply of skyscrapers have been built in the past 10 years, in an ever-growing pattern. In previous research, it has been suggested that there is a strong interrelationship between business cycles and skyscrapers development, yet this has never been measured at global level.

These complex large scale systems can be modeled by a broad class of hybrid dynamical systems. The current practice of controlling such processes is one way, from the scheduling level to the control level. The performance of these complex systems can be improved by allowing an exchange of information between both the scheduling and control level. <br/><br/>Although the techniques derived in this thesis are applicable to general class of hybrid systems, this thesis focuses on a railway network. This network, or a part of it, is modeled so that information at regular time instances can be sent to a dynamic scheduler which outputs an optimal schedule back to the control level, based on the current conditions in the network.<br/><br/>To this end, the railway system is abstracted into a Discrete-event system (DES). Essentially, the abstraction removes the continuous dynamics of a hybrid dynamical model and replaces them with discrete-events. All these discrete-events together form the railway network as a DES. Furthermore, the DES is modeled in max-plus algebra such that a Max-plus linear (MPL) is obtained.<br/><br/>The scheduling problem is solved by a Model predictive control (MPC) scheme which is solved by a Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. For this scheme, the MPL model is converted into a Switching max-plus linear (SMPL) model which is written as a set of mixed-integer linear constraints. In contrast to the scheduler which only contains a macroscopic model of the railway network, the trajectory planner includes microscopic constraints. Therefore, to complete the scheduling, the schedule found by the scheduler is iterated between the scheduler and a trajectory planner for further improvements. A part of a railway network is studied in a case study, showing that updating the schedule results in less delay in case a delay is introduced.","abstraction; Hybrid System; real time scheduling; railway management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Meanwhile, an increasing amount of (3D) data becomes available which is now mostly visualised with 2D screens, while there exists a plenitude of complex urban problems that could potentially benefit from the use of this data. Also, our cities are still mainly designed with traditional design methods such as sketches on paper and unintuitive CAD software.

Autonomous and shared mobility is the most talked about topic in the world of transport today. Self-driving shared vehicles will have a huge impact on urban life as they will begin to question the distinction between private and public transportation modes. This mobility trend will help in reducing time of travel with almost 80 percent fewer cars. The reduction in the number of cars on road will lead to changes in environment, traffic, congestion issues, efficiency, cost of road building and maintaining, urban sprawl and parking. With fewer cars, vast amount of land under parking, which is observed quite often in most cities today, could be freed for other public uses, thus changing the urban form of the city as we know it. Therefore, it is time for Transport Planners and Urban Designers to concentrate on this field of development and investigate the possible impact of Autonomous mobility on the city and space to reap maximum benefits in future. This project will explore the consequences of this mobility trend through scenario based studies with a thorough analysis of the possibilities for the city of Amsterdam and speculate how this will transform the city in future.","future; autonomous; urban form; space; car sharing; smart mobility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","","52.37020, 4.89520"

Though the computational power has steadily increased in the past few decades, resolving the complete range of scales from the largest scales up to the Kolmogorov scales can be very complicated and time consuming for moderately high Reynolds numbers as well. Hence, DNS is still expected to be a research tool to study relatively simple flows and geometries for the forseeable future unlike its counterparts such as Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and Reynolds Averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) methods. The main objective of DNS studies is to study the flows so that turbulence models which are parametrized can be improved upon with the physical insight from the results of DNS. It also helps in studying the effect of numerical methods and techniques applicable to real flows and their stand-alone effects without any type of modeling as done for LES or RANS.<br/><br/>This thesis is concerned with the DNS study of a compressible turbulent jet. A turbulent jet belongs to the class of free turbulent flows, in the sense that, it is not bounded physically. In this thesis, the transport of a passive scalar through the jet is studied. At higher Reynolds numbers, for convection dominated equations such as the scalar transport equation, discontinuities can occur due to the hyperbolic nature of the equations. When central methods are used, oscillations are observed in the regions of the discontinuities. These oscillations can make the solution unphysical. Therefore, in this thesis the scalar transport equation has been modeled with an additional Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) interpolation to accurately capture the discontinuities without oscillations. The WENO interpolation is combined with central compact finite difference methods to reduce the numerical dissipation while maintaining the order of accuracy in the smooth regions which is essential in high Reynolds number flows. <br/><br/>It was observed that a high dissipation setting for the WENO interpolation removed the oscillations but introduced artificial numerical viscosity. Therefore a relatively large domain was used with a low dissipation which while removing the oscillations and reducing the numerical dissipation. The WENO method for the compressible turbulent jet was first validated with experimental results to ascertain the accuracy of the grid resolution. The same grid resolution was used to study some properties of the jet at two different Schmidt numbers at a slightly lower Reynolds number. It was observed that the results obtained with the WENO interpolation matched well with the experimental results while being physical valid solutions because they had no oscillations. The results also showed different modes of instabilities for different Schmidt numbers and that the decay rate is a good characterization of the properties of the turbulent jet.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the WENO methods can be a very helpful method to accurately capture the discontinuities in an efficient manner and is also suitable for methods such as LES and RANS to model flows that have some hyperbolic nature of terms in the governing equations.","CFD; DNS; Turbulence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research is accompanied by a proposed redesign exploiting the advantageous properties of FRP and a life cycle assessment (LCA) of multiple FRP variants’ environmental impact compared to an existing steel variant. The subject of this case study is the Amaliabridge over the Gouwe canal in Gouda.The thesis was performed during an internship at Movares Adviseurs &amp; Ingenieurs, a Dutch engineering and consultancy firm, among others specialised in movable bridges. The goal of the project was to ascertain how the environmental impact of an FRP movable bridge redesign would compare to the original steel design of the Amaliabridge. The scope of this thesis did not cover the mechanical analysis of the redesign and therefore does not provide a fully accurate representation, rather an indicative and explorative result that asks for further investigation.The resulting design is a rolling bascule type movable bridge, eliminating the need for a bascule basement as is required in a trunnion type bascule bridge. This leads to significantly less design, engineering and construction efforts. Additionally, the design aims at reusability, prolonging the lifespan of the bridge as much as possible.The environmental impact assessments yielded partially questionable results. A Cradle to Gate analysis was performed, in which the FRP variants performed better compared to steel variants. A Cradle to Cracle analysis was also performed, where FRP variants performed significantly less, as their End of Life scenario’s accounted for a significantly higher impact compared to the steel variants. These differences are probably caused by an allocation error and are therefore not regarded as proof of FRP performing better or worse compared to steel.","FRP; Fibre Reinforced Polymers; Movable bridge; Sustainability; Environmental impact; Durability; Rolling bascule bridge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

The company is currently working on aiding teachers in aligning course material and assessment. Aligning the two provides students with clear expectations and can lead to an increase in learning [1]. Aligning course material and assessment is usually done by comparing what the students are taught to how students are assessed. When a student is assessed by an exam consisting of questions, the alignment process involves classifying these questions according to the cognitive process categories needed to answer them[2].<br/>This process can be time consuming if an exam contains many questions it, and it can be easy to lose oversight of whether the questions in the assessment are representative of what is taught in the course material. The task of classifying questions into categories that represent the cognitive processes needed to answer them can be facilitated by providing a classification tool. This tool also gives educators insight by displaying a summary of the different question categories present in a set of questions. As part of the solution to the problem of course alignment, FeedbackFruits requested the development of a question<br/>classifier which classifies questions according to the cognitive process required to answer them. Bloom’s revised taxonomy (subsection 2.1.1) is a taxonomy that categorizes questions and learning objectives into six distinct classes in the cognitive process domain. We propose a software solution that uses machine learning techniques to classify a courses’ questions and provides a clear overview of the classes in Bloom’s revised taxonomy present in these courses. To achieve this, we built a training set and test set by combining a preexisting labeled dataset from Anwar Ali Yahya, Addin Osama, et al. [5] and a self labeled<br/>dataset of over 1500 samples. We engineered a set of features specific to short text samples and questions. We adopted an experimental approach in selecting the classifier model: we tested several different models throughout the project and picked the best performing models as final step. When looking up Bloom’s taxonomy it is often presented with lists of class specific keywords. We replicated a study [3] that makes use of keywords that are indicative of the class in Bloom’s taxonomy to set a baseline to compare our model to. We ran our model and the model of the baseline study on the same test set. Our model scored an accuracy of 75% compared to the baseline model which scored an accuracy of 40%.","machine learning; question classification; bep project; feedbackfruits","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

In momentum theory, flow is assumed to be steady, stationary, in-compressible and in-viscid. But in reality, wind turbines operate in very unsteady conditions such as gust, pitching, yawing, turbulence, etc. So, it is important to study an actuator disk wake under unsteady loading. <br/>In this project, cyclic unsteady loading on an actuator disk is studied. The main research objective is to study the behaviour of wake behind an actuator disk under cyclic unsteady loading. As learnt during the literature review, only a small number of studies have been dedicated to this research topic. In order to fulfil the objective, an experimental approach is taken. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is used to acquire data in order to study the flow field behind the disk. Actuator disk is modelled using a porous disk. The porosity of the disk is used change the rate of change unsteadiness. This disk's porosity ranged between 14%-65%. The disk porosity was modified sinusoidally to simulate the effect of cyclic loading. The wake for steady loading was captured up to 1 rotor diameter downstream and 0.8 rotor diameters in radial direction. For unsteady load cases, data was collected up to 2 rotor diameters. For unsteady loading, three different reduced frequencies (k) were tested. The load on the disk was estimated using momentum integration of the flow field. Finally, the results from the experiment were compared to the velocity fields estimated using Vortex Ring (VR) method.","actuator disc; wind turbines; PIV; unsteady loading; dynamic inflow; Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-06-07","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Duinkerken, M.B. (mentor); Gorte, Frank B. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Since online shopping was invented in 1979 there has been a major shift in the way people shop. More than 40% of the clothing and footwear and more than 35% of the home electronics are bought online in the Netherlands. Grocery shopping in the e-commerce market. This, and the fact that over 92% of the Dutch population has access to internet implies that there is a huge market gat for e-grocers. Predictions are made that the market share of e-grocers will grow from the current 2% to at least 5% in 2025. <br/>At the moment the e-grocery market is dominated by traditional supermarket who also delivery online shopping as a service to the client, the so called click-and-mortar concept. Currently 55% percent of the market is owned by AH followed but not yet threatened by other supermarkets like Jumbo and Spar. In August 2015 however an online-only supermarket, a so called pure player, opened named Picnic. Because of the fact that they are a pure player gives them confidence that they can compete in this market. Since the opening of Picnic has grown to just above 9000 orders per week in January 2017 when the maximum capacity of the first fulfilment centre was reached. The aim of Picnic is to continue a with a growth of around 5% per week which comes with a lot of challenges, starting with the fact that a new fulfilment centre had to be opened in February 2017. The ambition of Picnic is to deliver high service to the customer with lowest price guarantee which means the processes at the fulfilment centres should run as efficient and as smooth as possible. <br/>In literature there is a lot to be found about supply chains in general and more specific about e-grocer supply chains. It has become clear that there are several pit falls for e-grocers to recon with. First of all there last-mile delivery is relatively very expensive. Furthermore, over investment in automation, weak negotiation power, customer acquisition and low ordering frequency are reasons why online grocers have failed in the past. Unfortunately, there is little known about the effect of fast growth on the supply chain, let alone the effect on the supply chain of an e-grocer. <br/>In order to give a well-founded advice in how to improve the upstream supply chain of Picnic while adapting to the fast predicted growth, the following research question is defined:<br/>How can the additional costs due to disturbances of an upstream supply chain of an e-grocer be <br/>reduced while accommodating expected rapid future growth?<br/>To answer this question a research methodology is developed consisting out of five steps: literature research, analysis of the current process, design (synthesis of the two previous steps) , assessment and conclusions and recommendations. <br/>From the literature research and the analysis it can be concluded that the process in the FC consist out of seven steps: the inbound, receiving, replenishing, picking, storing, consolidating and shipping. In a happy flow all of these processes work without disturbances ergo, all the items are delivered at the FC and are on the shelves as expected. This would mean all the order lines would be shipped completely. When something goes wrong extra costs are involved and it has been researched what can be done to reduce these additional costs. It has also been found that the rush order process is highly inefficient and store picking is relatively expensive.<br/>It has been found that there are eight root causes which lead to unexpected shortages in the FC: un-orderable products, shortage at supplier, delivery failure, receiving’s mistake, unexpected clearance, non-fifo picking, quality buffer and stock mismatch. These unexpected shortages have either no consequence (other than a stock adjustment) or a rush order, store pick, substitute or a cancelled order line, of which respectively no consequence is the most desirable and cancelled order line is the least desirable effect. After an extensive data analysis it was found that delivery failures had the most negative impact on the processes in the FC, followed by stock mismatches and non fifo picking. Also, the rush order process appeared to be highly inefficient since it is designed for picking much larger amount of items and the store pick procedure is relatively expensive. <br/>The results from the analysis phase have led the creation of five design alternatives: reduction of delivery failures (RDF), improvement of insight in the FC (IWI), direct delivery (DD), different store pick procedure (DSPP) and an improvement of the rush order process (IRP). Here the reduction of delivery failures is chosen because of the clear advantages for both the supplier and the e-grocer. Improvement of the insight in the FC is wanted since the consequences of an stock mismatch are relatively often a substitute or a cancelled order line which are highly unwanted. Since the performance of the supplier is so essential for the e-grocer, the alternative of (partly) direct delivery instead of using the DC of Boni as a buffer, is also taken into account. Improving the rush order processes and changing the store pick procedure are chosen as alternatives since both processes were labelled as inefficient so there is room for improvement.<br/>These alternatives are subsequently assessed using a Monte Carlo simulation with as input the root cause distribution of the different alternatives. This input resulted in a distribution of effects which were subsequently the input for an extra costs calculator. These extra costs per day (and per order) were used as a key performance indicator to compare the alternatives. Furthermore as an input the predicted growth scenario 5% per week was chosen. <br/>First of all it can be seen in both figures that all alternatives initially lead to more extra costs. This is due to investments needed to enable the different alternatives. In Figure 1 the influence of the performance of the supplier can be clearly seen. A reduction of delivery failures leads ultimately to relatively lower costs in contradiction to the worse performance of direct delivery. Changing the store pick procedure results in extra substitutes and cancelled order lines which that leads to extra costs. <br/>The influence of improvement of insight in the FC is better shown in Figure 2 where at low order amounts the extra costs to enable the extra insight outweigh the advantages. At higher order amounts above 3500, extra costs are saved compared to the current situation. The same goes for improvement of the rush order process.<br/>It can be concluded from the research that the reliability of the deliveries are essential for the performance of the FC. Therefore it is recommended that both the supplier (Boni) as Picnic look for solutions in reducing the amount of delivery failures. Furthermore, when direct delivery is necessary because of the limited capacity of Boni, clear performance deals should be made with the suppliers which ought to be checked, automatically if possible. Here the delivery performance of Boni can be used as benchmark.","e-grocer; Supply chain; Root cause analysis; Monte Carlo simulation model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Transport Engineering and Logistics","","52.2298913, 5.465872900000022"

A solution is to design an electric brake system in which the brakes are controlled electronically instead of mechanically. The report discusses the control models associated with braking, anti-sway detection and velocity sensor fusion. The RDW requires the force between the car and trailer to be regulated to zero within 0.6 seconds. The internal model based control method is used to design the controller. Test results show that the controller responds quick enough and is robust to disturbances. For the anti-sway detection, a calibration model is constructed that transforms the sensor data from the sensor’s reference frame to the trailer’s reference frame. Simulations with empirical data have verified the functionality of the calibration model. The angular yaw rate measured by a gyroscope can be used for anti-sway detection. A curve can be created that shows the relationship between the maximum allowed yaw rate and the velocity. In addition to that, an orientation model is constructed that can estimate the Euler angles and the gravity vector with a complementary filter. Consequently, the dynamic acceleration can be extracted obtained from the accelerometer. Several sensors are mounted to the E-Brake that can determine the velocity. A decentralised Kalman fusion filter is designed to estimate the velocity from the acceleration, velocity and GPS data.","bachelor thesis; electrical brake; sway; kalman; filter; control system; sensor fusion; IMU; orientation model; Internal model based approach; microcontroller; microprocessor; E-Brake; trailer","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","","","","Electrical Engineering","EE3L11 Bachelor graduation project Electrical Engineering",""

The thesis is part of the course EE3L11 - Bachelor Afstudeer Project and took place from April 2017 until July 2017.<br/><br/>This document describes the development of a system that is able to drive electric drum brakes, the brake control unit (BCU). The BCU is a subsystem of a larger project; a braking system that minimizes the force between a trailer and a car when braking. The ultimate goal is to let the trailer completely brake for itself. <br/><br/>To achieve this, two other subgroups have designed a control algorithm and a force sensor readout circuit that measures the force. The BCU receives a desired braking force from the control algorithm that should be exerted in order to eliminate the force between car and trailer.<br/>This input force covers a certain range, so the BCU should be designed such that the braking force of the brakes can be regulated. For this purpose a power supply, current controller and lookup table are designed.<br/><br/>The developed power supply is able to provide a constant voltage to the solenoids inside the electric brakes. The power supply consists of a DC/DC converter, which is powered from a car battery. As a consequence, the input voltage of the DC/DC converter is dependent on the state of charge of the battery. Nevertheless, the output of the designed converter is able to provide a constant DC voltage with a maximum current of 8 A.<br/><br/>The designed current controller makes use of a PWM driven current source, which controls the output current of the DC/DC converter. Besides this source, an algorithm that estimates the duty cycle of the PWM signal is derived, based on the desired current through the solenoid. <br/><br/>Last, a lookup table is implemented that determines which current is needed for specific input forces. The table makes use of inter- and extrapolation between measured test results to calculate the right current for every input force.<br","Electric brakes; Electric trailers; Brake controller; DC/DC converter; Current controller; E-Brake; E-Trailer; Bachelor thesis","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

The excessive use of ""conventional"" energy is bringing planet Earth to its knees. However, people started recognizing the value of renewable energy sources.<br/>One of the major renewable sources is the wind energy. The wind energy can be divided in two categories; onshore and offshore wind energy. Offshore wind energy has many advantages in comparison with onshore but comes with a major disadvantage, the installation cost. Since installing an offshore wind turbine is far more complex than installing the same wind turbine onshore, different ways needs to be developed to compensate for the excess costs.<br/>Even though the cost is a significant aspect, it is not the most critical one. Since<br/>more power is required, bigger offshore wind turbines are needed, thus larger foundation structures and bigger water depths. The conventional Jack-Up Barge that was being used for such operations so far is driving to a saturation on its operability due to limitations on maximum crane capacity and maximum water depth. For the aforementioned reasons, a floating vessel is considered to install bigger foundations but this leads to the loss of fixed ground that the Jack-Up Barge provided. This creates a significant problem that motions are generated and disturb the installation process. For this reason, a compensating strategy should be developed to allow such installations.<br/>Such solution comes from TWD with the Motion Compensating Pile Gripper. In order to reduce the installation costs and to allow installation of wind turbines in higher depths of water, a floating vessel has to be deployed instead of the conventional Jack-Up Barges. The use of a floating vessel though, generates motions that disturb the installation procedure. This is the reason that TWD came up with a compensating gripper. This gripper uses hydraulic cylinders to generate forces for the monopile and vessel in order to counteract unwanted motions and to keep the monopile in the required position.<br/>In this thesis, initially a functional design is conducted. This analysis concludes with the possible design strategies that can restrict the monopile through the lowering operation. After the possible design strategies are established, a simulation model is generated that involves environmental loads, a vessel model, a monopile model and a gripper model.<br/>Through that simulation model, the different alternatives are tested and imulated<br/>in order to evaluate the performance of each and observe their responses. Finally, after all the alternatives are simulated, a Multi-Criteria Analysis takes place that evaluates each one of the possible strategies based on various criteria in order to conclude to the winning strategy that is then suggested to be implemented in the lowering operation of the monopile erection process.","monopile; floating vessel; pile gripper; Dynamic positioning; control strategies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","","","","","",""

In order to gradually develop an architectural brief for the eventual design, a number of case studies has been examined in various forms: visual, logistic, social, cultural, economic. This original fascination based on the availability, aesthetics and intimacy of the public interior observed in the existing spaces opened up a wider field of literary research towards a profound understanding of the theoretical background of DIY in a historical context. The analysis of self-made creation– mainly related to domestic crafts and home improvement–has been directed to the relationship between consumption and production as the programmatic challenge for the architectural assignment. As per now, the processes around DIY are rather clearly separated and manifested in both urban and suburban conditions where public retail facilities offer materials and tools for the assembly in the private domain. Popular media and illustrative manuals have proven that the educational function of such activities is an essential part of its nature, a potential platform to show, explain, exhibit, inspire, share, help and collaborate. The digitalisation of knowledge in forms of instructions, ideas and models has isolated amateur practice as much as the exchange of immaterial information has established an own social space. The thesis takes these conclusions as a starting point to find a way of giving DIY a pyhsical platform to bring together interests, competences and cultures by creating an urban model where building materials can be purchased, collected, reused, processed and exhibited for the benefit of the chosen neighbourhood. The economic circulation of things and thus actions aim to contribute to an identity-establishing institution for, within and through the area.<br/>In parallel to the phenomenological investigation on the cultural conditions, a design brief has gradually been assembled to turn the personal fascination into a critical execution of an architectural programme. Being part of an open studio with a variety of themes, the choice of a legitimate site for the intervention has been a crucial part of the research. Since the means of production at hand demand an adaptive and yet framed context for its future use, the selected place offers a infrastructural foundation while being open for spatial transformation. After having tested scenarios in which the desired activities are directly inserted into an existing related typology, it has been logical to occupy a mostly vacant building in the city of Rotterdam that currently hosts workspaces for creative professionals, a social cooperative, a second hand material shop and an open event space. ""Het Gebouw"" is the focal point of the Zomerhofkwartier and works as an identity- establishing object for events, workshops and think-tanks for local transformations. The existing network of interests–consisting of a social housing company, active neighbours, social workers and schools–creates the ideal framework for the proposed agenda.","DIY; Material Culture; Appropriation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Interiors Buildings Cities","",""

This stress reaction includes persistent re-experiencing (nightmares, flashbacks, memories), changes in arousal (hyper-vigilance or self-destructive behavior), persistent avoidance of trauma related stimuli and negative emotional state. It is estimated that around 4% of Dutch veterans suffer from PTSD.<br/>There are currently two therapies that have been researched enough to proclaim an effectiveness of around 70 percent: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). But they can be very hard to complete and it still leaves around 30 percent behind. Furthermore, this type of research often excludes more difficult cases with co-morbidity. For them the focus is often more on stabilization and symptom reduction. One of the ways that symptom reduction is attempted, is by teaching relaxation exercises, including breathing techniques. <br/>It is envisioned that a veteran with PTSD can always have a product with him that, in a way, understands him and can physically respond. A product that can distract when it senses a distressing flashback/intrusion, can physically help to calm down when needed and communicate how the veteran is doing. <br/>Research into existing projects and products showed there are already many products that can detect rising stress level. They can give some type of feedback. Some give a warning with audio or some vibration. Others show how to breathe calmer with tones or a visual bar or graph. But none give a strong physical stimuli to calm down. <br/>A promising way to distract and calm down in an unobtrusive, yet strong way, is alternating pressure around the abdominal area. It can help calm down by inducing calmer and deeper breathing, comforting pressure, distract when needed (bring attention back to the present), and communicate about stress levels. <br/>A first user test indicates that pressure can distract and induce slower breathing. But a test setup that can be controlled more precisely is needed to make a definitive conclusion. <br/>Using solid state actuators to generate this pressure turned out to be problematic. Although they have the advantage of being very compact and silent, the actuators that could generate enough force - nylon supercoiled polymer and nitinol - turned out to require a high temperature for actuation (&gt;70°C) and also needed significant bias force to move back to the original position. This severely limits their use in a product around the body, requiring significant isolation material and restrictions on the actuation time. They are also very inefficient, 95%, is lost as heat. Therefore they require a larger power source. <br/>Using conventional electro motors provides significant challenges. They are very efficient and can be made inaudible to the human ear, but this is only done for application where it is absolutely necessary. There is no standard solution available for generating a high force in a large but very thin package that is inaudible to the human ear. Getting to an acceptable size will provide a significant challenge. Using an electro motor does seem more promising than a solid state actuator, especially for building a prototype that can be used to test the effect. <br/>The embodiment for the concept is a ‘belt’ that can be worn around the abdominal area. Three prototypes were built. The first was mainly to show the concept, with a simple cheap servo motor, a sensor to detect breathing and pressure sensors for communication. The second prototype used large flat silent stepper motors, but because of several problems it did not work properly. The last prototype contains a somewhat oversized DC motor, to be sure that it will deliver enough force to test the basic effect. <br/>The basic effect was tested with prototype 3, with 8 students from the TU-Delft. Most participants found it calming and comfortable. Some found it constricting and unpleasant. Most adapted their rhythm and were distracted from their thoughts. More research should be done to further develop and verify this. <br/>A design proposal shows what the eventual product can look like and gives direction to further development.<br","Post Traumatic Stress Disorder","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

A software program is used for this purpose. As extra hardware components have been added to the cryostat, the existing program does no longer fulfill the requirements. For this reason a new software program, which can monitor temperatures of all components and start control processes, is developed. The developed program consists of a client server structure. The server handles the logic of the cryostat using several controllers. It can send data to a native client, which is the graphical user interface, or a REST API. The native client displays sensor readouts received from the server and allows full control of server, which means it can start the cool down process as well as manual control processes. The REST API allows the user to have full control over the server using a Python script to achieve measurements which cannot be done from the native client. The increased automation, improved control and ability to integrate with external Python scripts allow the user to focus on the essential parts of an experiment making the developed program an improvement over the previous program.","Cryostat; Control; Refrigirator; Application; Temperature Control; Networking","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Volumetric particle image velocimetry (PIV) is well suited for the study of such flows. The introduction of Helium Filled Soap Bubbles (HFSB) for wind tunnel measurements has pushed the achievable measurement domains using state-of-the-art tomographic PIV systems to the order of 50 liters. Despite the dramatic increase in the measurement volume size by the introduction of HFSB, the observation volumes in tomographic PIV are still relatively limited. Further, the system complexity is high, constraining optical access on complex geometries and prohibiting a rapid repositioning of the measurement domain.<br/><br/>To address the identified need of large-scale volumetric flow field measurements around complex geometries, a novel robotic PIV approach is presented. The proposed method relies on a coaxial volumetric velocimetry probe comprising four high speed cameras at low tomographic aperture, aligned with the illumination. The compact system greatly enhances optical access and it gives rise to a universal calibration, meaning that it can take full advantage of robotic manipulations. Therefore, large domains can rapidly be partitioned into a series of adjacent sub-volume measurements, controlling the velocimeter position by means of a robotic arm. <br/><br/>The feasibility of the proposed system is demonstrated in a study of the near flow field around a full-scale replica of a time-trialling cyclist at 14 m/s. 450 time-resolved volumetric PIV measurements are acquired to compound the time-averaged flow field on a 2 m³ domain. The analysis of the flow topology developing around the cyclist shows good agreement with available literature and it indicates the potential of the proposed robotic PIV approach in other engineering applications. <br","Particle Image Velocimetry; Coaxial Volumetric Velocimetry; Robotic PIV; Aerodynamics; Lagrangian particle tracking; Flow measurements; Large scale; Industrial applications; Helium filled soap bubbles; Optical access; Cycling aerodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-07-05","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

This model is made by using the Rouse model for the gel network and the tracer polymer.<br/>The overdamped Langevin equation is then used to nd a set of coupled stochastic dierential equations for the motion of a single tracer bead and the Fourier modes of the gel particles. The single particle system is then analyzed using three dierent numerical methods: The Euler forward method, the Metropolis Monte Carlo method and the Gillespie algorithm. The Gillespie algorithm is then used to expand the single particle model to a model which again includes a tracer polymer instead of a single tracer bead. The simulations of the tracer polymer suggest that the motion of the tracer polymer is superdiusive. This contradicts the theory and the measurements of the single<br/>tracer particle, which suggest that the simulation of the polymer should result in subdiusion. This contradiction seems to be caused by an error in the implementation of the interaction between the dierent beads that make up the tracer polymer, as it creates a tendency for the polymer to move away from its original position. This possible error is hinted at by a simulation of the system with the tracer polymer where the gel is considered stationary. The simulation implies superdiusion as well, which means that the superdiusion is not caused by the gel network. In fact, the simulation with the frozen gel network is much further away from subdiusion that the simulation with the gel network intact, which does seem to imply that the motion would be subdiusive if the model<br/>was implemented correctly, but it is not conclusive.","diffusion; Gillespie; polymer","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Secondly, the outdoor part and thirdly, another indoor part inside the building of destination. As regards to the outdoor environment, a navigation aid is well used and implemented in many types of applications. However, it is not common to use an aid to navigate inside a building. While such an indoor navigation aid is not necessary in small buildings, it is a necessity in more complex buildings like hospitals, airports, conference venues and large shopping malls. The indoor navigation aid can help visitors finding their way inside these, for them, unknown locations. The systems behind a navigation aid consist of several elements like an indoor positioning system, an indoor navigable map, specific destinations (points of interest) and an appropriate guidance throughout a building. This research focusses on the creation of indoor navigable maps that can be displayed and used to plan possible routes throughout the entire building. The indoor environment is far more complex than the outdoor environment. First, most people lose their orientation inside a building after they change their direction several times. Second, since there are no pre-existing routes inside a building, there are many different possible ways to arrive at a destination. Third, there is a large variety of associated spaces which all have their own unique interior design. Therefore, automating the process of making an indoor map is more challenging and time consuming than generating an outdoor map.<br/><br/>Most research in the field of automatic generation of indoor maps is focused on the already available 2D floorplans and only few of them use the more complex 3D representations. Using a 2D floorplans for the purpose of indoor navigation has its limitations because of various factors. Firstly, the 2D maps are already a simplification of the complex 3D environment which can lead to difficulties in representation. Secondly, the connectivity between different floor plans can be difficult as each floor plan is a separate entity. Thirdly, the maps that are available do not always contain furniture. Fourthly, in addition to the third one, most existing methods only focus on reconstructing the indoor space as an empty hull which results in a navigation aid which has does not emphasize the attention to obstacle detection. At last, most floor plans are out of date because some buildings are not built according to their blue prints. Their interiors might change after several years through the modification of walls and doors and furniture may be repositioned to the users preferences. Therefore, information about the indoor environment must be updated in most cases. This research concentrates on the automatic generation of indoor navigable spaces for pedestrians based on laser scanning with a Mobile Laser Scanner (MLS) device. These devices scan the environment continuously along a trajectory which makes them more time efficient than terrestrial laser scanners.<br/><br/>To aid pedestrians in their indoor navigation, features needed for path computation such as floors, stairs, walls and furniture elements, need to be identified. These must be extracted from the point cloud which is generated by the MLS. How to identify these elements, like walls and doors, is investigated a lot. These researches are built on a set of constraints, like a Manhattan World or a flat surface constraint. These constraints are not problematic for a regular office building but they will provide difficulties in more complex buildings. This means that it is important to focus on a method with less or without constraints. <br/><br/>Scanning the indoor environment of an building often happens during business hours which automatically leads to the inclusion of dynamic objects like pedestrians or small vehicles in the final point cloud. These dynamic elements do not represent any type of building elements (like furniture) and thus need to be identified and removed. <br/><br/>Beside the point cloud, the MLS also stores the trajectory of the MLS device. This trajectory contains three types of valuable information. The points directly below the trajectory indicate areas where pedestrians can walk, since the MLS device was operated by a pedestrian. The height difference between neighboring trajectory points can be used to detect stairs, slopes and flat surfaces and the trajectory also provides information about the connection of different surfaces and represents the complexity of the building.<br/><br/>In this research, a method for the identification of walkable surfaces based on the analysis of a point cloud and the corresponding trajectory of the MLS is developed. First, the point cloud is voxelized. Second, the trajectory is analysed to detect the three different types of navigation surfaces: stairs, slopes and horizontal surfaces. This classified trajectory is projected vertically on the voxel model to acquire seed voxels. These seed voxels are then used to create areas by using region growing. These areas can be modified by identifying dynamic objects, entryways and furniture elements so that each area represents a specific navigable voxel space inside a building.<br/><br/>Experiments shows that by applying this method, it is possible to create a continuous navigable space in buildings including several floors, stairs and elevations. Data can be captured during opening hours because the method detects and removes dynamic objects in the final result. The proposed method can be used for any type of room without any constraints because the complexity of the building is already present in the trajectory of the MLS.","Navigation space; MLS; Trajectory; Indoor environment; Voxel; Dynamic object; 3D laser scanning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","3D geoinformation",""

Amongst all available copper alloys, brass, with a relative low cost, is one of the most common materials with a wide range of applications, such as heat exchangers and maritime industry. Corrosion is a common phenomenon for copper and brass in their various applications resulting in serious consequences and direct as well as indirect economic losses. Therefore, a high degree of attention should be paid to their corrosion control. The usage of corrosion inhibitors is one of the efficient approaches to retard corrosion of copper and brass.<br/>This master thesis focused on three organic corrosion inhibitors, i.e. imidazole, 2-mercapto-benzimidazole (MBI) and 2-mercapto-1-methyl-benzimidazole (1H-HB-2T). Open Circuit Potential (OCP) measurement, Linear Polarization Resistance (LPR) measurement and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) were used together with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR, both ex-situ FTIR and in-situ FTIR) to evaluate their inhibition efficiencies and interaction mechanisms, where the latter inhibitors were studied in more details. <br/>The results collected in this master thesis show the following: (1) different organic inhibitors provided different inhibition effects on copper and brass; (2) One kind of inhibitor had different inhibition effects on copper and brass; (3) the inhibition effects of MBI and 1H-HB-2T on copper and brass were linked with an electrostatic interaction between their molecules and the surface of specimens; (4) during the physisorption process at the specimen/solution interface, interfacial bonds were formed and a thin but protective layer was produced on the surface of immersed specimens, but these interfacial bonds could break because of soluble aggressive species in the environment resulting in a diminished corrosion protection; (5) the time required for the interfacial bond to break depends on the inhibitor and specimen types.<br","copper; brass; organic inhibitor; interaction mechanism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

The general idea is that there is always something to do and there is always someone to meet with in those cities. The truth is different.

The increase in loneliness is mainly caused by our individualistic oriented society and the fact that a growing number of singles lives in one-person households. Currently, those singles are living in houses designed for bigger households. Therefore, they are using a bigger amount of space and that is the exact thing cities are lacking.<br/>In order to design dwellings for the future, a new way of living, which should tackle the social and spatial issues cities are coping with, has to be found.

Crucial for the development of a design scheme was focusing on different scales, and tension between material and human. Anthropological research retraces the origin of Belgian limestone apparent in the city, by following the river Maas and two climbers. By capturing the weight, touch, and texture of stone the research investigates how material can influence human perception and introspection.

By focusing on a fundamental architectural element – the wall, the design is developed from the detail outwards, progressing from the prior detail of cavity wall to the building and urban scale. The design proposal – Ceramic Centre - focuses on the walls and how they can take on prior qualities of the stone. Physical as well as sensual properties of materials (smell, temperature, moisture) are used to navigate through the space of the building.

(graduation committee); Hekkenberg, R.G. (graduation committee); Burgess, Arnaud (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The inland waters of Ghana have a considerable potential for the operation of inland water transport (IWT) services. These services could be part of a multimodal transport corridor, to connect the northern regions and the northern landlocked countries with the industrial southern part of the country, which also includes the port of Tema, one of the gateways of the landlocked countries. However, despite the many advantages of IWT, these waters are currently barely used for freight transportation. The absence of a high quality IWT service is mainly unfortunate, as Ghana suffers from the consequences of the unilateral road transport market: the many trucks leads to congestions, traffic hazards and long (and unreliable) transport times. Besides this, the freight transportation by road is rather expensive.<br/>An IWT service on the Ghanaian inland waters could be able to improve the cost and time performances of the Ghanaian transit corridor.<br/>The Ghanaian inland waters are mainly formed by Lake Volta and the upstream Volta Rivers. The water levels of these waters are subject to the local climate, which results in (very) low water levels during the dry season (from November to July). The water levels of Lake Volta allow year round navigation, but that does not hold for the Volta Rivers. In fact, Buipe Port, along the Black Volta, is probably the most upstream location that can be reached for most part of the year, while a year round accessibility can be guaranteed after dredging a shoal, a bit downstream of the port.<br/>The potential container market for the IWT service is quite small, being about 8,000 TEUs per year. Nearly all these containers are currently transported by road from Tema Port to Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Due to the congestions and (bad) conditions of roads and trucks, the northbound journey (about 1,000 km) takes about four days. The corresponding price for transport is also very high, being about USD 2,600 for a 20 ft. container. The only commercial IWT service at Lake Volta, is not able to deliver better performances, due to bad and inappropriate equipment. <br/>The feasibility of three different IWT services is investigated: roll-on/roll-off of truck/trailer combinations or roll trailers on the one hand, and lift-on/lift-off of containers on the other hand. All the alternatives are based on the concept of barges being pushed by push tugs, as this is the most promising concept from a financial point of view.<br/>It can be concluded that the potential transit container market of 8,000 TEU/year, for which the IWT service has to compete for, is too small to result in a profitable service. However, when relocating the transit traffic (clearance) procedures from Tema Port to Buipe Port, the yearly container throughput via Lake Volta will be much higher, making an IWT service viable and profitable. Besides, this relocation will result in extra space in the port of Tema, and can result in more efficient clearance procedures, thereby decreasing the total door-to-door time of transit traffic.<br","inland water transportation; feasibility study; Africa; transit cargo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","6.53, -0.03"

If the propellers are mounted on the wing, strong propeller-wing interactions alter the aerodynamic efficiency of the aircraft. Using low-order numerical models, it is shown in literature that the wing chord and twist distribution can be changed to maximise this efficiency. These results are only theoretical. This thesis, therefore, aims to validate and apply a numerical model for optimisation of the wing design taking propeller-wing interactions into account.<br/><br/>A vortex lattice method (VLM) was adapted to include the effects of propeller-induced velocities. Comparing the results of the adapted VLM with existing experimental data already validates the numerical model for predicting the lift distribution. To validate it for changes in lift distribution due to wing design changes, a wind-tunnel experiment is set up. Two wings are tested in a tractor propeller configuration. The only difference between the wings is in the twist distribution. To find the lift distribution, the circulation is evaluated in the flow around a wing at several stations along the wingspan. Particle-image velocimetry was used to obtain this flow field. Indeed, the lift distributions measured on both wings are matched by predictions from the adapted VLM, which proofs the numerical model is suitable for qualitative optimisation studies.<br/><br/>For the wing and operating conditions used for the wind-tunnel experiment, an optimisation study is performed using the adapted VLM. It shows the drag can be reduced with 34% by adopting the optimal chord and twist distribution. Even though the operating conditions are not representative for full-scale aircraft or UAVs, it does show there is a great potential for taking propeller-wing interactions into account for the design of the wing.","propeller-wing interaction; optimisation; vortex lattice method; lifting line; propeller; wing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The advent of automated manufacturing methods such as Automated Fiber Placement and Tailored Fiber Placement has made variable stiffness laminate more realistic and attractive for use in aerospace and automotive sector. Importance of light weight designs in automotive sector has received new interest due to the stringent emissions rules and entry of designs based on alternative energy. Within this context, this thesis intends to create variable stiffness design for an automotive part to investigate the possible improvements in structural responses compared to a design based on conventional laminates. The design is done based on 2D Finite element analysis coupled with a convex optimization that helps to generate steered fiber designs optimized for strength, stiffness and buckling. One of the important load case studied here is the Inertia Relief. Inertia Relief method is a computationally efficient way of analyzing rigid bodies without doing a dynamic analysis. The method was implemented in the finite element framework and the responses from the analysis were taken for optimization.<br/>Final optimization of the structure showed that significant improvement in the objective responses can be achieved by using variable stiffness laminates over a conventional laminate design (UD). The result also implies that reduction in weight can be achieved if a variable thickness optimization is to be done on the model.","Optimization; Variable-Stiffness; Composites; Inertia Relief","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This project was to use their existing technology and ideas to create a system to prevent pressure ulcers. Pressure ulcer are the medical condition that happens when a patient is left too long in the same position in bed. In order to combat this the nurses turn the patient onto a new posture every 3 to 4 hours. To improve upon this Momo Medical decided to built a sensor pad that has to be placed under the mattress in order to track the patients bed posture and to alarm the nurses when a patient has been on a side too long. The project group was divided into three parts: the sensor group who would look at the sensor pad, the algorithm group who would use the data from the sensor pad to determine the bed posture and the test group that had to built a system that could verify the algorithm. This report will talk about the test group. Based upon the data that Momo Medical acquired it was also possible to acquire the heart rate and the respiratory rate from the sensor data. A way to acquire this data was also looked at. The design requirement that were set were 95% accuracy for bed posture and 90% for respiratory rate and heart rate.<br/>Design Description<br/>In order achieve these requirements a few different types of reference signals were looked at that could be used in order to detect the bed posture, respiratory rate and heart rate. In the end an accelerometer and an commercial grade ECG chest strap were chosen. The accelerometer could measure the patients orientation and thus his bed posture. When the accelerometer is attached to the chest it is also able to measure the chest compressing as a result of breathing. The ECG chest strap was chosen as this gave a good platform upon which the accelerometer and the micro controller could be attached.<br/>Evaluation<br/>A prototype was built upon our design and it was tested in different situations. In the end the accuracy for the bed posture detection was 99%, the accuracy of the respiratory rate was 91% and of the heart rate it was 95%. With these accuracies it meant that the design requirements were met. The disadvantage was that the system influences the sensor pad while the patient is wearing the prototype. Another disadvantage was that due to the low sampling speed it was not possible to attach the heart rate receiver to the testing group's prototype, but had to be attached to the sensor group's prototype. These two disadvantages could be improved in the future by making the prototype smaller and faster.<br","Medical; Bed posture; Heart rate; Respiratory rate; Pressure ulcer; Monitoring","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-19","","","","","",""

Thereby the drawbacks of sliding friction, including wear and hysteresis are eliminated. Besides that compliant mechanisms allows monolithic production which facilitates cost reduction and miniaturization possibilities. However, the integration of functions into fewer parts requires the simultaneous design of motion and force behaviour, causing a difficult design process.<br/>The commonly used design methods ('rigid-body replacement' and 'freedom and constraint topologies') try to bypass this difficult design process by considering the motion behaviour first. However this can lead to bad force behaviour in the end. A requirement that is often causing overcomplicated and bulky designs (because of an ill-considered kinematic structure) is the requirement of high rotational stiffness.<br/>To facilitate the difficult design of high rotational stiffness structures a different design method is proposed. First a general design class with high rotational stiffness is developed. Based on this design class the designer can select a kinematic structure that fits the high rotational stiffness requirement. From here on the designer can continue with the commonly used design methods.<br/>To show the power of the proposed design method a novel homokinetic joint is designed.

(graduation committee); Brugmans, J (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Installation Method Analysis for a Large Diameter Cold Water Pipe for Land - Based OTEC Plants<br/><br/>Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) is a technology which uses the temperature difference between cold deep water and warmer surface water in the ocean to generate electricity. This technology is most applicable in remote tropical locations, as it can produce a continuous year-round base load that supplies the remote region with reliable and sustainable energy. <br/><br/>One of the main challenges of large scale OTEC plants is the installation of the cold-water pipe (CWP), which is used to pump the cold water from the depths of the ocean to the plant. Bluerise is currently developing 10 MW land-based OTEC plants. For these plants, the CWP has an internal diameter of 2.5 meters and is installed over the seabed up to a water depth of 1000 meters . A CWP of these dimensions has never been installed yet and thus the optimal installation method is unknown. The main aim of this graduation was to find the optimal installation method and the preferred material for these large cold-water pipes.<br/><br/>First, research was conducted to evaluate several materials, assessing similarities and experience in other industries and the specific requirements for OTEC. In parallel, several existing and new installation methods were investigated and discussed. In order to compare these materials and methods, a base case project was used that Bluerise is currently developing in Curacao for which parameters such as seabed slope and water density are known. The different options for materials and installation methods were evaluated using a multi-criteria analysis taking into account non-technical aspects such as risks and costs. <br/><br/>Based on this analysis, HDPE was identified as the preferred material. Regarding the installation, it was found that the “modified Float and Sink” and the “Hold and Sink”-methods were optimal, both being similarly ranked. As the details of these installation methods are not yet known in practice, it is not yet clear if the CWP can be successfully installed using either of these methods - thus an installation model was developed for the CWP based on Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. This model simulates the pipe installation and describes the pipe in the vertical direction, as depicted in the figure below. In the model, forcing or loading (such as buoys and ballast) can be variably applied to the CWP thereby allowing for the simulation of any possible installation method.<br/><br/>In addition to this model, scale model tests were done at MARIN in Wageningen to investigate the practical aspects of the CWP installation, as well as to collect data for the validation of the Matlab model. As the computer model was validated, it was found that 3-dimensional effects, observed during the scale model tests, had a large influence on the drag and displacement of the pipe. The numerical model consistently overestimates the velocities seen during the tests at MARIN, however trend-wise the numerical model gives similar results when simulating different installation methods for the pipe. <br/><br/>As the main issue for the pipe is the bending, the key challenge is to minimize bending during the installation. Taking this into account, it was found that the best installation method was a combination of the “Float and Sink” and the “Hold and Sink”-method, as the shape and position of the pipe can meticulously be controlled by a combination of buoys (attached to the pipe) and vessels (manipulating the pipe end). It was found that with this combined installation method, the total Von Mises stress is kept well under the limit for HDPE. Nevertheless, it is recommended that these results are further verified using a more detailed model that takes 3-dimensional effects into account so that the response of the cold-water pipe can be calculated more accurately. <br","pipeline installation; OTEC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","","","","","",""

Pressure ulcers are a chronic wound that affects the skin of patients who do not regularly change bed posture. As it currently stands, nurses lack the manpower and time to change the postureof patients in a timely manor. Thus, a goal was set to create a product that would reduce this strain on nurses.The goal was to design a non-intrusive product that keeps track of the posture of a patient on a hospital bed, and send an alarm if this has not changed in a set amount of time. A constraint with this was that the product has to lay directly underneath the mattress of the patient. Furthermore, the product has to make use of as few sensors as possible. With these constrains, the project group was divided in three subgroups: the sensor, the algorithm, and the testing subgroup.This report will focus on the design, implementation, and evaluation of the algorithm. The algorithm has to be designed to process the sensor data and return, with 90% accuracy, the posture of the patient. It also has to be able to determine with 99% accuracy whether or not there is a patient on the bed. An optional objective was to design an algorithm to determine the heart and respiration rate of the patient, with 80% accuracy, but this was of lower priority. It was soon decided to give priority to posture detection and not further investigate detection of the heart and respiration rate.In the final product, the information about the patient’s posture will be displayed in a graphical user interface (GUI). This GUI has to be user-friendly and intuitive to use by the nurses. During the prototyping phase, however, a different GUI was used, one that displayed various debugging information. This prototype GUI was necessary to test the various algorithms.Several different mathematical models have been investigated, implemented, and tested. These models range from taking the variance of the sensor data, to deploying a Fourier transform on a polynomial curve based on the sensor data. With preliminary test data, an accuracy of 93% was achieved using a neural network.

The aim of Interactive Robotics is to tackle this problem by bringing robots into the classroom to aid teachers. They aim to have a single robot in a classroom that has the ability to teach different lessons and subjects; the RekenRobot being specifically for basic arithmetic. During the research phase, ideas were gathered regarding how to create teaching methods that are motivating and stimulating. For instance, personalisation, humanising the robot and adaptability of the teaching material were desired functions. The software for the RekenRobot was built from scratch, using the programming language GOAL, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and JSP. The original target audience of the project were children between the ages of 6 and 8. Later this was changed to cover different school years: 3-4, 5-6 and 7-8, making use of levels with different degrees of difficulty. The robot can work one-on-one with a child, being able to practice addition, subtraction, times tables and telling time, as well as 2 forms of explanations can be given: making use of a bus and a number line. Using no explanation to rather focus on automation is also an option. The idea of the project was to lay the groundwork for the later development of the RekenRobot, as this will be an ongoing project for Interactive Robotics. The application designed in this project will be adapted to become part of the Interactive Robotics system. The first user tests at primary schools yielded a largely positive result. The children were excited and motivated to work with the product. The system is simple enough to require very little explanation. This project was never meant to realise a product that can be deployed tomorrow, but the result is a very solid basis for further improvements.","arithmetic; children; teaching; robot; robotics; primary school; teacher","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2018-01-15","","","","","",""

In this type of RD a break in the retina allows liquefied vitreous to enter the subretinal space and the retina to detach. The prognosis concerning the patients' visual ability is better if the RD has not progressed to the macula. The patient is given a posturing advice of bed rest and semi-supine positioning (with the RD as low as possible) to allow the utilisation of gravity in preventing progression of the RD. It is, however, unknown what loads on the eye contribute the most to the progression of a retinal detachment. The goal of this exploratory study is to elucidate the role of saccadic eye movements and head movements on the progression of an RD. A finite element model is produced and evaluated in this study. The model is based on geometric and material properties found in literature. The model shows that a mild head movement and a severe eye movement produce similar loads on the retina. This implies that head movements---and not eye movements---are able to cause loads that can trigger and progress an RD. These preliminary results suggest that head movements have a larger effect on the progression of an RD than saccadic eye movements. This study is the first to use numerical analysis to investigate the development and progression of RD and shows great promise for future work.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-10-31","","","","","",""

It is in connection with the research developed by the PhD candidate Patrizia D’Olivo. To date not many strategies were developed to empower people who suffer of the alopecia condition. Thus, the project attempted to help people with alopecia feel comfortable in their everyday lives by designing coping strategies for the individual with alopecia and anyone he feels close with.<br/>In this project different research and design methods were applied, like interviewing, surveys, a co-creative session and design evaluation with assistance of the Alopecia Vereniging. Context and user research deepened the knowledge on the topic and classified the problems the target group encounters. The disrupted life event of alopecia and the population affected by this condition encounter a lot of problems that differ according to the level of severity and risk. It was evident that the communication between the person with alopecia and anyone he feels close with should be stimulated and improved. <br/>Different design explorations combined with a concept evaluation study and a co-creative session showed the desired features for the final design. The proposed design ‘Imagine alopecia’ gives people close to someone with alopecia a better understanding of the impact of the condition and stimulates the communication between them. <br/>The design evaluation study confirmed that the target group feels that the design has the potential to improve the communication between them and the people they feel close with. In addition, also the people close to someone with alopecia believe in the added value of the design. However, to validate the effect of the design on communication, it should be evaluated by letting people use the design in real life situations.","design; alopecia; co-creation; communication; empowerment; understanding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

These factors can induce motion sickness and therefore significantly deteriorate the user experience. There are already a variety of solutions available to track the position of a VR HMD, some of which can be made robust and<br/>low-latency by inexpensive means.<br/><br/>This thesis proposes a low-cost, outside-in, optical tracking solution. As optical sensor a stationary camera with an IR pass filter is used to capture an array of IR LEDs, which are integrated at strategic locations within the frame of the HMD. By using the OpenCV library the 3D pose of the LEDs can be estimated, and used to change the perspective of the user within the virtual world.<br/><br/>In particular, this tracking solution incorporates a fast, cost-effective, modified camera, capable of capturing over 180 frames per second. With this camera and a custom designed polyhedral structure to incorporate the LEDs, the LED array can be calibrated quickly and tracked accurately even when oriented at an obtuse<br/>angle with the camera. The high frame rate also allows for a redundancy in pose estimations, obtained by a mix of algebraic and iterative PnP solvers to further improve numerical stability and accuracy.<br/><br/>The tracking algorithm accurately tracks the developed prototype at short distances, even when placed in a noisy environment. The calibration procedure can also be performed fast, so that tracking can be resumed within a second when tracking has been lost due to occlusion. Recommendations for further improvements would be to integrate an IMU to provide tracking information in case that the HMD becomes occluded, and to overall improve tracking of rotational movement. Also, a higher resolution optical sensor should be<br/>used to improve the range of this tracking solution.","Virtual Reality; Positional Tracking; Perspective-n-point; low-cost","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Dangerous conditions can occur after clear sky nights with weak winds. The lack of turbulent mixing during these nights can cause the near-surface temperature to rapidly decrease. A single short-lived turbulent event can renew turbulent mixing and hamper/stop the formation of fog or severe frost, averting dangerous conditions for e.g. Short-lived turbulence has been studied using single tower observations, but the spatial scale of this phenomenon is not yet known. The goal of this study is to fill that gap and estimate the spatial scale of short-lived turbulent structures in the nocturnal boundary layer.<br/><br/>Short-lived turbulent structures are studied using wind speed and near-surface temperature observations from existing observational networks in the Netherlands. Nights with short-lived turbulence are selected using an automated filter and manual selection. Visual analysis is first used to identify that the turbulent structures span multiple stations of the network. If so, the correlation between pairs of stations is quantified as a function of their spatial separation. Next, an exponentially decaying fit is applied to this data. The e-folding distance of this fit serves as the estimation of the spatial scale of the turbulent structure. <br/><br/>A dense network is found by using the observational masts at and around Schiphol Airport. Visual analysis shows that this network is sufficiently dense for the turbulent structures to span multiple stations. Using the aforementioned methodology, the scales of the short-lived turbulent structures are estimated to range between 1.5 km and 24 km, with a median of 9 km. The spatial scale of short-lived turbulent structures is therefore estimates at 9 km.<br/>This study should be considered to be a first-order estimate. In fact, one of the weaknesses of the method used is that it only takes the distance between stations into account (without incorporating directional effects). As such, it assumes the turbulent event to be spatially isotropic. At present, limitations by the network do not allow for a clear assessment of the spatial structure of the events. <br/>To accurately study both the dynamics and the spatial coherence of short-lived turbulent structures, a dense and uniformly distributed network is recommended. Ideally, such set-up would consist of a nested fine-scale network within a courser network which needs to span a distance of 25 km minimum to capture turbulent events such as the ones studied here.<br/><br/>In addition to turbulent events, regional temperature variations are found. Near-surface temperature differences up to 9 degrees over a distance of 40 km are observed during nighttime. The daytime temperature at these stations is nearly identical, stressing the differences in atmospheric physics during day and night. These local variations may result from different local (soil) conditions, local turbulence and clouds. Artificial turbulence, caused by large airplanes taking off, is observed close to the airport’s runways, increasing the local near-surface temperature up to 4 degrees. It will be interesting to also study the impact of artificial turbulence on the near-surface temperature as a follow up of the current work.","turbulence; meteorology; nocturnal boundary layer; observations; atmosphere; scale estimation; stable boundary layer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Improvements in performance, safety margins and workload have been reported for lane-keeping and curve negotiation tasks. On the other hand, the guidance system instigates increased driver torques, indicating the occurrence of a mismatch between driver and automation intention. A novel, criticality-based control structure was developed, capable of adapting to different driving conditions by using safety margins (operationalized as time-to-line crossing, TLC) as input. Twenty-four participants drove through a single-lane, 10.8 km long road, with as independent variables the road width (normal road width of 3 m, wide road width of 5 m) and the type of guidance received: no guidance (manual), haptic steering guidance based on lateral deviation from the center-line (performance-based guidance, PBG) and criticality-based guidance (CBG). On the normal road, results show similar benefits for both guidance systems compared to manual control, in terms of performance and safety margins. Workload was reduced by PBG, but both guidance systems yielded increased driver torques. On the wide road, participants drove closer to the center-line with PBG, but at the cost of significantly more guidance torques than CBG. Interestingly, this reduction in lateral deviation did not result in a significant improvement for lowest safety margins encountered. No subjective preference was found for either feedback condition. It can be concluded that criticality-based guidance is capable of adjusting to different driving conditions, without compromising safety margins, whilst greatly reducing guidance torques in situations where they are unneeded.<br","Haptic steering guidance; TLC; Guidance as-needed; Human-automation interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This thesis begins with an assessment of the current status of this technology which formed the motivation for the reported experiments.<br/><br/>In particular, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) has been identified as one of the biggest challenges of this technology. To address this issue, a simple, non-vacuum, spin coating technique was developed for the introduction of alkali ions (Li+, K+, Rb+) into a pure selenide Cu2ZnSnSe4 absorber. The highest VOC achieved with this method was 454 mV, which is approximately 50 mV above the baseline level and on par with the highest known values for Cu2ZnSnSe4 solar cells [2]. The presence of Rb+ and Li+ ions in particular, was observed to<br/>reduce recombination in the bulk material and the quantity of shallow defects within the bandgap. Bandgap variations and electrostatic potential fluctuations in conduction and valence bands were investigated as aspects likely affected by alkali ions. <br/><br/>In order to exploit the potential for bandgap engineering of this material, Cu2ZnGeSe4 based solar cells were developed with experiments for the selection of appropriate substrates, absorber thickness and chemical etching of unwanted compounds.

Billions of images are created, shared and ultimately enjoyed by users every day. However, digital images are sensitive to a wide variety of distortions during the delivery mechanism it goes through. Any of the distortions that can arise during the delivery might disrupt the perceptual quality of an image and can incite dissatisfaction from the user. Thus, it is important to optimize the delivery pipeline towards the arrangement of perceptually good results. For that the perceptual image quality needs to be estimated. Image quality assessment (IQA) is concerned with measuring the degradation in quality of images. The level of degradation needs to be measured in a way that is compliant to how humans would perceive it as humans are the final judges of the delivered quality of an image. General purpose image quality metrics are based on a two-step design. First, quality-aware features are extracted, describing artifact appearance to the Human Visual System. Secondly, these features are mapped to a perceived quality score. General purpose metrics require a large number of varied examples of pairs of distorted images and perceived quality scores to acquire an accurate distortion-agnostic quality prediction. Obtaining a distorted image is relatively simple. However, acquiring the quality assessment is a complex, laborious and expensive undertaking. Consequently, all of the widely known image quality datasets only accommodate at most several thousand examples which is in stark contrast to the mound of possible distortion types and distortion intensities there could be. This limitation hinders the creation of an accurate general-purpose image quality assessment metrics. It would be desirable to extend these datasets with more subjectively evaluated images, but given the cost of doing so, one may want to have a smart mechanism to select those that are most informative to improve the accuracy and robustness of quality metrics. Active learning is such a smart selection mechanism and could therefore be a possible solution. The main goal of this thesis is to explore whether active learning can be beneficial to improve the accuracy of image quality metrics.","Image Quality Assessment; Active Learning; IQA; Machine Learning; Regression Based Active Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-07-04","","","","","",""

Depletion of fossil fuels and environmental impact are relevant concerns, widely acknowledged by the international community. NOx contributes to acid deposition and eutrophication. Regulations on NOx emissions become more stringent, such as the North Sea becoming a NECA area in 2021. In diesel engine emissions NOx mainly consists of NO. <br/>Given the relevance of NO-emissions a prediction tool is useful. Hohlbaum has suggested a 2-zone in- cylinder model approach to predict NO-emissions. The cylinder volume is divided in two zones, one containing fresh air, the other hosting secondary combustion. In the flame front, which separates both zones, primary combustion takes place at an air excess ratio smaller than unity. Air also passes the flame front, effecting the composition in secondary combustion zone, where NO-formation is calculated using the extended Zel’dovich formulation. <br/>The inclusion of gas properties by means of an equations of state is investigated as an opportunity to reduce the uncertainty in the assumptions in the original model formulation. Measurements on a 4 cylinder MAN engine are used to evaluate simulation results. <br/>Matching the simulated cylinder volume to the actual cylinder volume using the fuel flow, requires an additional tuning parameter - the partition of the cylinder volume in two zones at start of combustion - since the original assumption no longer holds. The original tuning parameter - the air excess ratio in the flame front - in combination with the newly introduced tuning parameter proved insufficient to match the simulated to the measured fuel flow. Therefore, the constant air flow passing the flame front is adjusted. Changing the flow profile made it possible to match the simulated to the measured fuel consumption. The simulated NO emission where 2.7 times higher than the measured values in the operating point investigated. <br/>A more complete analysis of flow profiles at different operating points is still required.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In many estuaries one specic location with a suspended sediment concentration (SSC) higher than in the sea or in the upstream river, is found, which is called sediment<br/>trapping. The location of the maximum SSC is called the estuary turbidity maximum (ETM). Understanding the dynamics is important to maintain a healthy ecosystem while making anthropogenic changes. To investigate such changes, a two-dimensional model is developed, considering the Ems estuary as a case study. The model equations consist of the width-averaged shallow water equations and a SSC equation. Assuming a morphodynamic equilibrium, these equations are solved mostly analytically by making a regular expansion of each physical variable in a relatively small parameter. Using this method, we are able to gain insight into the fundamental physical processes resulting in sediment trapping in an estuary by studying the influence of various forcings separately. One of the hydrodynamic forces is vertical mixing. This force has been assumed to be constant over time in previous studies [1]. In this thesis vertical mixing as a function that varies on the tidal timescale has been added to the model and is analysed. As a result of the salinity gradient in the estuary the mixing is stronger during flood and weaker during ebb. Using the model it is found that time variations in vertical mixing result in tidally averaged non-zero, and therefore contributing, transports. They cause a narrowing of the location where sediment is trapped. If vertical mixing is exactly maximal when the flood is maximal and minimal when ebb is maximal, the ETM shifts downstream. But if the vertical mixing is lagging the tidal stream, which is more plausible, the ETM will stay or shift upstream.","Ems Estuary; Estuarine turbidity maximum; Sediment dynamics; Vertical mixing","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

As a consequence, new types of use for traditional building materials emerge to create more prestigious buildings. As a relatively new product, ultra-thin glass constitutes a promising prospect in this regard due to its low weight and its ability to be bent up to small radii. A possible application is a kinetic thin glass façade, where the glass is bent to ventilate the interior. However, the realisation of this concept poses a number of challenges. These include the difficulty of achieving water- and airtightness at its bent edges, as well as the lack of stiffness of the glass and its compliance with safety regulations, requiring its lamination.<br/><br/>The aim of this study is to propose a possible design with the intention to tackle the named challenges. To this end, the research question is as follows: How can a kinetic façade element featuring a bendable thin glass panel be designed to be water- and airtight in closed condition? This question involves both structural and design aspects that need to be approached.<br/><br/>The research question is answered through a structural analysis part and a part dedicated to the investigation of possible solutions for achieving water- and airtightness. The structural analysis is performed via numerical analysis to test several glass laminate configurations under bending and wind load. The selected configuration consists of two thin glass sheets with a thickness of 0.55 mm laminated by a 0.38 mm – thick soft acoustic interlayer. The exploration of solutions for water- and airtightness is done via proposal and critical assessment of three possible alternatives, one of which is selected for further elaboration to create a final product. The selected proposal involves the use of an electro-permanent magnetic frame combined with a gasket attracting a metal strip attached to the glazing and thus creating a water- and airtight barrier. At the end, a mock-up of smaller scale is built to showcase the mode of operation of the final product.<br/><br/>Consequently, this paper presents a possible solution for the posed question to offer an insight into the field and to form a basis for further research for the development of a similar product. Many choices made during this research are subjective and are open for improvement or suggestions for a different approach. In addition, further research could be undertaken to investigate the possibility to create an insulating kinetic thin glass unit, which would be a step further towards the development of a product fulfilling the main requirements of a single-skin façade.","glass; Facade design; Kinetic; Aluminosilicate glass; Thin glass; Watertightness; Airtightness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

Therefore, the quality of the indoor environment has a big influence on the health and wellbeing of people. Standards for thermal comfort state that 80 percent of the occupants need to express satisfaction with the thermal environment to be thermally comfortable. Research from the Center of Built Environment however shows that only 11 percent of the office buildings reach this mark. The uniform indoor climate where the conventional HVAC system operates between 22°C and 24°C don’t meet the preferences of most occupants. At the same time is it very energy consuming to keep the indoor temperature between this deadband and can a lot of energy be saved widening this deadband. A possible solution can be the so called personal comfort system, where the dead band of the office is widened and the occupant can control their own thermal environment at the desk with heaters and fans. Results into these systems show an increased level of comfort and productivity. The problem is that these systems rely solely on active systems. Therefore, the research question is: How can additional passive techniques contribute to the thermal sensation of an occupant of an individual comfort system suitable for use in an open plan office spaces?<br/><br/>As literature shows, thermal sensation and comfort is related to the heat balance of the human body. Physical aspects and the thermal regulation system of the human body influence the heat balance. At the same time there are psychological influences. The most important aspects are expectations and knowledge. These aspects were combined to create several conceptual solutions. Extended research into the use of a heat reflection screen to redirect the radiational heat loss of the human body back to the human body was done. Calculations and simulations then showed a promising result for a neck radiation screen. There are a lot of people that experience a cold thermal sensation at the neck. Placing a heat reflection screen can increase the skin temperature with approximatly 1°C. Comparing these results with the just noticeable difference which is around 0.5 °C for the neck this 1°C difference will positively influence the thermal sensation of an occupant. Different materials were researched for their emissivity and reflectivity for far infrared radiation (wavelengths that the human body emits). However, these results came out inconclusive and need extended research. <br/><br/>The gathered information was used to design a flexible heat reflection screen for the neck that can be applied to every office chair. The original conceptual ideas where used to design an evaporation panel for cooling that can be used in combination with fans that are normally used in personal comfort systems. It is suggested to also combine biorhythmic lighting with the settings for heating and cooling; providing cool light when feeling warm and warm light when feeling cold. <br","Thermal comfort; Individual comfort systems; open plan offices; indoor environment; passive solutions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

Improving these products therefore could save an significant amount of energy. Unfortunately, at the moment double and triple glazing is often applied.

Inspiration was found by analyzing the stiffening methods that are currently used in the glass industy.

This stems from the meteoric rise of informal settlements in the global south, despite several redevelopment projects and policy attempts. The selected case study is Dharavi, located in Mumbai, India. <br/><br/>This research, through a comprehensive analytical framework in Dharavi reveal strong correlation between the economic livelihoods and networks and the existing social structure. What is also revealed is the lack of policy in the current redevelopment that addresses the pre-existing economic networks and thereby its social structure. In order to approach redevelopment of informal settlements such as Dharavi, in a more inclusive and sustainable manner, this project aims to use the hypothesis of ‘economic clustering’ in order to ‘reframe’ and develop a strategic framework for Dharavi. The strategic framework is then texted through a design framework echoing the same elements at a selected site (13-compound) inside Dharavi. <br/><br/>The frame of ‘economic clustering’ offers a reframe on the traditional model of redevelopment in informal settlements in India and perhaps extending to the global south. Most informal settlements in the geographical realm of the global south, have distinct economic patterns and social networks which play a vital part in their existence and contributing to their perseverance. The proposed model of redevelopment aims to address and examine the existing economic networks incorporating them into a framework that provides a balanced combination of spatial guidelines and policy recommendations. <br","Informal settlement; redevelopment; global south; economic clustering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","Inclusive Cities - International Planning and Developing Regions","19.0402, 72.8509"

Intensifying manifestations of climate risk lead to unforeseen cascading effects that often surpass the level of protection offered by this type of approach (e.g. Hurricane Katrina) . In this thesis. spatial planning approach is developed that embraces uncertainties, including potential cascading effects. It provides the potential to bounce forward in space to better cope with a disaster.<br/><br/>Critical infrastructure networks (transport, water, energy lines) are interdependent and embedded in space. The proposal spatially understands recovery patterns offered by these networks during a crisis to inform long term growth trajectories of the urban system that can ‘grow with risk’. The principal objective is mainstreaming the role of spatial planning for risk reduction.<br/><br/>The research and design draws from quantitative conclusions of engineering, transport and seismic studies in the context of resilience planning. A spatial disaster event chain is proposed based on theories of complex networks and cascading effects. Risks are projected in space to simulate evacuation behavior on road networks using ArcGIS Network Analyst. With spatial reconfiguration as a central aim, ‘urban design’ iterations form a principal research component for an aggregate understanding of risks in space. The test case utilized in the San Francisco Bay which is at risk of a sea level rise by 2100 and is a hotbed of seismic activity.<br/><br/>Understanding recovery patterns due to incremental risk on infrastructure helps derive the gradient of spatial vulnerability. This informs the ‘critical web’ of the urban region to reconfigure land management and density distribution. A coherent spatial assessment framework is established to identify the ‘middle ground’ that absorbs intensive growth and vulnerable sites that must transition for better adaptivity.<br/><br/>The research highlights lack of cohesion in planning practice to pursue long term implementation strategies such as resilience in land use management, looking beyond building back’ and investing in incremental gain models that grow with risk .It aims to address this vital knowledge gap between engineering simulations and planning in the real world and how we can build a framework to sync them for long range risk reduction.<br/>In conclusion, the project acknowledges risk in space and finds ways to sustain life in the light of urgencies.<br/><br","spatial planning; Uncertainty; San Francisco Bay; critical infrastructure; risk reduction; disaster; future, autonomous, urban form, space, car sharing, smart mobility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-07-04","","","","","San Francisco Bay-Resilience By Design","37.572498,-122.035437"

Because of its rich resource in Hardware, Shenzhen attracted lots of makers and startup teams to start their businesses. This is timing that Shenzhen heads to another phase of city development which is related to creative industry and innovation. However, used to be city of Shanzhai products, the city benefited a lot from Shanzhai ideology which is seen a successful migrant entrepreneurship model by some scholars. This significant social movement provided some strategies could be used as guidance for improving the maker movement later. Current maker movement in Shenzhen represents the national culture which mainly focus on manufacturing production instead of incubating innovation. Highly connected to production chain makes it lose the essence of doing for fun spirit. Under the pressure of employment base shift, migrants especially workers are gradually leaving the city center even the city. Thus inclusive urban innovation development will defiantly deserve discussion on how migrants could build up a new model of entrepreneurship based on maker movement to achieve self-empowerment. How could Urban village where 50% of migrants live spatially, economically and socially contribute to the incubate social economical innovation instead of only a collective property waiting to be redeveloped. This essay will discuss how a model learned from Shanzhai Movement is used a strategy to revise current maker movement towards inclusive urban redevelopment and empower migrant entrepreneurs. <br/><br/>During the last decade, Chinese Shan Zhai mobile phones have steadily and deliberately evolved from an informal economy to a formal one. We draw on institutional entrepreneurship to study this evolution, focusing in particular on how informal Chinese entrepreneurs pursued change and the transition to a formal economy. We emphasize three strategies—framing, aggregating, and bridging—Chinese entrepreneurs employed to mobilize support, garner resources, and increase their amount and level of legitimacy. We also discuss implications for research on informal economies and institutional entrepreneurship. This shanzhai model provided a basic for discussing about the possibility of implementing Maker Movement in Urban Village, which could be seen as an opportunity for new migrant economy. <br/><br/>A dramatic paradigm shift over the last few years from top=down planning, physical construction and industrial development towards a new wave of experimentalism that attempts to tackle contemporary urban complexities, develop holistic social growth and steer new social values not solely dependent on economic metrics. In urban village, the urgency of discussing informal development should go beyond the physical structure of the urban village and needs to include the understanding of an intangible network of communities across the entire city. <br","Shanzhai; Maker Movement; Urban Design Framework; Grassroots Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Design as Politics",""

They buy this cookie data from a 3rd party. They also manage, however, a vast amount of cookie data themselves, which is currently partly unused. In order for the marketers to use this data, Annalect needs to process and prepare database views for them. To let the marketers, who have no database knowledge, be able to manipulate these views, they create dashboards with 3rd party software called Tableau. Annalect wants us to create an application in which they can set up these dashboards for the marketers so they can manipulate the cookie data and use it for their advertisement campaigns. As a result we have created a web application which supports the workflow of the marketer. After some setup by the people from Annalect, a marketer can sign into our application, choose a dashboard, start working with the cookie data and send the manipulated data off to create an advertisement campaign. All this is done without leaving our application. The data the marketers manipulate in our application is just a small snippet of the complete data set. Since the complete data set contains much more data, it needs to be processed by server clusters paid for by Annalect. This processing is done at night, in order to cut the cost of running the server cluster. After the processing, the result has to be sent to Google DoubleClick Campaign Manager. Furthermore, the ability to use machine learning algorithms was requested by Annalect. This has been implemented through a generic pipeline, which supports multiple machine learning models. A model based on gradient boosting is included as a proof of concept. In order to evaluate the application some tests were done. Different aspects need different tests. Firstly, a usability test was performed with the end users to test the User Interface. Secondly, unit tests were made where it was applicable.

(mentor); Bokel, R.M.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The topic of this graduation project is the design of an adaptive fabric façade for a high-rise in Paris. The stimulus for this choice was the turn of nowadays towards lightweight materials and constructions, a trend that is growing tremendously. Glass façades always remain popular and are frequently used in all kinds of buildings. For instance, a great quantity of glass is used in curtain walls. Therefore, following the need of research for lightweight materials, alternatives for glass are being investigated and membranes can be an interesting solution. They offer a number of possibilities and have many advantages, such as a variety of transparency levels and the fact that they are extremely lightweight materials. Furthermore, this graduation project concerns an office building, which is a rather demanding building type, as it requires a building envelope that offers a high level of indoor comfort, in terms of thermal and acoustical insulation, as well as efficient solar control. Thus, taking all the above into account and the global growing interest towards membranes, which are mostly used as roof components until now, the decision of exploring the potential of such materials as the main part of a building envelope for an open-plan office building in Paris was taken. <br/><br/>The graduation research has an experimental character, as it tackles several issues of a possible membrane façade element and it tries to answer the questions that are being raised throughout of the development of this thesis. Firstly, a literature research is conducted on the available materials, their physical and mechanical properties, their production and connection methods, their advantages and drawbacks in general. Subsequently, design aspects are taken into consideration concerning the building envelope and physical models are constructed in order to visualise the design. Furthermore, hand calculations are conducted for the thermal and acoustical performance of the under study membrane façade element and then software simulations are made in order to validate the results. Moreover, an actual acoustical test is attempted with several difficulties, though, that will be described later on. Finally, conclusions are drawn concerning the whole research and design. As it is evident in the end, although the proposed solution is proved to be rather successful, there is still space for improvement, as well as further research and development.","membranes; high-rises; adaptive; acoustics; vacuum; inflated cushions; building envelope; solar control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Sustainable graduation studio",""

As a reaction to this matter, the government has built several student complexes which consist of transformed shipping containers. It is a very effective and quick solution in order to cope with the rising number of students who are in need of a home. But unfortunately there are also disadvantages about this way of offering students a home. Because the container is made of steel, it is hard to generate a good climate control. This has the consequence that in winter times it can be very cold as in the summer it can be very hot. Another disadvantage is that because the shipping containers are looking the same, you see that the container complexes have a very impersonal and unfriendly character. To tackle these problems this research paper tries to find a way in order to transform the shipping containers in such a way that a living environment is being created which gives the feeling of home. Before you are able to transform a shipping container you have to learn the basic knowledge about the container. Research about the construction, climate design, utilities, toxics and fire safety are needed. This research has shown that there are several ways to transform a shipping container. Most important is that you meet the building requirements. With this basic knowledge the next step can be taken which leads the research to examining what a feeling of home actually means. Literature research has shown that for a feeling of home, different terms are very important: personal, physical, social and identification. These terms also take place at two levels, namely the micro- and macro level. In this research paper, physical strategies, based on the knowledge of the container and the feeling of home, are being implemented in order to transform a shipping container into a home which gives a feeling of home.","construction; climate design; utilities; toxics & fire safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the assessment of the current performance and a review of literature on various forms of transport organisation, two alternative configurations of transport are developed. All transport of deliveries that is individually organised and executed by growers in the current situation, are redesigned in these alternative configurations. The aim of this research is to investigate whether an improvement in the organisation of transport can be achieved by increasing the coordination in transport of these deliveries. The first configuration is based on the consolidation of products from multiple growers in a local hub. The second configuration collects products in a round trip, thus combining multiple growers in a delivery. Both configurations show potential for improvement by achieving a reduction of transport costs and an increase in utilisation of available vehicle capacity, however the lead time of products increases in both configurations.","Transport Logistics; Supply Chain Management; Coordination; Routing; Scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-04","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

People eat and drink significantly more. 50% of all food is bought in supermarkets and every day over 4 million people in the Netherlands buy their groceries in the supermarket (Rabobank, 2016) (CBL, 2016). However, the current supermarket cannot exist in the future. In its current state, it faces three challenges that need to be addressed; their environmental footprint, the competitive threat of other food segments and the development of online food delivery. As a result of these challenges, the research question in this thesis is: How can a supermarket create value for the environment and still be commercially attractive in the future? As to provide an answer on this research question, the analysis is divided into three parts; the supermarket of 2017, the future of the supermarket, and the environmental impacts of the supermarket.<br/><br/>As a result of the analyses of the three parts, requirements are given for the conceptualisation phase which will be the starting point for the vision in the design brief. <br/><br/>The starting point for the supermarket of the future is the current supermarket in 2017. After, research on the future was conducted by identifying global trends, customer trends and retail trends that eventually provided insights for the future of the supermarket. The trends were found by a combination of future visions of experts, established with interviews, and company reports. As a result, five themes that have a major role in the future of the supermarket were established: personalisation, experience, convenience, transparency and platform. <br/><br/>Based on the book ‘De Verborgen Impact’ and LCA’s, the largest environmental impacts of the supermarket were found. The entire supply chain of the assortment and the physical store are evaluated according to the impacts: water use, land use, fossil energy, raw materials, chemical substances, greenhouse gases and waste. This wide range of impact delivers a complete overview of the environmental impacts. Eventually, the assortment had a significant higher impact than the physical store. The two highest impacts that are identified and that are within the circle of influence are: consumption of animal-based products and food waste. As a result of the environmental analysis, four sustainable strategy solutions are established in order to create a sustainable supermarket: minimal use of recourses, everything is circular economy, promote green products and a net-positive building. <br/><br/>By plotting the five future themes and the four sustainable strategy solutions against each, ideas where generated for the supermarket of the future. Based on the criteria found in the analysis, the Green Protein was chosen as most convenient concept. As a result, research was conducted on the motives and barriers of customers to eat more plant-based proteins instead of animal-based proteins. Since customers require an added benefit for themselves instead of only being good for the world, health and convenience is used as encouragement.<br/><br/>The final design of the Green Protein is part of a supermarket that is divided into types of nutrients; proteins, carbs and vegetables. The layout of the Green Protein is based on the IKEA layout in which the customer first walks through the inspiration part and ends in the assortment part. The goal of the inspiration part is to encourage the customer to eat plant-based proteins by communicating the benefits, such as convenience or health. The goal of the assortment part is offering protein product with emphasize on plant-based proteins (legumes, nuts and seeds, mushrooms and meat substitutes). In the end, sustainability is applied on different levels of the store: store level, presentation level, interaction level, product level and process level. <br","environmental impacts; sustainability; supermarket of the future; retail","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

However, generally, an equal dimensioned revetment is used on both the inner- and outer slope. Although with low-crested breakwaters severe overtopping occurs, the application of similarly sized armour on both sides still results in an over-dimensioned inner-slope revetment. An (economical) optimisation is possible in this regard. <br/>The tests executed by Hellinga (2016) in this topic, showed large scatter in the found stability results of single-layer cube revetment at the rear slope. This scatter was party introduced by the large number of inﬂuencing factors in the test scope (Hellinga, 2016). By developing an overtopping simulator, the scope of the model-tests is delimited to solely the breakwater crest and rear slope. Moreover, larger scale tests are feasible in the same ﬂume, reducing scaling errors.<br/><br/>The main objective of this thesis is a) determine if the approach of a (semi-) small scale overtopping experiment using an overtopping simulator is increasing the reliability of the test results, and (b) to increase the understanding of failure mechanisms of single-layer cube revetment on the crest and rear side of low-crested breakwaters.<br/><br/>To design and construct a simulator that is able to generate realistic waves, the relevant mechanisms of overtopping waves were determined and boundary conditions were composed. The behaviour of the simulator was tested in combination with a ‘mock’ breakwater. Seven types of realistic breakwater models were installed to investigate both the hydraulic behaviour of the overtopping volume and the stability behaviour of the revetment. The determination of the layout of a conﬁguration is every time well substantiated by the results from the former conﬁguration.<br/><br/>The water level inside the Wave Overtopping Simulators (WOS) reservoir showed a skewed drop during the release of an overtopping volume. Consequently, the water level measured at one single point was not accurate to determine the volume (change) inside the reservoir, and hence the discharge and velocity. Diﬀerent test conﬁgurations failed, where others remained stable during exposure to simulated waves in the test range. Compared to stability numbers of the theoretical front side, the cubes are relatively stable. The transition of the crest and rear slope showed to be a weak point, and outwash of the rock material ﬁlling the gap is a signiﬁcant possibility.<br/><br/>Improvements on the WOS are possible to enhance the ability to simulate the characteristics of a realistic overtopping wave volume and to give a more detailed evaluation of the magnitudes of these overtopping characteristics. The normal forces between the cubes at the slope are more important for the stability than the own weight of the cubes. The lack of interaction between the cubes at the crest results in a signiﬁcantly lower resistance to hydraulic loads compared to the cubes at the rear slope. The layout of a sharp inner crest-line transition, if well designed, showed a stable alternative for a rounded transition.<br","Overtopping; Wave Overtopping Simulator; WOS; Breakwater; Rear-slope; Single layer; Cube; Stability; Revetment; Crest; Transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Differences in the refraction index of the media encountered by a light wavefront produces phase aberrations which distort the image received from the original object. Currently, there are two main approaches for solving this problem: adaptive optics, which rely on deformable mirrors and wavefront sensors for correcting the phase aberration before it reaches the imaging sensor; and post-processing techniques, which try to estimate the object after receiving distorted images. <br/><br/>MFBD methods are a family of algorithms that are capable of reconstructing the object by fusing the information carried by a set of differently aberrated images. These techniques are widely used in current optical systems, allowing a notable increase in image quality in most situations. However, there are cases in which they are not applicable; for example, looking at a dynamic object (e.g., a bird flying) or looking through static aberrations (e.g., in microscopy applications); but certain modifications in the optical system can be used for solving this problem.<br/><br/>Actual optical devices have only one aperture, thus creating one full-size image on the imaging sensor but, by segmenting the pupil, several images can be retrieved at the same time with different aberrations (i.e., light follows a distinct path for each aperture). However, using a multi-aperture system implies that there is less imaging sensor area available for each aperture, thus obtaining images with less resolution. Nonetheless, MFBD algorithms can usually be extended in order to support SR, a technique that allows the increase of the object resolution by retrieving extra information from the displacement between images.<br/><br/>This thesis is focused on the development of a functional prototype of a multi-aperture optical system that can do real-time object reconstruction. As a MFBD technique is needed, the novel TIP algorithm (developed at Delft Center for Systems and Control) is selected. In order to achieve a fast and reliable reconstruction, the algorithm is: modified for increasing its robustness against noise, expanded in order to support SR and implemented efficiently in both CPU and GPU. Finally, the system is tested in a real environment, showing promising results.","computational imaging; image reconstruction; image deconvolution; mfbd; fft; python; gpu; cuda","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, it has been unavoidable to approximate the FS equations when modeling growth and collapse of an ice sheet-shelf system, which requires simulating many thousands of years. However, the most popular Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA) and Shallow Shelf Approximation (SSA) are only accurate in certain parts of an ice sheet, both excluding the grounding line where the ice starts floating. Using the Finite Element software Elmer/Ice, SIA and SSA are dynamically coupled to FS aiming to maintain high precision and reduce computation time. An existing coupling of SIA and FS, called ISCAL [Ahlkrona et al., 2013a], is investigated for robustness. It is shown that instabilities in the FS solution limit ISCAL’s robustness. <br/>A novel way of iteratively coupling SSA and FS has been implemented into the open source Finite Element software Elmer/Ice and applied to both 2D and 3D conceptual marine ice sheets. The SSA-FS coupling shows to be very accurate, for both diagnostic and prognostic runs (error in velocity respectively below 0.5% and 5%). Grounding line dynamics of the SSA-FS coupling are similar to the FS model under a periodical forcing in a simulation covering 3000 years. The current implementation does not yield speed up in 2D due to inefficient assembly of the matrices to be solved. <br/>In 3D, the cpu time is reduced to two thirds of the cpu time of the FS model despite inefficient assembly. The total number of FS iterations in the SSA-FS coupling is comparable to the FS model, showing a large potential of reducing computation time since computation time of the SSA model is up to 3% of the FS model’s computation time when applied to the same ice shelf ramp. In future research, the SSA-FS coupling can be combined with ISCAL, but this requires both efficient implementation of the SSA-FS coupling and improved stabilization methods for FS.","Finite Element Method; Ice sheet modeling; coupling approximations; full stokes; shallow shelf approximation; shallow ice approximation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

In contrast with traditional replenishments that are repeated with 3 to 5 year intervals, this local mega-nourishment is expected to protect the coastline for a period of at least 20 years. As sand replenishments are a widely applied technique, the concept of the Sand Engine, if proven successful, could be an effective solution for other areas of the world as well. This study looks into the potential effects of a large-scale sand replenishment on fresh groundwater resources, on four coastal areas in different parts of the world where such a project could be applied. These effects were quantified using 2-D variable density groundwater flow and coupled salt transfer models, by simulating the fresh-saline water interface before and after the replenishment, and comparing the results based on the current sea level and weather conditions with those based on scenarios of climate change. The results show that a large sand replenishment can lead to a considerable increase in the fresh groundwater volume, offering an opportunity to combine coastal protection with an increase of freshwater availability for areas with limited water resources.","Sand Engine; groundwater; coastal aquifers; sand replenishment","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To apply preventive maintenance, up-to-date data is required which is unavailable. The goal is to research the applicability of crowdsensing to detect road pavement distresses, and to investigate how the positions of these detections can be used to gain information on a road pavement section.<br/><br/>The construction sector is currently moving from traditional maintenance contracts, where maintenance was a pay per bill business, to contracts focused on the performance and availability of assets. These types of contracts shift the risk during the maintenance phase from the government to the contractor. The contractor receives a fine if either the minimum performance or the availability is not met. This fine in combination with the risk of unforeseen maintenance costs creates a demand for more efficient maintenance methods like preventive maintenance. However, in the field of road asset management, there is a knowledge gap in how road pavement distresses develop over time. To fill this knowledge gap, up-to-date information is required. The up-to-date information cannot be provided using the current high-quality methods due to the limited availability of equipment. <br/><br/>In this research, raw data is gathered on the state of the road through crowdsourcing with smartphones. This data is then preprocessed by signal analysis, positioning analysis and event detection to retain only the information which describes the occurrence of a road pavement distress. Next, a database analysis consisting of clustering, asset linking and averaging is performed to gather information on the measurements of an instance of road pavement distress. The position of the instance of road pavement distress can be seen as the position of a virtual sensor. A virtual sensor groups events together from multiple smartphones. The location of the virtual sensor is linked to the location of the nearest road pavement asset, allowing asset managers, the people who plan maintenance tasks at contractors, to send their maintenance crew to the correct location.<br/><br/>The results from the experiments show that the detection of road pavement distress is possible by using crowdsensing. The position of the virtual sensor increases in accuracy when more data is used.

They want to develop new modules for the Enterprise Resource Planning software they resell, Odoo. Odoo allows companies to manage their projects, employees and other resources. The goal of this project was to create a software product that assists users in creating plannings for their projects in Odoo. The product should offer the following features: Visualise a planning for the user’s projects, Facilitate manually adapting the planning and Propose an automatically generated improvement of the planning. During the research phase of the project we met with a client of West, TNO. TNO explained they are performing research for the Dutch navy to create software that assists planners in creating schedules for battleships. With this case problem in mind, we created a list of requirements our software product should adhere to. We discovered that the case problem West provided us with is a subset of the case problem TNO provided. This meant that if we created a model for the case problem of TNO, the model would work for the case problem of West as well. After the research phase was completed, we started development on the software product. The development phase consisted of seven weeks, and in each week new functionalities were added to the product. In addition to adding new functionalities, we also kept refining our models to improve the performance of the automatic planning generation. The final software product consists of an interface that visualises a planning, a model that can be entered into external algorithms to automatically generate plannings and a module that allows users to import existing projects from Odoo. The user can view their planning through a visualisation that allows them to modify it using a drag and drop interaction. These modifications are setting preferences, like starting times for activities or the assignment of certain persons to certain activities. Once the user has set their preferences, they can ask the software to find an optimised planning that keeps their<br/>preferences in mind. At the end of the project, we gave a demo to TNO and they were impressed with the results of the project. West IT was also happy with the delivered product and is interested in further developing it","Planning; Scheduling problem; Automated scheduling","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2017-07-04","","","","","",""

(mentor); Szlavik, Z. (mentor)","2017","Extreme weather conditions seem to occur stronger and more frequently due to climate change. Very expensive technology is used to predict them, which results problematic when they have to be used in less developed countries. An alternative could be to employ digital sensors, such as phone cameras or existing webcam infrastructures, widely distributed in many countries in the world, and to analyse the captured images. Many methods have been proposed for weather detection including also Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The latter have recently become very popular in the field of computer vision due to their excellent performance in image recognition tasks. However, CNNs are characterized by a high number of learnable parameters that need an equally high number of data points to achieve good performance. Since very big dataset are hardly available, techniques that help to overcome this problem, such as transfer learning, can be used. Different are the transfer learning approaches: the fine-tuning approach, i.e. re-training all the network layers, and the freezing layers approach, i.e. re-training just a subset of the network layers. In collaboration with IBM Netherlands Center for Advance Studies, we optimized a ResNet-18 architecture, modifying the architecture depth and applying regularization methods, to perform weather detection of images showing rain or no-rain conditions. The architecture was previously trained on the ImageNet dataset and then, through the fine-tuning approach, we re-trained the network layers using as training data points weather images captured by webcams distributed in The Netherland, Belgium and London. In particular, we collected a dataset composed by 397041 images showing scenarios such as city roads, urban and rural areas. We also adopted the freezing layer approach on an optimized ResNet-18 architecture and made comparison between the two approaches in relation to weather detection task.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","","",""

Tram assets were found to be most vulnerable for disruption as the tram lacks the speed advantage of the metro and de bus has limited dedicated assets. Tram assets could run the risk of depreciation or disutility which can be a problem for the asset owner, tax payers and city residents. Digital On-demand Ride-sharing Services (DORS) are a likely suspect to disrupt the tram, because short term diffusion and substitution with transit is plausible according to literature. DORS providers include ride-sourcing, ride-sharing, ride-splitting, microtransit and combinations of them. All match supply and demand of available vehicles/seats using a digital platform. Scientific literature on potential impact of DORS on tram investments is lacking however. This thesis aimed to contribute to science by exploring the potential impact of DORS developments on investment policy in the tram system in an urban context. A framework for substitution was developed and four distinct scenarios for the impact of DORS on tram substitution and investments were written with the help of an expert panel. Moreover, the implications of these scenarios for tram investment policy were discussed. It was found that the development of DORS can have significant impact on tram investment policy, because substitution to some degree and risk of divestment is probable in three out of four scenarios. Disruptive impact however is probable in only one scenario and impact is larger for the already low demand tram corridors and less to non, for the bigger tram corridors. DORS can be beneficial for tram investments as well. To address this uncertainty in investment policy a robust and multiple strategy approach can be considered. MTA can also gamble by not considering the scenarios or choose one as truth, but this is not without risks.","Ride-sourcing; Ride-splitting; Disruptive innovations; Microtransit; Digital On-demand Ride Sharing Services (DORS); Tram; Investment policy; Scenario analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is the most widely used building material and due to its characteristics suitable for a wide range of applications. Still, for the last century steel and concrete have been the materials of choice for large buildings. Part of the reason for this is the lack of knowledge in the industry regarding timber construction. Now that the environmental problems such as climate change get more and more attention, there is an opportunity for timber as a building material and the manufacturers of timber products to increase its popularity.<br/>Cross-Laminated Timber, or CLT, is a relatively new product. First introduced in the early 1990’s in Austria and Germany, now gaining popularity in residential and non-residential applications in several countries around the world. The panels normally have 3 or more layers of side-by-side placed boards, that are stacked crosswise at a 90 degree angle. The boards are glued on their wide faces and may or may not be glued together on their narrow faces.<br/>The Derix Group, a company with a vast experience in the timber industry, specializes in laminated timber constructions and are interested in developing a new panel configuration. The idea is that by relocating boards from the middle layer of a CLT element, to a more favourable position, material usage can be optimized.<br/>A problem definition is formulated and used to derive the research questions that form the direction of the thesis. The research questions are related to the possible advantages and the consequences of the Hollow Core Cross-Laminated Timber (HCCLT) configuration.<br/>The first thing that is done in order to investigate the possibilities, is research into the manufacturing process and the structural design of CLT. As a relatively flexible building material with a low dead weight, the design of CLT is often determined by serviceability criteria, such as deformation and vibration. However, the rolling shear properties of the cross-layers can control the design, it influences the effective bending stiffness and stress distribution. It also causes a larger deformation due to shear than for other wood based products. Since there is not one specific design method, the most common methods are researched and described.<br/> The composite theory<br/> The mechanically jointed beams theory<br/> The shear analogy<br/><br/>To determine how the existing methods perform and to investigate the structural behaviour of a HCCLT element compared to a CLT element, the methods are used to calculate different configurations in order to compare the results.<br/>The knowledge obtained during the research and calculations is then used to model a HCCLT element. Different models are made in order to investigate the behaviour during manufacturing and for when the element is in use.<br/><br","Timber; Cross laminated Timber; Hollow core; Structural design; Manufacturing; CLT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to accomplish this, a literature review is presented about the election process in other countries and new possibilities with state of the art technology are reviewed.

These transactions are visible and verifiable for anyone connected to the decentralized network. Due to this decentralized design, the network is resilient against DDoS attacks and has no single point of failure. Machine readable travel documents are used for the authentication. Dutch travel documents (passports, identity cards and driver’s licences) are designed according to the ICAO machine readable travel document standard, which also requires the presence of a biometric chip. This means that every citizen already has access to a PKI (public key infrastructure) key pair, which can be used to sign data.

Existing models of hydraulic flow in soils need to be tested and confirmed again and again to make sure it’s trustworthy. With the use of three-layered samples containing 1mm and 3mm glass bead sizes a simplified model of the fining upward (1mm top layer) and coarsening upward (3mm top layer) stratification was made. The top and bottom layers consist of a uniform glass bead size. The middle layer is a binary mixed one with different volumetric percentages to mimic the gradual increase of grain sizes like fining and coarsening upward sediment deposits. A decrease in the permeability was observed as the volume percentage of the smaller glass beads increased. The influence of a possible transition/mixed zone between layers was not clear because of the small ratios of the used glass beads. This is also the case for the effect of the porosity on the permeability. In addition, test samples were prepared to calculate the theoretical harmonic permeability to be able to compare it with the actual measured permeability. This theoretical harmonic permeability seems in the case of the coarsening upward samples smaller than the actual measured permeability as was expected from findings of another research. This study confirms the influence of the relative positioning of the layers with their specific properties on the overall permeability and the deviation from the theoretical harmonic permeability. Future prediction of the permeability’s in layered deposits is a little bit more educated with the findings of this study.","Permeability; porosity; fining upward; harmonic permeability; falling head test","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Block mattresses are widely used bed protection elements under non-uniform flows. Previous studies show that the turbulence of the flow plays a key role on the instability of the mattress. However, in the available design equations, the turbulence intensity is included as a magnification factor roughly and qualitatively defined. Consequently, the design equations are often used as a rule of thumb, where the engineering criteria of the designer is critical and large safety factor are used. In turbulent non-uniform flows, the available design equations were developed for uniforms flow and the turbulent intensity is included as a magnification factor, usually poorly defined. The stability reduction due to turbulence has been proved by several authors. However, there is not any study in previous literature that investigate the role of velocity fluctuations on block mattress failure. Nevertheless, the literature review showed that an innovative approach, which combines the mean velocity and the turbulence intensity to quantify the flow forces, has been largely study for loose rock by several authors. Following this trend, the option of applying this structure (u ̅+α√k) as a flow quantification on Pilarczyk equation was decided to study. For this purpose, a series of test were done under four different configurations. Two weir heights were used (15 and 18.5cm) and the distances corresponding to 3h and 4h were checked. Four failures were recorded for each configuration for a total of 16 failures. Additionally, a data base was recorded for each configuration where the flow discharge was related to mean velocity and the turbulence intensity. An analysis of the failure mechanism was done by synchronizing the velocity time series with the displacement of the blocks. The results showed that an episode of peak streamwise velocity and downwards (sweep) was present at the failure. However, the analysis of the velocity showed that higher combinations of streamwise velocity and shear stress were present before the failure on almost all the records. Therefore, the streamwise velocity and the induced shear stress cannot solely explain the failure of the block mattress. This conclusion is in line with the work done by Hofland (2005). However, the recorded data did not allow to describe completely the failure mechanism. <br/>The turbulence magnification factor (α) at the stability equation was derived by two different approaches. The first approach was based on the peaks of velocity associated to failure while the second one was described as a fitting parameter. The analysis concluded that the α values were close to 3 for both cases, in line with the expected value from previous studies. Finally, the new developed equation was compared with the original Pilarczyk equation and the modification proposed by the Rock Manual (2007). The comparison shows that the new developed equation described the required thickness of the block more accurately than the available equations. Thus, the results show that the proposed approach described the effect of turbulence accurately on a design equation. Additionally, all the relevant derived conclusions for design propose were summarized in a design guideline.","stability; Bed protection; Block mattress; Non-Uniform; Turbulence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-07-03","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

Their use is related to the need for solutions on issues that correspond to the building environment. Modelling aspects, like geometric, semantic information and topology are necessary, in order to provide an integrated result of spatial analysis. The creation of a complete 3D city model that contains all the needed information for an application, is a time consuming and complex process. Furthermore, different 3D city model formats can contain different aspects of the same features. For example, a CityGML model can have the semantic information of a 3D object, while a Multi-View Stereo Mesh model can contain all the geometric and appearance information of the same 3D object.<br/>This thesis is documenting the possible enrichments that can be done bidirectionally between these two different 3D city model formats, when both exist for the same entities. Moreover, it presents the exploration of possible automated enrichment methodologies that can enrich each 3D city model automatically with information from the other one. Finally, an automatic bidirectional enrichment methodology is proposed and is implemented on a testing area, provided in the two different 3D city model formats. This method is based on distance computations between the meshes of the two 3D city models, used to match corresponding features, or part of features, in order to segment semantically the Multi-View Stereo Mesh model (roof, wall, road, terrain, uncertain) and transfer texture to the surfaces of the CityGML model that correspond with the surfaces of the Multi-View Stereo Mesh model.<br/>In addition, distance computations are performed for the validation of the absence of buildings and the shapes of the roofs in the CityGML model, with respect to the information given from the Multi-View Stereo Mesh model.

Numerous researches have focused on the technical since the rise of DDoS amplification attacks. However, there is less understanding regarding their target selection on financial services. This research uses a mixed method approach to capture factors that influence cybercriminals in their selection of victims. Via data from amplification DDoS honeypots, various factors are identified and explanatory models are provided. In addition, financial cyber security experts are consulted to assess their perspective on target selection. The analysis demonstrates that certain countries have significantly higher or lower victims, which can partially be explained through country level factors such as the ICT development and Normal GDP Per capita. In addition, the ICT development influences the duration of the attack significantly. The findings also indicate that organizational size, as measured by market value, showed a limited effect on the number of attacks. Contrary, experts regarded the size as a highly influential factor. The analyses furthermore demonstrate that financial organisations incur significantly more attacks on Friday than on any other day. Moreover, the experts mention additional target selection factors such as,<br/>reputation, media attention, patching, having capable employees, and mitigation parties. Finally, this paper reflects on the implications of these findings for the financial sector and related sectors.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management (SEPAM)","",""

All transactions that are handled by bunq are monitored for these cases of fraud by a transaction monitoring system. When this system flags a transaction as being possibly fraudulent, a bunq employee has to manually check this transaction. The problem with the current system is that it proves to be time consuming and labor intensive. This is caused by the fact that there are a lot of transactions which are falsely flagged as possibly fraudulent, these transactions are called false positives. This resulted in a demand for a system which reduced the number of false positives and thereby the time needed to manually check the flagged transactions. <br/><br/>To fulfill this demand, bunq has been working on creating a machine learning model which classifies transactions as fraudulent or legitamte. This machine learning model has shown promising results during test runs on historical data. However, it was not yet production ready, because it was very slow and there existed no connection with the existing bunq back-end.<br/><br/>During the project, a new transaction monitoring system was designed and implemented. The new system uses a combination of a bunq-made machine learning model and a set of pre-defined rules to flag a transaction as possibly fraudulent or not. The final system implementation consists out of 5 different components: (1) an incoming transaction system, responsible for noticing new transactions and segregating those over different workers so that they can be classified in parallel, (2) an information gathering system, which efficiently gathers large sets of needed information for the classification, (3) a machine learning model server, which enables fast communication with altering machine learning models, (4) a set of pre-defined rules, which check transactions for indicators of fraud and (5) a Grafana dashboard which monitors the performance and statistics of the machine learning model, the pre-defined rules and our system. <br/><br/>The system is fully tested by unit and integration tests. Furthermore, new machine learning models and pre-defined rules can be easily adopted. All the above mentioned components are implemented and fully working. The final implementation is focused on integrating the system in the currently existing bunq back-end, because the system will actually be used in production.","Transaction Monitoring; Fraud; Machine Learning","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The beaches of the Hague are cleaned by so called beach cleaners. Beach cleaners are large tractor pulled screening machines that effectively screen/rake garbage from the beach. There is however a problem with these machines. Together with the garbage, large quantities of shells are taken in. This is in-desirable for three reasons. 1: Shells are materials that belong to a natural beach and should therefor not be taken away. 2: Shells help prevent beach erosion because of their sand-clinching characteristics. More shells mean less beach erosion. 3: Shells form a large weight fraction of the material collected by the beach cleaners and therefor account for a large part of the disposal costs. Leaving them on the beach will significantly decrease these costs. This thesis shows the development of the ShellSaver. The ShellSaver is an add on to the current Beach cleaners, It is situated within the large collection container on top of the beach cleaner and separates the shells from the collected garbage in three separation steps. A disc screen separates large garbage from small garbage and shells. The first zigzag wind sifter separates glass and iron from shells and plastics. In the second zigzag wind sifter the shells are separated from the plastics and are returned to the beach. A prototype of the concept was developed and tested on a sample taken from one of the beach cleaners.

Therefore, in history many have tried to stabilize rolling ship<br/>starting with Watts in 1883. He described the damping of the roll motion by<br/>having a group of men running to the ""high"" side of the vessel. Since then,<br/>a great deal have been written about the subject of roll damping for<br/>stationary vessels. The principle however has been the same ever since, a<br/>shift of mass to counter the roll motion. Water tanks, carts on a curved track and sliding masses, all tend work with this principle. In 1904 Schlick introduced another device to damp roll motions was introduced, the gyroscope. By controlling the precession angle, the roll motion could be damped. Following from an increase in computational power more advanced control strategies could be applied, leading to a renewed interest in the subject as well as different methods to model the vessel for controller design.<br/><br/>In the current paper, the performance of a gyroscope is compared with the performance of a moving mass, modeled as a double pendulum, for dynamic performance of a showcase vessel, the Huisdrill P10000. Results of this analytic study are promising, a reduction of more than 80% for both systems was <br/>achieved at the natural frequency of the Huisdrill. The decay time after a roll amplitude of 5.7 degree was reduced from about 250 seconds to 60 seconds for the gyroscope controller model and 70 seconds for the double-pendulum controller model. A static heel control system is modeled based on the double-<br/>pendulum equations. This proves to be able to compensate for the heeling moment depending on the weight at the crane tip as well as the weight and distance available to compensate. Combing the static an dynamic approach is possible with the note that there should be sufficient space for the mass to deviate after compensating for static heel.<br/><br/>In irregular waves the 4-DoF model shows good performance for the showcase of the Huisdrill P10000. The RMS value for the roll-roll motion was decreased by 65% For other degrees of freedom, similar reductions were obtained. From this it can be included that for the given seastate, significant reductions can be achieved using the ballast train. In the time domain, it was shown that great reductions in most probable maximum of reduction of roll amplitude were achieved for time periods close to the natural frequency of the vessel. For no time period, reductions in performance were measured. It was found that <br/>the most probable maximum roll angle linearly increased with the wave height, as well as the most probable deviation did.<br/><br/>Interpreting the results of this study, it can be stated that both the gyroscopic control system as well as the double-pendulum system are able to introduce great reduction in dynamic roll motions. The main benefit of using the double-pendulum system is its ability to compensate for the heeling moment induced <br/>by the swiveling crane as well as compensating for the dynamic motions that a vessel will undergo offshore.<br/><br/>It is recommended to do a simulation of a non-linear time-domain model or to perform model tests for verification of the results found in this report. The gap between static and dynamic control should be filled by a master control which is to be designed and run in the time domain.","Roll damping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-03","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

IoT has the potential to improve business processes and change the ways we live. KPN New Business has a high affinity with IoT projects and supplied the problem definition that this project builds on. The project has been done in close collaboration with KPN. <br/><br/>This document describes the design process for a stand-alone obstruction detection system for supermarket environments. The focus lies on obstructions near emergency exits, where they pose safety threats and obstructions in shopping aisle, where they hinder customers. The system should detect obstructions and communicate the presence of an obstruction to a central server. The communication is however not within the scope of this design report.<br/><br/>Five sensing techniques were considered for the detection system, ultrasonic ranging sensor were deemed the most suitable for this application. Ultrasonic sensors lend themselves well for IoT applications as they are easy to implement, cheap and operate on low power. <br/><br/>A MaxBotix MB1300 sensor was chosen for the implementation of the prototype as it offers an Analog Envelope (AE) output of the measurements. This allows for multiple objects to be detected in a single measurement. Furthermore, the MB1300 sensor has the largest beam width in the AE product line and can thus cover the most surface area.<br/><br/>The processing of the measurements in the prototype is done using an Arduino Mega 2560. The Arduino board allows for easy prototyping and has sufficient memory on-board to store and process the measurements. The measurements are sampled using the built-in ADC of the Arduino at a sampling frequency of approximately 8.93 kHz. The sampling frequency is a trade-off between the spatial resolution of the system and the memory required to store the measurements.<br/><br/>An algorithm is developed for the detection of objects from the sampled measurements. The process involves the windowing of the measurements to only look at relevant samples. A background subtraction is performed to avoid the detection of scenic objects, and the objects are detected using a threshold.<br/><br/>A data structure was created in order to store the detected objects. An algorithm was developed to check whether detected objects remain static. If an object is repeatedly detected it is marked as an obstruction. If an object goes unseen for a certain period, the object is removed from the memory. Thresholds for when an object is marked as an obstructions, the deletion of objects and measurement intervals are suggested for emergency exits and shopping aisle systems. These should however be verified in further development.<br/><br/>The performance of the system was evaluated in testing environments for the emergency exits and shopping aisles. Testing results showed that the system performs well on most design criteria. The area covered by a single sensor was however below expectations. This could be problematic for the implementation of the system in shopping aisles, as lots of sensors would be required to cover entire shopping aisles. Also some false positives occurred in the detection of obstructions. This could however easily be solved with minor changes to the detection algorithm.<br/><br/>Based on the testing results the conclusion is drawn that the design goals are partially met. The system is able to detect obstructions, but does not yet operate as a stand-alone unit. This design goal was however considered in every design choice. Power consumption of the prototype remains to be tested, this however is also dependant on the communication system.<br/><br/>Recommended is to further look into the power consumption of the system, the implementation of a multi-sensor system to cover more floor area in shopping aisles, and to reconsider CCTV images for the detection of obstructions in shopping aisles.","Internet of Things; IOT; Ultrasonic sensor; Arduino; Object detection; Obstruction detection","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

With this, the possibility of households to become “prosumers” (producers and consumers of energy at the same time) becomes an attractive alternative due to the opportunity to save on the electricity bill costs. The traditional concept where a household can only purchase from the grid becomes outdated; this also triggers the concern of “death spiral.” The reinforcing loop where the increase of the prosumers can provoke them to defect from the grid and force the utilities to increase their tariffs in order to cover their network grid and additional policies cost. Where in the past, this kind of condition was unlikely to happen. Due to household consumers are usually the least elastic and ended up carrying the burden of the of the cost because this type of end user will not change their consumption by much, even if prices increase greatly (Alleman, 1999; Ramsey, 1927).<br/>This research is using Vensim software to build and run a model of the Spanish household market based on System Dynamics (SD) methodology. The model is using six different scenarios that tested into four kinds of combinations of policy: no net metering and mixed tariff, no net metering and volumetric tariffs, net metering and volumetric tariffs, and net metering with mixed tariff. On top of that, the possibility of exit charges and network-only regulation charges were also being tested on those four combinations of policy, to see about the potential possibility of the “death spiral” in the Spanish household market. Results indicated that there is less possibility for the “death spiral” happening in Spain’s household market. Interestingly, cost recovery aside the concept of net metering leads to less to none of the grid defection, and without net metering, it is encouraging households to defect from the grid. Other results are fixed-network regulation cost can dampen grid disconnection, but at the same time delayed the RES adoption, and exit charges managed to prevent grid defection. Other alternatives are needed to be explored in order to foster RES, efficient market mechanisms need to be designed in order to put in level playing field different technologies at different scales and not incentivizing certain technologies with non-transparent cost shifting among consumers as net-metering does.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Economics and Management of Network Industries (EMIN)","","","","","","","",""

This estimations are based on base flow separation and a SWAT model. Multiple base flow separation methods are applied and these are compared with the base flow produced by the SWAT model. This first estimations show a range of 248-670 mm average groundwater recharge per year, which is roughly 11-30% of the average annual rain in the catchment. The upper limit, produced by SWAT, seems to be too high, as the total flow is overestimated due to a rate of evaporation which is too low compared with remote sensing based evaporation. In the Chindwin it appeared that it is rather difficult to separate the base flow due to the highly sensitive alpha parameter, which determines the response behaviour of the base flow, also there seem to be multiple groundwater components. This makes it hard to perform base flow separation, but also increases the difficulty of calibrating the SWAT model, especially the base flow component. However the SWAT model shows a clear spatial groundwater recharge pattern even though it needs further optimization. Optimizing a (hydraulic) model can be cumbersome and especially in a developing environment as Myanmar it is also interesting to look at other possibilities/models, like Water Accounting +, which are more flexible to adapt to changes as new dams or increase in groundwater irrigation.","Groundwater; recharge; Myanmar; Chindwin; SWAT; Base flow separation; IWMI","en","student report","","","","","","","","2019-06-15","","","","Water Management","Internship",""

It was in collaboration with Fugro N.V., a large Dutch consultancy and engineering firm that is active in onshore and offshore services in the field of geological and geotechnical investigations for a wide field of clients in the petroleum and gas industry but also for other infrastructure. Current methods for the classification of soils comprise of laboratory and in-situ measurements. Fugro is searching for a more accurate and time efficient method to classify soil and provided five soil samples on which a classification had to be performed. The Leica C10 laser scanner, provided by the department of Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TU Delft), was used to scan the soil samples. TLS is based on LIDAR (light detection and ranging) which is known for emitting pulses in a very narrow beam of monochromatic light (one wavelength) in the ultraviolet, visible or near-infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum. After scanning the soil samples, the following features extracted from the 3D point cloud data were used to perform classification on each soil sample: intensity (backscattered energy), colour (an RGB-image), surface height variations (roughness). The chosen method was iso cluster unsupervised classification. After classification, interpretations were made based on the descriptions of the soil sample and knowledge of bare soil reflectance. The main factors that influenced the soil reflectance were related to characteristics of the samples: glauconite content (an iron-bearing mineral) and surface roughness. Both factors were responsible for a decrease in soil reflectance. Unsupervised classification was applicable on three out of five samples. However, only one sample provided good results. The other two samples were less promising, although some features could clearly be identified after comparing the classified image with ground truth data.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

In addition bugs in mobile apps can cause the reputation of the app on the store to decrease and thereby the the number of downloads. Hence the following question is central to our research: can we automate user interface testing for mobile apps and multiple platforms without human interaction?<br/><br/>To overcome the limitation of multi-platform testing, as well as to help non-developers in the creation of tests, we introduce a novel tool that is able to test behaviour on mobile devices by defining expected scenarios. These scenarios consist of simple human readable instructions that are easy to write and understand by non-developers. These scenarios can then be tested against multiple operating systems and devices by simply connecting a device and pressing a button.","mobile testing; behaviour driven testing; platform-indepent testing","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Starting from the skin and possibly continuing to the bone, tissue slowly decays when the pressure keeps being applied to the same spot. Prevention is the best method of treating the ulcers and it is done by regularly changing posture. Normally a person does this automatically but for a portion of hospital patients this option is not there. <br/><br/>The goal of this project was to design and create a prototype which can track the body position of a person on a bed. This way an alarm can be triggered when a person stays in the same body position for too long. To complete this goal a list of requirements was created to guide the design process. The most import design requirement was the ability to track the body position non-intrusively, which means a person should not perceive the tracker in any way. Furthermore, minimizing cost and interference were also important design considerations.<br/><br/>Using piezoelectric and piezoresistive sensors beneath a mattress, the pressure a person applies to it can be measured and used to determine the body position. The sensor encasing is thin enough to go unnoticed through the mattress when lied upon. Therefore, the non-intrusive tracking is successfully implemented.<br/><br/>By keeping the circuitry simple and looking for the most cost-effective components the overall costs for the entire electrical system are kept to a reasonable minimum. For the piezoelectric circuit a parallel zener diode was all that was necessary and the piezoresistive circuit consists of an inverting amplifier and low-pass filter. The cost per system comes down to $€146.39$, which can still decrease when a more tailor-made microcontroller is used for reading out the analog-to-digital converters and when costs decrease due to buying in bulk.<br/><br/>Minimizing the interference for the system is implemented to some degree for the piezoresistive by adding a low-pass filter before the ADC input. The lack of physical shielding results in a poor interference reduction. This will have to be addressed in the future.<br/><br/>The required cooperation within the project resulted in many prototypes being developed to ensure the algorithm could use the most recent version of the system at any time. The collaboration with a mechanical engineering student resulted in an integrated prototype of both mechanical and electrical design.<br/><br/>The additional targets set for the project consisted of detecting respiration rate and heart rate, creating a PCB and creating a pilot worthy prototype. Of these targets the PCB creation is the only target which is nearly completed. Soldering the PCB can however not be done before completing this report due to delivery times.","Sensors; Pressure ulcer; non-intrusive","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2027-07-19","","","","","",""

Also in the Netherlands, tidal turbines have been installed. This has been done in the storm surge barrier that is positioned in the inlet of the Eastern Scheldt. These turbines have an impact on sedimentation. Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyse the effect of tidal turbines on the sediment transport in the Eastern Scheldt. Within this research, there is a distinct focus on how the tidal situation plays a role in this. Literature research has been carried out to gain knowledge that is needed to fulfill this objective. From this literature research it could be concluded that the effect of tidal turbines on sediment transport is much greater when the tide is (horizontally) asymmetric. It means that the maximum flow velocity in ebb-direction does not equal the maximum flow velocity in flood-direction. This results in a net sediment transport in one direction. It can be concluded that the greater the tidal asymmetry, the greater the net sediment transport. Now, it was time to qualify the aspects of the tide where the sediment transport depends on. This has been done by analytical elaborations of the relation between sediment transport and flow velocity. From this, it could be concluded that the sediment transport is depending on the wave height amplitude, discharge amplitude and the phase difference between the wave height and the discharge. The obtained relation was implemented into a Matlab model that computes the wave height and the discharge due to arbitrary tidal waves. The model has been extended to a network of channels that represents the Eastern Scheldt. With the extended model it was possible to simulate a net sediment transport, due to tidal asymmetry. The storm surge barrier and the tidal turbines could be implemented in this model, represented by a higher resistance. This resulted in a lower wave height- and discharge amplitude and with that also the net sediment tranport decreased. Since the net sediment transport is directed seawards, a decrease meant less erosion of the channels. But from the literature research it was concluded that the construction of the storm surge barrier and of the tidal turbines resulted in more erosion of the channels. An explanation for this difference in results may be that in the model, only sediment transport due to tidal asymmetry is taken into account. Other forms of transport are not considered. Also, many assumptions have been made in the model and there is still room for improvement to represent the reality more accurate with this model, which could be subject to further research.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thanks to the supportive legislations, advances in technologies and reduction of costs, residential electricity consumers are increasingly incentivized to actively participate in managing their consumption and installing distributed generation units. Several studies have suggested that battery storage coupled with solar photovoltaics (PV) can benefit both households and the electricity grid. These facts call for a model to help households determine the composition of their grid-connected photovoltaic battery system based on the specific situations in Spain. This paper proposes an optimization-based mixed integer linear programing model for the sizing and scheduling of residential battery storage co-located with solar PV in the context of present self-consumption regulation and three tariff schemes (the 2.0A, the 2.0DHA, and a newly proposed three-period tariff). The objective function for the household is to minimize the annualized electricity expenditure while satisfying the current electricity demand and constraints. To illustrate the model, a 5-spaces household in Sevilla is selected as an example. The load of the appliances is modelled by a load generation model with statistical data of appliances and time-of-use information. The optimization model is built with mixed integer linear programming (MILP) method in GAMS. Besides the business as usual case, 100 scenarios are created to discover the best combinations when PV/battery prices decrease to different levels. The future scenario analysis is helpful to discover future uncertainties, tipping points, and better regulatory incentives. The results of the paper contribute in the following three aspects: -Provide guides for the investment decision of the households to take advantage of PV/batteries to minimize the expenditure. -Test the performance of the tariff schemes and test the soundness of the future. -Provide suggestions for the regulators on designing incentives.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Economics and Management of Network Industries (EMIN)","","","","","","","",""

The more feasible offshore conditions in windfarms create optimal situations for reef recovery in combination with Aquaculture, Integrated Multi-Trophic (IMTA). The combination of Windfarms and IMTA can be a first step towards oyster reef restoration in the North Sea by creating the assumed right conditions for oyster growth and survival.

As part of the development process different analyses need to be developed for characterisation of heart muscle cells. For this purpose, more traditional methods such measuring the action potential can be used. But newer methods such as measuring the contraction by means of optical imaging are being developed and tested. In this paper, image analysis characterisation of cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells are explored. Using images recorded from transmission light as well as fluorescent beads the movements of a monolayer of cells is tracked and analysed. Next to this, the potential for live cell imaging of actin structures during contraction is explored, allowing the study of sarcomere compaction during contraction.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Nanobiology","",""
