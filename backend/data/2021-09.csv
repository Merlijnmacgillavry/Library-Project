PPU business models are currently mostly used within shared washing rooms, which is also the segment in which ASKO will enter withtheir first circular washing machines. However, even though PPU business models help nudge sustainable consumer behaviour, it can also have negative effects on consumer acceptance towards PSS and create negative emotional connections towards the brand itself. Key competitors currently offer circular products under PPU or leasing business models, but lack differentiation and clear unique selling points. To date, most competitors in the market struggle to offer new experiences with a circular product launch and seem to solely meet the requirements of potential regulations. However, this also offers an opportunity towards ASKO, as they have a chance to reposition their brand towards a broader target market and create new and unique brand experiences which set themselves apart from competition. MyASKO is a sub-brand and brand extension of ASKO which is targeted towards “aware millennials” who are using shared washing rooms within student accommodations, serviced apartments or communal homes. MyASKO also offers a digital brand experience which is rewarding and gives members the opportunity to proactively contribute towards local &amp; global sustainable initiatives by choosing to wash on sustainable modes. By making the experience more rewarding and by engaging with local communities through sustainable initiatives, MyASKO increased the chance to create brand loyalty and potentially keep members for future circular washing machines for the private domestic market.","Product Service System; Branding; User Experience; Circular Economy; Washing Machines; White Goods; ASKO; Gorenje; Brand Strategy; Marketing; Digitalization; Consumer Engagement; Gamification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) circumvents this limit by sparsely exciting fluorescent molecules at different time instances. Single molecules can subsequently be localized with improved precision over the diffraction limit. Due to their high frame rate, single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays are imagers that can be used for SMLM. Most SPADs have to recharge after each photon arrival. During this recharging period, the SPAD is insensitive to more photon arrivals. As a result, SPAD arrays will measure zero or one photons for each pixel in each frame, whereas scientific complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (sCMOS) imagers and electron multiplying charge-coupled devices (EMCCD) have a discrete frame output. Here, we describe the photon arrivals in the image formation model of the SPAD array as a binomial process rather than as a Poissonian process. In addition, we quantify the minimum theoretical uncertainty of single-molecule localizations using a binomial Cramér-Rao lower bound and benchmark it with simulated and experimental data. We show that if the expected photon count is larger than one for all pixels within one standard deviation of a Gaussian point spread function, the binomial CRLB gives a 46% higher theoretical uncertainty than the Poissonian CRLB. Without saturation, which is the case for most SMLM applications, the binomial CRLB model gives the same uncertainty as the Poissonian CRLB. Therefore, the binomial CRLB can be used to predict and benchmark localization uncertainty for SMLM with SPAD arrays for all practical emitter intensities.","Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy; Single-Photon Avalanche Diode Array; Cramér-Rao Lower Bound","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

This transport can be captured in two main loading processes: the loading division, which consists of allocating items to different trailers, and the loading sequence, which considers placing the items onto their respective trailer. <br/>The possibility of automating the process of the loading division is investigated. This includes the digital generation of the loading sequence process. Achieving a form of automation would both mean a reduction in time required to create a loading division as well as allow for optimizing the number of required trailers. <br/>Using an extensive literature review as well as an in-depth investigation of the current situation at the company, a model is developed, which consists of an ALNS heuristic responsible for the loading division, and a new function, the layer heuristic, proposed in this report, that digitally generates the loading sequence. <br/>The proposed model is validated using various experiments on real-life data, including several sensitivity analyses. For the used data set, the model is able to reduce the existing loading division by at least 24%, and the computation time is superior to the current time required to create a loading division. Because the loading sequence process is created digitally, the model is capable of checking all the loading conditions, such as axle loads, even before the actual loading sequence has taken place.","3D space optimization; Multiple Bin Size Bin Packing Problem; Adaptive large neighborhood search","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Distributed planning differs from centralised approaches because it is performed by several agents, which coordinate plans with each other in order to meet a global objective. In this research, we examine airport surface movement operations and focus specifically on improving the conflict detection abilities of a Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) approach for distributed planning and coordination using machine learning. Our MAPF proposal is built on top of a distributed CBS-based algorithm implemented in an existing Multi-Agent System (MAS) model of Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (AAS). In the proposed approach, we use a delegated Multi-Agent System (dMAS), firstly, to propagate information related to the intended aircraft paths and, secondly, to perform the conflict detection task of the CBS algorithm. To achieve these, the dMAS accesses a set of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), each allocated to specific taxiway segments to obtain traversal time estimates of aircraft intending to use those segments. Propagated aircraft intentions are used as predictors for future traversal time predictions either during the intention propagation phase or during CBS conflict detection. The proposed planning and coordination model and three of its variants were tested on a real-world flight schedule extracted from ADS-B ground tracks. Comparisons with a baseline approach that implements a forward kinematic simulation for conflict detection revealed that dMAS-CBS offered more precise conflict predictions while being less prone to Type I errors. More specifically, under scenarios where the airport operates at peak capacity, dMAS-CBS was twice as precise and produced up to five times fewer false positives predictions than the baseline approach.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

For linear stationary processes, such as AR processes, the direction of time is independent of the model parameters. By combining theoretical principles of time-reversibility in time series with conventional modeling approaches such as information criteria, I design a criterion that employs the backwards prediction (backcast) as a proxy for the forecast. Hereby, I aim to adopt a finite sample, data-driven approach to model selection. The novel criterion is named the \textit{backwards validated information criterion (BVIC)}. The \acs{BVIC} quantifies forecasting performance of models by trading off a measure of \mbox{goodness-of-fit} and a models ability to predict backwards. I test the performance of the BVIC by conducting experiments on synthetic and real data. In each experiment, the BVIC is examined in contrast to conventionally employed criteria.<br/><br/>Experimental results suggest that the BVIC has comparable performance to conventional information criteria. Specifically, in most of the experiments performed, I did not find statistically significant differences between the forecast error of the BVIC under certain parameterizations and that of the different information criteria. Nonetheless, it is worth emphasizing that the BVIC guarantees are established by design where the model order penalization term depends on strong mathematical properties of time-reversibility and a finite data assessment. In particular, the penalization term is replaced by a weighted trade-off between functional dimensions pertaining to forecasting. <br/><br/><br/>That said, I observed that the BVIC recovered more accurately the real order of the underlying process than the other criteria, which rely on a static penalization of the model order. Lastly, leveraging the latter property, I perform the assessment of the order model (or, memory) of time series pertaining to epileptic seizures recorded using electrocorticographic data. The results provide converging evidence that the order of the model increases during the epileptic events.<br","Time Series; Forecasting; Model selection; Identification; Time dependency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

With the help of genetic engineering, the DNA of micro-organisms can be altered to produce value-added products (e.g., enzymes, vitamins, and alternative proteins) efficiently and sustainably. There has been lots of research activity about public perception and acceptance of genetic engineering in the food industry during the last decades. The EU Regulations provide significant loopholes, and companies fear strong anti-genetically modified organisms (GMO) lobby due to early scandals to notably GMO plants and animals. Until now, most research groups studied the public perception of genetically modified animals (GMAs) and genetically modified plants (GMPs). However, the public perception towards genetically modified micro-organisms (GMMs) has not been studied intensively, while valuable products are hampered. This research explores public emotions and underlying ethical concerns towards GMMs in the dairy-based industry through literature research, semi-structured expert interviews, and online questionnaires. Experts in this field hypothesize that people look differently towards specific GMO products and that consumer acceptance rises when a clear benefit is given. Techno-ethical scenarios were created to study laypeople and to verify different propositions made by experts. Roeser (2018) argues that moral emotions can play an important role in judging the ethical aspects of risky technologies. We used the theoretical approach from Roeser (2018) as a guideline to offer concrete recommendations for further study and essential elements to consider for decision-making on GMM technology. From this research, it can be concluded that the opinions, as in other debates, do not seem to be polarized. The majority of the public feels optimistic about GMM products when it gives a clear benefit. The emotions point to ethical concerns that are most important for specific types of products and consumers. The negative emotions (fear, anger, powerlessness, irritation, and disgust) and positive emotions (interest, hope, joy, happiness, and surprise) link to awareness, trustworthiness, and autonomy to be essential for GMM product acceptance.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Of these devices, the greatest uptake amongst trucking fleets has been for devices fitted to the underbody, primarily on account of allowing free movement of freight into and out of the trailer, hence incentivizing a better understanding of the flowfield in this region. The current research addresses the aerodynamics of trailer wheels in tandem, which form a key component of the semi-trailer underbody, by investigating the effects of wheel rotation, trailer side-skirts, and wheel cavity covers on the flowfield and drag. The configurations tested include a short side-skirt terminating before the front edge of the leading wheel, a long side-skirt covering both the wheels, wheel covers without openings (solid disks), and wheel covers with openings varying in coverage area and radial position. <br/><br/>Stereoscopic (2D-3C) PIV is applied to examine the flow topology in the near wake and on selected planes besides the wheels. The measured velocity data in the wake is further used to derive the pressure field (by solving the Poisson equation for pressure), which together are then used to calculate the drag using a control volume approach. The uncertainty in the derived pressure field and drag values is determined using linear uncertainty propagation. <br/><br/>The largest drag reduction from the baseline case, i.e. without a side-skirt or wheel covers, is seen for the long side-skirt, followed by the short side-skirt with wheel covers, short side-skirt only, and wheel covers only, in that order. The effectiveness of both the long side-skirt and wheel covers is seen to increase with wheel rotation, with an appreciable reduction in drag with the wheel covers fitted only seen for rotating wheels. Investigation of the flowfield in the wake shows significant differences between the stationary and rotating wheel, particularly within the region of the projected wheel profile, and indicates to an earlier separation of flow along the upper surface of the rotating wheel. The effect of the side-skirt on the velocity in the wake is seen primarily in a lower streamwise velocity deficit, narrower wake, and higher horizontal symmetry of the wake for the skirted configuration. Wheel covers show a comparatively limited effect on the velocity field in the wake, showing a marginally wider wake and a slightly higher velocity deficit for the uncovered wheel. On planes beside the wheels, the side-skirt and wheel covers show a greater influence than wheel rotation, considered to be a consequence of a static floor combined with a gap between the wheel and the ground. The non-skirted configurations here exhibit a larger region of separated flow and greater velocity deficit whereas the uncovered wheels show an outflow at the bottom of the wheel cavity and an inflow at the top. Finally, the wheel covers with openings show a behavior between that of a covered and an uncovered wheel, with the inflow/outflow depending significantly on the coverage percentage and radial position.","PIV; wheel aerodynamics; trailer side-skirt; wheel cavity covers; aerodynamic drag","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Wind turbines that need to be installed in the next decade will reach a capacity of 15 MW, with an approximate rotor diameter of 240 meters. The currently used wind turbine installation vessels cannot install these larger wind turbines; hence, investments need to be made. An opportunity arises from the oil and gas industry: investments in this industry are decreasing. Thus, the floating monohull fleet working in this industry will need repurposing in the upcoming decade. <br/><br/>In this thesis, the operational limit of a single blade installation with a floating monohull crane vessel is sought. An installation method is proposed where taglines are used to compensate vessel motions and wind loads on the blade. Motion compensation with taglines is a technology that is already being used in the industry, which makes it attractive to contractors who are hesitant to use new technologies. The proposed installation concept uses three different compensation systems, allowing the blade motions to be decoupled and controlled separately. One of the compensation systems is selected and investigated in more detail in this research. The selected compensation system compensates for the blade motion in y- and yaw-direction with two dynamically controlled taglines horizontally attached from the blade to the crane boom. <br/><br/>The operational limit is determined for the final installation stage, the mating phase between the blade and the hub. The alignment of the blade and the hub is modeled in frequency- and time-domain. From these models, it can be concluded that the control system can limit the y-motions at the blade root below typically accepted motion limits, when the wave direction is limited to an interval of 150-210\deg, for a sea state up to a wave height of $H_s$= 5.6 m and wave peak period $T_p$ of 10 s. However, this is only true when the predisplacement of the blade towards the crane boom is larger than the maximum crane tip displacement. <br/><br/>Based on these preliminary findings, it seems that floating installation of turbine blades could be feasible with proper tagline control. Further investigation, involving dynamic control in all degrees of freedom, is therefore recommended.","Wind Turbine Installation; compensation system; Floating installation; aNySIM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-30","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM) | Offshore and dredging engineering | Bottom Founded Structures, Arctic and Wind","",""

The introduction of Koopman operator theory helped to deal with this challenge. The Koopman operator is a composition operator that globally describes a nonlinear system in an infinite-dimensional linear framework. To implement this theory, the usual approach is to approximate the Koopman operator through data-driven methods. These algorithms use measurements of the nonlinear system to compute the approximated operator. Generally, noise can be present in real-world scenarios. Noisy measurements can have a considerable deteriorating effect on the data-driven approximation of Koopman operators. The approximation of this operator in presence of noisy training data is a necessary step for its implementation to a wider spectrum of real-world applications. Many robust numerical methods were designed to solve this issue. Koopman subspace identification (KSI) is a promising approach. As the name suggests, this algorithm employs subspace identification modeling to compute the matrix approximation of the Koopman operator. In this work, we test KSI against other state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we improve its performance in predicting the state trajectories of the nonlinear system in presence of noisy measurements. To this end, we propose a reducing-order routine that computes the most robust model against measurement noise. Furthermore, a randomized singular value decomposition is adopted to reduce computational times. The improved KSI is then compared against the other state-of-the-art algorithms in the presence of noisy data sets. We will show that the upgraded KSI outperforms most of the other techniques.","Koopman Operator; Subspace Identification; Measurement Noise; Data-Driven Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

When two droplets that are suspended in a shearing flow come in contact with each other, it is currently uncertain if the contact would result in coalescence. To be able to make such predictions, it is necessary to study the effects of the system parameters, such as the angle of collision between the droplets and the properties of the flow and the two fluids, on the process of coalescence. This necessitates the need for a robust experimental setup in which such studies can be performed. <br/><br/>The characteristic of a systematic study is repeatability and control over experimental conditions. In coalescence studies, the impact angle between the droplets is a parameter that has proved difficult to control. In this study, a microfluidic device is developed that uses the concept of surface energy wells to achieve repeatability in the impact angles of droplet collisions. Using the device, droplet coalescence experiments were performed. An interesting observation was made from the experiments which guided the further course of this research work. It was seen that the droplets did not coalesce upon approach, but coalescence was driven by the separation of the droplets. In the literature, this phenomenon is referred to as 'separation-driven coalescence'. Furthermore, it was suspected that an experimental condition could be defined based on a non-dimensional parameter, namely, the Capillary number Ca, such that for Ca &gt;<i> </i>Ca<sub>cr</sub>, separation of droplets ceases to trigger coalescence.<br/><br/>The effect of the system parameters, namely the impact angle, θ<sub>i</sub>, and the viscosity ratio, λ, over the Ca<sub>cr</sub> was investigated.

Ever-increasing technological advancements have resulted in rapid growth of IMS data set sizes, scaling quadratically with the increasingly refined spatial resolution of its ion images. Dimensionality reduction techniques aim to make large data sets practically approachable by reducing the number of dimensions in the data while retaining as much information as possible. Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction (NLDR) methods attempt to uncover an underlying nonlinear manifold or structure in the data by constructing a Low-Dimensional (LD) feature space with variables that are nonlinear combinations of the original features (i.e. mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) bins in IMS measurements). The t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) has been a common approach in NLDR methods, using force-directed graphs. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) works in a similar manner, but leans on a more versatile mathematical foundation in topology, is generally faster, and the method tends to scale better than t-SNE.<br/><br/>In this thesis, we introduce UMAPLUS, an extension of UMAP that takes not only spectral, but also spatial information into account. Our experiments show that UMAPLUS is capable of extracting the structure of a synthetic IMS data set better than UMAP. Besides UMAP’s standard spectral and random initializations, we introduce a new spatial initialization that provides more intuitive insight into the LD embedding relative to the spatial image domain. Standard UMAP entails several parameters that influence consistency, reliability, and quality of its LD embedding. Thus far, the influence of these parameters on IMS data sets has been barely investigated, and previous studies have consistently applied the default settings of UMAP. In this thesis, a Data-Driven UMAP (DD-UMAP) is constructed, which includes optimization of UMAP parameters in a data-driven manner. Several distance metrics are investigated, with cosine similarity providing the most robust results. A naive 1-D optimization procedure is compared to a multivariate Bayesian optimization approach, capable of optimizing multiple parameters simultaneously. Using an evaluation function partly based on the cost function of UMAP and the addition of spatial information, DD-UMAP is able to estimate and utilize an optimized input parameter set for UMAP in an unsupervised manner and on unlabeled IMS data sets. This is demonstrated on generated synthetic data, and two real world IMS data sets; a full mouse pup and a murine kidney.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Pancreatoduodenectomy is the cornerstone of curative treatment for patients diagnosed with pancreatic head cancer. Only 20% of the patients are candidate for surgery since many patients present with distant metastases or locally advanced tumours with vascular involvement. Whether tumours are amendable for resection is based on potential vascular involvement with the surrounding vasculature. Assessment of vascular involvement, mainly based on multi-phase computed tomography (CT) scans, requires specific expertise and can be challenging. Computer-aided detection (CAD) and autostereoscopic three-dimensional (3D) patient models might improve accuracy in predicting vascular involvement and improve overall surgical planning. This graduation project aims to assess the added value of autostereoscopic three-dimensional patient models and computer-aided detection for decision support in pancreatic cancer care.<br/><br/>Technical methods <br/>An integrated medical imaging workstation was developed based on the clinical needs of clinicians regarding key concepts of the preoperative planning of pancreatoduodenectomy. This workstation is a hardware and software combination that consists of three main components; 1) a medical imaging viewer showing CT scan with basic imaging functionalities, 2) annotations outlining the tumour and anatomical structures (to simulate segmentations generated by CAD algorithms) that are translated to 3D patient models displayed on an autostereoscopic display, and 3) CAD-derived metrics (degrees and length contact) regarding vascular involvement of the tumour. <br/><br/>Clinical methods <br/>This integrated medical imaging workstation was evaluated in a multi-centre study including 13 expert hepatopancreatobiliary surgeons and one abdominal radiologist. All participants assessed pancreatic tumours in a simulated setting under 3 different test conditions; assessment using only the regular CT scan (CT-condition), assessment using CT and 3D patient models (3D-condition), assessment using CT, 3D patient models and CAD-derived metrics regarding vascular involvement (CAD-condition). A total of 6 patient cases were evaluated, of which 3 radiologically resectable cases (simple) and 3 radiologically borderline resectable cases (complex) with pancreatic tumours near to major vessels. Perceived fulfilment of clinical needs regarding the preoperative assessment, differences in surgical planning decisions compared to baseline, and confidence in clinical decision-making were evaluated.<br/><br/>Results <br/>Clinicians experienced an improved ability to accurately detect pancreatic tumours and determine the degrees and length of tumour-vessel contact under the 3D- and CAD-condition compared to the CT-condition. Additionally, clinicians reported a higher perceived ability to identify, localize and understand anatomical relationships when supported by autostereoscopic 3D models. Lower degrees of tumour-vessel contact were reported under the CAD-condition compared to the CT-condition. Furthermore, clinicians had higher confidence in assessing the need for a vascular resection under the 3D-condition than the CT-condition.<br/><br/>Conclusion <br/>CAD and 3D might improve the accuracy of pancreatic tumour detection and reduce the overestimation of degrees of vascular involvement on radiological imaging. The risk of over-trust in CAD mandates thorough evaluation of the accuracy and use of CAD in prospective studies.","Pancreatic Carcinoma; Pancreatoduodenectomy; Integrated Medical Imaging Workstation; Autostereoscopic Three-Dimensional Patient Models; Computer-Aided Detection; Preoperative Planning; Vascular Involvement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-30","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Visser, K. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The reduction of the of harmful emissions that result fromyachting are an increasing concern and priority. It has been widely established that yachts have a significant contribution to the emission of greenhouse gasses and other emissions that are harmful to the environment and the public health. Measures must be taken that drastically reduce the environmental impact of yachts. The use of fuel cells, in combinations with alternative fuels, can provide a solution. The emission of all harmful emissions can be greatly reduced or completely eliminated. One of the major challenges in this transition is the uncertainty in the future supply of alternative fuels. Yachts are built to operate up-to 30 years, this is only possible if it is ensured of fuel supply over this time. Fuel-flexibility can provide a solution. If the operating fuel can be changed according to the availability, the yacht is guaranteed of operation in all future scenarios. This report describes research on how a fuelflexible fuel cell system can be designed that is capable op powering a super yacht. A selection of alternative fuels was made. These fuels must be suitable for marine application, they must hold environmental benefits over conventional fuels, and together they must ensure operation in all future scenarios. A number of fuels was considered. Their storage, production and feedstocks were compared. A final selection of operative fuels was made: it consists of ammonia, methanol, and bio/synthetic diesel. A fuel-flexible fuel cell system was designed based on the power demands of a yacht. The operational demands have been carefully mapped based on a yacht design of De Voogt Naval Architects. The system design is based on an SOFC with an external (pre-)reformer/cracking reactor. This reactor operates adiabatic and the required steam is supplied by water recirculation, both to increase the control over the fuel decomposition process. Waste heat is utilized in the balance of plant of the system, and can be recovered from the system in the form of a hot water flow. This heat can be consumed directly during the operation of the yacht. There are limitations in the fuel-flexibility of the system. Some of the components must be replaced when a switch between alternative fuels is made. A performance analysis is needed to find whether the fuel-flexible fuel cell system can power a yacht. A model of the system was made in which the performance of the system was simulated under the defined operational requirements. A thermodynamic analysis of the system is conducted to find the efficiencies and fuel consumption, and the heat and mass flows within the system. These parameters were used to calculate the yearly fuel consumption, emission of CO2, and required stored fuel capacity. The efficiency for the designed fuel-flexible fuel cell system is high for all of the fuels, and throughout the operation of the yacht. There is a large difference in fuel consumption and required fuel storage capacity between the alternative fuels, this is mainly caused by the energy density differences of the fuels. The emission of CO2 is depended on the fuel consumption and the carbon content of the fuels. Compared to conventional power generation and fossil fuels, the emission of CO2 is significantly reduced. There are also differences in the heat and mass flows within the system. Each fuel therefore has a different required capacity for pieces of equipment such as heat exchangers, pumps, and compressors. This research has shown how a fuel-flexible fuel cell system can be designed that is capable of powering a yacht. Through a thermodynamic model, it is shown that such a system has a high operational efficiency throughout the performance of the yacht. Harmful emissions are greatly reduced compared to conventional power generation. In a fuel-flexible system, each component must be designed for themost demanding fuel. For each fuel, some system components will therefore be over-dimensioned. A fuel-flexible system will be more complex and voluminous than a single-fuel fuel cell system. In return, the system will be operational in all future scenarios. This research has shed light on the trade-offs that the choice for a fuel-flexible fuel cell system can bring about. It provides an analysis which will only become more valuable as the yachting industry is urged to adapt to an ever-changing environment","Solid oxide fuel cell; methanol; ammonia; diesel; yacht; fuel; Flexibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","","","","Marine Technology | Marine Engineering","","51.9962559"

(mentor); Schipper, H.R. (graduation committee); van den Brom, P.I. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Especially in colder climates, like The Netherlands, a large quantity of non-renewable energy is used for space heating by burning natural gas. To meet climate goals, natural gas should be replaced with renewable sources. Reducing the total energy demand for space heating and lowering the design water temperature in a heating system enable more renewable energy production alternatives for space heating. So high temperature heating (HTH) systems need to be replaced with low temperature (LTH) alternatives to get dwellings through the energy transition.<br/><br/>Despite the indisputable advantages of LTH, it also comes with risks. One risk is that heating elements need to become exceedingly large to ensure sufficient heating capacities. Insufficient capacities may adversely affect indoor thermal comfort. To mitigate this effect, extra measures should be taken in the façade, ground floor and roof to reduce infiltration and increase insulation. In order to introduce these measures a renovation should be carried out. This study will focus on façade renovations. <br/><br/>For the assessment of comfort levels when changing to LTH, this research presents a case study into a typical Dutch terraced dwelling. This case study was carried out through simulations in TRNSYS 17. This is a validated program simulating energy flows in transient systems. Although TRNSYS 17 has built-in comfort calculation options, these were not deemed sufficiently transparent in their workings for this study. Furthermore, calculations of view-factors, mean radiant temperatures (MRT) and the predicted mean vote (PMV) showed deviations from standards NEN-EN ISO 7726 and 7730. Therefore a workaround is presented which calculates comfort levels closer in line with standards. <br/><br/>Two façade options were investigated for 1 HTH and 3 LTH systems. The HTH model was calibrated to match measured air and surface temperatures of a test dwelling. LTH was then simulated while keeping the current radiators, which showed that diminished capacities significantly reduce comfort and façade renovations cannot realistically mitigate this. This option is not possible when changing to LTH in dwellings in general. Then a system with specialized LTH radiators was investigated, with capacities determined through ISSO 51. This still showed a high peak of discomfort at current insulation levels. Comfort levels were improved significantly after a renovation to match the new ‘Target Values’ (‘Streefwaarden’) for insulation and an ‘excellent’ qualification for infiltration reduction. Finally, underfloor heating was investigated, resulting in enhanced comfort levels both with current and updated insulations levels. In all cases, a renovation has a positive effect on comfort levels and reduces heat transfers. <br","Thermal Comfort; low temperature heating; Renovation; Facade Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Miedema, S.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","To meet the targets set at the Paris climate convention, a rapid decrease in the emissions caused by the process of extraction of fossil fuels is required. Especially offshore, where a grid-connection is often non-existent, having power supplied by local renewable energy sources with a variable power generation can potentially lead to problems in the energy balance. To avoid the use of back-up diesel generators, Novgorodcev Jr. et al came up with the idea of implementing an energy storage unit based on the principles of potential energy, namely the SBGESS (Figure 1). The objective of this thesis was: To assess the dynamic behavior of the SBGESS system during installation and provide suggestions to increase workability by reducing the dynamic response. To this end, the SBGESS was preliminary dimensioned based on simulations of the energy balance and the lowering operation was modelled using these dimensions. A 10.32MWh SBGESS, with three power supply modes (including a power saving mode), is able to operate a 4.34MW water injection system with power being generated by two 12MW wind turbines. Simulations were run to assess the sensitivity of the system to the energy storage capacity and the ranges in which a certain mode was active. Based on historical wind data, this system is able to meet the empirical reliability and performance criteria for a water injection system. Using the energy storage capacity and power demand as input, the size and number of buoyancy- and gravity units were scaled to minimize overall dimensions as to reduce installation complexity. The vertical displacement of the SBGESS during the lowering phase was modelled using non-linear mass - dashpot - spring models (Figure 2). It was concluded that using polyester rope for the lowering cable leads to relatively low dynamic forces during the lowering and is able to meet the DNV criteria for an offshore operation in more sea states than other alternatives. Taking precautions such as heave compensation and a lower payout velocity are however necessary to avoid slack conditions and large dynamic forces during the beginning of the lowering operation, as this is where resonance predominantly may occur. A Sensitivity analysis showed that the hydrodynamic coefficients require extensive lab testing as their values have a large impact on the dynamic force. The added mass coefficient has a significant influence on the overall dynamic force and location of the resonance zone, while the drag coefficient mostly impacts the oscillation magnitudes in the early parts of the lowering operation.","SBGESS; Buoyancy Energy Storage; Gravity Energy Storage; Vertical displacement model; Subsea equipment; Offshore installation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The swept flat plate model is equipped with two linear manual stages to create forward and backward facing steps. Preliminary measurements characterize the pressure gradient over the swept flat plate model under study. In the preliminary study , hot-wire anemometry (HWA) measurements characterize the flow over the swept plate without steps over a large chordwise domain with and without forcing by discrete roughness elements (DREs). The DREs are spaced at a spanwise wavelength corresponding to the overall maximum N factors from LST. The mean velocity contours and N factor trends presented in these measurements reinforced the need for DREs to control flow. Spectral content is monitored and the frequency bands associated with probe vibration and travelling crossflow interaction were delineated. Infrared thermography was employed to observe the movement of transition front with varying step heights and initial crossflow amplitudes. When the DRE height increases, the transition front moves upstream consistently for all step heights. Furthermore, when the DRE height is kept a constant , but the array is moved upstream and downstream of the neutral point, the transition front moves upstream for all step heights. In order to observe the flow in the vicinity of the step, HWA was once again used to quantify the interaction of crossflow with FFS. The clean, short FFS and supercritical step height configurations identified from the IR study, are studied for two initial amplitudes. For the supercritical step configuration, bandpass filtered fluctuations are found to align with a high wall normal and spanwise shear region which has been identified in previous work. It is postulated to be associated with a vortex shedding mechanism, for which frequency bands are delineated. Estimates of the range of recirculation bubble length were made and a flapping frequency range was also demarcated. In this study, a vortex shedding scenario is used to explain the presence of these near wall fluctuations.

As the number distribution of posits is similar to the data distributions in deep neural networks (DNNs), posits offer a good alternative to fixed point numbers in DNNs: using posits can result in high inference accuracy while using low precision numbers. The number accuracy is most important for the first and last network layers to achieve good performance. For this reason, these are often computed using larger precision fixed point numbers compared to the hidden network layers. Instead, these can be computed using low precision posit, to reduce the memory access energy consumption and the required memory bandwidth. The hidden layer computation can still be performed using cheaper fixed point numbers.<br/>An inference accuracy analysis is performed to quantify what the effect of this approach is on the VGG16 network for the ImageNet image classification task. Using 8 bit posit for the first and last network layer instead of 16 bit fixed point is shown to result in a top-5 accuracy degradation of only 0.24%. The hidden layers are computed using 8 bit fixed point in both cases. <br/>The design of a parameterized systolic array accelerator performing exact accumulation is proposed that can be used in a scale-out system along with fixed point systolic array tiles. To increase hardware utilization, a hybrid posit decoder is designed to enable fixed point computation on the posit hardware. Using this hardware, the entire network can be computed using 8 bit data, instead of using 16 bits for some layers.

(mentor); Cucurachi, S. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2021","In recent years, an increasing amount of plastic packaging waste has drawn attention from consumers, media and policymakers alike. To tackle this, the concept of a circular economy (CE) is well established in Europe through the implementation of the European Strategy for Plastics in the Circular Economy. The strategy places an importance on improving recycling to increase the amount of high value materials in circular loops. An innovation intended to achieve this is chemical recycling, which provides an alternative to the current mechanical recycling system. Improvements in recycling are also being met with innovations in the sorting of the plastic packaging waste to improve overall recyclability. One such packaging waste that can benefit from these innovations is composite plastic aluminium packaging. The example taken in this report is that of single-use coffee capsules. These are incinerated due to their poor recyclability in current mechanical recycling systems, leading to a loss of materials, counteractive to the CE approach. This review outlines the end-of-life of such packaging and explores chemical recycling and sorting technologies that can help to realise a CE for the waste. The work also includes a qualitative exploration of the overall packaging waste system to analyse barriers towards a CE and propose interventions for the CE transition. The work gathers information on different chemical recycling and sorting technologies through semi-structured interviews with practitioners and a review of scientific publications. In line with CE strategies, solvent dissolution is chosen as a potential chemical recycling technology for the coffee capsules. Subsequently, the collection and sorting of the capsules is outlined through flow diagrams, and a sorting protocol is drawn up for isolating a feedstock of the capsules for recycling with solvent dissolution. Two promising sorting technologies are highlighted here: NIR scanners with deep learning and packaging markers. The overall packaging waste system of the coffee capsules is then explored in three main steps; (1) a mapping of stakeholders and flows of materials, money and influence, (2) semi-structured stakeholder interviews and (3) mapping of CE barriers along four key pillars: technological, regulatory, market and cultural. The results of the system study reveal a variety of interconnected barriers across different system levels. While key technological barriers exist in the form of limited industrial demonstration, several other barriers were found more insightful. These include a regulatory focus on material circularity, limited stakeholder awareness for the environmental impacts of different CE strategies, a lack of design guidelines for composite packaging waste, limited funding for industrial experimentation and a lack of consumer awareness of packaging sustainability and preference for convenience. Following these findings, four system interventions are proposed to overcome the mentioned barriers and facilitate recycling of the coffee capsule. Overall, it is seen that any intervention requires significant further work and an understanding of the root causes, as the identified barriers are interconnected, and one may cause a chain reaction to others. The interventions proposed here should be taken as a guiding point of departure, and further work is needed to validate the interventions and their potential impact for change.","circular economy; packaging; consumer goods","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These vessels are less susceptive to disturbances caused by sea waves when they lift their hull from the water level by jacking down multiple legs to the seabed. An alternative is a crane mounted on a floating vessel, which has the benefits of being faster regarding sailing time, cheaper in operation, able to locate multiple times around the same offshore site and able to operate in deep waters. However floating crane vessels have a significant lower workability in comparison to jack-up vessels and are therefore not deployed in OWT activities yet. <br/>Huisman initiated the three-dimensional (3D) motion compensated crane (MCC) project to improve the workability of crane vessels in offshore operations - thereby focusing on the performance of the equipped cranes - such that floating crane vessels will be able to install and service OWTs during an sufficiently large operational window. But to date MCCs have never been realized for offshore wind industry, which makes it difficult to estimate their performance beforehand and evaluate whether they are feasibile. <br/>This thesis describes the development of a procedure to assess the feasibility of motion systems from a mechatronic design perspective and the motion compensation system of the Huisman 3D MCC is used as a case study. Several aspects of the MCC have been studied into more detail because these aspects are an determining factor regarding feasibility. These aspects are the influence of actuator type and crane boom flexibility and the performance during realistic offshore conditions. To investigate these aspects the system dynamics of the conceptual design are modelled, a controller is designed for the model and parameters are identified. Next the model is evaluated on its disturbance rejection capability because this is an important performance indicator for motion compensation, its robustness is examined and whether the OWT installation requirements are fulfilled.","feasibility; assessment; motion; compensation; offshore; crane; vessels; wind; turbine; installation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-30","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

Before we can remove the human completely, a better understanding of this unique characteristic is necessary so that we can apply it to automation itself. Currently, however, research opportunities are limited mainly due to a lack of techniques that can recognize such control adjustments within short periods of time. One well known form of adaptation is characterized by changes in control behavior in response to three types of displays used in manual control tasks: compensatory, pursuit and preview. This research aims to use time series classification to recognize such changes using samples of 1.5 s of tracking data from experiments with double integrator controlled element dynamics. InceptionTime, a convolutional neural network, is optimized for the task, resulting in an average attained accuracy of 95.4%. It was found that the best configuration is a basic three-class classifier that uses the e, u, x signals and their first-order derivatives as input features. Additionally, results show performance highly depends on what data sets are used for training and testing, with accuracies ranging from 60% to 99% for different train-test allocations. Most errors occur in separating the pursuit and preview strategies, where it was expected to be between compensatory and pursuit.

As a solution to the concerns regarding the environmental and health impact due to increasing demand of air travel. The DUUC has a characteristic feature which consist of two ducted propellers at the empennage of the aircraft with vertical and horizontal vanes mounted downstream of the duct, spanning the whole diameter. With this newly integrated architecture the DUUC combines thrust with stability and control of the aircraft. Furthermore, with the current trend of increasingly larger bypass ratios on turbofan engines, these will at a certain point not fit below the wings anymore. Therefore, further highlighting the importance of this research than the study on the DUUC alone. From previous research on the DUUC, where the propulsive stabilizer was in a fixed, aft-fuselage position with a fixed duct aspect ratio. It has been observed that the rear center of gravity (CG) position and a large shift in CG due to the propulsive stabilizer, poses a number of challenges. Therefore, research has to be done on the positioning of the propulsive stabilizer. The objective of this research is to study the positioning of the ducted fan propulsive stabilizer, considering its impact on stability and control by development of a method to predict aerodynamic/stability &amp; control derivatives for variable position and duct/fan size. In this study, the aerodynamic analysis tool FlightStream is used to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of the ducted propeller.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In this thesis report, a new radial basis function (RBF) interpolation mesh deformation method is investigated that is applicable on periodic domains that contain small clearance gaps. In the field of fluid structure interaction, there is a strong interaction between a structure and the fluid in which this structure is immersed. When performing simulations of this interaction, the fluid mesh has to adapt to the changing domain which occurs due to the structure deforming. The adaption of the fluid mesh can be done with an RBF interpolation method. Although this is considered to be one of the most robust methods available, there are specific cases in which the method can still yield some poor quality deformed meshes. This is for example the case when small clearance gaps are present such as the region between a blade and the shroud in turbomachinery. Then it becomes beneficial to allow boundary nodes to slide to improve the mesh quality.<br/>In turbomachinery, periodic domains are also often encountered, for example in a gas turbine. Here, the same blade is constantly repeated, allowing to use one single blade in computations which will have a domain with periodic boundaries. In general, the larger the number of blades, the smaller the distance between the blade and the periodic mesh boundary will be. Hence, also here small clearance gaps are present. As the blade might undergo a large deformation, it is possible for the blade to even intersect the mesh boundary if this boundary is kept fixed, which would lead to a degenerate mesh.<br/>The aim of this thesis is to avoid this scenario by making adaptions to the RBF interpolation method that allow the periodic boundaries of the mesh to be displaced with the deforming blade. Evidently, this has to be done in a periodic manner, keeping both periodic boundaries equal. This will yield a higher mesh quality of the deformed mesh as it will reduce the skewness and avoid the occurrence of degenerate cells. Two different methods for periodic boundary displacement are investigated in this report. Both methods work for both translational and rotational periodic boundaries and several two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) meshes are used as test cases.<br/>The first method is the periodic distance method which is based on making the distance between the boundary nodes periodic. This method is very similar to the regular RBF method and only requires a regular Euclidean distance function to be replaced by a periodic distance function. This means that the computational cost is also similar to an interpolation matrix of size N<sub>m</sub> x N<sub>m</sub>. This method shows good results for both 2D and 3D meshes and both types of periodic boundaries. Apart from giving the periodic boundaries an identical displacement, it also allows for a smooth transition from one mesh to another.<br/>The second method is based on equal displacement. Hence, the RBF interpolation matrix is adapted to include conditions imposing equal displacement of the periodic boundary nodes. These extra conditions yield a larger interpolation matrix of size N<sub>m</sub>+N<sub>p</sub> x N<sub>m</sub>+N<sub>p</sub>. This means the computational cost for this method is higher than for the periodic distance or the regular RBF method. This method also shows good results in terms of deformed mesh quality but does not feature the same smoothness over the interface between two meshes and creates small kinks at the interface.<br/>Even though RBF interpolation can be relatively low in computational cost compared to other mesh deformation methods that require mesh connectivity information, it still becomes computationally expensive for large 3D problems with a high number of nodes. Therefore, a greedy algorithm is also used for larger problems which allows for a reduced amount of nodes selected to perform the interpolation.<br/>In conclusion, the periodic displacement method used with RBF interpolation shows great potential for different types of problem sizes and periodic boundaries and can potentially make the simulation process of periodic problems much more efficient.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Kenter, Rob (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Throughout history, complex societal problems have plagued societies with their ever-changing dynamic natures and sheer societal consequences. In efforts to address such complex problems, many actors have turned to participatory methods as a means to incorporate community level knowledge and produce community-oriented solutions while addressing societal concerns. Simultaneously, in the field of serious game design, a large body of research has studied the positive effects of using serious game play for societal intervention. However, fewer efforts have been allocated to exploring the effectiveness of participatory serious game design as a means for societal intervention. In other words, can participatory serious game design act as an effective method for societal intervention?<br/><br/>Such inquiry is the basis of this research, where the complex societal problem of biased US policing serves as the application of this study. A mixed methods approach to this research was implemented to explore how to develop interventions where serious game design concepts are to be created between US communities and police. Through a mixed methods approach involving quantitative elements of inferential and descriptive statistical analysis and qualitative elements of content analysis, sentiment analysis, and micro-interlocutor analysis, group brainstorming data, workshop observation data, and semi-structured group interview data was explored in an effort to understand if and how participatory serious game design can be leveraged effectively as a means to societal intervention in the context of US policing and beyond.<br/><br/>The outcomes of this research are two-fold. First, with regard to improving police-community relations through societal intervention, results from this research indicate that current relations between US police and BIPOC communities, specifically black communities, are in a dire state of mistrust. As such, any attempt at intervention between these two groups will likely be received with caution and scepticism. However, in demonstrating that intervention efforts are long-term oriented and not just “throw away” events, more willing engagement could be facilitated. In addition, this research has also demonstrated that police accountability in intervention efforts can exhibit to communities that such efforts to improve police-community relations are serious. In maintaining police accountability throughout interventions, communities may be more willing to welcome police efforts in engagement and relation building.<br/><br/>Second, in considering participatory game design as an intervention study, results from this study indicate that participatory game design has the potential to be an effective intervention method if it is implemented in a way that appropriately caters to the desired audience. In using participatory game design as a means to societal intervention, participant “buy-in” must be facilitated early on to ensure effective engagement. This study also alludes to the fact that participatory game design could be particularly effective as an intervention method when the topic of intervention is taboo, discomforting, or difficult to talk about, as the game-like nature of such intervention can provide an adequate amount of abstraction from reality that helps facilitate less anxiety-inducing dialogue. In a similar vein, the reality-abstracted game-like nature of participatory game design interventions could also be effective at fostering safe and inclusive spaces where all participants can feel able to engage and contribute to discussion, regardless of their backgrounds. Finally, with regard to using participatory game design as an intervention study, this research has exhibited that in ensuring a diversity of participant backgrounds and perspectives, echo chambers, polarity, and groupthink can be avoided in participatory game design-based interventions. Similarly, more meaningful intervention outcomes and creative problem solving has the potential to arise if a healthy amount of group conflict and pressure is managed appropriately within participatory game design interventions.<br/><br/>To the best of our knowledge, this research represents the first mixed methods study aimed at investigating the effectiveness of participative serious game design as a societal intervention method for biased US policing. Therefore, this study provides several potential scientific contributions to the fields of intervention science and serious game design, and it also has several potential implications in the context of society and public policy.","societal intervention; serious game design; participatory systems; community-oriented policing; police bias","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

The motion controller of the industrial robot should be able to change the end-effector position within a frequency of 50 Hz. Frequencies above 333 Hz result in the most accurate simulations. The upper range of inertia that can be simulated is restricted by the maximum joint torques the robot can apply.

By combining these devices with integrated analytical components, an in vitro system is created that can real-time monitor the cellular activity and better predict the effects of drugs in vivo. Coupling multiple OoC devices together with microfluidic channels can even provide insights into the complex interactions between multiple organs.

It was found that this gut-brain-axis plays an important role in the development of various gastrointestinal and neurological diseases. Investigating the interaction between these two organs could provide valuable information about the functioning of the gut-brain axis.

The majority of gas and energy exchanges occurring at the ocean-atmosphere interface are driven by small-scale, O(1 km), coupled processes. Despite its importance, too few observations have been able to capture the ocean-atmosphere coupling at scales smaller than O(10 km). This has led to poor parameterisation in climate models. In an effort to enhance our understanding of the ocean-atmosphere coupling, this study aims to test and improve upon two separate Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL) characterisation methodologies (called algorithm 2A and algorithm 2B) put forward by Young et al., (2000). Algorithms 2A and 2B relate processed Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image properties to a specific atmospheric state through use of surface-layer similarity theory and a combination of surface-layer and mixed-layer similarity theory respectively. Results of both methods indicate significant inherent limitations. Algorithm 2A's utility is curbed by uncertainty introduced during the estimation of Convective Boundary Layer depth Zi and spectral power-law extrapolation. Algorithm 2B suffers from uncertainty introduced by the dimensionless energy dissipation rate psi. As a result of these (and other) uncertainties, the estimated atmospheric instability can be off by a factor 2 or more. Further analyses suggest shortcomings in the applicability of the Geophysical Model Function (GMF). It is hypothesised that both employed GMFs underestimate the horizontal wind-field variance at scales relevant to turbulent convection, which subsequently manifests itself as (part of) the observed average 50% overestimation of absolute Obukhov length and subsequent 33% underestimation of the atmospheric instability. Additional research is required to support and quantify the GMF-induced underestimation hypothesis. Inspired by algorithm 2B, a third method (algorithm 2C) is developed which circumvents major uncertainties inherent to both algorithm 2A and 2B. However, due to limitations of its own, algorithm 2C is incapable of replacing algorithms 2A or 2B for a large range of atmospheric instabilities. If improved upon and successfully employed, spaceborne characterisation of the MABL could benefit climate studies by providing a wealth of continuous and global atmospheric-state measurements on scales previously unavailable.","Characterising; MABL; SAR; Atmosphere; Ocean; Coupling; Similarity theory; Spaceborne SAR; Atmospheric properties","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/owenod1/MSc_thesis python code","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

The current standard procedure to restore continuity defects of the mandible involves free tissue transfer with an autologous bone flap. Even though the success rates are high, several critical drawbacks have been associated with this procedure, including severe donor site morbidity, long hospital stay and re­covery process, need for high surgical expertise, insufficient bone graft height, and mechanical failure of the plating system. A systematic approach for the designing and testing of patient­-specific implants used as an alternative to the free flap procedure appears to be still lacking. The goal of this thesis project was to develop a semi­automatic workflow for designing patient­ specific mandibular reconstruction implants and assess the effect of topology optimization on the biome­chanical performance of the implant using the finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental validation. Using the proposed workflow, a fully porous implant (lattice implant) and a topology optimized implant (TO implant) were designed according to the anatomy of a synthetic mandible analog subjected to lateral resection, and were additively manufactured using selective laser melting. Both implants were designed in the shape of a cage to allow for the insertion of a bone graft and the integration of dental implants. The mechanical performance of the reconstructed mandibles was predicted with computa­tional FEA and evaluated through quasi­-static and cyclic experimental testing. Digital image correlation was used to validate the finite element model through principal strain field comparison. An excellent fit between the implants and mandibles was established, indicating the capability of the workflow to develop customized implants with accurate dimensions. The results obtained with FEA were in agreement with the DIC measurements and quasi-­static testing results. No significant differences (P &lt; 0.01) in mean stiffness, mean ultimate load, and mean ultimate displacement were found between the non-­implanted control mandibles, lattice­-implanted mandibles, and TO-­implanted mandibles during quasi-­static testing. No implant failure was observed during static nor cyclic testing at loads substantially higher than the average maximum biting force of healthy individuals, indicating the high resistance of the implant designs to mechanical failure. Yet, the lattice implant would likely be preferred over the TO implant for clinical application due to its lower weight (16.5%), higher porosity (17.4%), and shorter workflow time (633.3%). The workflow proposed in this study may offer surgeons and medical engineers the tools to sys­tematically design and evaluate patient­-specific reconstruction implants. This would result in more cost­-effective and time­-effective pre-­surgical planning and result in implant designs that can minimize morbidity and maximize aesthetic and functional outcomes.","Mandibular reconstruction; Implant; Patient-specific; Topology optimization; Finite Element Analysis; Additive manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-09-29","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Each technique has its own pros and cons. The main limitation of the empirical formulas is that often they have to be applied outside their range of validity. Physical modelling also has its own shortcomings. When breaking waves hit the structure, the location of the maximum pressures is still not well known due to the high spatial variability. By using an array with low spatial resolution, the forces estimated in the physical ume will usually underestimate to some extent the actual forces experienced by the wall (Ramachandran et al., 2013). In the last decades, numerical modelling has become an attractive alternative in simulating wave-structure interactions. Nevertheless, estimating loads on crest walls in the numerical ume is still at its early stages. On that account, the present work validates the prediction of wave induced forces on the front face of crest walls on top of rubble mound breakwaters in CoastalFOAM. A scale model of the Holyhead breakwater, located in Wales, is used. The key validation topics are the reproduction of wave-structure interaction when heavily breaking waves reached the wall, the evaluation of the ventilated boundary condition implemented by Jacobsen et al. (2018), the porous ow inside the armour layer formed by Tetrapods units and whether the simplication of not using a turbulence model, as done by Jensen et al. (2014) and Jacobsen et al. (2018), is also valid under heavily breaking waves. Four validation cases were used to test the capabilities of the numerical ume. The results conrm that it is possible to accurately reproduce the wave conditions and the wave induced forces from a physical modelling campaign. Overall, the CoastalFOAM model is able to capture the shape and the order of magnitude of the force events. A calibrated model predicts the highest wave induced forces (forces with an exceedance probability of 0.4% and 0.1%) with errors lower than 20%. Moreover, the results indicate that for practical applications it is not essential to include a turbulence model in the numerical ume to obtain reliable forces on the front face of crest walls for dierent wave conditions. Another outcome of this study is that the implementation of the ventilated boundary condition is required in the interface between water surface and structural elements to mimic accordingly the air-water mixture when the structure is subjected to a heavy wave attack. Nonetheless, there is still room for improvement in this area, where a better understanding of this boundary condition and of the air entrapment during wave-structure interaction needs further research. Despite the large computational time required by the numerical ume when large wave trains must be simulated, a CFD model during design stages of breakwaters and crest walls provides higher spatial and temporal resolution of the wave induced pressures exerted on the wall than a physical test. Therefore, a better picture of the forces and pressure distribution in the front face can be obtained.","OpenFOAM; waves2FOAM; Rubble mound breakwater; crown wall loading; Tetrapods; Breaking wave impact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

This work demonstrates the utility of pseudo forces generated by a wearable tactile interface for providing non-intrusive movement guidance. First, we developed hardware to generate pseudo forces using asymmetric vibrations, whose frequency and amplitude can be tuned to vary the acceleration of the pseudo forces. Maximum acceleration of 160 m/sec^2 is obtained at a frequency of 40Hz and amplitude of 1. Second, the utility of the generated pseudo forces to provide movement guidance was explored by involving 19 participants in 4 separate experiments: 1) Symmetric and asymmetric vibration comparison, 2) Duration modulation, 3) Amplitude modulation, 4) Frequency Modulation of asymmetric vibration. For every experiment, the elements of movement guidance: direction and joint angular velocity were investigated. Participants perceive directional cues with 96% accuracy (P&lt;0.001), and translate the perceived pseudo forces into directed arm movements, with a uniform joint angular velocity of 14+/-8 degrees/second for the duration of the provided pseudo force. The joint angular velocity of the arm movement changes until 12 degrees/second with frequency. With these findings, we anticipate pseudo forces to be the foundation for remote guidance of human body movements in fields like rehabilitation and sports.","Movement guidance; Pseudo forces; Asymmetric vibrations; directional cues; joint angular velocity of movement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

The analysis of wind power ramp events from the perspective of grid operators or energy traders is prevalent in the literature. Nonetheless, this area of research is still evolving. The criterion of a minimum of turbines and its effect on the detection of ramp events, thresholds, or smoothing of power differences have not been considered so far. Moreover, little research has been conducted on analyzing the impact of ramp events on ultimate wind turbine loads. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the results have not yet been validated with measurements. Therefore, the primary objective of this report is to investigate the impact of wind-induced ramp events on offshore wind farm power and ultimate wind turbine loads by using offshore measurements.<br/><br/>At first, a wind power ramp detection algorithm is developed by considering the suitable power normalization technique and the criterion of a minimum number of turbines. The detected ramp events followed a decreasing trend in a number of events with the increasing wind speed, turbulence intensity, ramp duration, and wind direction changes. This can be because of the strong dependence of the number of ramp events on the non-linearity of the power curve. However, the available measurement data sets were found to be insufficient to capture the correlation and travel time of ramp events within two wind farms. Therefore, detailed meteorological information with the high spatial and temporal resolution is necessary for thorough analysis. <br/><br/>Following that, extreme wind speed fluctuations (ramp-like events) were found to be extreme load drivers for wind speed bins that fall under the inactive pitch or above rated wind speed region. The measured loads are further compared with the simulation results, which are obtained by following the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) guidelines of extreme turbulence load cases. In general, the measured loads associated with the extreme fluctuations did not outperform the simulations, except for the tower side-side moments. Besides, extreme loads around rated wind speed exceed the simulations, but the values are not related to the extreme fluctuations. Therefore, this study examined the high-frequency time series for the most interesting blade root flap-wise moments. Based on the investigation, extreme loads over the wind speed range, except near rated wind speed, were governed by extreme turbulence or ramp events involving a sudden pitch transition from the inactive to the active region. The extreme loads around rated wind speed, which exceeded the simulations, were associated with the standard deviations equivalent to the normal turbulence but with comparatively higher fluctuation frequency. In conclusion, for the ultimate load analysis, the wind speed time series should include a sudden transition of a pitch angle from the inactive to the active region.<br","Design load case 1.3; IEC Extreme turbulence model; Smoothing effect of power differences; wind power ramps; wind speed ramps","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

In this contribution, an exploratory simulation study was used to put into perspective the derived conceptual frameworks and assess their performance in terms of efficiency and safety.

Which method will perform better is often not known in advance. It has been shown that adding the encoding during the search can be beneficial. This thesis extends those methods by incrementally constructing the encoding during the search. This work proposes several methods that only encode the active parts of the constraint. In contrast to previous work the full encoding of the constraint is not determined beforehand but instead is determined during the search. The results show that during the search the same subset of variables is active and therefore not all variables are needed for the encoding. Furthermore, this work shows that the order of the literals in the encoding has effect on the performance. However, this mostly affects the first part of the solve process, and therefore the effect on optimization problems is limited. Finally, it shows that an incremental encoding can lead to a smaller encoding while having similar results as adding the full encoding during the search.","SAT; SAT solver; pseudo-boolean constraint; cardinality constraint","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The cross-organisational trust achieved in these platforms has driven the digitisation the documents from which import declaration data is extracted and shared with European customs. The latter see combining data from multiple platforms an opportunity to automate the cross-validation of declaration data, which is still performed manually to a large extent. This would improve supply chain visibility, turn declarations more agile and risk assessments more effective. However, it remains unclear how to integrate declaration procedures in these data ecosystems. There are two major barriers to overcome. Firstly, the lack of interoperability solutions to make data exchanges with multiple platforms compatible for the aggregation of declaration data. Secondly, the need to adapt available identity management solutions to the distributed architecture of these platforms to promote trust between declarants and their partners. To tackle this, a peer-to-peer data collection architecture is presented as a novel solution to migrate from import declarations based on data duplication towards information sharing based on links to the original and trusted shipping data stored in BCT platforms.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

The water lubricated oil core with a core-annular flow configuration is a viable option for the transport of high viscosity oil. It was observed that there are significant differences between the predictions from the RANS simulations and the experimental data for turbulent oil-water core-annular flow obtained in the flow loop in the lab at TU Delft. Thus, this study is performed to understand the difference between the RANS simulations and the experimental data. 1D and 2D OpenFOAM simulations for turbulent vertical core-annular flow are performed using the Launder-Sharma low-Re k-ε turbulence model. The pressure drop and the oil holdup are imposed while the total flow rate and the water-cut is obtained as the output from the simulations. The results from the OpenFOAM simulations are compared with the DNS data available in literature to understand the impact of the turbulence characteristics and the interfacial waves. Both 1D and 2D simulations were carried out. The 1D model does not include the interface waves. The 2D axisymmetric model is able to capture the travelling interface waves. The 1D OpenFOAM simulations are carried out for five cases with different oil holdups and the results are compared with the asymptotic wall laws. It is concluded that the turbulence is sufficiently resolved by the 1D simulations. The 2D simulations are also performed for five different oil holdups. The 2D simulations are first validated by performing grid independence tests. The dependence of the simulation results on the streamwise domain length, presence of gravity and oil viscosity is also analysed. It was found that the streamwise domain length and the oil viscosity used does not have a significant influence on the prediction of the results. The comparison of the RANS simulations with the DNS data shows that the difference depends on the turbulence levels inside the simulation domain. The difference for the total flow rate between the 2D OpenFOAMsimulations and the DNS data is found to be 10% for fully turbulent core-annular flow while the difference increases to 29% for core-annular flow with no turbulence. The friction factor for the 2D Open- FOAM simulations is found to be about 17% lower for fully turbulent flow while it is 39% lower than the DNS predictions for the simulation with no turbulence. The difference for the holdup ratio (when comparing 2D OpenFOAM simulations with respect to DNS) decreases first from 15% higher for the low oil holdup cases to 8% higher for simulation with oil holdup fraction 0.71 and then increases to 14% higher for the highest oil holdup case. It is also observed from the comparison of the mean streamwise velocities and the mean shear stresses that the turbulence level in the simulation domain impact the extent of the difference. The agreement in the wave characteristics between the 2D OpenFOAM simulations and the DNS data depends on the mixture of wavelengths present in the simulation domain. The RANS simulations predict a specific dominant wavelength while the DNS data gives a mixture of wavelengths for lower oil holdups. The dominance of a specific wavelength increases with increasing oil holdup for the DNS predictions.","Core-annular flow; Turbulence; RANS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy, Flow and Process Technology","",""

It shows exceptional properties in electrical, optical, thermal, mechanical and chemical fields. And due to its excellent properties, it is being researched to be used in many applications such as, sensors, graphene transistors, opto-electronics, etc. To realize these applications in an industrial scale, reliable methods to grow and transfer graphene need to be developed. Methods such as chemical and mechanical exfoliation, chemical vapour deposition (CVD), etc. are a few methods which are used to synthesize graphene. And wet transfer, electrochemical delamination, etc, are a few methods to transfer graphene on to the required substrate. Graphene is sensitive to chemicals and processing steps, hence the properties/behaviour of graphene varies based on the fabrication and transfer technique used. Applied Nano-Layer(ANL) is a company based in Delft, that fabricates and transfers wafer-scale mono-layer graphene. Asmentioned before, the properties/behaviour of graphene changes based on the fabrication and transfer technique used. Therefore, in this thesis, the properties/behaviour of monolayer graphene provided by ANL, is analyzed. In this thesis, electrical properties like channel resistance, resistivity and mobility were analyzed. Also, the optical behaviour of graphene where pauli-blocking stops the absorption of light at dirac point, is analyzed. Few questions related to design of the process flow, working of the fabricated devices, propagation of light in the waveguides, modulation of light and effect of process flow on graphene, were answered to properly analyze the above stated properties/behaviour of graphene. First, a wafer-scale silicon waveguide was designed using COMSOL and BeamLab. The derived width of the waveguide was found to be for the values of 1 um to 4 um and the optimal cladding thickness was found to be 20 nm. Then, the designed waveguide structures were translated onto a mask that would be used in the fabrication of the electro-absorption modulators. Second, a cleanroom compatible process flow for the fabrication of Hall bars and electro-absorption optical modulators was designed and optimized. Several testing steps were performed to find the optimal parameters required in the process flow. Third, the hall bars and the optical modulators were fabricated in the clean room , Else-Kooi Lab(EKL), using the designed masks and process flows. The electrical properties were analyzed by extensively measuring the hall bars. As an example, the average channel resistance, dirac voltage, average resistivity and average mobility of a graphene hall bar with dimensions 2 um x 2 um was measured/calculated to be 6.74 k­, 75.9 V, 1.7 k­ and 1573.28 cm2/Vs respectively. Similarly, the values for 11 other dimensional devices were measured/calculated. The optical behaviour was analyzed by testing the electro-absorption optical modulator. A few waveguides were tested for propagation of light and a power of 0.8 uW wasmeasured for an input power of 0.6mW, which suggests that light successfully propagates though the waveguides. Graphene modulation was tested using back gate biasing and an average dirac voltage of 73.33 V was observed for 2 um x 2 um hall bar device on the optical modulator die. These two when done simultaneously theoretically should modulate light. Lastly, the impact of process flow on graphene/ graphene devices was checked. And a drastric fall to 30% working devices(for optical modulators) from 60% working devices (for hall bars) with increase in process flow steps concludes that the number of processing steps does affect the graphene/ graphene devices.","Graphene; Graphene Properties; Hall Bars; Optical Modulators; Silicon Waveguides","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

Unfortunately, the scarcity of liver donors leads to waitlist mortality, pushing the need for alternative treatment options. In vitro models are essential tools in research on alternatives for transplantation. One of the promising models is the hepatobiliary organoid model because these three-dimensional cultures model (elements of) the native tissue structure and function. However, a limitation of these models is that they currently resemble only one liver cell type. The aim of this research was therefore to combine different cell types, i.e., biliary organoids and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), in one culture model.<br/><br/>The organoids were obtained from liver-biopsy-derived intrahepatic biliary epithelium and are therefore named intrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids (ICOs). The liver-specific MSCs (L-MSCs) were isolated from perfusion fluid of donor livers collected at liver transplantation procedures. Decellularized liver tissue was used to include extracellular matrix (ECM) in the co-culture models. To assess the most optimal culture conditions, three experimental setups were tested. In the first setup, ICOs were cultured in different concentrations of L-MSC derived conditioned medium (CM) in commercially available basement membrane extract (BME) (1A). This setup was also used to differentiated the ICOs towards hepatocytes (1B). In the second setup, various concentrations of ICOs and L-MSCs were cultured in an indirect (2A) and direct (2B) BME model. The third setup included liver-derived ECM to replace the BME. Cells were cultured similar to model 2B (3A) and ICOs were added after a pre-culture of L-MSCs (3B). The morphology of both cell types, the visible interaction between cell types, and the expression of hepatocyte, cholangiocyte, MSC and proliferation markers were analyzed.<br/><br/>The effect of L-MSCs and L-MSC-derived CM on ICO formation, morphology, and growth patterns, was small. Direct cell-cell contact was rare in the BME co-cultures, but instances of close contact between two cell types were observed in both the indirect (2A) and direct (2B) setups. In the ECM models (3A-B), ICO cells formed polarized monolayers that pushed the L-MSCs aside, indicating that the cell types did not mix well. ICOs expressed the cholangiocyte markers cytokeratin (CK) 7 and 19 in both mono- and co-cultures, whereas L-MSCs were most likely CK7 and CK19 negative. Variation in gene expression levels of hepatocyte, cholangiocyte, MSC, and proliferation markers was observed, but no statistically significant differences were found between conditions. Nevertheless, the down-regulatory effect of CM on the expression of hepatocyte markers in differentiated ICOs showed a consistent trend. Additionally, the presence of L-MSCs resulted in a higher mean expression of MSC markers CD90, CD105 and Vimentin, and proliferation marker KI-67.<br/><br/>Although no clear effects of L-MSCs on ICO growth were observed in this study, the created co-culture models form a promising base for future research. The models include adult human liver-derived components and are therefore a step towards the reconstruction of the hepatic microenvironment. In addition, if other (liver-derived) cell types were to be introduced to the co-culture models, L-MSCs have the potential to enhance the cell function of these new cells. Last, the models can be used as a base for future ICO co-culture studies, since the L-MSCs can be replaced by other cell types.","Organoid; Liver; Mesenchymal stem cells; Co-culture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-07","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The main motivator for this thesis is the flow of blood in aneurysms. An aneurysm is a sudden expansion of an artery, with large expansion angles causing an adverse pressure gradient and leading to flow separation. Several studies have shown the transitional nature of the flow in aneurysms, and it has been seen that the variation of the wall shear stress from cycle-to-cycle is one of the major reasons for the growth of aneurysms, and possibly leading to their rupture at a later stage. It has also been noticed that the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) does not decay with the mean flow kinetic energy and the periodic kinetic energy of the cardiac cycle. Therefore, it is intersting to research the turbulent decay to see how the flow in an aneurysm can be affected. However, the number of variables in an aneurysm are too high to effectively characterize this, and therefore, a simplified geometry was chosen. Pipe flow is a good choice to start with, as it can mimic the wall-bounded nature of an aneurysm. It also has a well-defined statistically steady turbulent state from where the decay of turbulence can be studied. Additionally, blood being a non-Newtonian fluid, makes it interesting to study the effects of shear-thinning. <br/><br/>To this extent, a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) study has been carried out using a higher-order spectral element method code. First, statistics for fully-developed pipe flow are compared with existing results. To a fully-developed turbulent state, a deceleration is applied to bring the flow to a steady, laminar state. The decay of the turbulent quantities is monitored during this process. Comparison studies are undertaken to study the influence of the ramp rate, the dependence of the decay on the initial Reynolds number, and the variation of the results between Newtonian and generalized Newtonian fluids. A modelling approach using RANS has also been undertaken to see if only studying the mean flow is sufficient to characterize the decay. <br/><br/>It is seen that two regimes of decay exist -- a power-law decay based on turbulent scaling, and an exponential viscous decay. The power-law decay is further divided into two stages -- one before the saturation of the integral length scale, and one after the saturation of the length scale -- with the maximum length scale being set by the diameter of the pipe. The exponential model has been validated using the hypothesis of Skrbek (2008). The point of divergence from the power-law to the exponential decay has been hypothesized here. It is seen that for all the cases studied, the point of divergence occurred at $Re_\tau = 60$. It is noticed that the decay is independent of the ramp rates when they are applied at time on the order of magnitude of 1 Eddy Turnover Time (ETT). The decay does show a dependence on the initial Reynolds number and the reasons for this are hypothesized. The RANS modelling used was found to be insufficient due to the inability of the RANS model to gauge the size of the domain. For generalized Newtonian fluids, it is noticed that the decay rate increases with shear-thinning. The results obtained are discussed in the context of an aneurysm. Based on the diameter, length and flow rate of the aneurysm, it can be hypothesized at which stage of decay the flow is, and based on this, it has been discussed whether using a non-Newtonian modelling approach is more beneficial than using a Newtonian approach for the decay.","DNS; Turbulent Decay; Pipe Flow; Shear-Thinning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

Decreasing number of festivals poses threats to cultural and economical development. This research aims to close this research gap by developing a SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk analysis method for large events by modelling crowd interactions at different types of event spaces and quantifying the SARS-CoV-2 transmission risks in the process. A method is proposed to connect activity scheduling, pedestrian route choice and movement modeling, virus spread modeling, and infection risk identification to determine the transmission risks throughout the events by probability method. <br/><br/>A case study applies the proposed method in a pre-pandemic music festival and shows its capability of revealing the general infection risk and the relation of influence factors to the transmission scale, and it also identifies risk-prone areas in an event. Comparing the different scenarios at each activity space, the general trend is identified that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is limited when the facility is located outdoor, the queue distance is increased, the density is lowered, and the respiratory activities are calmer. Compared to the real-life experimental events, the simulated results tend to be underestimating the risks due to assumptions of the event scale, infrastructure, compliance to measures, heterogeneity in the emission rate, activity schedules, group behavior, number of infectious individuals, and such factors that directly influence the amount of virus transmitted in the event. Nevertheless, this research has shown when and where major risks can occur during an event. It also gives indications on crowd management measures and interventions that can help reduce the virus transmission scale.<br/><br/>The proposed method allows future exploration and comparison of the transmission scales of large events, without posing ethical controversy of exposing people in infection risks. Yet, it has its limitations of not considering group behavior at the event, which is commonly observed at large events and may potentially increase the transmission scale. Another major limitation is its heavy dependency on detailed virus transmission parameters and activity patterns. The former needs to be validated under different scenarios, and the latter needs to be identified from the data collected at the same type of event in future research.","Pedestrian modelling; COVID-19; Risk assessment; Event management; Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","SamenSlimOpen",""

Additive manufacturing (AM) and the subsequent surface biofunctionalization and antibacterial element incorporation are promising techniques to achieve dual antibacterial and osteogenic functionalities within a bone implant. In addition, macrophages are an immune cell type that are known to be essential for the implant success in the body, by having an intimate crosstalk with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the process of new bone formation. However, the behaviour of these immune cells is affected by environmental cues, including the implant surface properties. Therefore, this work investigated for the first time the effects of AM titanium implants biofunctionalized via plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) and incorporated with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on the human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) co-cultured in vitro with human macrophages. Specifically, the paracrine effects of immune cells on the hMSCs osteogenic differentiation were studied by the development of an indirect co-culture model.<br/>Materials and methods: AM Ti-6Al-4V implants were biofunctionalized via PEO and AgNPs incorporation and the surface characterization was performed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and ion release analysis. The effects of such implants on the hMSCs osteogenic differentiation in vitro were subsequently evaluated by measuring the mineralization and osteogenic gene expression. In addition, a macrophage-hMSCs indirect co-culture system was developed in order to study the effects of the macrophage polarization induced by the implants on the hMSCs osteogenic differentiation by means of a paracrine communication. The macrophage polarization was characterized by measuring the cytokine secretion pattern with an ELISA assay and gene expression.<br/>Results: PEO modification of AM implants created TiO₂ surfaces with interconnected micro and nanoporosities and the incorporation of AgNPs. The single-culture of hMSCs on PEO and PEO + Ag implants revealed their ability to promote the osteogenic differentiation and no detrimental effects were observed in this process by the presence of AgNPs. The immunological evaluation of the co-culture system revealed similar polarization patterns when macrophages were cultured on PEO and PEO + Ag surfaces. In addition, factors secreted by polarized macrophages did not elicit a paracrine effect on the co-cultured hMSCs, neither enhancing nor inhibiting their osteogenic differentiation.<br/>Discussion and conclusions: Based on the findings gathered in this study, the incorporation of AgNPs in the PEO layers, under the conditions used in this work, did not compromise the osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of the hMSCs. In addition, PEO + Ag surfaces did also not cause any detrimental effects on the paracrine communication of human macrophages on hMSCs. Therefore, further investigations regarding the osteoimmunomodulatory potential of these biofunctionalized AM implants are worth performing, in an attempt to achieve an important additional biofunctionality next to their proven osteogenic and antibacterial activity. These future researches should include further optimization of the PEO surface morphology and chemistry as well as the co-culture model used in this study.","osteoimmunomodulation; bone implants; Macrophages; Mesenchymal stem cells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-28","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Our current global situation has urged the different industries to adapt the way they provide their services &amp; products, creating a higher demand for home delivery. With 66% of Europeans claiming to have shopped online more since the initial lockdown in March 2020 and 82% planning to shop online at the same level or more post lockdown (Samat, 2014), online shopping will remain in the consumption behaviour of potential customers. Even if consumers considered receiving their packages at their home or decided to pick them up, some other concerns may arise with this new way of purchasing, especially with the packaging system and the further waste disposal issues that the Netherlands has been facing. The high demand for packaging material and the tight supply of waste paper are pushing up cardboard prices (Velden &amp; Stooker, 2021). Thus, there is an inconsistency in the collection of material for repurposing, leading to an increase in the price of recycled material [ + 214% in May 2021 (TMR, 2021)] and leaving the use of virgin material as a better alternative to meet the demand for cardboard. With a market estimated to be valued at ~US$ 237 billion by the end of 2019 and anticipated to reach ~US$ 333 billion by 2027 (TMR, 2021), wood pulp became a relevant subject of analysis in this project. Without a proper strategy to ensure collection and prevent the material from being contaminated, the packaging sector will be forced to bring new virgin material into the chain, which may affect our natural resources in the medium term. This thesis aimed to identify the potential points where paper-based packaging may become waste. Therefore, a systemic design approach is used to identify the different actors. Then, a strategic solution allows them to set shared needs &amp; impacts and collaborate towards the proposed goal. As a result, a program that incorporates logistic providers, packaging producers and waste collectors was created. Moots (from the Mayan word that means “roots”) puts the waste collection system closer to the consumer and, in this way, successfully recover, measure, and repurpose waste paper and cardboard. It also evolves the role of the waste collectors where they became a facilitator to enhance collaboration, goal development, implementation, and measurement of objectives with the final aim of reducing the idea of waste.","Systems design; Reverse Logistics; Packaging; Waste disposal; Sustainabilty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The bone-tendon/ligament and bone-cartilage interface are the most prominent hard-soft interfaces within the human body and need restoration once injuries occur. It is difficult to repair these interfaces and simultaneously maintain the initial quality of the native tissues. This study used hybrid 3D-printing techniques, i.e., fused deposition modeling (FDM) and an extrusion-based technique, to develop a proof of concept for the fabrication of hard-soft interface structures. The first part of the study concentrates on the design of geometrical interlocking structures. A parametric study with multiple simulations was performed for two specific geometries, an anti-trapezoidal and a double hook design. The double hook design demonstrated the highest stiffness under tensile stress conditions. The second part concentrates on manufacturing hard-soft interface structures, for which 2D and 3D models were fabricated. The 2D models were used to explore different geometrical interlocking designs and validate the computational models. The 3D models were used to create a proof-of-concept for a hard-soft interface made from PLA (FDM technique) and alginate (extrusion-based technique). The 3D-printing techniques were combined by extruding hydrogel into the interlocking system of the PLA part and printing a soft alginate scaffold on top of the interlocking structure. In conclusion, this study suggests several practical solutions to improve interfacial designs and to manufacture hard-soft interface structures. Combining 3D-printing techniques opens up new possibilities for the fabrication of state-of-the-art hard-soft interfaces structures.","hard-soft interfaces; bone-to-soft tissue interfaces; additive manufacturing; 3D-printing; biomimetic interfaces; computational modeling; geometrical interlocking designs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-30","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Sustained exposure to motion sickness can lead to the disuse of automated vehicle technology among users. Thus, there is a need to mitigate motion sickness. To do so, a robust model is desired which can predict motion sickness levels while also accounting for individual differences in susceptibility. Studies have been carried out to study the different dynamics of motion sickness and its development. However, the effect of motion amplitude has not yet been quantified. <br/>This study investigated the amplitude dynamics of motion sickness. This was done by perturbing 17 participants along the fore-aft direction with acceleration amplitudes of 1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5 ms^-2 in four separate sessions. In the experiment, both subjective sickness scores and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) was recorded. Using the subjective sickness scores, we explored variations of the Oman model of nausea that could capture the time-amplitude dynamics that were observed. Along with this, a neural network prediction model was proposed to predict motion sickness levels using GSR as a predictor, which could then be used as an objective measurement of motion sickness. Lastly, to better understand the MISC as a measure of motion sickness, we determined the functional mapping between subjective discomfort and the MISC scale. <br/>Our findings show a monotonous increase in the rate of motion sickness development, but this increase is not linear, with a sudden change in slope after 1.5 ms^-2. This nonlinear increase was captured best by applying a power law to the input conflict vector instead of at the output as proposed in the original Oman model (Oman, 1990) Further, it is found that GSR can indeed be used as a predictor for motion sickness with an accuracy of 77% in the training, 66% in the validation and 62% in the holdout set. Finally, it is found that the subject discomfort has a power-law relation with MISC with a mean exponent of 1.28.<br/>The developed prediction model as well as the variation of the Oman model can be used in other experiments to control the level of sickness to the desired trajectory. The developed models can enable adaptive control algorithms for path and motion planning to mitigate motion sickness. This is will in turn lead to a significant improvement in the experience in commuting with an automated vehicle.","Motion Sickness; SIMONA; Automated vehicles; Comfort; Discomfort; Simulator; Modelling; Neural Network; LSTM; MISC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

Unfortunately, they are as far away from nature as it can get. Over the last decade, the industry is increasingly trying to move towards a more bio-based future, often this can be seen in the increased demand for materials sourced from renewable resources such as plants (living organisms) fabrics like cotton. Alongsides the increase in traditional fabrics multiple new initiatives are popping up to connect the textile industry with nature. Due to these endless possibilities, future consumers find it hard to see the wood for the trees. Navigation into the world of biodesign is a necessity to set the next step towards this envisioned sustainable future. What if I told you, to think beyond sourcing materials from living organisms? What if we let living organisms become part of our daily life again? Bioassembly makes it possible to source raw materials from living organisms, produced with living organisms to create a material that is still alive in the use phase. This concept changes the relationship between the consumer and the material. To create comfort around this new relationship innovators should be more interactive with future consumers' so preconceptions can be addressed. Currently digital platforms are the most efficient way of communication between the consumer and the innovator, especially since the shift towards digital channels particularly increased the past year due to social distancing measures as a consequence of Covid-19. However traditional tools are still inadequate in capturing and communicating the qualities of these living materials (D’Olivo &amp; Karana, 2021). Clear digital communication should be transparent and interactive. Besides, it should give a clear image of the aesthetics that currently go beyond beauty and include morals. Morals encourage change on a societal level, where the individual is part of something bigger. The appreciation, attention and understanding of new innovations is built upon social situations and group associations, which are also digitally visible since the rise of social media. So we can state that digital social influence matters since it affects what we think and do. What if we could thoughtfully use social dimensions for the communications of new innovations like ‘living’ textiles? Social dimensions can be split into different levels. Firstly the macro-level of society is envisioned as a concept which is called social impact storytelling. It envisions a clear image on what we could create together in order to provoke change worldwide. Secondly social presence can be used to create a space where people feel safe and free to share and cherish information with others. To finally be influenced by each other; you can pioneer, you can follow or you can do the complete opposite. A qualitative study researches how these particular social dimensions can contribute to the level of understanding and appreciation regarding living textiles. Taking into account the data of 160 participants it should be noted that social dimensions should be used carefully. Innovators should be very specific in what they exactly want to communicate. Social presence can lead to a less professional story since the innovator is not the only source of information anymore. Furthermore innovators should clearly decide to whom they communicate since different groups could be addressed differently. For social impact storytelling this mainly applies when distinguishing between different age groups as there is a lot of difference in what kind of relationship they have with the digital world. The digital world can be a notably broad playground for communication. Let’s design a place that stimulates creativity by giving shape to a material and its ‘livingness’. A world where preconceptions around health, smell and hygienics can be addressed. A world where we can try something new, together.","DIGITAL; NARRATIVES; BIODESIGN; COMMUNICATION; TEXTILES; ALIVE","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://youtu.be/Y3yDPyJXM8w Social impact storytelling https://youtu.be/SPBfcT8Nr7A Social presence storytelling https://youtu.be/SDkdMzb773U control group","","","","","","","",""

Demand in a housing market is caused not only by households without a house but also by those who are unsatisfied with their current housing. In the Netherlands, the housing market is unique because many houses are part of the social sector, a sector in which housing corporations decide the regulations on how houses are allocated. The question is whether different regulations can reduce how many households are unsatisfied with their current housing, thus reducing the total demand. Agent-based modelling (ABM) has been used to better understand various aspects of housing markets. It has not yet been used to model the Dutch social sector. In this thesis, a descriptive agent-based model of the Dutch housing market is created, with a focus on the effect of regulations on the demand of individual households. The main challenge of creating such a model is to create an abstraction that accurately captures the system of interest. The experiments show that the current model is limited due to some of the design choices. The results create insight into the impact of regulations and provides various directions for further research.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The dynamic behavior of structural components can largely change in the presence of damages. Understanding this behavior is of particular importance for critical engineering systems, and in particular bridges. Damage identification methods forms a key objective in structural health monitoring of bridges so many researches have been conducted in this area. In this thesis, damage identification techniques on beam bridges under moving vehicle loads will be presented in order to produce useful conclusions about the assessment of existing bridges by investigating various numerical applications of different scenarios.<br/>The first objective of this thesis is to derive the analytical expressions needed to be able to predict the dynamic response of many different cases of bridges so that as many real scenarios as possible can be treated. This means that these expressions would be used to investigate damaged beam bridges that can be modelled as an assembly of beams with any number of different material properties, any type of interface or boundary conditions and any number of cracks. For this reason an approach to analyze the bridge as an assembly of n piecewise homogeneous damaged Euler-Bernoulli beams jointed at their edges, will be presented, using the generalized functions to obtain a single expression of the solution which depends on the 4 integration constants associated with the boundary conditions. The closed-form expressions of these 4 constants will be provided. Furthermore, in the presence of internal or externals springs, translational or rotational, additional constants representing the discontinuities have to be taken into account and are computed by considering one additional condition for each discontinuity. The feasibility of this approach and the corresponding analytical formulations is shown with two numerical applications that include all the different capabilities mentioned. Moreover, the implementation of these expressions in a deterministic approach for damage localization is presented, mainly as another example of the many possibilities of the use of analytical formulations instead of other approaches and as an introduction of the so called Inverse Problem with deterministic and probabilistic methods. <br/>The second objective concerns the optimization of damage identification on bridges by comparing different quantities that are evaluated while measuring the response of the bridge (direct monitoring) and the response of the moving vehicle when it passes along the bridge (indirect monitoring). First, the governing equations for the dynamic response of these models are derived, considering the crack(s) as a rotational spring, the bridge as an Euler-Bernoulli beam (or multiple with different properties) and the moving vehicle as a spring-mass system. In this manner, the dynamic response of the bridge is calculated (modal characteristics and displacement) as well as the one of the moving oscillator (displacement and acceleration) and the reaction force acting on the surface of the beam from the moving vehicles. Numerical applications with different beam properties and different number of cracks are performed, using MATLAB for the analytical expressions and SAP2000 for the finite element model, to derive the optimal quantity to be used for damage identification. Lastly, the results are validated by considering and comparing an alternative way of modelling crack, namely as a zone with reduced rigidity, for the same numerical examples, leading to the same conclusions about the crack(s) identification.<br/>Last but not least, the third objective of this thesis is to be able deal not only with the widely used time-invariant damages, namely the always-open crack model, but also with time-variant damages and in this case with the switching crack model. To achieve this, the analytical expressions for the closed-form solutions of the mode shapes derived for the always-open crack are modified to be able to tackle the switching crack model by introducing a Boolean switching crack array which identifies open cracks, modelled as rotational springs. These new expressions would still be able to be used for any number of Euler-Bernoulli beams, any type of interface or boundary conditions and any number of switching cracks. Then, the governing equations for the dynamic response of this model are derived, considering the moving vehicles as moving masses in order to validate the approach with numerical examples existing in the literature and then by introducing its new capabilities. Further, as the computational strategy has been validated, a comparison between time-variant and time-invariant damages is performed concerning crack identification, so that the reader would recognize the importance of understanding the dynamic behavior of different ways of modelling damage in complicate engineering systems like bridges.<br","Damage Identification; Switching crack model; Analytical expressions; Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Through mission-oriented innovation, policy makers provide a framework for systematically implementing mission-led research to bring together the willing public and private actors to create system-wide transformations across the entire value chain.<br/><br/>By virtue of its abundance of knowledge, skills and resources, the European Union provides a fervent ground for implementing mission-oriented innovation to address grand challenges, but this fragmentation could also make it an extremely complex scenario to do the same. However, through public funds such as the Horizon 2020 framework programme, the public sector can provide a foundation for initiating mission-oriented policies by funding the early, high-risk and uncertain stages of innovation, which private organizations and SMEs can capitalize on to develop smart innovations. In order to do so, the public sector must possess the appropriate set of dynamic capabilities for bringing private actors to actively work towards developing solutions for addressing grand challenges. Additionally, the fragmentation of knowledge and skills available across member nations of the European Union, industrial sectors or technologies differ, making it highly probable that the degree of private participants in mission-oriented innovation also differs.<br/><br/>This thesis identifies the extent of private participation in European mission-oriented innovation by qualitatively analyzing data extracted from the European Commission's Community Research and Development Information Service (CORDIS) database. A descriptive statistical analysis of the data extracted from CORDIS has identified the current degree of private participation in initiatives encompasses in the Horizon 2020 framework programme. This study identifies the proportion of private participation in the various member states of the European Union and across different societal challenges. It also, identifies the participation of SMEs and incumbent in these initiatives. Based on the results obtained, this study discusses its implications for mission-oriented innovation and provides a scope for possible areas for future studies. Additionally, this study goes one step further to analyze the CORDIS database to understand it benefits and shortcomings.<br/><br/>Lastly, this study also provides recommendations for steering policies in a more effective to better suit actors/researchers/policy makers from specific regions or sectors. The results can be utilized by researchers to conduct studies to identify the dependent variables that directly affect the participation of private actors, which can open up areas of research to understand what factors drive the participation of actors in mission-oriented policies.

Due to its capability to be adapted to suit a wide range of objectives and constraints, both structural and non-structural, TO has been widely applied in all industries, including aerospace. The application of TO in secondary structures offers the scope for further weight savings and, therefore, this thesis investigates the employment of TO on a galley structure provided by Safran-Cabins. The galley structure is an essential equipment for the functioning of passenger aircrafts and hence, provides an ideal product, which once optimized could offer widespread weight saving.<br/><br/>The next generation of commercial aircraft require solutions that are lightweight and yet economic to manufacture. TO solutions are renowned for their complex architectures and frequent employment in conjunction with additive manufacturing. However, for products such as galleys, which are required to be manufactured in large quantities, complex manufacturing strategies are not economically feasible. Therefore, this thesis proposes a modularization strategy that can be used to augment the monolithic TO solution into an assembly of simpler and identical modules. The modular design strategy has proven to be a capable strategy to enhance manufacturability as well as reduce costs over the board and offers a unique opportunity to leverage the capabilities of TO for employment on a wider range of products.<br/><br/>To achieve the aforementioned goal, an image moment-based modularization strategy is investigated which treats the TO solutions as digital images and identifies positions of simple bar/beam modules within the image based on matching of the image moments. Through a detailed investigation, a fragment constrained bar matching strategy is developed. It is demonstrated that the proposed matching strategy is capable of identifying positions of bar/beam modules within TO solutions from the literature. Additionally, a post-processing strategy is developed to augment the obtained modules and their positions into simplified and assembled frame structures analogous to the underlying TO solution. The developed framework is employed on the topologically optimized galley, and its practical capabilities and limitations are identified, thus providing a foundational work to be further refined.<br","Topology Optimization; Modularity; Truss structures; Legendre Polynomial; Image moments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The complex behaviour of light weighted membrane structures can induce dynamic and wind effects, so this requires an appropriate method to analyse the structure. When the deformation of membrane structures is large, it becomes necessary to consider the interaction between wind flow and membrane. This interaction leads to aeroelastic problems. <br/>The necessary properties to be considered for the aeroelastic coupled problem are considered and presented. The major focus of the thesis is to simulate the geometric non-linear behaviour of the membrane structures when subjected to wind loading. To derive the initial equilibrium shape, the method of form finding is applied. To properly simulate the wind flow around the structure, existing research regarding wind tunnel testing of a hemispherical air dome model is used. First, hemispherical model similar to existing research was made to verify the boundary conditions. The results are compared to the wind-tunnel testing results to get proper boundary conditions in Computational Fluid Dynamics models. In order to keep the simulation simple, the wind velocity is considered constant with height and constant wind flow with respect to time. <br/>Partitioned analysis is used to simulate the physics behind the wind-membrane interaction simulation. By using this method, the multi-physics problem is separated into individual fields. Considering the wind-membrane interaction, the problem is separated into fluid domain and structural domain. <br/>The structural and fluid domain mechanics are discussed in detail. For the single field solvers, methods are introduced based on the fundamentals. Finite Element method is used for the form-finding as well as numerical simulation of the structural field and SOFiSTiK software is used. For the fluid simulation, ANSYS CFX is used. <br/>The strong physical coupling is done between the fluid and the structural domain. For this, the partitioned coupling simulation is used. The requirements and methods for the partitioned analysis are presented as well. For the coupling of separate solvers, a central coupling tool is made using Grasshopper. The transfer of coupling data such as displacement and wind pressure on the membrane structure is done using the developed coupling tool. In the development of this coupling method using Grasshopper, Python programming language is used. The developed method was used in iterations to analyse the effect of geometric non-linearity. <br/>In order to make the developed method reusable for the air-supported membrane structures, the whole process is made parametric using grasshopper. This enables us to analyse the membrane structures with known base shape, internal air pressure. Ultimately this method can be used to analyse the effect of geometric non-linearity on membrane structures when subjected to wind loading. To show the use case of developed method, two different models are developed to analyse the fluid structure interaction. First model has been considered with a circular base shape and the second one has been considered with a square base shape. In order to analyse the effect of geometric non-linearity on these structures, the results such as maximum wind pressure on the membrane structure and maximum structural displacement are compared to the results without considering the geometric non-linearity.<br/>Moreover, wind variation analysis is done to analyse the extent to which geometric non-linearity is dependent on the wind speed. Similarly, size variation analysis is also done to analyse the extent to which geometric non-linearity is dependent on the structure size, keeping the wind velocity constant.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-28","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Scope changes negatively affect time, quality and usually lead to cost overruns due to underestimating the change order impacts on the project. There are two main categories through which the impacts could be quantified: the first and second order effects. The first order effect is the impact of the change, cost, time, quality, and risk related. The second order effects are the impacts that resulted as consequences of the first order effects such as lower labour productivity and increase in errors.<br/><br/>The purpose of this research was to analyse and quantify the second order effect due to scope change in large infrastructure projects. The approach that was used to create the model is system dynamics modelling (SDM), since several studies confirmed the success of system dynamics modelling in solving similar projects’ problems in different industries.<br/><br/>Through the literature review and the case study, it was found that the second order effects of scope change are rework, schedule pressure, morale, overtime, productivity, hiring new staff, and office congestion. It was observed through the created dynamic hypothesis that productivity was directly impacted by morale, office congestion, schedule pressure and overtime. The simulated model showed that productivity and morale were the two mostly influenced factors by the scope change.<br/><br/>The main question of ""How could second order effects of the project scope change be quantified through system dynamics modelling?"" was answered as follows: First, a dynamic hypothesis should be created and confirmed through literature and continuous interviews till the hypothesis reflects the project case. Second, formulas should be created for the defined variables and values should be inserted in the model based on the case data. Third, the model should be simulated, and the perceived progress should be compared with planned progress. Then, the first order progress should be compared with the planned progress to quantify the first order of effects of scope change. Finally, to quantify the influence of the second order effect of scope change, the first order effects should be deducted from the total influence of scope change.","System Dynamic Modeling; Second Order Effects; Scope change; Vensim Software; Risk Management; Design Uncertainty; Optimism Bias","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-28","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","Afsluitdijk",""

In particular, in the field of aerospace engineering, airflow sensing is crucial to vehicle state evaluation and flight control. This project surveys the key mechanisms from biological features in nature that enable flow sensing and expands towards the application motivation to identify a suitable airflow sensor that can be equipped to a flapping wing micro air vehicle (FWMAV) for onboard airflow sensing. <br/><br/>The selection of sensors is first narrowed down to three major types of airflow sensors from the state of art that have the most potential to be integrated onboard a flapping wing MAV, considering the sensor performance need, size, weight and power (SWaP) restrictions. Two thermal-based commercially available low-cost airflow sensors RevP and RevC from Modern Device have been selected after the trade-off analysis. <br/><br/>A full workflow of calibrating and evaluating the two airflow sensors' directional sensitivity has been carried out through two wind tunnel campaigns. Their performance under grid-generated turbulence is compared with a constant temperature hot-wire anemometer. This series of tests leads to the conclusion that the RevP airflow sensor has better performance and is therefore chosen to be placed onboard a flapping wing MAV Delfly Nimble. <br/><br/>Both mounted tests and tethered hovering tests with the Delfly Nimble are performed to further examine the airflow sensor RevP's measurement performance under different influence factors such as MAV throttle levels, MAV body pitch angles and freestream speeds. In the end, it is concluded that as a proof of concept, the RevP sensor is capable of performing effective measurements for low flow speeds less than 4 m/s, within the pitching angle range of -30 to 30 degrees. Although this is the first achieved tethered hover flight with onboard airflow sensing for a flapping wing MAV, its limited payload and onboard power supply demands an even smaller and less power consuming design of airflow sensors to enable further applications such as autonomous reactive control under wind disturbances.","DelFly; Flapping Wing MAV; Airflow sensing; Sensor selection; Low speed","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-12-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

III-V/silicon is an emerging solar cell technology, that is expected to enter the market in between 2025 and 2035. It was found that gallium availability can become restrictive for large scale production of III-V/silicon cells, because the amount of high-purity gallium needed for an annual 1 GWp production of III-V/silicon cells (176.3 tons) is close to the entire 2019 world production of high-purity gallium (205 tons). It is therefore recommended to create additional high-purity refineries to refine low grade gallium to high-purity gallium. Moreover, in the long term, gallium can be recycled from end-of-life III-V/silicon cells. Various gallium recovery technologies from end-of-life products have been summed up from a literature review. One of them, an ethanol dilution process, is included in the flowchart of a recycling process for III-V/silicon solar panels. The environmental impacts of the recycling process are compared to the cradle-to-gate impacts of the production of the panels, by performing a life cycle assessment (LCA). The impact categories where the recycling process scores high are climate change, marine eutrophication, freshwater ecotoxicity, fossil resource depletion and ozone layer depletion. A suggestion to reduce the climate change impacts is to recycle the waste plastic that comes from the EoL panels, instead of incinerating this plastic. Finally a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is performed. The CBA shows that recycling gallium, indium and silicon from 1GWp end-of-life III-V/silicon cells is likely to be profitable. With a product lifetime of 25 to 30 years, recycling is assumed to be profitable starting in the timeframe 2050-2065.","Critical Raw Materials; recycling; Industrial Ecology; LCA; CBA; III-V; PV; solar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","SiTaSol",""

Currently the major global sustainability issue stems from the sourcing of virgin wood chips from dense forests for pellet production. An alternative is to use residual biomass from agriculture or forestry, which is produced in large volumes, to produce different products that range from biofuels to chemicals via thermochemical conversion technologies. Among thermochemical technologies, torrefaction is a promising route to produce solid biofuel known as biochar. With an increasing potential for biomass production coupled with an increased scrutiny on the use of biomass as a green fuel, the need for alternative clean applications for the biochar is critical. The aim of this study is to investigate new and novel agricultural residues or other waste streams to produce biochar using high temperature (350 °C) torrefaction technology. The obtained biochar is evaluated experimentally to determine the best feedstocks out of the ones that are selected from a performance and cost point of view for horticultural applications. . This research aims to provide a clear and useful analytical tool which will benefit the scientific community to select suitable biomass materials based on material properties and end applications. The efficacy for the various torrefied biomass feedstocks on the soil and its stability are tested. Overall, about 50 different biomass feedstocks were identified and evaluated based on past performances from literature. The top 10 best performing feedstocks were sourced and subjected to various physical and chemical characterization tests with a specific focus on soil remediation. The selected materials were torrefied in a fixed bed pilot reactor Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and pH measurements. Ultimately the feedstocks were scored and ranked from best to worst performing biochar for soil remediation and sequestration-based applications. The results of this project indicate potential for biochar production from woody, grassy and other processed materials that could help to remove the dependence on evergreen forests and wood chips. The system proposed in this work could also yield negative emissions since the feedstocks are residual flows and the biochar is going to be used in the soil.","pyrolysis; Biomass Pretreatment; Biomass availability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-28","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The shore power evaluation on costs and power utilisation combines the Life Cycle Costs approach and operational tanker data. By designing a model that evaluates the costs and utilisation for terminal and ships, insights for the business case for shore power have been obtained.<br/>Shore power implementation is extremely sensitive to utilisation, if the shore power readiness of ships is low at the terminal, it will be economically unfeasible. As well as for the ships, if no ports with shore<br/>power can be visited, shore power is not at all costeffective.<br/>The chemical shortsea market has the most potential for shore power implementation, due to the frequent visits of ports in Europe. This thesis has found that shore power can be economically feasible when European shortsea shipping is implemented in EU ETS with a CO2 price. The required CO2 price ranges from 33 to 84 €/ton depending on either 100% to 50% of shore power visits of the vessels, respectively. The terminals are unable to provide low shore power prices with only the vessel utilisation, therefore subsidy ranging from 25 to 100% is required on the investment, depending on the terminal. The emission reduction potential of shore power is good, with no local emissions in ports and the power generation emission reduction of 80 to 90% per pollutant.<br/>Currently, shore power for the chemical industry is not economically feasible but provides a good emission performance in the port. For all evaluated shore power systems, EU ETS CO2 prices are required for shipping and subsidies for the terminal investment.

Organic Rankine cycles have a great potential as low grade heat can be converted into electrical energy. In the last ten years, research in this particular field has increased together with the amount of installed systems. Triogen is a company which does a lot of research on how to increase the power output of their Organic Rankine Cycle systems. Their product involves a radial inflow cantilever turbine connected to a single shaft to the generator and the main pump which makes the system quite unique. Because of the fluctuating heat input the system scarcely runs on its design condition so research has to be done to ensure the turbine efficiency is as high as possible to extract as much power out of the heat source as possible. This study investigates whether the pump strategy can be modified in order to increase the system power output for part load situation. By means of elaborate turbine computational fluid dynamics simulations, an optimal rotational speed op n = 475 hz is found for all turbine inlet pressures. A simple cycle model is made in Excel in order to compute the increased power output, given the optimal rotational speed. The most cost effective and straight forward way to implement the fixed rotational speed in the system, a throttle valve is chosen. The amount of extra power gained using the optimal rotational speed is approximately 7 kW, which is an increase of 8 %. For evaporator heat inputs higher than 900 kW<sub>th</sub>, the operation with throttle valve is no longer beneficial and the operation on design condition is favoured.","Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD); ANSYS; Thermodynamics; Organic Rankine Cycle; Pumps; Turbine; Cycle thermodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, when the panel is allowed to enter the post-buckling regime, skin-stringer separation due to the interaction of the post-buckling deformations with the skin-stringer interface is often the critical failure mode. The accurate prediction of skin-stringer separation in these types of panels is therefore crucial for their design. Due to the high computational costs associated with modelling damage in a large multistringer panel and the manufacturing and testing costs associated with testing such a panel, single stringer specimens that accurately represent the behaviour of critical regions in these panels have been proposed in literature. In this thesis, transversely loaded single stringer specimens are designed and verified and are used to predict skin-stringer separation in the critical regions of a specific multistringer panel. A specific composite stiffened panel is considered that contains a skin of a tape material and four co-cured stringers of a fabric material. At the intersections of the skin and stringers, resin-rich noodle regions are created. A buckling analysis is first performed on the panel to obtain its post-buckling deformations. Based on these, two types of regions where skin-stringer separation may occur are identified; a mode I dominated skin-stringer separation at the minima of the buckling waves and a combined mode II and mode III skin-stringer separation at the inflection points of the buckling waves. A seven point bending specimen is designed based on the panel deformations near the former critical region, while a four point twisting specimen is designed based on the deformations near the latter region. Finally, detailed damage models are set up for the single stringer specimens to predict skin-stringer separation and the models are verified with the multistringer panel. The analyses showed that a mode I dominated skin-stringer separation is critical for this panel. The detailed analysis of the four point twisting specimen showed that no damage occurred at the inflection point. To predict the skin-stringer separation at the minimum, a verified seven point bending specimen has successfully been obtained. To do so, it was important to accurately simulate the deformation of the skin at the stringer flange edge, since this proved to be driving for the initiation and propagation of skin-stringer separation. Next to that, a trilinear cohesive law was used to capture the R-curve effect in the tape/fabric interfaces. Finally, a first assessment of the noodle region behaviour showed that damage in this region will probably happen at the location of maximum bending. Recommendations for future research have been provided.","Skin-stringer separation; Stiffened panel; Composite; Buckling; Finite element modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Threatening the almost year-round functioning of nuclear power plants are Flow-Induced Vibrations (FIV). One such mechanism, Vortex-Induced Vibration (VIV), holds importance in areas of cross flow in nuclear power plants. To make fail-safe<br/>designs, computational analysis in the domain of Fluid Structure Interactions (FSI) has been increasing over the past two decades. The thesis work aims to add to the body of knowledge by making predictions for an in-line two-cylinder configuration, set up as part of a benchmark proposed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), using the commercial code Simcenter STARCCM+ (v2020.3.1).<br/><br/>The main objective of this study is to test the efficacy of the URANS framework in predicting VIV which is strongly correlated with the objective of the OECD to propose recommendations for the Best Practice Guidelines. To do so, it is desired to shortlist the most appropriate turbulence model for the final application and point out gaps in the prediction of the same. The thesis work is thus carried out in three phases: code validation, turbulence model selection and final application. Key results from this study reveal the ‘Standard K-Epsilon<br/>Low Re: Cubic’ model to be the most apt for the final application. Furthermore, gaps are also identified in the application of URANS to predict VIV resonance conditions, the primary of which is the overprediction of the vortex shedding frequency.","Fluid Structure Interaction; Vortex-Induced Vibrations; URANS; Turbulence Modelling; Star-CCM+","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-27","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

A detection technique based on correlation values is implemented to obtain an approximate shape of the air cavity and the location of the air-water interface. The technique was successful in identifying the maximum cavity thickness with sufficient accuracy. The leading and trailing edges of the cavity however, were harder to identify, the former owing to a limitation of the developed technique and the latter due to the dynamic nature of the flow and a slightly limited FOV. The ratio of the initial boundary layer thickness to the maximum thickness of the air cavity is 6.7, and as a consequence the boundary layer did not separate at the leeward side of the air cavity. The turbulent boundary layer is observed to feel the presence of the air cavity up to 8.5-9.5 cm upstream due to an adverse pressure gradient. Alternating streamwise pressure gradients are generated due to the curvature of the air cavity: from an adverse to favourable and back to adverse. Compared to solid bump studies in literature, additional perturbations due to a free-slip boundary condition and the unstable nature of air cavity increase the complexity of the current flow. The mean velocity profile and stresses are able to capture the effects of alternating streamwise pressure gradients and air injection, with variations mostly restricted to the inner region. Effects of streamline curvature in the outer region are found to be minimal, while potential effects of the free-slip condition were much harder to identify separately and further research would be needed to appropriately assess them. The mean velocity profile is found to deviate from the classic logarithmic behaviour at the apex of the air cavity, although the flow does not seem to relaminarise. Quadrant analysis shows differences in Reynolds stress producing events compared to the baseline turbulent boundary layer case hinting at possible alteration to coherent structuring of the turbulent boundary layer developing below the air cavity.","turbulent boundary layer; air cavity; pressure gradients; perturbations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","FINN is a framework developed by Xilinx Research Labs that compiles Deep Neural Network software descriptions into fast and scalable dataflow architectures for inference acceleration on FPGAs. The dataflow<br/>architectures are network dependent, sized according to the user-defined throughput requirements, and constrained by available resources on the user-specified FPGA board. Synthesising large neural network designs<br/>with a high degree of configurability leads to large build times, spanning from hours to days, to build an entire network. Thus, the first objective of this thesis is to explore and propose a modified FINN accelerator construction methodology that can substantially reduce the build times. The main idea behind our proposal is to reduce the granularity of the architecture to reduce the size of synthesis jobs and to enable logic reuse within and across neural network layers. Using this method, up to 12× speedup in High-Level Synthesis times and up to 2× speedup in end-to-end build times of accelerator networks are achieved.<br/>The second limitation that this work addresses relates to the performance scalability of FINN generated architectures. There are two modes of parallelism in FINN that currently provide performance scaling in convolution operations. The first factor, which modifies the number of Processing Elements (PEs), parallelises along the input channels of a convolutional layer and the second factor, that modifies the number of Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) lanes present in each PE, parallelises along the number of output channels of<br/>the convolution. Computations are currently not parallelisable across the non-depth dimensions of images, i.e., the side containing pixels of images that faces the viewer. This limitation can restrict the achievable performance for networks that contain layers with large image dimensions and shallow depth dimension. The second part of this work leverages the fine-grained construction methodology to augment FINN performance scaling. The proposed approach introduces a generic FINN modification that enables pixel-level parallelism,<br/>i.e., multiple output pixels of a convolutional layer can be processed simultaneously by performing Multiple Matrix Vector (MMV) multiplications at the same time. Using this generic method, MMV number of pixels can be processed simultaneously, an MMV times throughput increase can be obtained at the cost of less than MMV × additional resources.","FPGA; Neural Network; FINN; Dataflow computing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The trust and acceptance of automated vehicles are primarily dependent on the travelling experience of people. In automated vehicles, passengers are expected to be engaged in non-driving tasks that are likely to decrease their predictability of the vehicle manoeuvre. This would greatly increase their sensitivity to motion sickness, which a large population already suffers in manual driving. Developing a control algorithm to reduce motion sickness in automated vehicles is an absolute necessity. In this research, first, a novel method is proposed to design a test road profile. Next, the study presents an optimal control strategy that implements a speed profiling method to minimise Motion Sickness Dose Value (MSDV), suitable for objective evaluation of motion sickness; on the test road. The resulting manoeuvre from the proposed control algorithm is an 'active mode driving.' A time minimisation manoeuvre defined as 'passive mode driving' is also simulated on the same test road to examine the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. For validation, a subjective assessment is carried out with 16 participants using a driving simulator in a comparative study between the two driving modes. Subjective responses are recorded with MIsery SCale (MISC) during the exposure and with a Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire (MSAQ) at the end of the experiment. It is found that active mode driving resulted in 38% MSDV reduction than passive mode driving. Further, the mean MISC rating in active mode was 62% lower than passive mode driving.","Motion Sickness; Discomfort; Optimal Control; Driving Simulator; Nonlinear; DAVSi","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Aluminium is a vital component of the world's economy, thanks to its versatile applications. However, the environmental impacts of primary production result in a growing desire and societal pressure to develop more efficient recycling techniques. Secondary aluminium is produced at 5% of the energy consumption used to produce primary aluminium. Unfortunately, many recycling techniques suffer from an undesired loss in quality and material due to the complex particle shapes, variety of alloys, and contaminants. This research focuses on a state-of-the-art scrap sorting technique that aims to overcome the problems associated with the singulation of particles with sizes up to 500mm (max. diameter). Singulation is the process where a random particle flow is regularized into an individually spaced 1D file of particles. Subsequent particle identification and sorting into multiple categories increases scrap quality to allow for more efficient up-cycling. A combination of literature study, model simulations and setup experiments is used to study the effects of particle- and equipment properties on obstructing processes. Firstly, this study focuses on three particle properties: Length-to-Width (LW) ratio, density, and complexity of shape. Four different samples are studied: Base case, high LW, high density, high complexity of shape. Obtained results show the adverse effects of increased LW-ratio on the singulation performance. An average LW-ratio increase from 2 to 6 decreases the singulation performance by 10-15%. Surprisingly, the expected frequent entanglement of complexly shaped particles was seldom observed. In addition, the flow of complexly shaped particles showed similar singulation rates compared to low LW particles. High density particles were only linked to minor obstructing events. Secondly, this study focuses on obstructing processes by studying the particle flow over and between setup equipment. Two processes are the most important: 1) transition behaviour (single particle flow) and 2) merging mechanisms (multiple particle flow). Video analysis has shown the adverse effects of unpredictable particle flow upon transitioning between setup stages. This results in an entirely random process, thereby deteriorating performance and rapidly wearing the chute surface. Unpredictable flow on the chute is primarily related to specific yet frequent circumstances. The amount of correction in flow a particle requires to align into a single file seems the best indicator. Centre-fed, parallel orientated particles require the least correction. Edge-fed, perpendicularly orientated particles require most. The latter is associated with the highest degree of unpredictable rolling. This observed phenomenon increases with particle size. The chute is designed to merge particles with crossing trajectories. Merging particles rotate around their point of contact as a whole until the combined bounding box is orientated parallel to the direction of flow. This explains the poor performance of high LW particles and surprisingly good performance of complex-shaped particles. The bounding box of merging high LW particles is already orientated parallel to the direction of flow. Limited rotational force is therefore exerted on the particles. In addition, the higher moment of inertia and chute design further restrict rotation towards sequential flow. Consequently, the current singulation process functions below its potential. The passive singulation process benefits from a reject of high LW particles towards the coarse faction (to be re-shredded) and smooth transition designs to reduce unpredictable flow.","Recycling; Scrap; Aluminium; Scrap modelling; Upcycling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-09-27","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","Development of a novel scrap sorting process",""

It addresses the mixing processes with resident gases that occur during hydrogen storage operations in gas fields, and analyzes their implementation in a reservoir simulator. The CMG GEM reservoir simulator allows incorporation of mechanical dispersion and effective molecular diffusion into its simulations, while solving the advection dispersion transport equation fully implicitly, as well as gravitational segregation and other macro scale mixing phenomena. Mechanical dispersion is quantified by its main parameter dispersivity, for which a large uncertainty exists in the literature. Dispersivity represents pore scale fluid velocity differences caused by microscale heterogeneities in a porous medium. Due to the lack of adequate hydrogen dispersivity experiments, a range of dispersivity values is collected from literature on (groundwater) dispersivity experiments in sandstones. A sensitivity analysis is conducted, in which the influence of the different mixing processes on the mixing between working gas and cushion gas is analyzed. For this, a conceptual reservoir model (radial and homogeneous), with properties based on Dutch sandstone gas fields was built in CMG GEM. The effect of molecular diffusion on mixing proves to be negligible compared to mechanical dispersion at typical reservoir flow rates. Furthermore, the results of the simulations prove to be significantly influenced by numerical dispersion, which is a calculation error, dependent on grid size and time step. The effect of numerical dispersion compared to mechanical dispersion is quantitatively analyzed, after which various options are introduced to deal with numerical dispersion in a way that the physical processes are most realistically represented. The work in this thesis demonstrates the challenges of realistically implementing hydrogen storage mixing processes in a reservoir simulator, and should be regarded as a foundation for further research.","Hydrogen; Storage; mixing; dispersion; dispersivity; gas reservoirs; gravitational segregation; diffusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

To achieve optimal total impulse during engine operation, these engines are normally optimized to be optimally expanded at high altitude, and low ambient pressure. The expansion ratio is constrained by the sea-level operational conditions, for a too high expansion ratio will result in internal flow separation from the nozzle wall. However, during start-up and shutdown, when the engine has not yet achieved nominal nozzle pressure ratio (NPR), between the combustion chamber and the ambient, flow separation still occurs. The unsteadiness and asymmetry of the separation and the resulting internal shock structure, impose significant lateral loads on the nozzle structure. These loads are exacerbated in thrust optimized contour (TOP) nozzles, where the flow transitions between two vastly different configurations, free and restricted shock separation (FSS and RSS), during the start-up or shut-down ramp. <br/><br/>Simulations and small-scale experiments on thick-walled nozzles have provided insight into the physics behind this transition. However, they never consider the effect of the flexibility of the nozzle wall on the flow structure, while in real rocket engines deformation amplitudes of the nozzle wall can reach up to 6% of the nozzle diameter. To investigate the effect of fluid-structure interaction on the magnitude of lateral loads, a test setup was designed at the high-speed laboratory to allow for testing of flexible rocket nozzles. Several tests with stiff and flexible nozzles were performed, taking wall pressure, side load, particle image velocimetry (PIV) and digital image correlation (DIC) measurements. The successful operation of the test setup was validated by comparing stiff nozzle wall pressure measurements to literature, and quantitative velocity field data was obtained using PIV. The PIV data hinted at the existence of a stabilizing recirculation region downstream of the Mach disk, which has been observed in simulations, but has never been experimentally confirmed. The flexible nozzle tests did not result in useful scientific data but did prove that DIC can be used effectively to perform modal analysis on the nozzle lip.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

As a part of Saudi Arabia’s 2030 vision, an unprecedented amount of tourism development is being carried out under the ‘Red Sea Development Project’. The aim is to develop hyper-luxury islands in a sustainable and ecologically friendly way by closely following ‘Building with Nature’ principles. The tourism development site at Al Wajh Bank encompasses an archipelago of more than 90 islands and some of the sandy islands provide nesting grounds for Hawksbill and Green turtles. The thesis is a component of a broad study on investigating the preferential conditions for sea turtle nesting and conservation where TU Delft is collaborating with NIOZ and KAUST. The present study makes a preliminary assessment of the preferential conditions for sea turtle nesting of wave hydrodynamics and geomorphological conditions based on available data and numerical wave model simulations. The study is expected to provide information and guidance for future research for the conservation of sea turtle nesting at Al Wajh Bank.<br/><br/>The coral reefs provide breeding grounds for sea turtles in the gently sloping sandy beaches along the raised islands where the sand has ideal conditions of moisture, temperature, and distribution of sediment size for successful nesting and hatching of eggs at an optimum distance from the highwater line to avoid inundation by wave runup. In general, the foreshore at the turtle nesting site has a fore reef with a steep slope followed by a wide and shallow reef flat having high bottom roughness for dissipation of wave energy. The Al Wajh Bank spread over an area of 2880 km^2 has a very large and complex barrier reef system at the outer edge in the deep sea enclosing a massive lagoon with several islands. These islands have sandy beaches on the up wave (windward) side and mudflats with sand and vegetation in the sheltered zones. The vegetation is dominated by mangroves in the mudflats and seagrass in the shallow lagoon beds.<br/><br/>The study used the Delft3D WAVE stand-alone phase averaging spectral wave model for transforming waves from offshore to nearshore and to examine the energy dissipation characteristics of the reef system. The high-resolution bathymetry data for the Al Wajh Banks was obtained from GCC and relatively coarse resolution data for the offshore from GEBCO. The model simulated offshore wind and wave data validated using satellite altimetry, SAR, and Buoy measurements was obtained from BMT ARGOSS online services website “waveclimate.com”. The normal and extreme wave conditions were derived using this data. The data on GPS coordinates at the location of turtle nesting sites was provided by a survey undertaken by KAUST. A limited data on sediment size distribution at four islands south of Al Wajh Bank was made available by KAUST collected by ALS Arabia. The data on beach slopes, the distance of nests from HWL, geomorphology, vegetation was derived from secondary sources or in an indirect manner using bathymetry data.<br/><br/>The wave model results were analyzed for the nearshore wave heights and distribution of energy density at the fore reef and inside the lagoon. The wave model results revealed that the extensive barrier reef on the seaward side of the Al Wajh Bank is able to completely prevent and dissipate the energy of the offshore waves providing ideal conditions for turtle nesting at seaside islands. Further, the results show that the offshore waves do not have any role in the production and dissipation of wave energy inside the lagoon. The study confirmed that the waves inside the lagoon are exclusively local wind-generated waves. The wave climate inside the lagoon during storm conditions is only influenced by the prevailing strong winds and not dependent on the storm-generated extreme waves from offshore.<br/><br/>Most of the sea turtle nests have been found on the up wave or windward side of beaches with flat and wide reefs or fringing reefs between the reef crest and the high-water line. The wave model demonstrated the large energy dissipation rates under these geo-morphological conditions. In the absence of relevant data on sediments for the nesting and non-nesting beaches, no specific conclusions could be drawn. The beach slopes where sea turtle nests were abundant had slopes in the range of 1:10 and 1:20. The study indicated that the non-nesting sites inside the lagoon are in the sheltered zones of inner reef shelfs and behind the islands where mudflats with mangroves and other vegetation are abundant.<br/><br/>The wave runup is estimated using the HyCReWW metamodel at the nesting and non-nesting sites. The metamodel estimates indicated that the wave runup is of comparable magnitude both for the nesting and non-nesting sites. The comparison of runup distance along the beach indicated that the turtle nesting sites are located sufficiently away from the runup computed for 1 in 100-year wave height<br/><br/>A satellite imagery-based global shoreline data source (Shoreline Monitor, Deltares/TUDelft) was used to examine the erosion and accretion trends at Al Wajh Bank. The data identified two of the islands as having chronic erosion which have a small percentage of nesting sites. The analysis of the data identified that the turtle nesting sites are located on beaches with stable erosion/accretion rates.<br/><br/>The study confirmed the limitations of the Delft3D WAVE (SWAN) model used in simulating IG waves. Due to the very large domain and the course grid adopted in the present study the wave setup aspects have not been covered. The present study was useful in providing a range of information and guidance for further hydrodynamic and geomorphological data inputs at a regional scale and application of models like X-Beach or SWASH for a more comprehensive and detailed analysis on the influence of the surf and swash zone dynamics including IG waves on the sea turtle nesting sites. A systematic data acquisition on geomorphological and sediment characteristics will be useful for logistic regression analysis to study the dominant factors influencing the turtle nesting and non-nesting sites.","Turtle; Wave hydrodynamics; beach morphology; Vegetation; Coral reefs; lagoon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","25.590299, 36.694635"

This study applies moderated multiple regression on Netherlands Mobility Panel data to analyse possible heterogeneity of the effects of determinants of travel behaviour on daily travel distance, dependent on the level of urbanisation. The results show that various determinants indeed have effects with varying strengths, dependent on the level of urbanisation. The findings advance the understanding of the relationships between built environment and travel behaviour, which could be used to design tailor-suited policies that efficiently target specific groups.

The design process was guided by the formative research on the challenges and enablers to diet change relating to pregnancy as reported in the literature followed by translating them into providing continuous care by applying behaviour change theories.<br/>As a solution direction to providing personalised support, it is envisioned that women with gestational hypertension will be supported using a chatbot-driven service that assists them in effectively managing their diet by providing continuous training based on their lived experiences and with the help of relevant triggers. The chatbot was developed with the aim to (1) help the women cope with emotions, (2) provide knowledge and (3) effectively manage their diet.<br/>The chatbot serves as a tool to gather data from the women, uncover it and deliver continuous support. In the process, it improves the current care pathway by providing (1) immediate response without increasing the load on the medical team, (2) ease of interaction through uninterrupted contact and increased reach and (3) personalisation of care utilizing tailored support. Thus, it has the potential to act as an effective means for guiding women when making diet changes while catering to specific needs within a diverse population. Further analysis through user testing is required to understand its acceptability and desirability in everyday use.","mHealth app; diet change; Pregnancy; chatbot; healthcare design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","",""

The gapped design allows the cross flow amplified at the hingeline of the inboard spoiler to escape through the middle gap increasing the lift dumping per area efficiency of the design by 44% while only reducing lift dumping by 4.6% compared to the full spoiler span configuration. LDA spoilers reach a projection height of 8.7% local chord and the hingeline is placed at 80% local chord. With this combination of projection height and chordwise location, there are no occurrences of adverse lift phenomena. Other tested spoilers that are either smaller in chord length, deflection angle or placed such that it is submerged in the boundary layer have shown to increase the lift coefficient at angles of attack relevant to touchdown, 17 degrees.<br/><br/>Control surfaces are integrated within the LDA given the spoilers do not heavily influence the authority of the control surfaces. The ground roll performance of the Flying without the LDA is already comparable to a B747-400 using spoilers. At the point of operation where ground roll is maximized, namely forward center of gravity and maximum landing weight, the Flying V can come to a stop from touchdown in 1300 m and 28.4. Introducing the LDA to the Flying V is less effective than introducing spoilers to a B747-400 as the Flying V does not have any lift from flaps that the LDA can spoil. Nonetheless at typical runway conditions LDA reduces the total ground roll by 95 m. The significance of dumping lift is amplified for adverse runway conditions as 130 m in wet runways and 500 m in icy conditions can be gained using the LDA.<br/><br/>At 17 degrees touchdown angle of attack the LDA only uses the spoiler to create a slight nose down moment of -0.0069 to help derotate the aircraft. Furthermore the LDA can be directly deployed at touchdown to decrease the lift coefficient by 0.057 which is approximately equal to decreasing the angle of attack by 1.5 degrees on the clean aircraft reducing the possibility of a bounce-off. At braking attitude of -2.5 degrees angle of attack, control surfaces join the spoiler in lift dumping. In this case the LDA reduces the lift coefficient by 0.21 and increases the drag coefficient by 0.028.","Flying V; Spoiler surfaces; Lift dumping; Ground roll; Braking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This creates societal issues putting pressure on the affordability of transport, the liveability of cities and sustainability of mobility infrastructure. The radical innovation that could potentially reform the entire transport system in order to tackle these societal challenges is Mobility as a Service. But for MaaS to become a succes, the current way the Dutch mobility system functions has to change, and travellers need to adopt the use of the system in a way that societal issues will actually be solved. Whereas current developments regarding MaaS in the Netherlands are mainly focussed on creating a base on technical and policy level, this graduation project puts the individual traveller central. In collaboration with RET, 9292 and the Seamless Personal Mobility lab, the project evolved around the process of designing of a mobile MaaS journey plan application that supports travellers with tailormade travel advice to fulfil trip-dependent needs, when preparing a door-to-door travel plan. As a case study, the target group entailed travellers that travel to incidental leisure activities and live in an urban area with a large mobility offer (like Rotterdam). Along the line of a user-centred double diamond process, a variety of research activities and multiple design iterations are conducted with extensive user involvement to unravel true user needs and creating desirable and usable experiences. Based on the insights gained, a design of a mobile journey planner MaaS application is envisioned, prototyped and evaluated with travellers, mobility, design and technology experts. For MaaS to become a success, the service should provide added value for travellers to adopt the service and stimulate a positive travel behaviour change. Currently the way people travel is very much rooted in existing habits and routines. Cross-checking multiple application is carried out in search of finding the best travel plan fulfilling travellers’ specific travel needs. To improve the current process of planning a trip, the final design is focussed around supporting travellers in their information search on travel possibilities and evaluation of these alternatives. Design criteria for creating a personally relevant travel plan The process of creating a door-to-door travel plan should provide travellers with freedom of control and choice, speed and ease. Besides to create a window of opportunity for positive travel behaviour change, the design should provide personally relevant inspiration on a diversity of travel modes and allow for a clear comparison on different modes on each leg of the trip as well as for travels plans as a whole. Get inspired – a MaaS journey planner The final design is a journey planner sparking travellers with endless personalised travel possibilities. In the form of a white-label app, this design is envisioned being part of a MaaS application that supports travellers in their search for information and evaluation of possible travel modes and routes. The app provides travellers with two methods to create a door-to-door travel plan. The Reismodus method provides a few complete travel plans filtered by a personally chosen travel mode. On the other hand, travellers are provided with full control by the ability to compose the entire travel plan from scratch. On top of that, creating a profile and adding personal transport modes, subscriptions and/or discount cards, allows for evaluating the data that are truly apply to oneself. Evaluating on desirability, viability, feasibility and integrity The final design is evaluated with travellers, and design, technology and mobility experts on desirability, feasibility, viability and integrity. Conducting different guerrilla tests provided insights in the desire for an ‘advanced profile’ to support receive personally relevant travel suggestions and information, and a clear division of ‘Reismodus advocates’ and ‘Stel samen advocates’. Besides the different functionalities of the final design are provided an initial estimation on the level of complexity, and are reviewed by design experts on usability and UX patterns. Eventually a variety of evaluation sessions with mobility experts generated insights in the design’s strengths and weaknesses, as well as potential opportunities and threats.","MaaS; personalisation; journey planner; planner; User-centered design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Silicon-air battery is a type of storage technology that potentially has a higher energy density than lithium-ion battery. The silicon-air<br/>battery, on the other hand, must overcome corrosion and passivation reactions in order to discharge continuously. One method of reducing the passivation reaction is by increasing the dissolution rate of the discharged product higher than its generation rate. This is possible by increasing the surface area of silicon anode by making it porous. The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of porosity on the discharge of a silicon-air battery. In this work amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) based anodes made by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) technique are used. The deposition power and deposition pressure are altered to obtain a-Si:H anodes of different porosities. The influence of these deposition conditions on porosity and conductivity is studied. In order to find the porosity, the refractive index of the deposited a-Si:H layer was obtained from optical characterization. Bruggeman’s Effective Medium approach is followed to calculate porosity. The deposition power has the greatest impact on the refractive index, porosity, and conductivity of the a-Si:H layer. Increasing the deposition power raises the porosity and the conductivity. This thesis also looks into the effect of varying the fraction of dopant gas in the gas mixture on porosity and<br/>conductivity. The experiments show that both porosity and conductivity increase with higher fraction of dopant gas. The deposited a-Si:H layer and c-Si wafer were used as anode in the discharge of silicon-air battery.","Silicon-air batteries, passivation, porosity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Using the estimation theoretic Cramér-Rao bound, optimisations of the acquisition sequences can be performed, that increase the precision of the resulting tissue maps. The effect of this optimisation has been confirmed using numerical simulations. Speed-ups in MRF are generated using significant undersampling of the k-space information. This results in spatially coherent undersampling artefacts, that generally is the dominating error source for regular $T_1$ and $T_2$ mapping. The undersampling artefacts can be predicted using a mathematical model leveraging on techniques from perturbation theory. Numerical simulations suggested that optimisations of the acquisition parameters are effective in reducing the undersampling error. This was confirmed using in vivo scans.

Instead of utilizing the conventional transportation routes, Autonomous Surface Vessels (ASVs) could transport goods and people via the 165 canals present in Amsterdam. <br/>However, urban canals are challenging for motion planning since the space can be narrow and contain other human-operated boats. <br/>Unfortunately, there are limited existing works regarding motion planning for ASVs in urban canals with dynamic obstacles. Additionally, motion planners for other applications can not be applied directly because of the lacking traffic structure in the canals, the specific dynamics of ASVs, and the regulations applying to canals. <br/>Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to develop a motion planning framework that can plan dynamically feasible motions for ASVs in urban canals complying with regulations. These rules are not only mandatory but adhering to them makes the ASV's motion socially compliant, and therefore, more predictable by other canal users. <br/>We build upon local model predictive contouring control and extend it with regulation compliance. Adherence to rules is achieved by constructing a new cost function for the optimization problem that allocates a higher cost on specific sides of the obstacle vessel. With this new cost function, the Roboat can behave according to the regulations in takeovers, head-on encounters, and crossings with boats from port and starboard.<br/>Furthermore, the effect of predicting the obstacle vessel trajectories with a Social variational recurrent neural network is compared to the constant velocity model. <br/>The entire motion planning framework is compared in simulation with LMPCC and the current motion planning and control framework of the Roboat, breadth first search combined with Nonlinear Model Predictive tracking Control (NMPC).<br/>Additionally, the motion planning framework is implemented on a quarter-scale Roboat and is tested in an outdoor environment with disturbances.","Motion Planning; Autonomous Surface Vessels; Urban; Canals; Regulations; Model Predictive Control; Model Predictive Contouring Control; Local Planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-27","","","","","TRiLOGy","52.373197, 4.915044"

This problem is caused by long periods without rain but with high evaporation rates and is enhanced by groundwater extraction for drinking water. Due to climate change, these droughts are expected to occur more often and become more severe. A possible strategy to mitigate drought in the eastern part of the Netherlands is to scale down the groundwater extraction, thereby limiting the groundwater depletion. In this case however, an alternative drinking water source has to be created. This research explores the option to use the former river bed of the Rhine near the Dutch-German border, the Rijnstrangen, to create this alternative drinking water source, answering the following question: How can retention of Rhine water in the Rijnstrangen contribute to drought mitigation in the eastern part of the Netherlands?<br/><br/>With this study, it is shown that the Rijnstrangen realistically can contribute up to 100 Mm3/y to the drinking water production in its region. This is up to 75% of the drinking water production of the Dutch province Gelderland, in which the Rijnstrangen is located. The exact maximum extraction volume from the Rijnstrangen depends on policy choices such as the maximum accepted water level in the Rijnstrangen and the maximum accepted average extraction from the region around the Rijnstrangen. <br/><br/>From a water quantity point of view, the maximum extraction volume of up to 100 Mm3/y indicates that utilizing the Rijnstrangen as a retention reservoir is a promising option to contribute to drought mitigation in the eastern part of the Netherlands. Therefore, further investigation of this idea is relevant. <br","Rijnstrangen; Drought; Retention; Drought mitigation; Retention reservoir; Retention basin; Drinking water; Oost Nederland; Climate change; Climate change adaptation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.895684, 6.093160"

Many of them have only minimal or even no metal built in making it difficult to detect such devices via conventional metal detectors. Thus, alternative methods such as Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) are deployed for this purpose. The field methodology of using GPR for the detection of buried objects generally includes varying degrees of inclination and height of the antenna in use. In this work, the influence of antenna inclination and height above ground is studied by using control studies with simple reflector geometries. The investigations shall provide more insights on the influence of these factors via measurements in controlled environments and numerical simulations. A comparison of the two is used to study the accuracy of numerical simulations of scenarios involving the detection of buried objects with GPR. The motivation hereby is the fact that gaining experimental data is generally very costly, time consuming and difficult to set up. Evaluations of the tested parameters showed the individual impact of each factor on the measured data. Height and inclination as well as exogenous factors, such as antenna orientation, subsurface structure and reflector geometry played a governing role influencing the measured data. The field measurements were successfully reproduced in numerical simulations. However, it is crucial to implement proper physical and geometrical parameters of the antenna, subsurface and reflector into the simulation environment to achieve realistic and reliable results. The findings of this thesis will be beneficial to implement more accurate numerical simulations in the future, which enables to study more complex, extensive and variable scenarios in a much faster, efficient and less costly manner.","Landmines; Improvised Explosive Devices; Ground Penetrating Radar; GPR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","Counter-IED3",""

The designing of these experiences is called Brand Experience Design.<br/>Brands have become one of the organizations’ most valuable assets. This entails that storytelling has become more important. It helps ensuring a brand has a single and consistent proposition. However, when a brand does not live up to its story, the story is nothing more than empty words to persuade a consumer. Therefore, it will not only be essential to tell a consistent story but also to prove it.<br/>To achieve this, brands have to think from a central idea and translating it into the brand’s different touchpoints. Think about central ideas like Nike’s Just do it or Coolblue’s Alles voor een glimlach. While these are successful examples that organizations look up to, they don’t organize themselves to do the same. So the question is how to help these organizations think more from such central idea?<br/>This project is executed in collaboration with creative agency Selmore.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Exploiting electric vehicles for maintaining a stable electricity grid is a promising opportunity, which is recognized by both the academic and industrial world. Although the concept is relatively simple, the operating space containing many different stakeholders, rules and legislation is not. There are various practical issues that complicate large scale implementation, which are not yet addressed in scientific literature. One such issue is that aggregators who engage in energy trading and have the desire to capitalize on flexible power from electric vehicles by active control, need forecasts and real-time information of uncontrolled charging power. The main problem is that under active control of charge sessions, information of uncontrolled charging is lost as energy meters measure the result of such control signals. This thesis proposes an innovative solution for which a patent has been filed, to reconstruct uncontrolled charging profiles from historical data and to forecast future values of the load for a large group of charge stations as input for trading on energy markets. <br/>Three forecasting methods were applied to forecast future values of the uncontrolled load in two different scenarios, e.g. day-ahead and intraday. In the day-ahead scenario, the 24 hours of the next day are predicted, but predictions are to be submitted 12 hours in advance due to the day-ahead market clearing, such that our models need to predict 36 hours into the future. In the intraday scenario, our models need to predict the load for the next 15 minutes.<br/>For forecasting, the following methods were used: a SARIMAX model, Singluar Spectrum Analysis with a Linear Recurrent Formula and a Nonlinear Autoregressive Gaussian Process model. The forecasting accuracy of these models was tested by evaluating the out-of-sample predictions using the mean absolute percentage error and root mean squared error. As a guideline for acceptable accuracy, we require the mean absolute percentage error to be below 10 (percent). <br/>In the day-ahead scenario, for weekdays the best performing model is the SARIMAX(2,0,1)(2,1,0)24$ which returned a MAPE of 4.57% and RMSE of 236 (rounded) for a specific day in March based on three weeks of data. The AR-GP recurrent with order p = 28 followed with an acceptable result with MAPE 6.68% and RMSE 330. The SSA model scored significantly lower than both methods, with a MAPE of 9.47% and RMSE of 413. Cross-validation showed that the current models were unable to adequately predict the load during weekends. The models were retrained by selecting different model orders based on a new training data set, which contained only Saturdays or Sundays and we saw the AR-GP direct models now outperform the SARIMAX model, which was the best model for week days, with MAPE of 4.87% and 6.84% and RMSE 213 and 309 for Saturday and Sunday respectively. <br/>For the intraday scenario, on weekdays, the AR-GP with recurrent forecasting (p = 16) was the best performing model and returned a MAPE of 5.73% and RMSE of 220.<br/>As a general conclusion, using the proposed method we can reconstruct the uncontrolled load for thousands of charge stations and using a combination of different forecast models, our forecasting accuracy goal for all different scenarios is achieved.","Forecasting; Electric Vehicle; Electricity market; SARIMAX; Gaussian Process Regression; SSA; Load; Uncontrolled; Baseline","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-09-24","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This paper investigates the use of solar-sail technology to increase the warning time for Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) heading towards Earth. In addition, this research will build upon the current understanding of using solar-sail dynamics with regards to CME detection by providing insights into the problem characteristics. The warning time is proportional to the distance from the Earth to the spacecraft detecting the CME: a current warning time of 30 to 60 minutes is achieved by satellites at or near the Sun-Earth L1 point. By considering the actual shape of a CME, the continuous solar-sail acceleration from the solar sail can be used to find a periodic trajectory that travels further upstream of the CME-axis, thereby increasing the warning time with respect to current missions. Finding a periodic solar-sail trajectory can be regarded as an optimal control problem, which requires a near-feasible initial guess trajectory. the latter is found by generating heteroclinic connections between artificial equilibrium points in the vicinity of the sub-L1 and sub-L5 point through the use of a grid search and a genetic algorithm. The optimal control problem is solved with a direct pseudospectral method, resulting in four representative trajectories, each having specific (dis)advantages. The performance impact due to (the uncertainty of) non-ideal sail properties, change in lightness number, and variation in CME size are investigated. Ultimately, the most optimal trajectory increases the average and maximum warning time by a factor 20 and 30 with respect to current missions at L1, respectively, with a 90\% probability that the spacecraft detects the CME.","Solar storm; Solar sail; Trajectory optimisation; Pseudospectral collocation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The lack of quality sleep can cause serious health problems and affect patients’ health recovery. Music as a low-cost sleep aid is a promising way to improve patients’ sleep. However, most available sleep music playlists are limited to generic, soothing songs. People’s personal preferences in relation to the effects of music are not well-considered and under-researched. Therefore, this project aims to explore how to design and deliver music that fits with patients’ sleep and music preferences with a profile-based personalization approach.<br/>Literature research was first carried out to understand sleep knowledge, how and why music aid sleep, practices in music therapy and profile-based personalization. Through generative research, people’s preference data was collected and lead to four sleep music profiles: explorer, diver, hunter, observer. A design direction was proposed based on insights from the research activities. In the design phase, two brainstorming sessions were carried out and resulted in a feasible system concept. After two iterations, the final design DREAMe was proposed. DREAMe is personalized music modular system, including profile generation and music delivery. The profile generation logic allows the system to predict which profile users are based on a list of questions. Each profile comes with a sleep music module. To evaluate the music effects, sleep music samples were made under a summarized music design guideline. The music melodies of users’ favourite music come from instrumental covers of the songs participants provided. The resources downloaded online were used fairly and only for this evaluation purpose.<br/>In project evaluation, results suggest that the product and profile experience are logical, intuitive, and easy to use. The four profiles can reflect people’s preferences, but they may not be stable. An eight-day evaluation was conducted to test the music effects on sleep. DREAMe music was found to reduce sleep onset latency and improve sleep quality. People could fall asleep more easily and feel more relaxed after two days’ music listening. The music design delivers a relaxing, enjoyable and immersive music experience.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Partly due to this, the accuracy of DNNs in image classification and speech recognition tasks has increased as well. This enables a great potential for such models to be applied in real-world applications. However, due to their size, the compute and power requirements are often too large to deploy these models on edge devices. This prohibits applying such models within a rich field of application demanding high-throughput and real-time execution. <br/><br/>Deploying quantized DNNs on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) overcomes this problem. FPGAs are well known for their low-latency, high-throughput, and low-energy capabilities. However, creating hand-tuned FPGA designs requires expert-level knowledge of the underlying hardware domain. Especially for mathematicians or software engineers that develop new quantized DNNs, but also for experienced hardware designers that want to implement a large DNN on an FPGA, the implementation burden is often too large to reap any practical benefits from accelerating the application on an FPGA. <br/><br/>The open-source FINN compiler, introduced by Xilinx Research Lab, provides an excellent bridge between the software and hardware domain by allowing quantized DNN inference FPGA accelerators to be generated from a high-level description of the quantized DNN in the widely adopted open-source ONNX format. Due to lower-level implementation details being abstracted away, the question is how this affects the performance of the generated accelerator.<br/><br/>This work examines whether FPGA implementations of CNN-based models for speech-to-text inference can be generated automatically by means of FINN. For this purpose, a sub state-of-the-art CNN for speech-to-text recognition, named QuartzNet, is targeted for FPGA acceleration. <br/>To achieve this, extensions to the FINN compiler are proposed to enable generating 1D CNN inference accelerators for FPGAs. Furthermore, a proof-of-concept FPGA accelerator of a quantized QuartzNet model is implemented by means of FINN. Compared to a high-end CPU device, the proposed FPGA accelerator achieves 7.7x higher throughput and 8.2x lower latency for a speech recognition inference task. Compared to a high-end GPU device, the proposed FPGA accelerator improves the energy efficiency by 6.8% at the expense of lower throughput and higher latency. <br/><br/>By generating an FPGA accelerator for a quantized version of the QuartzNet model, this work bridges the software and hardware domain by showcasing how a trained CNN in the software domain can be transformed to create a high-throughput, low-latency, and energy-efficient FPGA accelerator with a fraction of the design effort required compared to constructing a handwritten RTL implementation.","FPGA; Hardware acceleration; CNN; speech-to-text; Inference; compiler; Vivado HLS; FINN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

The circular economy (CE) provides the opportunity to address this issue because CE is characterised by reducing the carbon footprint, using primary materials and protecting material resources. By recycling construction materials and use second-hand construction materials, it is possible to address this issue.<br/><br/>High reaching ambitions on circularity are created by the Dutch government and public organisations for the infrastructure industry. Researchers explain that public procurement can contribute to achieve these circular ambitions. Especially in the infrastructure sector, public organisations have a large purchasing volume. They can stimulate and create demands for a product that contributes to CE by including it in their procurement. However, because of the developing character of circularity, circular public procurement is a new challenging field that lacks empirical research.<br/><br/>To realise circular procurement in practice, ambitions need to be clearly formulated for a project. This is not yet explored enough, and the question of how to deal with the challenging ambitions in projects is still unanswered. In this research is discovered how public organisations strategize their organisational ambitions on the project level during the preparation of procurement. The strategizing of organisational ambitions on the project level is recognised as a process. Therefore, two real-life projects are analysed by using process research to explore the used strategies. <br/><br/>The research results show us that two public organisations show two different approaches of strategizing in which several contextual factors play a significant role. On the one side, a highly emergent strategy is preferred when it is acceptable to release the organisational boundaries and restrictions. On the other side, a partly deliberate and partly emergent strategy is preferred when it is a situation in which organisational boundaries play a significant role in the innovation process. Eventually, both strategies discovered in the case studies can be applied to determine how organisational ambitions can be strategized on a project level in other situations concerning new initiatives (like circularity in this research). <br","Construction Management & Engineering; Infrastructure projects; Strategy-as-practice; Process research; Public procurement; Circular economy (CE)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Two major renovations (1985 and 2000) tried to save the mall, but it has become outdated again.

Many companies are developing their own quantum hardware for both research and preparing for practical deployment. The main challenges in the past years have been an abundance of practical applications for the few-qubit Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) quantum hardware and scaling the qubits and depth of the quantum hardware. For these reasons, quantum computing was not yet at the maturity level needed to create a useful application level quantumbenchmark. Many quantum benchmarks have been developed, but these either aim at qubit level assessment or are lacking in practical usability. For a benchmark to be useful, the practical application of the quantum hardware needs to be reflected. For this a practical application is required and this was not yet achievable with current quantum hardware scales. Benchmarks at the component level (individual qubits, quantum logic gates) have been developed widely and are useful for the development of the hardware. This is, however, more aimed at basic quantum research rather than application [21]. This also serves a fundamentally different goal than a performance measure of quantum computers. Many different forms of quantum hardware are being used, without a clear dominating implementation. Each of these have different dynamics and metrics, and can therefore not be generalized [97]. For this reason, making a benchmark for low-level hardware aspectswill not properly reflect its performance compared to other implementations of the quantum hardware. Furthermore, while benchmarks for single qubit operations have been developed [32, 36, 70, 102], these performances do not accurately reflect quantum operations on larger scales. Noise levels, for example, are an important metric in single-gate performance. The noise, however, varies per gate and due to qubit entanglement will propagate unpredictably throughout the system [38, 43, 97]. This makes it impossible to use single gate noise performance to extrapolate for the entire system, while for classical computers this would have been possible. These difficulties in determining the performance will require abstraction from the low level performance and an application level benchmark is needed to properly verify the performance.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model takes into account damage progression to simulate the vessel’s deformational behavior and estimate the burst pressure. The modelling strategy is highly replicable, it reduces significantly the computational time of the analysis with respect to the previous benchmark, and it is able to predict burst with reasonable accuracy both in the cylinder and in the dome region of the vessel.

However, the austenite recrystallization kinetics are difficult to investigate experimentally, due to solid-state phase transformations during cooling to room temperature. The best model alloys to examine SRX are those austenitic alloys such as, Ni-30Fe alloy, that do not experience undesirable phase transformation and that have similar stacking fault energy (SFE) as austenite in C-Mn steels. The hot-working of the Ni-30Fe alloy has been conducted at high deformation temperatures, followed by an uniaxial compression test at a low strain condition (ε = 0.2) with a strain rate of 1s<sup>-1</sup>, and an annealing temperature of 900°C (above recrystallization start temperature). Thereafter, the alloy is experimentally investigated by Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), to characterize the austenite microstructure and to measure the crystallographic orientations. The experimental measurements from the EBSD technique are subsequently analyzed using MTEX software to study the SRX phenomenon that occurs during hot rolling of steels.The technique to separate recrystallized and deformed grains in this research has adopted the Kernal Average Misorientation (KAM) and Grain Average Misorientation (GAM) technique, rather than the previously utilized Grain Oriented Spread (GOS) technique which incidentally produced slower and inaccurate recrystallization kinetics. The initial and final grain size calculations have been conducted by consideration of the annealing twins, and the reported results are in close agreement with earlier conducted work of Sellars model. The EBSD scan which captures the Geometrically Necessary Dislocations (GND) have been experimentally measured after deformation to be approximately 4.5x10<sup>14</sup>m<sup>-2</sup>, by utilizing the approach of KAM, curvature tensor and the Burgers vector with an estimated 13% error. Additionally, the effect of recovery has been captured with the continuous decrease in stored energy as a function of time, where the GND density is estimated to be 7.3x10<sup>12</sup>m<sup>-2</sup> after the annealing treatment.The GND density present in the deformed microstructure is significant to provide the net driving force necessary for nucleation, based on the validated strain-induced-boundary-migration (SIBM) mechanism. The initial nucleation site is observed at triple junctions, and the selected nucleation criterion factor for the captured GND densities, estimates the driving force for nucleation to favour single sub-grain SIBM. The minimum critical sub-grain size required for bulging is calculated to be 3.40 ± 0.44 μm after deformation, which is an increasing parameter with time, as a result of the recovery process. The number of recrystallized grains captured at different time intervals using the validated GAM technique assists in experimental nucleation rate calculations, that have been subsequently converted for a 3D microstructure, in order to compare with the nucleation framework of Rehman's model. The recrystallization nucleation process is experimentally observed to obtain peak values at 2s and continues until all the GNDs are annealed out of the specimen. There is a large discrepancy in the nucleation rate predicted by the model, which is much higher with respect to the experimental observations reported. Finally, the experimental recrystallization kinetics is observed to be in close agreement with the JMAK model during the initial phase of the annealing treatment, but deviates in the later phase of the recrystallization process.","SRX (Static Recrystallization); Recovery; Grain growth; GOS (Grain Oriented Spread); Ni-30Fe alloy; GND (Geometrically Necessary Dislocations) density; Stored energy; KAM (Kernal Average Misorientation); GAM (Grain Average Misorientation); Critical size for bulging; JMAK model; SF (Speich Fisher) equation; Recrystallization Kinetics; Nucleation; Annealing; Twins; SIBM (Strain Induced Boundary Migration) mechanism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

With foreseeable growth in CRMs demand, principles such as Circular Economy (CE) strategies are gaining attention as means to mitigate risks associated with CRMs. This study examines the effect each CE strategy has on CRMs in servers, via a case study of a Dutch telecommunications company. The study was conducted by collecting industry insights from 16 industry experts and performing a literature review.<br/><br/>Results show that out of 47 types of CRMs, at least 20 CRMs are contained in 4 sub-assemblies and 2 extension tools of a rack server. Among the sub-assemblies, the motherboard is found to contain the most diverse types of CRMs, while the HDD contains the largest amount of CRMs.<br/><br/>CE strategies were investigated in two ways, first by studying current strategies implemented by the company and its value chain partners, and by investigating advanced practices and strategies discussed in the literature. Results indicate that each CE strategy impacts the CRMs in sub-assemblies in different ways, while also having varied limitations in their potential. The result also shows that the current implementation of CE strategies does not always lead to the enhanced circularity of CRMs, as indicated in most of the CRMs being lost in current recycling practices. The degree of effect also differs depending on the strategy and sub-assembly. In the case of the motherboard, substantial potential to improve circularity was identified in the substitution method and advanced recycling strategy, with more CE strategy in need for Ba and P containing components. For HDDs, significant potential was observed in the functional substitution by SSDs and advanced HDD recycling technology. In addition, the strategies’ potential in mitigating the supply risk and environmental impact associated with CRMs was explored. While each strategy is seen to have the potential in reducing risk, its effectiveness depends on multiple factors and further case studies will be necessary to quantify it.<br/><br/>The results imply that enhancing the circularity of CRMs is a complex challenge where diverse interest from actors in the value chain is involved. For this reason, the study stresses the need for active collaboration among value chain partners and system-level support, to be able to design each CE strategy tailored for intended improvement in CRMs circularity. For the advancement of the topic, further studies are recommended, including the four goals of inventing secure ways for CRMs data sharing across the value chain, design for lifetime extension and CRMs recycling via collaboration between suppliers and downstream partners, finding economically viable business models for CRMs circularity, and assessing each CE strategy’s risk mitigation potential via specific case studies.","Circular economy (CE); Critical Raw Materials; ICT Networks; Telecommunication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

In contrast, results of TVLA with a higher statistical moment order t-test are slashed when only one trace is misaligned. We propose a novel way of performing DL-LA to remove one of the requirements of the DL-LA method of Wegener et al., namely that the attack traces need to be balanced. This DL-LA method is a multi-class leakage assessment method. It finds its similarities in the Sum-Of-Squared T-values (SOST) leakage detection method.

Renewable energy sources contribution in the energy mix is growing rapidly. However, due to their intermittent power output, they cannot ensure system security and stability, and therefore, energy storage technologies are needed. In this direction, hydrogen is an energy carrier with great potential. When produced from water electrolysis based on electricity from renewable energy sources (green hydrogen), it represents a sustainable fuel. Due to that, industry’s interest is turn on green hydrogen production, with several large scale projects announced on a daily basis. In many countries, especially in Europe, there is not enough empty land for large scale renewable energy projects, turning the interest to offshore areas. This research aims to design and analyse the economic feasibility of an offshore hydrogen production system, intending for 2030, based on offshore solar energy,<br/>located in Greece, for the production of a million tons of hydrogen per year. The<br/>produced hydrogen will be injected into the European hydrogen network. Considering the main components of an offshore solar to hydrogen system, four possible system configurations are proposed based on two parameters for comparison. The first parameter for examination is the electrolyzer type, which can be either alkaline or PEM. The second parameter is the involvement of batteries into the system. The sizing and cost details about the different systems were selected and all the configurations were modelled using Matlab and Simulink software. From the model results, the levelized cost of hydrogen<br/>for all the systems was calculated to evaluate the project. The most cost-effective<br/>configuration was the one based on alkaline electrolyzer and without the involvement of batteries. The levelized cost of hydrogen for the selected <br/> onfiguration was calculated to be 1.5 €/kg of hydrogen, making it comparable with blue hydrogen costs and with green hydrogen costs of relevant announced projects. A sensitivity analysis showed that the most influencing factor in the cost calculation is the capital expenditure of the floating photovoltaic system. More specifically, by decreasing the floating photovoltaic costs by 30%, the levelized cost of hydrogen can be reduced by 19%. Finally, in an optimistic scenario,<br/>where all influencing factors are improved by 20%, hydrogen can be produced at<br/>a cost slightly higher than 1 €/kg. Overall, it is concluded that an offshore hydrogen production system based on offshore floating solar energy, located in Greece, northern to Crete, can produce hydrogen at a competitive cost.","Green hydrogen; Offshore Hydrogen; Photovoltaic; Floating Photovoltaics; Offshore Solar Energy; energy transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","35.47, 24.78"

It has offered multiple functions to take the responsibility of being a public cultural institution for all citizens. However, in the Netherlands, libraries are losing their members, especially young adults. With the development of technology, a public library is no longer the only choice for books. Libraries are encountering a challenge to attract young people back. They need to strive for providing new kinds of public services to attract this potential new audience.<br/><br/>Westfriese Bibliotheken is one of these libraries which has 10 decentralized community libraries in 6 places in the north of the Netherlands. Westfriese Bibliotheken is facing a challenge to reach a bigger group of the generation of youngsters who think a public library is a dull place to go. To narrow down the scope, the book discovery experience for young adults between 18-25 years old was focused. Augmented reality as the technology this project worked with has been proved to benefit the library context.<br/><br/>Hence, the objective of this thesis is to explore a new book discovery experience for young adults in the public library in Stede Broec.<br/><br/>From the theoretical study (chapter 2) about the book discovery behavior, the behavior pattern was investigated and worked as the design requirements. User research (chapter 3) was conducted to understand the current book discovery experience in the context through contextmapping. It discovered users' concerns and expectations about the book discovery experience. Moreover, the opportunity of this project: designing a new book discovery experience to facilitate serendipity was concluded based on user research findings. Under the framework of the serendipity theory (chapter 4), design opportunities for facilitating serendipity in the current library were gathered. The study on augmented reality (chapter 5) helped to define design qualities and technologies that this project can make use of.<br/><br/>With the research insights, a design goal with three design qualities (fascinating, playful, and inviting) and relevant design requirements were formulated (chapter 6). They contributed as a guideline to the design solution.<br/><br/>Ideas were gathered through a creative session and based on these ideas three initial concepts were generated. Concepts were evaluated and iterated with users, clients, and fellow students. The final design outcome is a phone-based AR application with two main parts: exploring and browsing parts. It offers both basic and additional information about books to stimulate users to experience serendipity in the public library. <br/><br/>Finally, an evaluation test was conducted to validate if the final design can fulfill the design goal. The final design achieves a good usability and desirability performance evaluated by 6 participants in the library. The evaluation test demonstrated that the additional information about books and interaction between the physical and digital world can let users feel fascinated, invited, and playful during the book discovery experience.","Library; Augmented reality; Book discovery; Serendipity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

It discovers new molecules, recommends what to watch and informs many business decisions everyday. There it has also become part of hiring, where recruiters are in need of more efficiency. The digital age has caused the amount of applications per position to skyrocket, while organisations have noticed that in the last decades an increasing amount of their value generation is directly connected to their people. Vendors market AI systems as intelligent workers that can help human resources (HR) departments find the best people efficiently. Different systems help with analytics, writing, assessments or video interviews, where participants answers questions from an AI system on their computer.<br/><br/>With the implementation of AI systems, there are often ethical problems involved. Biases are often hidden in the data or algorithm, that may cause people to be unfairly treated by an AI system. But AI interviews have another ethical problem that has gotten relatively little attention: autonomy over self-representation.<br/><br/>During an interview, you always want to show your best side and focus on your strengths and best experiences. You know better than anyone else what you can do and therefore it is important that you are able to represent yourself. But AI interviews interfere with that self-representation because they make assumptions on what you mean before they present that information to a recruiter. Also, by nature AI systems can only work directly with quantitive data, so how are you sure that your meaning of ‘teamwork’ was properly processed?<br/><br/>This project uses a novel approach of Value Sensitive Design in combination with<br/>a different framework for generative prototypes to find a solution to this problem. Generative prototypes focus on generating hypotheses to further understanding. Here they were used with provocation in multiple iterations to elicit the values that people have about self-representation in hiring.<br/><br/>Those findings were synthesised into a new process that helps applicants maintain autonomy over self-representation through conveying feedback so they understand how well they are doing, through steering the interpretation of their answers and by keeping regular interviews to ensure the right nuance still arrives at the recruiter. This process was evaluated with another generative prototype, which informed the final three design requirements for AI interview systems in hiring: integrating feedback into the interview, managing expectations and assumptions and building in options for escalation.<br/><br/>In this way, the first steps are made for designing better AI systems that respect the autonomy over self-representation of applicants.","design; AI; self-representation; Value sensitive design; generative prototype; hiring; interview; design requirements; HR; Socio-technical system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Nevertheless, from the operator's point of view, hardly any insights have been provided on how the sustainability perspective aligns with industry specific corporate objectives. In order to improve the effectiveness of sustainability-driven decision-making in airlines, this study aimed to address this gap. Specifically, the goal was to view the evaluation of operational innovations as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. To that end, a case study was conducted at the low-cost arm of Europe's third largest airline group.<br/><br/>The definitions of the main criteria to support the evaluation of operational improvements in flight operations were synthesized from literature and expert opinion. Using the Best-Worst Method, inter-criteria preference data were collected from seventeen senior and executive airline managers. The data were analyzed through the aggregation of individual preferences as well as probabilistic modeling.<br/><br/>Results from both approaches showed that ""Safety"" plays by far the most important role in the evaluation of operational innovations. It is followed by the four criteria, ""Employee Experience"", ""Passenger Experience"", ""Finance"", and “Sustainability"", between which there seems to be no evident relative preference based on the aggregation of individual data. From the probabilistic approach could be concluded that Finance outranks Sustainability, which in turn outranks Employee Experience and Passenger Experience. Still, neither the aggregation of individual data, nor the probabilistic model revealed practically meaningful differences between the magnitudes of the weights assigned to the four intermediate criteria. Both approaches established however, that the criterion “On-Time Performance” is clearly the least important.<br/><br/>The results presented in this study can be interpreted three ways: i) as a high-level framework to assess the priority of sustainability relative to the five other dimensions of the firm, which can be used by airline managers to develop an effective corporate strategy for the appraisal of operational improvements in flight operations; ii) as the conceptual foundation for the quantitative comparison of a set of projects with respect to the six perspectives presented in this report; and iii) knowing the relative preference from key decision-makers can help other practitioners to improve the performance of their innovative efforts.","airline strategy; sustainability; innovation management; multi-criteria decision-making; Best-Worst Method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Moreover, a low acoustic signature can be lifesaving for a navy ship, especially during submarine on mine threats. To be able to operate as flexible as possible under these threats, a flexible propulsion plant is required. A diesel engine with a controllable pitch propeller (CPP) is contributing to this. A method to reduce the emissions and noise of such a plant is to improve the control strategy. Often this is tested with numerical models. However, frequently they contain many simplifications of reality, for example, the neglection of several hydrodynamic effects. Hardware In the Loop (HIL) takes these effects into account by replacing a software part of the model with a hardware component. In this research, the CPP is the scaled hardware part. A feasibility study is performed to determine whether a propeller open water HIL setup can be used to simulate the dynamic behaviour of the propulsion plant. Therefore, a comparison is made between full and model scale numerical simulation of a diesel engine with a CPP controlled by adaptive pitch control (APC). To reduce the pitch actuations with the APC strategy a Kalman filterwith deadband is implemented. Full-scale simulations with irregular waves demonstrated that the pitch actuations could be reduced during acceleration and at a constant speed. The validated full-scale model is Froude scaled and implemented in a model of the open water HIL setup. The results of the full and model scale simulations are very similar. Thus, the HIL setup can be used to simulate the dynamic behaviour of a propulsion plant. However, the hardware limitations such as the backlash in the CPP blades, the low sample rate of the actual pitch and the Froude dissimilarity of the acceleration of the towing tank need to be resolved to ensure the scaled simulations are representative for the actual, full scale, vessel. Due to these limitations, it is not possible to use the setup at this moment to perform experiments and improve novel control strategies. If these physical limitations of the current HIL setup are overcome, the effect of the propeller and the pitch control strategy during turns can be investigated by performing experiments with oblique inflow.","Hardware In the Loop; HIL; Adaptive Pitch Control; APC; Kalman filter; control; Dynamic behaviour; Propulsion plant; Controllable pitch propellers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","SDPO.21.026.m",""

The aim of most countries worldwide is to reduce their carbon footprint, in order to slow climate change. Fossil fuel powered energy generation is replaced with an increasing share of variable renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy. Because of the inherent uncertainty and intermittency of these renewable power sources, large scale energy storage is considered inevitable in order to mitigate the mismatch between supply and demand. However, storage comes at a cost and uses precious materials, of which there might not be sufficient. Therefore, a whole range of solutions is being researched and implemented. Currently, it is not well-known what mix of which solutions will be the most technologically and economically effective. The Low-Wind turbine is a new turbine concept, specifically designed for low wind speed conditions, combined with a low rated and cut-out wind speed. The reduced normative loads on the blades enable a re-design of several components, which ultimately results in lower costs. This new turbine concept aims to be a system-friendly turbine, by decreasing the mismatch between production and demand and thereby reducing the total amount of storage or overplanting required in the system. This research assesses the effectiveness of the Low-Wind turbine in the Dutch energy grid, when it is predominantly powered by renewable energy sources. A power model, specifically developed for this research, simulates the power flows and optimises the seasonal storage required in order to meet the constraints. The power model is simulated for a range of installed turbines, consisting of combinations of conventional and Low-Wind turbines. This research also carries out a preliminary design off a Low-Wind turbine, based of a reference turbine, in order to determine its costs. The result of this study show that, if the cost of the installed wind farms dominate the costs, Low-Wind turbines does not provide a cost-effective solution to minimising system costs. However, the results also show that, in a situation where total costs are dominated by storage cost, the Low-Wind turbine can provide a cost-effective alternative to conventional turbines. The results also show that, for high overplanting factors, Low-Wind turbines and conventional turbines provide a similar effect on the reduction of system costs, but at lower costs.","Wind Turbine; Low-Wind Turbines; Cost analysis; Optimisation; Storage; Wind turbine design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

However, present-day societal and environmental challenges concerns are barriers to economic development. Mission-Oriented Innovation Policies are a powerful tool that acknowledges the importance of addressing these societal problems and drives innovative transformation associated with technological breakthroughs across socio-technical systems. <br/><br/>In reality, innovation finds its true purpose in the hands of consumers, and the relationship between consumers and missions is crucial for the longevity contribution to the success of the innovation. However, the existence of policies in the system does not ensure public demand, although it claims to tackle the challenge. The root cause and the factors causing demand articulation failure in transitions is unknown. Although Mission-Oriented Innovation Policies are deployed in the EU to reach sustainable development goals, there is often a lack of demand for innovation to achieve economic growth and address societal challenges. <br/><br/>The concept of demand articulation emphasized the need to investigate the barriers to consumption, as the ideas of consumption and demand are linked. This study aims to address factors that impede consumption to understand demand articulation failure. The research is based on exploratory methodology and is designed to add relevance to the MIP by diving into the case of the Dutch fashion industry and drawing insights from the case. <br/><br/>Prior research under-addresses consumption aspects in the fashion industry. Also, Circular Economy literature mainly focuses on the production side, exploring business models but does not pay attention to the consumer impact or consumption. Lack of consumption of circular products and services has been a hindering factor for circular business models. Fashion consumption is inherently socially significant in our consumer society and should be considered vital to the sustainable consumption discussion. The present study explores the impeding factors by analyzing the micro-level consumption that individuals encounter, as no previous study in the context of transitions has been done. <br/><br/>This study uses a qualitative approach to understand the complex problem of sustainability in the fashion industry. The main research findings included diverse methods for a consumer to contribute to circularity in the fashion industry. Also, there is not an integrated experience that supports the consumer to act circularly. Moreover, the influence of the identified factors varies depending on the consumption method. To obtain a generalized view, the identified consumption methods were associated with the 9-R framework of circularity. Finally, implications have been provided to fashion companies and policymakers based on the findings.<br/><br/>The research findings conclude that there are diverse methods through which a consumer can contribute towards circularity in the fashion industry. However, there is not an integrated experience that supports the consumer to act circularly. The consumer contribution methods included donating, sharing, consuming sustainable clothing, Vintage clothing, rental clothing, second-hand clothing, recyclable/ recycled clothing.<br/><br/>The researcher developed an understanding that circular fashion cannot be considered holistic as it consists of multiple variables that could vary based on the consumption method. Hence, to obtain a more generalized view, the consumption methods were associated with the 9R framework of strategies. This included Sharing and donating, Reducing consumption and consuming sustainable fashion, Vintage, Rental and second-hand clothing, Upcycling, Recyclable/ Recycled Clothing. It was evident that the influence of certain factors can be generalized; however, some factors have a varied influence according to the choice of the consumption methods. For instance, some factors followed a general trend, namely, price, income, awareness and knowledge, availability, culture, and transparency. Other factors whose influence depended on the consumption method included age, product attributes, gender, hygiene, the company's marketing power, brand loyalty, and ease of recycling.<br/><br/><br/>Circular fashion consumption methods are so diverse that it is impossible to generalize the influence of the identified factors. Hence, for future research, the researcher should focus on a single R strategy and focus on the consumption methods. By focusing on a single R strategy or a particular consumption method, an in-depth analysis could be done to understand the barriers that obstruct consumption with the respective R strategy. Finally, implications have been provided to the policymakers and the companies trying to transition towards circularity for increasing consumption. <br/><br/>Moreover, the thesis aims to contribute to the stock of knowledge on Mission-oriented Innovation Policies (MIP) as it although aims to address societal challenges but often ignores the cause of demand-articulation failure. Through this research, consumer behaviour has been analyzed so that demand failure could be addressed. This is done by linking MIP literature with consumer behaviour and adoption literature. This research aims to add relevance by identifying the micro-factors (individual-level) that impede consumption in the transition in the presence of Mission-Oriented innovation policies. The factors impeding consumption would further address the demand articulation failure. The insights through the case study regarding the potential barriers would contribute to a better understanding of market creation. <br","Mission-Oriented Innovation; mission; demand articulation; consumption; Circular economy; fashion industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-24","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

These next-generation WTGs create problems for the carrying capacity of current-day installation jack-up vessels that work according to the conventional installation method (shuttling). These installation vessels can carry less or even nil of these WTGs per trip compared to the current-day WTGs. Fewer turbines per trip would allow the larger current-day installation vessels to maintain their work. However, they have more sailing time since more trips are required. This could also be more inefficient since the Offshore Wind Farms are moving further offshore. The other option within the conventional method is to build larger installation vessels that would carry more WTGs per trip.<br/><br/>Another installation method in the literature called feedering is a potential substitute for the conventional method. Very limited research has been done for feedering as well the practical implementation whereas the conventional method has extensive research and is mostly used in practice. The models in the literature compared two different feeder methods, called, the base port feeder and feeder-ship method, to the conventional method. The models are generic and lack different strategies to find the best feeder solution. The feeder-ship method has the most potential to solve the aforementioned problems and is therefore further investigated to find the best installation strategy, being either the conventional or feeder method.<br/><br/>First of all, the feeder-ship method is evaluated based on practical knowledge and adapted so a base port is used to temporarily store all components that come from the production port. The feeder sails back and forth between the base port and the installation site to supply the installation vessel with WTG components. The installation vessel will stay at the installation site to be as efficient as possible (the least amount of sailing time). This research only looks at the feeder and installation side and leaves the port elements out of the problem. Feeder strategies (within this method) differ in the number of feeder vessels/types and transfer options using either barges or Platform Support Vessels and being indirect (transfer components onto the installation vessel) or direct (install components from the feeder). The installation vessel for feedering is also looked into as being either a current-day or a special feeder purpose installation vessel. Different carrying capacities of the installation vessels are used to create different strategies for the conventional method.<br/><br/>A stochastic Discrete Event Simulation model is created and used in this research to evaluate the strategies. The output of the DES simulation is the project duration per sailing distance and strategy. The costs for this duration is calculated in a costs model from the perspective of the contractor as well as the developer. Besides duration and costs (based on the European market), the strategies are also evaluated on emissions (fuel consumption) since this is an increasingly important element in the industry. A sensitivity analysis has been performed to get a better understanding of which critical parameters the feeder strategies are most sensitive to. The analysis is also used to find the best next-generation WTG installation strategy in Europe which is the main focus of this thesis. <br","Wind Turbine Generator; Offshore Wind; Installation Vessel; Feeder Vessel; Installation Strategy; Discrete Event Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

However, in many countries, the drinking water temperature has not been taken seriously and was excluded from water quality standards. For example, in the Netherlands, the temperature of drinking water should not exceed 25℃ at customers’ taps, which is an advanced guide for ensuring water safety. Moreover, with the tendency of global warming, the drinking water temperature in the distribution system will become higher and higher without sufficient attention and practical solutions. Therefore, understanding the mechanism and cause of water temperature fluctuation is instrumental in finding appropriate measures to cope with it and improve the drinking water quality. <br/><br/>This thesis provides relatively comprehensive and overall ideas to research drinking water temperature. The objective of this thesis consists of three parts: i) Determining impact factors on water temperature; ii) Simulating water temperature in the distribution system; iii) Choosing measures to control water temperature. Firstly, data measurement and analytical methods were applied to determine impact factors on water temperature, and the influence level of each impact factor had been identified. Subsequently, implementing these impact factors to calibrate the water temperature simulation model to verify the model’s feasibility. Finally, the performance on reducing water temperature of three measures, porous asphalt, pervious interlocking concrete pavement, and grass cover, were compared to determine the most effective measure from the standpoint of pipe cover. The results show as following: i) Four impact factors are summarized as surface cover material, district heating pipe, shade effect and groundwater level based on the collected data; ii) It is feasible to simulate the water temperature in the water distribution system. For the model of city Almere, around 88% of simulation values had a difference smaller than 1℃ compared with measurement data; iii) Grass cover has a better performance than the porous asphalt and pervious interlocking cement pavement. Additionally, this thesis discusses limitations during the measurement and simulation process and more relative interventions to reduce water temperature. <br/><br/>In summary, this thesis further summarizes the various impact factors that affect the drinking water temperature and the measure to control drinking water temperature has launched from the point of pipe cover compared with previous references. These results provide guiding advice on the engineering projects of constructing and renovating drinking water distribution systems considering water temperature.","Water quality; Drinking water temperature; Soil temperature; Drinking water distribution system; Pipe cover; Heat transfer; Simulation model; Measures; Interventions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","","","","Water Management | Sanitary Engineering","",""

While deformation phenomena occur in a three-dimensional (3D) world, one of the limitations of the InSAR phase observations is that they are only sensitive to the projection of the 3D displacement vector onto the radar line-of-sight (LoS) direction. To uniquely estimate the three displacement components, we would require at least three sets of spatiotemporally coinciding independent (STCI) LoS observations, (i.e., scatterers on an object that is not subject to internal deformations, observed at the same time) available over the same Region of Uniform Motion (RUM). More importantly, the system of equations needs to have a full rank coefficient matrix. Unfortunately, in most practical situations at most two sets of STCI LoS observations are available, resulting in an underdetermined system with an infinite amount of possible solutions. <br/><br/>Within the InSAR literature we encounter different approaches to address the underdeterminancy problem, unfortunately often with either mathematical or semantic flaws. We concluded that the InSAR community has no uniform way of addressing the underdeterminancy problem. We developed a taxonomy for the different fallacious approaches that can help by evaluating InSAR results and reviewing InSAR papers. <br/><br/>Moreover, using the east-north-up (ENU) reference frame for decomposing the LoS observations provides results that are not tuned to the needs of the end-user of an InSAR product. Therefore, we developed an alternative solution to the underdetermined problem, in the form of a `strap-down' approach, which uses a local strap-down reference system that is fixed to the deformation phenomenon with transversal, longitudinal, and normal (TLN) components. For many practical cases, such as line-infrastructure, landslides, or subsidence bowls, analysis of the main driving forces supports the assumption that significant deformations in the longitudinal direction are unlikely.<br/><br/>We found that using the strap-down approach gives physically more relevant estimates. Moreover, it results in more relevant estimates since it properly includes all uncertainties. We can further conclude that the conventional way of communicating (PS)-InSAR results by means of a `dot distribution map' is sub-optimal when considering the quality of the estimates. For many cases, `vector arrow maps', or traditional geodetic vector-based visualizations, including error ellipses are a viable and more optimal alternative.<br/><br","InSAR; surface displacements; line-of-sight; decomposition; strap-down approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

An instance segmentation based on two-stage neural architecture is used for this purpose, which is hard to operate in real-time navigation.

Hence, all the features corresponding to the predicted dynamic class are removed even when the objects remain stationary, affecting the quality of SLAM performance. A two-stream encoder-decoder architecture is developed to segment the moving masks using RGB and optical flow input, improving feature tracking without affecting robustness.

A wind farm of finite span-wise length, consisting of 25 NREL 15MW wind turbines laid out in (5 X 5 Aligned manner) is considered. In order to achieve the same, two customized open source CFD RANS solvers are used, based on the OpenFOAM and SOWFA environments.<br/><br/> The study primarily focuses on the impact of thermal stratification in the Free Atmosphere, the strength of the capping inversion and height of the same on the characteristics of the AGWs excited. Further, the work also evaluates the impact of the excited AGWs on the wind farm in the form of velocity deficits at each individual turbine column and also power down the analysis.<br/><br/>The study finds that for a higher capping inversion strength, the AGWs excited by the wind farms are trapped and propagate horizontally along the capping inversion along with its vertically propagating counterpart. These cause velocity fluctuations at the hub height of the turbine, which results in AGW induced wind farm blockage that lowers the amount of incoming kinetic energy at the first turbine row and an increased velocity at the last two rows. Furthermore, the trapped AGWs cause the collective wake of the wind farm to recover faster. Moreover, the study proves that the height of the capping inversion determines the extent of AGW excitation by the wind farm. It was found lower capping inversion heights led to a higher AGW excitation and higher AGW induced flow blockage and wake recovery. Lastly, the study also finds that the thermal stratification in the Free Atmosphere determines the vertical wavelength of the AGWs propagating in the free atmosphere. Furthermore, the study also reports that for a higher Free Atmosphere stratification, a lower AGW induced blockage is observed.","RANS turbulence modelling; Atmospheric Gravity Waves; Free Atmosphere Lapse Rate; Capping Inversion Strength; Capping Inversion Height; wind farm blockage; wake recovery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The income has increased a lot during the past 40 years, especially in metropolis like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. These cities have attracted a lot of investment, providing a large amount of job opportunities, so the population of these cities expands rapidly as well as the scale of the cities. The number of civil automobile in 2019 is almost 5 times of that in 2000 and the travel distance is almost 3 times of that in 2000. Therefore, traffic congestion has become more and more serious in recent years. It takes more than twice as much time to travel during rush hours. The research object is to find out measures to control traffic congestion in Chinese cities.<br/>In this paper, system dynamic is applied to study the transportation system which is also known as the policy laboratory. According to system dynamics, it is important to understand that the system is dynamic and the change of one variable can influence the performance of the whole system. In this research, system dynamics is used to establish a simplified model to reflect the real transportation system. By adjusting the values of the variables, the effect of different policies can be simulated, and the efficiency of the policy can be evaluated.<br/>Firstly, this paper analyzes the traffic development process at home and abroad, summarizes the development characteristics of each stage, and summarizes different measures of congestion control. Secondly, the paper analyzes the traffic operation characteristics of Chinese cities and the causes of road network congestion. Traffic congestion in China mainly includes external factors and internal factors. The external factors refer to the growth of traffic demand caused by economic development, population growth and urban expansion. The internal factors refer to the poor management of the transportation system. Thirdly, based on the causality relationship between different factors, the system dynamic model with virous policies is established. Due to the fact that most of the developed cities located in the southeast China and Shanghai is the largest city in the south, it is selected to be the example of this research. In the end, specific measures are put forward based on the simulation result of the model.","traffic congestion; system dynamic; congestion control policy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy often occurs in these tumours due to hypoxia, which can be caused by different oxygenation parameters. Multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are able to assess these oxygenation parameters. Since multiple artificial intelligence (AI) approaches exist to fuse these oxygenation images together, the goal of this research is to find and implement an AI approach to generate a combined representation of multiple oxygenation parameters acquired by MRI so hypoxia within brain tumours can be detected and located.<br/>Literature study: Multiple MR imaging techniques that are able to measure different oxygenation parameters have been reviewed in the literature study. In addition, an overview was given of different AI approaches for combining the acquired information of the discussed MR imaging techniques. Based on the literature findings, hierarchical clustering was the most promising AI approach for this research purpose.<br/>Methods: A specific MR imaging protocol was designed to assess information regarding tumour oxygenation within patients with brain tumours. After registration of the acquired images to the same space, the voxels of healthy brain tissues in these images were used for performing hierarchical clustering multiple times to identify the optimal parameter settings of the algorithm. Then the clustering was performed multiple times with different data types in order to achieve a decrease of required computational power. After segmentation of the tumour area in the MR images, the clustering was applied to the tumour voxels to generate a spatial map of the tumour showing the location of the clusters representing different states of oxygenation. Evaluation of the clusters was performed by visualizing the distribution of the oxygenation parameter values within the different clusters.<br/>Results: Three patients were included and underwent MR imaging. Results showed that ward linkage and Euclidean distance resulted in the highest clustering performance when performing hierarchical clustering on data of healthy brain tissue. Changing the data type of input data did not lead to a decrease in required computational power. Applying the hierarchical clustering with the optimal parameter settings on tumour voxels resulted in spatial maps of the different clusters within the tumour. Evaluation of the distribution of the oxygenation parameter values showed differences among different clusters within the patients.

Visualizing these different clusters in a spatial map results in a combined representation of these oxygenation parameters.

This method can be applied to non­uniform meshes, but is restricted to right­triangular meshes. Using this approach, a system of Galerkin equations is created and solved iteratively with the use of the Generalised Residual Method (GMRES). Operator preconditioners and preconditioners originating from domain decomposition methods are summarised and implemented for a two dimensional Dirichlet problem. In the case of operator preconditioning, a diagonal duality pairing proposed by Stevenson and van Venetië [23] is used in the implementations. The Restricted Additive Schwarz method is considered as both a preconditioner and a basic iterative method. The Calderón preconditioner, an operator preconditioner, is used to test the efficiency of parallel preconditioned GMRES implementations, as this preconditioner provides a dense matrix. For different amount of processes, the parallel GMRES implementations are investigated. Using row­wise decomposition, parallel GMRES becomes increasingly time­efficient, as the level of refinement increases.

The first part is to estimate the total number of infected people as a function of time by combining data from hospital admissions, daily reported cases and serological data. Using these data sets, we found that our estimation for the number of infected people was comparable to the estimations provided by the RIVM and Sanquin. Furthermore, we found that on average only 39.3% of the total number of cases were detected. 1.2% of the total number of infected people is admitted to the hospital and 18.6% of the hospitalized patients is admitted to the ICU. The second part is to develop a representative model that reproduces the estimated total number of infections using a modified SEIR model. These modifications include modelling the infection rate β(t) as a function of time using a simple linear ODE, a system of ODEs inspired by the Lotka-Volterra equations, the implementation of gamma distributed exposed and infected stages and lastly the incorporation of spatial heterogeneity. We found that our Lotka-Volterra inspired model was able to model multiple consecutive waves, which differs from the standard compartmental models. The other modifications however seemed to have only minor effects on the model and had some difficulties with matching historical data. We conclude that our Lotka-Volterra inspired model should be used to model consecutive waves for a longer period of time. The other modifications can be used to optimize the model.","COVID-19; SEIR model; Lotka-Volterra model; gamma distribution; infectious time period; incubation time period; spatial heterogeneity; number of infected people","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","There has been an increasing interest in moving computation closer to storage in recent years due to significant improvements in memory technology. FPGAs were proven to be an exciting candidate for accelerating database workloads since they provide an energy-efficient, reconfigurable and high-performance computation platform. Therefore, FPGAs are widely used as attached accelerators on data-centric applications.<br/><br/>Database operations usually run on large volumes of data, which creates an I/O bottleneck when processing them on CPUs. Therefore, recently, researchers have been investigating query pushdown techniques during a database load operation. A well-known columnar storage format, Apache Parquet, provides an efficient way to store a database. In addition, current big data processing engines provide functionalities for pushing filter operation down to the parquet reading stage.<br/><br/>This study explores the boundaries of pushing down analytic queries to the parquet reader stage by using FPGAs. An extended roofline analysis is performed on a proof-of-concept hardware design. The analysis shows that peak performance is achieved via a storage-attached accelerator once a high bandwidth interface is introduced. Furthermore, using multiple FPGAs with flash storage while interfacing them with OpenCAPI or PCI switch enables higher performance for aggregation since aggregation is shown to be I/O bound. <br/><br/>The thesis introduces Apache Spark integration of the proof-of-concept query pushdown for parquet reading operations. Apache Spark implements several layers of parallelism to achieve higher speed-ups. However, the concurrency and parallelism for a single FPGA instance for multi-threaded Apache Spark applications requires synchronization on a constrained resource represented by a single FPGA. Therefore, this work suggests a way to achieve synchronization with a single FPGA instance. <br/><br/>The present work shows that for a single Spark thread, a maximum end-to-end application speed-up of 3.88x and a kernel speed-up of 7.24x are achieved. As a result, the throughput of TPC-H Query 6 can be increased up to 3.8 GB/s. Furthermore, FPGA can perform better than CPU until Spark is configured to run on 7 CPU threads. Then, for the scaled-up multi-threaded Spark application with six CPU threads, the FPGA can achieve 1.13x end-to-end application speed-up and a kernel speed-up of 13.19x.","FPGA; Heterogeneous Computing; Hardware Accelerator; Apache Spark; Fletcher; Predicate Pushdown","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The instability of a moving mass / oscillator due to surpassing the velocity of the minimum group wave velocity (in a continuous homogeneous structure) has been studied extensively and is well understood. In contrary to that, Parametric Instability of a moving mass / oscillator on a continuous periodic structure has been studied less extensive and therefore the mechanism behind the instability is unknown. Literature that is avaiable on this topic mainly focuses on continuous periodic inhomogeneous structures, namely where the foundation is modeled as a continuous periodic inhomogeneous structure. Even less well studied are models where instead of a continuous periodic inhomogeneous foundation discrete periodic supports have been used. So far as known to the author there has also been no studies where the discrete supports are coupled through a medium. In order to solve the transition curves discerning the stable and unstable domains concerning the parametric instability of a moving mass / oscillator the analogy with the Mathieu equation is used, which tells us that the solution on those transition curves will be periodic with once or twice the period of the parametric excitation. In this thesis we have focussed on studying the use of the analogy on continuous structures founded upon periodic supports. <br/><br/>The Mathieu equation describes the motion of a parametric oscillator, for example a pendulum with a length that periodically varies over time. The theory that predicts the solution to the Mathieu equation is called Floquet theory and ascociated with the solution are the Floquet exponents, these exponents dictate whether the solution will be periodic and bounded or unbounded. By solving for the Floquet exponents of the Mathieu one sees that for an increase of the amplitude of the parametric excitation the system will experience a greater exponential growth. For a greater mistuning between the parametric excitation and the natural frequency of the equivalent non-parametrically forced equation we see that the system will experience a smaller exponential growth. Outside the instability domains the solutions will be bounded and periodic and contain a wide variety of frequencies. When damping is introduced, the value of the damping coefficient (if written in the canonical form of a viscously damped single degree of freedom equation) will be subtracted from the value of the undamped Floquet exponents and by that result in an upward shift and narrowing of the transition curves. Furthermore, outside the instability domains we will see two regions: the first lies close the the transition curves and is asymptotically stable with a period equal to that of the transition curve, the second covers the remaining stable region and is asymptotically stable and periodic with a wide variety of frequencies.<br/><br/>Regarding the Parametric Instability of a moving mass / oscillator we have studied three different models: a continuous Euler-Bernoulli beam on periodic spring supports, a continuous Euler-Bernoulli beam on periodic supports that are complex (i.e. modeled as an oscillator between two springs), and a continuous Euler-Bernoulli beam on periodic supports that are founded upon a 2-dimensional lattice. Of these models we have conducted a parametric study as to study what the effects are of the various parameters. We have seen that whenever the ratio between the stiffness of the supports and that of the beam is increased, the instability domains will shift to higher velocities and become wider. For certain combinations also 'islands' of instability may appear, where these 'islands' indicate stable areas between regions of instability. If damping is introduced into the system, this will generally narrow the instability domains and shift them to higher values of the mass and lower values of the velocity. However, for certain parameter combinations adding damping will lead to a widening of the instability domain. In the case of a moving oscillator the instability domains will narrow and be shifted to lower values. If the support is modeled with a mass it will affect the general trend of the transition curves through its own resonance, hence for a complex structure it is advised to model the supports with the correct dynamic equations. Last but not least, if the supports are coupled through a medium (a 2-dimensional lattice in this case) one will generally see a similar effect as adding damping has. <br/><br/>In this thesis we have also studied three real world cases: a regular railway track, a high-speed railway slab-track, and the Hyperloop. In the first case we have seen that Parametric Instability will most likely have no influence. For the slab-track, being much more stiff, Parametric Instability will be important. However, a more extensive study with several cases must confirm this. In the last case, namely the Hyperloop, we have seen that for a moving mass the instability domains are relatively large as compared with the other cases. We have also studied the Parametric Instability of a test-pod, which showed that its instability domains that are negligible. Of course, this was merely a test-pod not capable of transporting people, hence when a larger pod is studied it may be expected that the instability domains may not be neglected.","parametric instability; moving loads; Mathieu equation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Pellegrini, Paola (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Among the many cities that lost their status of capital with the Italian unification, Naples is the one that struggled the most to reconcile with its past. With the cholera outbreak of 1874 the criticalities of centuries of uncontrolled urban development under foreign kings rose to the fore of the public opinion of the Kingdom of Italy. Yet, for the following decades until nowadays, institutions and politicians failed in providing an integrated vision for the city that could give it a new inclusive identity. Instead, lack of dialogue, path dependency among stakeholders and scarce involvement of communities served the interests of a weak entrepreneurial class and extremized the social problems of the old capital.<br/> King Ferdinando II and Francesco II of Bourbon, the last royals of Naples, saw in the geographical position of the South of Italy the protection of their power: as they liked to say, the peninsula was confining with the salty water of the Mediterranean Sea toward south and the Holy water of the Vatican state up north (Astarita, 2006). This image not only reflected the attitude of the monarchs in international affairs, but it also reveals the two major constraints that have hampered the Neapolitan urban development: a problematic relationship with the sea and the unwillingness to open to a diverse liberal society. <br/>What had grown in between these two limits, was what Walter Benjamin and Asja Lacis would have referred to as the Porous city (Benjamin, Lacis, 1925). When the two visited Naples in 1925 found an obstinately antimodern city where the people had the same consistence of the stone that constituted its walls and that, in its rejection of dichotomies, was a distant alternative to the rational northern European cities which the authors were so used to. According to their description, the urban environment of the Parthenopean city was extremely promiscuous: families from different social extractions used to share the same ancient buildings and attend the same squares, where a crowded market poured into the street in a continuous swarm of praises and trades, that could only be broken open by the sudden passage of a religious procession. <br/>Since then, this image lived a life of its own, having a profound impact on the imaginary of urbanists and planners across the world and reoccurring in different forms in the speeches and texts of researchers over the last seventy years. Most notably, the Italian duo Bernardo Secchi and Paola Viganò reinterpreted this concept in their work for the city of Antwerp in 2009 (Secchi, Viganò, 2009). The two urbanists, in fact, would later explain how the theme of porosity does not only concern the material quality of the buildings but rather more the different ways through which different city users appropriate the space. As such, porosity allows for diversity in the urban environment maximizing social and economic interaction (Tallen, 2008), thus enabling kinship network, the system of formal and informal relationships that make up a community to be active and thriving.<br/>But what is left of the porosity of Naples? Since the end of the XIX century, having by then lost the role of capital, the city had to go under a much-needed process of reinvention and even if originally Naples had to be a maritime city, the foreign rulers, especially during the two centuries before the Italian unification, never developed the full potentiality of the port (Di Mauro, 2006). Under the new regime instead, the Neapolitan elite class rediscovered the sea in its potential for the industrial development. Following logic of economic efficiency and rationality led to new patterns of expansion and consumption of land (Ascher, 2001) and the insalubrious territories, once considered the limit to urban expansion, became the desirable location for the new Industrial city. The old walls of the city where gradually demolished and the city began its expansion towards east in the Borgo Loreto, the marshy delta of the Sebeto river and the, at the time separate, town of San Giovanni a Teduccio. These Bad lands (Secchi, 2006) were necessary for the current socio-economical functioning of the city, not only, because they hosted the construction of warehouses and fabrics, but especially, because they accommodated the rural immigrants that would have constituted the human capital of the new economy. For many, these transitional cities have been constituting the access to the urban social network and economy and they retained this function even when the deindustrialization took over the initial motivation of their existence. The lack of access to facilities, poor housing conditions, low property value and population decline transformed these lands into enclaves for the low-income classes and those who are excluded by the society (Grahame Shane, 2005). Conversely, the Neapolitan upper and middle classes steadily fled the historical centre to pursue a new lifestyle on the hills up west and restructured the city to serve their interests. Nowadays Naples has partially lost its porosity and presents many visible and invisible barriers, whether are they segregating infrastructures, low quality urban and housing environment, monofunctional districts, differences in the social status and political representation. <br/>Since the 70s attempt to convert the city’s economy to the tertiary sector, Naples’ development has been driven by the alleged will of answering to the many crises of the city without ultimately being successful (Galasso, 1987). This is, in some measure, due to the fact that the city’s institutions are still partially tied to their conception of the “Holy water” that manifests itself in a in a scarce attitude towards change that results in institutional inertia (De Martino, 2020). Emblematic in these regards are the not fulfilled promises of the at the time just elected new mayor of the city Luigi de Magistris toward the Islamic community in Eastern Naples. This rapidly growing community had been promised in 2011 the construction of the first Mosque of city and an Islamic cemetery. Only after 10 years, at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, in August 2020, the municipality granted the concession for the use of a land to bury the dead (il Mattino, 2020). <br/>The genealogy of the Eastern Naples returns the image of a bad land that has never been given the proper tools for development and whose communities have never been involved in the decision making. Nowadays as then, it is a Purgatory, a city of perennial transition, of goods and people: the established Neapolitan population that aspires to move to other parts of the city or the immigrants arriving from overseas.<br/>In this work, I explore how can the study of the porosity of the urban environment set the bases for a community-based design approach. After having delved into the study of the context of the East Coast of Naples, I focus on the Case Nuove and Mercato del Ferro areas, the first districts to be built outside the former walls of the city in the old Borgo Loreto, and their relationship with the Mercato, the historical neighbourhood grown behind the city walls. The two are institutionally one administrative entity and share an increasing lack of porosity that manifests itself in visible and invisible barriers, problematic social issues, and low quality of the urban environment. Taking this case as example, I will define a design process and stakeholders engagement strategy through which to answer the question: Through what means can Eastern Naples provide a spatially just alternative for its citizens?<br/><br","Naples; Porosity; Socio-spatial segregation; Spatial Justice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Master in Urbanism (EMU)","",""

In part of facilitate the development, the national government has actively adopted the form of apartment under supportive national policies and planning instruments. The mass production in large quantities of apartment complexes has rested on the conviction that it would be an effective device to deal with ultra-dense environment in Seoul where the skyrocketing population growth has challenged the demand of adequate living space (Kim, 2018).<br/>It is true that densification is one of the core in contemporary society, giving essence in urbanity. It has been always the intriguing topic in urbanism which dominates and imposes the prevailing theories and manifests at that ages. Yet, what constituted the density in apartment complexes in Seoul is the logic of capitalism, where the quantity of floor area of verticality decides everything in speculating the gainable maximum profits. Importantly, the challenges inherent in apartment lie at its scale of complex (block), not at the building itself, as Grands Ensemble, where the characteristics of enlargement and internalization execute the exclusivity and polarization between spaces. While the more than half of Seoul’s citizens are living in apartments, the ongoing phenomenon of producing apartment complex would continue to proliferate, as the desire to live in luxurious and enclosed community will not disappear. <br/>This graduation project aims to explore the new role of apartment complexes in relation to urban fabric, and to open the discussion for envisioning integrated and dynamic living environment. Therefore, it seeks the new definition of ‘Apartment Urbanism’ in Seoul, where the density is represented not only by form, but also by its function and overarching relationships that operate simultaneously. Borrowing the lens of ‘depth structure’, the orienting concept in implementing design strategies as territorial, scalable and institutional depths, this project argues that the despite the rationale in area-based approach characterized by rigid zoning system, the relation-based approach using patterns delivers the possibility to embrace all interacting and conflicting forces as a cohesive language. Conditioned at different settings of private and public properties, it proposes a model that is more adjustable to the context and adaptive to process, ultimately shaping the synergetic relationship between spaces and people.","Apartment Urbanism; depth structure; pattern language; generative interface; synergetic co-presence; Seoul","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Master in Urbanism (EMU)","","37.532600, 127.024612"

Furthermore, the manufacturing process resin transfer moulding, but also potential test setups were researched. Apart from toughening the matrix, the interface between the carbon fibre body and a thin steel sheet attached on top of the specimen was researched as well. For that, different interface materials such as short fibre veils, weaves and polymeric materials were reviewed. Based on the literature review a hypothesis was defined. Increasing additive concentrations, which were core-shell rubber particles and silica nanoparticles in particular, should yield an increasing impact performance.

It is made out of silicone with embedded magnetic particles that lay in magnetization patterns due to 3D printing them under a magnetic field. Its characteristics are fast, remotely controlled, reversible and heatless shape transformations. Because the material is new, not much is known about the parameters, how they are made or how they influence the performance of the material. The number of possible applications for this material is also very limited. This graduation project has addressed both these topics by using factorial designed experiments to understand different parameters of the magnetic soft material ink as well as starting the setup of the 4D printer system with which the material can be fabricated. <br/><br/>A design process was also done in which new idea directions have been identified. These were haptics, personalized fits, texture change, replacement of vulnerable mechanical parts, milli devices and scaffolding, and toys. A concept for a demonstrator was made to explain the material to designers and researchers and inspire them. It was a cleaning tool for hard to enter spaces. In the ink development, the influence of different ingredients was discovered as well as how they influence the viscosity of the ink, which is an important factor for the 3D printer system. The viscosity of the last measured ink, which was magnetized, was 500% higher than the viscosity limit of the 3D printer system. The 3D printer system should therefore be reconsidered for a new research project. In the end, also a proof of principle was made which showed the feasibility that magnetic soft material can be made. <br/><br/>This graduation project is the starting point of magnetic soft material at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering. Even though the first parameters have been researched, much work remains to be done to fully understand magnetic soft materials.","Magnetic Soft Materials; shape morphing; Magnetic field orientation; Composite Material","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In the upcoming decades, the Netherlands is going to face challenges regarding the protection against flooding. The reason for this is the expected rapid change in climate around the world. As a result of the changing climate, the sea levels rise and the peak river discharges increase. These changes lead to higher water levels in the Dutch rivers. To deal with this increase, the current flood defence system has to be improved. A new method for Southwest Delta of the Netherlands is the Delta21 concept.  <br/>The focus of the Delta21 concept is on the Southwest Delta, the region around Rotterdam and the Haringvliet. The idea is to create a lake, the Energy Storage Lake, next to Maasvlakte II in the North Sea. During high discharge conditions in the rivers of the Southwest Delta, the Rhine and the Meuse, the lake can be used to store excess river water. From the Energy Storage Lake, the water can be pumped into the sea. In combination with a closed storm surge barrier next to the Energy Storage Lake, the water level in the rivers upstream of the lake can be lowered. To achieve the lowering of the water levels in the upstream rivers, a spillway is required to let the water flow into the Energy Storage Lake.  <br/>This thesis aims to come up with a conceptual design for the spillway discharging the water from the Tidal Lake towards the Energy Storage Lake. This design must fulfil the functional and structural requirements, must be affordable, constructible and must fit within the ideology of Delta21. To achieve this, the hydraulic engineering design method is used. The first step in this method is to analyse the problem, in which climate change plays a vital role. In the second step, the basis of design is elaborated, including the boundary conditions and the requirements. The main requirements for the spillway are the discharge capacity of 20 000 m3/s and that the water level near Dordrecht may not exceed NAP + 2.5 m.<br/>In the third step, the location of the spillway is first decided upon. After this, four different concepts are generated that differ in, among other things, the type of flow and the way the structure is part of the surrounding flood defence structures. The different concepts are concept Siphon, concept Underflow, concept Caisson and concept Ogee.<br/>The fourth step is the verification of the concepts. The concepts are verified on the functional requirements and the stability requirements. This results in the main dimensions of the concepts. After this step, the concept Ogee is rejected due to stability issues and a large flow velocity at the end of the spillway.<br/>In the next step, the remaining three concepts are evaluated by a multi criteria-analysis and a cost estimation. This evaluation shows that the best concept is the concept Caisson. After the selection of the best concept, the strength verification is performed for this concept and the scour protection is designed. <br","DELTA21; Haringvliet; Design; Spillway","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","DELTA21","51.890743, 3.953119"

(mentor); Mehta, M.K. (mentor); Palensky, P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Renewable energy sources have become a cost-competitive and green option for supplying power to the grid in recent years. Nonetheless, their variable nature poses a problem to the regular operation of the electrical grid by introducing severe fluctuations of large magnitudes and/or short-duration known as ramps. There is a lack of research in the literature on characterizing ramp events induced by wind-based hybrid power plants. The main research question of this study is how to characterize the ramping behaviour of wind-based hybrid power plants and what impact they have on the system. The application of the different methods to detect and assess the implications of ramps were presented in this thesis using wind and solar power based on the reference location.<br/><br/>Due to dependence on threshold values that vary across the literature and the limitations associated with calculating thresholds as a percentage of installed capacity, it was demonstrated that binary ramp definitions are not ideal and result in under-reporting. On the other hand, the wavelet approach extracts ramp events from the generation using statistically determined threshold values. As a result, the problem of under-detection of ramp events is mitigated. The proposed approach of ""significant ramps"" allows the evaluation of which ramp events are important and which are far less disruptive and may be ignored.<br/><br/>It was demonstrated that anti-correlation between wind and solar resources alone is not adequate to promise a smoother output as it does not provide sufficient information about ramp events. Anti-correlations at shorter time resolutions, such as 15 minutes or an hour, could be preferable. While seasonal anti-correlation may benefit national system adequacy, it does not benefit daily ramping events.<br/><br/>The optimal wind-PV capacity size for decreasing the total number of ramps was such that wind turbines filled the grid capacity, as solar power would result in extra ramps. It was observed that solar over-planting leads to a significantly increased number of ramp events, whereas wind over-planting results in a minimal change in ramp events. A penalty price was proposed to internalize the severity of ramp events, which could influence the choice between wind and solar over-planting. A solution was presented to mitigate ramp incidents in a hybrid power plant using a battery which was found to be more effective and/or more economical in minimizing ramps compared to over-planting.<br/><br/>The proposed ""significant wavelet ramp approach"" is shown to be a useful metric for characterizing wind-based hybrid power plant ramp occurrences. For a future in which variable renewable energy sources account for a substantial portion of the energy mix, it is proposed that demand information be considered when defining ramp events. More attention must be paid to power ramp occurrences, either by penalizing ramps or enforcing tougher grid codes. The ramp events must be considered at the sizing and development stage, with the possibility of including a ramp-mitigating battery strategy. A thorough examination of ramp events in hybrid power plants demonstrates the importance of minimizing and managing ramp events for both the system operator and the producer. <br","Hybrid power plant; Wind-PV hybrid; Power ramp events","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Schrama, Ernst (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Royal Netherlands Airforce (RNLAF) is currently supporting the Feasibility study for Optical Tracking of Orbital Satellites (FOTOS), which aims to create a satellite observation instrument, FOTOS1, for the optical tracking of satellites, which would be a key tool towards maintaining a sustainable use of space. This thesis was tasked with producing an improved image processing pipeline with the aim of detecting more objects and accurate endpoints for orbit determination. Additionally, it was important for the pipeline to maintain the cost and time efficiency of FOTOS1. For time and cost efficiency, data was firstly reduced; the data used originated from the MASCARA instrument in Chile, which takes subsequent exposures at a fixed exposure length from dusk until dawn. The instrument consists of five cameras that virtually covers the whole local horizon. The number of frames to be processed varies depending on the time of year, but is in the range of 23, 500 to 34, 000 images. Since optical satellite tracking requires that the satellites are sunlit, we could reduce the number of images for processing by specifying an observable altitude limit of ℎ = 2, 000 kilometers. This reduced ranges from 4.35% up to 48.38% depending on the day of the year. For higher altitude limits the reduction becomes significantly smaller as the earthshadow becomes less of an effect. To increase the detection performance of the pipeline we combined 50 images to create a single detection image. Several operations were performed to highlight dynamic features among the starry background. The astrometric solution was used to align the images together and subtract subsequent images from one another. These difference images were stacked together by their maximum value to highlight longer streaking features. For the detection, the Probabilistic Hough Transform worked efficiently and returned the correct positions on the image frame. The created detection images did not lead to an increase in the number of uniquely detected objects, but it did extend the altitude range of detected objects and the number of endpoints per unique object. Since the features in the stacks are longer the detection method was able to detect objects up to GEO altitude. Also since the stacks consisted of 50 images, a single detection of a feature could contain data from multiple images and thus contain multiple endpoints. Because of this approach the number of endpoints per unique object was increased almost fourfold whilst only detecting 20% less unique objects in total. Our last task was to determine the endpoints within one track; two novel methods were produced and tested with the aim to use position and discrete time data to create an overall better representation. However, it turned out that fitting noisy data was difficult for the tested regressors (least squares, TheilSen and RANSAC). It oftentimes caused the determinations to be off by 15 or more pixelsruling those results useless for orbit determination. Both the index prediction and index tracing methods had trouble defining the shape due to noise and thus can benefit from a possible iterative approach for data selection. The double index prediction method combined with a TheilSen regressor was selected for the pipeline as it showed to be the best performing method being the most robust combination and had relatively little error compared to the other combinations. When comparing the best performing new method to the existing method, it turned out that the existing method performed better. The endpoint accuracy of the new method was centered around 2 pixels but was more distributed than the existing methods. However the quantity of endpoints was almost doubled. How these results translate into quality of orbit determination is a recommended topic for future work. During this thesis project we therefore produced a new pipeline which can be implemented for instruments with the same observation strategy as MASCARA and is compatible with different lenses and exposure times. It showed proofofconcept that stacking images and through the data reduction simulation allowed for the processing of all the images within 24 hours such that a backlog of data will be avoided.","satellite; tracking; Line detection; astronomical imaging; Orbit Determination","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Due to its complex nature, it still remains a challenge to simulate this effect with real-time frame rates even on modern-day hardware. Existing methods are noisy and either require extensive filtering or long frame times to converge. In order to increase convergence, Instant Radiosity stores scene illumination from light sources in Virtual Point Lights (VPL), where reflected light rays are considered as new point light sources. Evaluating each VPL for every pixel is slow however. Light Cuts solves this problem by creating a light tree, where clusters of VPLs can be evaluated at once using a representative point light. A light cut is a cut in this tree which determines which clusters are evaluated. <br/><br/>We propose a pipeline which allows for efficient generation of VPLs, light tree generation and light tree sampling for real-time one-bounce global illumination in fully dynamic scenes. VPLs are generated from Bidirectional Reflective Shadow Maps, and we provide an efficient method of building a light tree from these VPLs. Computing full light cuts in real-time is still too costly, thus our work utilizes shallow light cuts which are easier to compute, together with stochastic light tree traversal to reach nodes deeper in the light tree for efficient sampling VPL clusters without sampling correlation. To further reduce computation time, light cuts are computed only for k*k pixel blocks and are blended using a novel stochastic light cut blending strategy. <br/><br/>All these steps make for a global illumination pipeline which is faster and outputs a higher quality image when compared to similar methods.","graphics; real-time; Global Illumination; ray tracing; computer graphics; 3D; light cuts; stochastic light cuts; stochastic substitute trees; importance sampling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fossil fuel sources are used to meet this demand for much of the world [1]. The way in which energy is handled causes pollution e.g., CO2 emissions, inducing climate change, therefore a more sustainable industry is desired [2, 3]. Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) is a way to use CO2 from the atmosphere or which would end up in the atmosphere, limiting its influence on the climate. Sustainable fuels or chemicals can be produced from the captured CO2, reducing the use of fossil fuels and fossil feedstock [4, 5].<br/>Formic Acid is a favourable product from CO2 electrolysis. Only 2 electrons are required for one molecule Formic Acid, which results in a high normalized price ($/electron) [6]. COVAL Energy works on scaling-up and commercialization of CO2 electrolysis to Formic Acid. Coval has already an operational reactor on lab scale with promising performance, a conversion efficiency up to 90%. Although the reaction kinetics are limited by a poor distribution of reactants on the electrode surface. Previous research by Jos van der Maas showed a highly uneven flow distribution in the cell reactor [7]. Gas bubbles are formed inside the reactor, which likely limit the reaction. Consequences of this poor distribution of reactants and these bubbles are a lower energy efficiency and higher electrical resistance.<br/>The main question of this thesis is: How can the current knowledge of electrolysers be applied to improve the Coval electrolyser design regarding flow distribution and mitigation of the impact of dissolved gas production? Experiments were performed to gain knowledge about the bubble behaviour in the Coval electrolyser. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used to screen design ideas on liquid distribution. Promising designs were assessed in a flow and gas bubble visualisation experimental setup, in which also the bubble behaviour was investigated. Finally, prototypes to be tested in the high pressure reactor were produced.<br/><br/>Two auspicious designs were found. The first design has channels in the inter electrode gap. The results showed that with channels the velocity variation over the cell width was reduced. The second design has a manifold like geometry in a calm zone before and after the interelectrode gap. This resulted in an almost constant velocity over the cell width for the entire cell. Additionally, a larger inlet and outlet pipe to and from the cell improves flow homogeneity and reduces pressure dorp in these pipes. The gas fraction in the cell can be kept low by sloping the top part of the cell towards the outlet.<br/>A next step is to assess both designs in the high pressure reactor. Particular attention should be paid to the manufacturing of the design to avoid leakage and mechanical deterioration. It is recommended to measure pressure drop over the cell for better assessment of the designs.","CO2 utilisation; CO2 electrolysis; formate; formic acid; Flow distribution; bubble flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-27","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy, Flow and Process Technology","","51.999624, 4.371942"

The calculation for the most occurring failure mechanism in dykes, i.e. macro-instability, is limited by not being able to calculate large deformation when sliding occurs within a dyke. The random material point method (RMPM) is able to capture the complete failure path, including the residual dyke strength, while taking the heterogeneity of the soil into account, thereby improving the assessment of failure processes. However, as the method is not (yet) used in current practice, clear communication of the results is essential for convincing a wider public of the contribution of this method. Visuals are an important tool in communication, as it increases comprehension of the subject matter if the visual is designed efficiently. This research aims to investigate the available software and which techniques are suitable to make realistic and informative visualizations for a given RMPM dataset of slope failure problems.<br/>A method to create visualization with a certain graphical realism in three-dimensional space is developed. The technique uses a computer graphic software (Blender) combined with an add-on, i.e. an extension plugin. The add-on allows to work with VTK software to process scientific data for visualization, thereby maintaining the scientific correctness of the visualizations. Moreover, a rendering pipeline in Blender is created, which transforms the properties from scientific colors into realistic materials, making the visualizations more intuitive.<br/>However, the dataset is too large to summarize in a straightforward illustration. Therefore, a data analysis is obtained to classify each realization into five pre-defined failure profiles, which are determined based on a literature study. Four failure profiles are classified based on the number of retrogressive failures and whether or not the realization resulted in flooding, while the fifth class describes horizontal failures. A technique has been developed to separate the horizontal failures from the other classes based on the plastic deviatoric strain attribute. Additionally, the data analysis aims to characterize the behavior of each failure profile from an early start, such that the findings could be used for current methods, which could not calculate the full failure profile. <br/>Therefore, this thesis needs to investigate the reduction of the dataset to make it more time efficient when doing a data analysis. It is extended on the clustering algorithm, which has the function to detect failure blocks based on the displacement per dyke profile. The reduction method replaces an amount of data by one representative point per cluster. It not only reduced the size of the dataset significantly, from 3000 GB to 6 GB, it also made the comparison of attributes between realizations, and therefore the data analysis, easier.<br/>The data analysis shows that it is hard to distinguish different failure profiles using only data of the initial failure, which shows the importance of using RMPM to account for post-failure behavior instead of using the current assessment i.e. FEM and LEM. One finding is that equilibrium of the initial failure block is often reached before a vertical crest displacement equal to 0.5 times the height of the dyke. This indicates that the crude estimation in the current assessment is highly conservative. Moreover, within the assumption, it is hypothesized that the secondary failure block will only form after the initial failure block has reached its equilibrium, which is shown otherwise within the data analysis of this thesis.<br/>This work proposes a method for data analysis of RMPM using parallel coordinates, which can be extended to other RMPM datasets for macro-instability and can help to improve the prediction of the probability of flooding. Moreover, it proposes a method to visualize the prominent features, determined using parallel coordinates, in Blender-VTK. This work can, in future research, be extended to other geotechnical problems, such as 3-dimensional dyke slope failure.<br","RMPM; visualization; Blender; macro stability; MPM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

When people operate vehicles they utilize all their senses to assess the current traffic scenario and determine appropriate actions to take. Sensors in autonomous driving applications aim to mimic those human senses to build a similar understanding of these complex circumstances. Most scientific attention in the autonomous driving community has been put on camera and LiDAR solutions, which are already capable of constructing a cohesive three-dimensional representation of the surroundings with high accuracy. Instead, minimal research went into the utilization of the auditory landscape in traffic scenarios. With the use of sirens in emergency vehicles and upcoming regulations of minimum sound emissions for electric vehicles, it appears evident that acoustic perception deserves more attention. Auditory localization in particular is a task widely studied in the field of speaker recognition, where robust methods exist that can localize and track multiple speech sources in difficult acoustic environments. This raises the question of whether such principles can be applied in the domain of autonomous driving and help to make self-driving cars safer and more robust in navigating dense and complex urban cities. Especially in non-line-of-sight situations where oncoming traffic can be hazardous and conventional systems fail, employing acoustic sensing may prove instrumental in early detection and localization attempts. This study investigates, if, and to what extend, acoustic methods can be used to complement ordinary sensing and localization methods. Using the example of a T-crossing, where traffic is occluded by buildings, it is shown that acoustic sensing alone is capable of detecting oncoming traffic before it enters direct line-of-sight. To achieve this, a combination of a generic acoustic line-of-sight feature and two concepts of data-driven classification methods are used to infer from the surrounding soundfield at the ego-vehicle to other motorized vehicles in proximity. This investigation is aided by a supplementary real-world dataset that provides around two hours of data, gathered from five different locations. The performance of the methods is directly compared to a visual baseline and other acoustic line-of-sight methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed acoustic localization concepts can detect traffic about one second earlier than conventional line-of-sight sensors. Despite the complexity of the problem, it is shown that the more lightweight method in terms of parameter count is favourable and more performant in most of the tasks. Among others, these tasks include generalization across different environments and a larger time horizon.","Acoustic Localization; Non-Line-of-Sight; Microphone array; Occlusion; Autonomous driving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-17","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Human Factors","",""

(mentor); Brand, D.I. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In the previous decade, a new type of air travel has seen a surge of interest from established and start-up companies alike: Air Mobility, a type of short range air travel as an alternative to taking the train or the car. Part of air mobility are a new type of aircraft, called Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing vehicles (eVTOLs), which hold potential for many new use cases. <br/><br/>Design agency Modyn wants to profile themselves within the field of air mobility through a vision concept for an ambulance drone. This use case, they reckoned, would be a good starting point for Air Mobility and eVTOLs, as it attracts more public acceptance than commercial use cases, such as an air-taxi service. <br/><br/>Modyn’s vision project was turned into this graduation thesis: an ambulance drone concept for the scope of 2035. Far enough in the future to capture the imagination, but near enough for it to relate to our present day reality in 2021. <br/><br/>Keeping the project grounded was one of the main challenges. It required a good understanding of the current ambulance system in The Netherlands. Which was the first research subject. A visit to ambulance station Delft and interviews with people from the field were all valuable input. <br/><br/>After establishing the current status quo, a look into the future was taken. Here, plans towards Air Mobility were investigated, in order to see how much The Netherlands is interested in this idea. The influence of technological and societal developments that relate to Air Mobility were plotted on a timeline, creating a roadmap towards 2035. This roadmap would create an input for the technical architecture of the ambulance drone. <br/><br/><br/>Having a good picture of the present and a potential future, the research was distilled into a vision and a mission. The focus now clearly went towards using ambulance drones to replace the current ambulance helicopters. Also, the design challenges were identified and a program of requirements was compiled. <br/><br/>The design phase started off with the ideation, in which Virtual Reality was used to generate interior layouts. The interior is the most fundamental part of the design, as it is responsible for 90% of the interactions that the users have with the ambulance drone. An inside-out design approach was therefore the most sensible. <br/><br/>From the VR based ideation, the most promising interior layouts were translated into concepts. The direction was still rather open at this point, so in order to converge towards the final concept, a lot of experts were consulted for feedback on the concepts and the direction of the project. <br/><br/>This led to the creation of the final design, which was loosely based on two of the concepts. Thanks to the feedback from experts, the final design underwent quite a metamorphosis compared to the concepts.<br/><br/>The result is an ambulance drone concept with novel features and interesting ideas regarding the interior layout. The final concept has a recognisable, yet unique identity from a visual standpoint, being professional and approachable at the same time.","Ambulance; Drone; eVTOL; Air Mobility; The Netherlands; Healthcare","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Online learning is employed to provide robustness to changes in the environment and physical characteristics of the drone. As a result, vertical speed tracking improves in terms of settling time when the drone's mass is more than doubled.

(mentor); van Daalen, C. (graduation committee); te Morsche, Wietse (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Netherlands suffers from a traffic congestion problem, which is a cause of both economic damages and high NOx and CO2 emissions. Today, the bus accounts for only a small percentage of all trips made in the Netherlands (less than 4%) but the bus plays an important role as an access and egress mode for train travelers. Short access and egress times are considered as crucial criteria for choosing to travel by train. Thus without a proper bus network, traveling by train will become less attractive. Furthermore the Dutch population is both growing and more mobile than ever, but space to construct new roads is limited. These developments mean that the current transport system in the Netherlands will not be sustainable in the future. To prepare it for the future sustainable public transport will be essential. However it is complicated to design a solid bus network as the public transport sector depends heavily on subsidies. For bus operators to allocate their resources efficiently, good information is key. Direct Ridership Models (DRMs) are rising in popularity as they can provide useful information to bus operators. DRMs are statistical models that are able to capture the relationship between surroundings (such as car ownership in the surrounding neighbourhood or the presence of a university) and travel demand. This way first cut predictions can be made for new bus stop locations. Furthermore, the expected number of travelers can be predicted for existing bus stops when there is a change in the surroundings of the bus stop, which allows bus operators to adjust their services accordingly. In this study, DRMs are used to explain and predict bus ridership for the concession area Arnhem-Nijmegen. The independent variables that are included in the models can be categorised into three groups: demographics, built environment and level of service. Three DRMs are developed based on different regression models. One model is the commonly used OLS. The other two models, Spatial Lag X model (SLX) and Spatial Error Model (SEM), are able to take spatial relationships between bus stops into account. The spatial models showed an improvement over the OLS model in terms of explanatory power. With 34 independent variables, the OLS model could explain 71.4% of the bus ridership. The SEM was able to explain 72.4% and the SLX 73.4%. But more importantly, some of the independent variables that were found significant related to ridership in the OLS model turned out to be not significant in the SEM model, of which car ownership was the most surprising one. For Arnhem-Nijmegen, it could be further looked into if the transportation by bus to parks, sport facilities, amusement parks and hospitals could be facilitated more to increase the bus usage as these variables are found to influence bus ridership significantly. Furthermore, it should be examined why P+R's are not found to affect bus ridership significantly. The prediction accuracy of the OLS model and the SLX model was also studied. The predictions of the SLX model turned out to be more accurate, but in general the prediction results were not satisfying. For more than half of the bus stops in Arnhem-Nijmegen, the predicted value of the SLX model was 50% more or 50% less than the actual value. The reason for this is the existence of non-stationary relationships, which means that the relations between ridership and the independent variables can vary based on the locations of the stops. This study contained bus stops in urban areas and in rural areas and it can be expected that for example the influence of a hospital in a village on bus ridership is smaller than the influence of a hospital in a city. In this study, the existence of non-stationary relationships between regions is demonstrated while studying if a DRM based on Arnhem-Nijmegen can be generalised to the region Groningen- Drenthe. It turned out residential land-use has more influence on bus ridership in Groningen- Drenthe while hospitals and universities have a higher impact on ridership in Arnhem-Nijmegen. The non-stationary relationships make it not advisable to generalise the DRM based on Arnhem- Nijmegen to different regions. In scientific literature, nothing has been written about the practical applications of DRMs for policy makers. As it was assumed DRMs can be useful for policy makers, three policy makers were interviewed for their insights on the applications. One of the application mentioned is preventing unsafe traffic situations, as DRMs allow to update ridership predictions when circumstances around the bus stop change. For example, when a bus stops is designed for a low number of travelers and a new neighbourhood is developed close to it, the increase in travelers could result in unsafe situations. With a DRM the increase in travelers can be predicted, which makes it possible to redesign the bus stop. Other applications that were identified in the interviews are: examining if a bus stop is performing below its potential and substantiating plans for new routes, new stop locations and relocating bus stops. Overall, the benefit of DRM is widely acknowledged and in combination with personal expertise, it could lead to optimised decision making. In the end, it is demonstrated how a DRM can be used to identify bus stops which do not fulfil their potential and suggestions are provided how the number of rides can be increased. The stops Europalaan in Renkum, Kerkstraat in Weurt and Beemdstraat, Fransestraat &amp; Hatertseweg in Nijmegen turned out be under performing and several improvement suggestions were made. Although the prediction accuracy of the models were rather poor, future studies can use this study as a basis for models based on a more homogeneous study area, such as only bus stops in cities. Sub-setting the model is expected to have a major positive influence on the prediction accuracy. It would be interesting to see if a DRM based on a city can be generalised to other cities as well. Furthermore, the model can be complemented with more independent variables. Variables that encourage car use over bus use, such as the difference in travel time to the city center or the distance to the closest highway ramp, could be valuable additions.","Direct Ridership Model; Bus Ridership; Predicting; Explaining; Spatial Regression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

If an implant with spatial control that can release drugs to a target location can be developed, it will provide efficient treatment opportunities for a variety of brain disorders such as strokes. One of the questions in realizing this implant is how to activate the drug release mechanism. Light is a promising activation stimulus due to its spatial precision and flexibility in the optical path. This thesis is a feasibility study into carrying light inside such a brain implant using a photonic crystal waveguide. Such a device must be soft and maintain its functionality during the mechanical bending imposed on the implant by the geometry and movement of the brain. A flexible 2D photonic crystal is simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics with the goal of designing a waveguide that functions with infrared light. The dispersion diagram of the photonic crystal is plotted to design for a bandgap at the operating wavelength. The transmission through a linear waveguide is calculated for the deformed state of the implant in mechanical bending, which is modeled as a 2D strain. A metallo-photonic crystal with photoresist nanopillars coated with a gold thin film and embedded in a flexible PDMS matrix is selected as the prototype for fabrication. The nanopillar arrays that form the photonic crystal waveguide are printed using two-photon polymerization (2PP), deposited with gold then transferred into photosensitive PDMS by drop casting. For characterization, a tapered rib waveguide is designed for light coupling and an optical end-fire test setup is built for transmission measurements on the fabricated device.","Photonic crystals; Two-photon polymerization; End-fire characterization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

To further boost the efficiencies of c-Si-based solar cells, high-bandgap perovskite cells are stacked on top achieving a record efficiency of 29.52%. However, as most of the high-quality perovskite films are solution-processed, the front surface of the bottom device should be flat. Therefore, in this work SHJ bottom c-Si cells featuring front-side-flat and rear-side-textured morphology, which delivers high V<sub>OC</sub> together with excellent near-infrared response, have been optimized as bottom cells for tandem configurations.<br/><br/>Firstly, RF-PECVD deposition conditions of a (i)a-Si: H monolayer for symmetric &lt;100&gt; flat c-Si surfaces were optimized. The optimized (i)a-Si:H monolayer ( 10-nm-thick) was obtained using pure SiH<sub>4</sub>, which results in rather moderate passivation performances (teff = 1.2ms, i-V<sub>OC</sub> = 701 mV).<br/>To improve further the passivation quality of monolayer (i)a-Si:H on flat &lt;100&gt; surface, other passivation approaches aiming at incorporating more H without promoting detrimental epitaxial growth have been investigated.<br/>With a bilayer deposition approach, which features firstly a less H-containing (i)a-Si:H to prevent epitaxial growth and then a second H-rich (i)a-Si:H layer, the passivation properties were slightly enhanced to τeff=1.4 ms and i-V<sub>OC</sub>=704 mV. Subsequently, by combining the bilayer approach with a post HPT, τeff of 2.0<br/>ms and an i-V<sub>OC</sub> of 714 mV were achieved. Finally, by combining the bilayer approach with an intermediate HPT, the optimal passivation sample was deposited, with τeff of 2.4 ms and an i-V<sub>OC </sub>of 720 mV on the flat &lt;100&gt; surface.<br/>To gain a better understanding of the correlation between passivation qualities and the microstructure properties of (i)a-Si:H on flat &lt;100&gt; surface, the layers have been characterized mainly via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). From the analysis, it can be concluded that the passivation layer that contains<br/>sufficient H and a higher fraction of monohydrides is beneficial for achieving a better passivation quality.<br/><br/>For the two-terminal tandem solar cells, bottom cells with (n)-contact on top are preferred due to the optical advantage of the perovskite top cells with the p-i-n configuration. Therefore, a first tandem cell with (n)a-Si:H has been fabricated in collaboration with TU Eindhoven resulting in 22.2% efficiency. Starting from<br/>this first fabricated tandem cell, its main optical limitations have been identified by performing advanced optical simulations using GenPro4, and the main strategies to overcome these optical drawbacks have been defined. By optimizing the front anti-reflection layers (MgF<sub>2</sub> and ITO) thicknesses (at 100 nm and 20 nm, respectively), and reducing C<sub>60</sub> thickness from 20 to 10 nm, front reflections, and parasitic absorption can be minimized. Thus a gain of implied photocurrent density of 1.8 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> for the tandem cell was obtained.<br/>Further, by implementing (n)nc-SiOx:H doped layer in the SHJ bottom cell, instead of standard (n)a-Si:H layer the reflection between the top and bottom cell is also reduced, and enhanced light incorporation into the bottom cell is obtained. By adopting all the above optimizations and also adjusting the perovskite<br/>layer from 473 nm to 530 nm, a total improvement of 2.7 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> in implied photocurrent density with respect to the initial 22.2% tandem cell can be achieved.<br/>After having identified different optically optimized SHJ bottom cells for tandem applications, both rear junction and front junction single-side-textured SHJ solar cells were fabricated. Firstly, the passivation quality of (i)a-Si:H/(n)-layer and (i)a-Si:H/(p)-layer on different (i)a-Si:H were investigated. Then RJ solar cells<br/>with three different (n)-type layers [(n)nc-SiOx:H;(n)nc-Si:H;(n)a-Si:H)] have been fabricated with optimal thicknesses individuated from the tandem optical simulations. Furthermore, a tunnel recombination junction SHJ solar cell with a layer stack of (n)nc-Si:H/(p)nc-SiOx:H/(p)nc-Si:H has been fabricated and measured as well.<br/><br/> In conclusion, various doped contacts (both n- and p-type) were successfully implemented into SHJ solar cells, which delivered V<sub>OC</sub>s range from 700 to 714 mV and FFs range from 77.8% to 80.9%.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In my opinion, the primary goal of a piece of architecture should always be to connect to the people of a certain place, by tapping into the history and specificities of that place. This necessity is put into words and understood tacitly because of the existence of the opposite. In this project is strived to find a method how to work towards this goal working from something that can be perceived as an opposite: a dysfunctional shopping center in the inner city of Nijmegen called ‘De Molenpoort’. <br/> The question of how to meaningfully reconnect the existing building fabric to the city should be answered on multiple scales. First, it is important to understand how the city came into being and how it relates to ‘De Molenpoort’. The shopping center, as it manifests itself currently, seems to fit into the debate, raised by Marc Augé, of ‘place and non-place’. The characteristics of a non-place are present in shopping center but also in the streets around it – the main function of the inner city of Nijmegen has become shopping and therefore mainly hosts the anonymous movement that can be associated with this function. The city is therefore in need of true anthropological places. <br/> In order to come to a true community place, firstly, people who are related in some way should be able to assemble there to communicate. In order to find a program that supports this, the needs of society are reassessed. Herein the concept of recreation has taken on a central position in this research. The performance of art provides the possibility for people to connect and express their unique individuality. <br/> Secondly, the singular and uniqueness of the existing building should be highlighted. This is done by taking on the attitude of the bricoleur and pruning away the things that are not needed. It is sought to look at the existing spatial and material elements in a new way, and make them come to their full potential. Lastly, it is sought to preserve the memory of ‘De Molenpoort’. In this inspiration was found in the book on Adhocism by Jencks and Silver. <br/> One of the most characteristic elements of the existing shopping center is its gigantic and heavy parking deck. The drawing of a demolotion plan, made the amount of removed concrete clear. It is decided therefore, to radically reuse the concrete by tactically cutting it in rectangular pieces. The façade is a product of change, a recreation, but is by definition not static. The panels invite appropriation by the citizens and consequently record the stories that take place around it. It becomes more than just a building by, for example, bringing what happens inside, into the city by hosting works of art. <br","Circular building; Bricolage; Place; Non-Place; urban architecture; architecture; Urbanism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","Urban Architecture, Studio Bricolage",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Marine structures are frequently equipped with rubber fender systems, which absorb the berthing en­ergy in order to protect both the marine structure and the berthing vessel. These fender systems absorb the kinetic berthing energy by elastic deflection and the associated reaction fender force introduces a berthing impact load acting on the vessel’s side hull. In guidelines and rules on ship design, recommendations regarding the structural resistance due to external fenders are not present. On the other hand, special requirements state minimal strengthening for tug resistance, which results in marked areas on a vessel’s side hull at which tug contact is allowed. Also for ships equipped with integrated steel fenders in their side hull, also known as beltings, minimal strengthening is required. Since the use of fender systems in ports is common, and all ships require to berth in a port the maximum hull loading due to fender contact is an important factor to take into account from the vessel’s perspective. PIANC WG33 published design recommendations for the maximum allowable hull pressure in kN/m2 for different types of vessels. The size of the fender contact area is in practice determined by dividing the design reaction force by the maximum allowable hull pressure. However, the hull pres­sures in this recommendation are based on the pressure on the keel of a fully laden vessel. Based on this background information, not all values are reliable, since some pressures correspond to a draft of 70 meters. Besides that, the pressure formulation does not contain information on the specific geom­etry of the contact area, i.e. height and width. This thesis systematically analyses the strength of the vessels’ parallel side hull for different failure modes, e.g. yielding in the stiffeners due to excessive bending­ or shear stresses. The structural ge­ometry of various vessel types is represented by various grillages. Two different pressure distributions were considered: a soft contact area, and a rigid contact area, to cover the most extreme behaviour of a fender panel. The results of this study show that the allowable load is largely influenced by the geometry of the contact area. The fender panels designed using the PIANC WG33 fender design are not always opti­mal. Especially for fender panels having large widths, the current guidelines seem to be too optimistic. Consequently, it is necessary to define a maximum width to what extent the current guidelines are allowable. This study shows that a specific allowable force in kN for a specific geometry is preferred over the current guidelines. In this study, a general formulation for the maximum allowable hull loading is proposed. This for­mulation requires the specific structural lay­out of the vessel that encounters the berthing facility. If the specific ship’s particulars are not known, recommendations are provided for different vessel types. These recommendations consist of a new acceptance criterion for each vessel type, which can be used to optimise the geometry of fender panels. The findings of this study can be used in the design of fender systems and the new design criterion has been submitted to the members of PIANC WG211.","Fender systems; Hull pressure; Elastic; Lateral loading; Patch loading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

In this problem, PSF and the pupil function are given, and the goal is to reconstruct the phase of the object. For camera which has 8 bits color depth, the maximum number of colors that can be displayed at any one time is 2^8 , i.e. 256. When the minimal exposure time of the camera is longer than ""correct"" exposure time or the intensity is changing, e.g. dynamic focusing, too much intensity is measured by the camera and causes saturation, i.e. over-exposure. Over-exposure causes distortion of the image, thereby losing the information. However, on the other hand, the overall brightness of the PSF image will be enhanced due to over-exposure. It highlight structure and increase the number of informative pixels of the image. We can use this to enhance the information in the PSF image to offset the negative effects of noise or background in the image. <br/>Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm is a solution to phase retrieval problem and is a nice example of projection based algorithm. The algorithm has a perfect performance in the case that the PSF is the modules square of the object, i.e. without noise or other preconditioners effect. It is demonstrated in [Nishizaki, 2019] that an over-exposure preconditioner can improve the performance for phase restoration of a machine-learning model based algorithm. In this master thesis, we propose modification of the model of PSF amplitude in Gerchbrg-Saxton algorithm to make the algorithm be able to cope with over-exposed PSF image. This approach is tested both by numerical simulation and with experimental data.","phase retrieval; alternating projection; Preconditioner","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Typical approaches determine the loudspeaker inputs by optimizing over a cost function that models the sound pressure inside the enclosure. However, recent methods propose cost functions that include a perceptual model of the human auditory system, which further models the perception of sound. This thesis investigates such an approach by proposing a framework within which sound zones are constructed through optimization over a perceptual model. The framework is used to propose two perceptual sound zone algorithms: unconstrained and constrained perceptual pressure matching. Simulations of the proposed algorithms and a reference algorithm are presented to determine the benefits of including auditory-perceptual information in sound zone algorithms. From this, it is found that the unconstrained perceptual approach outperforms the reference in terms of various perceptual measures. In addition, it is found that adding perceptual constraints to the optimization problem allows for control of sound zones which correlates well with other perceptual quality measures.","Sound Zones; Perceptual Model; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Signals and Systems","",""

Firstly, distinguishing between different levels of decision making in Open Building is brought into connection with the levels that constitute the built environment through which the water cycle circulates. Secondly, the interdependency between the constituents of Open Building and the water cycle is formulated. Thirdly, it is clarified how Open Building can contribute to a high-density neighbourhood and nature inclusive public space. Lastly, the impact of densification on a net positive water cycle is explained and the possibilities of nature inclusive public space to mitigate these effects are given. By structuring the connection of GreenBlue infrastructure with Open Building at different levels of abstraction, a better understanding of the interdependency within planning for urban renewal is put forward. The spatial implications are clarified and substantiated by research through literature study, case study and by design.

It’s growth and importance is fuelled by technology advancements that support both traditional local industry and advanced manufacturing. However, there is a lack of a vision and clear approach regarding industry in cities as well as competing interests for available space in urban environments. Since industry is typically considered as a weak land use, strategic efforts and strong interventions are required to ensure its presence in cities is retained and promoted within the urban fabric (Hill, 2020). This study focuses on examining the conditions that can influence the feasibility of integrating light industry when transforming industrial estates (bedrijventerreinen in Dutch) into new urban mixed-use districts in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. NDSM-Werf, a former shipyard situated on the northern banks of the IJ, is the chosen case study site. In this research, the scope of light industry covers a broad range of industrial and supporting activities that in theory can be incorporated in an urban mixed-use setting. The research methodology includes an extensive literature review, followed by empirical research that is made up of three main components: the Planning &amp; Policy Dimension, the Stakeholder Dimension and the Spatial Dimension. The data collection methods used include documentation analysis in which a range of governmental and non-governmental documents were reviewed; semi-structured interviews with public, private, and third party stakeholders as well as experts;  and additional desktop research where applicable. Outputs include the review of planning and policy processes, stakeholder mapping and a spatial analysis that involved the identification of City of Making (CoM) patterns derived from the Foundries of the Future book (Hill, 2020) using the case study site of NDSM-Werf. Main findings include the identification of six key conditions that were found critical to consider to integrating light industry in urban mixed-use developments of transformation areas in Amsterdam. Recommendations are provided at both the city level of Amsterdam and for the NDSM-Werf site in particular, directed at key stakeholders identified in the research.

It is increasingly used for the design and assessment of (civil) structures. Reliability analysis, possibly in combination with performance data, allows for instance to update (extend) the lifetime of existing quay wall structures. This gives economic advantages when assessing quay walls, figuring there are thousands of kilometres of quay walls worldwide. Soil-structure analysis (e.g. analysis of quay walls) is however complex and in general requires finite element (FE) models. Conventional reliability methods are mostly incapable of dealing with FE models because they have long (infeasible) calculation times e.g. Monte Carlo, or they cannot deal with the typical noisy and incomplete FE model output e.g. FORM. One way of dealing with these challenges is by using a metamodelling approach, i.e. build up and make use of a response surface on a limited number of model evaluations. One specific application which uses metamodelling is ERRAGA, which is an abbreviation for Efficient and Robust Reliability Analysis for Geotechnical Applications. This thesis investigates the potential of ERRAGA/metamodelling for reliability analysis of quay walls in engineering practice.\medskip<br/><br/>In this thesis ERRAGA is tested on two realistic case studies located in the port of Rotterdam. The first case is called the ‘Sleepbootkade’, a quay constructed from a combi wall with anchors. The second case study is called the HHTP-quay, a combi wall with relieving platform and MV-piles. In the first case focus is placed on getting to understand the details and workings of the ERRAGA method. In the second case focus has been put on the creation of the reliability model and the practical applicability of ERRAGA using the experiences of the first case. Two critical limit states are tested within the case studies: wall failure in bending and geotechnical failure. Especially the limit state geotechnical failure is challenging as relevant output parameters are known to be noisy and/or incomplete.\medskip<br/><br/>The main finding of this thesis is that reliability analysis of quay walls using ERRAGA in combination with a numerical model shows good potential. ERRAGA can generate reliable and accurate results within only hundreds of realizations, hereby overcoming the main drawbacks of existing reliability methods. Main drawback of the ERRAGA method seems to be its inherent complexity and ‘black box’ nature. For the user to employ the full potential of the method some more in depth knowledge and especially the user-defined settings are required. Based on the gained experiences in this thesis some first recommendations are presented for the use and application of ERRAGA in projects.","Reliability analysis; Metamodelling; Quay walls; Plaxis 2D; Probabilistic analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","GRAPA",""

A mechanical circulatory assist device can potentially increase their life expectancy and quality of life. Given the complexity of the anatomy and physiology of the Fontan circulation, design of a safe and effective mechanical assist device is a challenging task. A device based on a viscous impeller pump is very attractive. Such a device is amenable for minimally invasive implantation through a catheter, given the miniaturization of its actuator is possible. The current thesis provides the first steps in designing and developing the small brushless electromagnetic motor intended to drive the viscous impeller pump. First, a list of requirements was defined for such an actuator. The essential requirements are that the actuator is 5.4 mm in diameter and 11 mm in length, has an outrunner configuration, can reach a power output of at least 0.92 Watts and that the within the motor generated temperature does not excessively heat up the surrounding blood or breaks the actuator. After that, the actuator's first concept was defined and validated on the torque output and heat generation. After that, various optimizations of the design were performed, which resulted in a potentially promising actuator concept. Although, the presented actuator concept meets the prescribed dimensions and is an outrunner BDLC motor, the predicted power and torque output of 0.632 Watts and 2446 μNm, respectively, both are above the required values. The actuator needs to be tested to conclude if the actuator can indeed provide sufficient drive resulting in required pumping power of the VIP. <br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-07","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Bioelectronics","",""

These objects are alienated objects within the modern city, they can take the observer to a place former to them. The topic of the terrain vague got my interest as the leftover of the industrial, within most industrial areas certain parts are redundant due to progression and have been left there to be taken over by nature. Terrain vague, a Term introduced in Anyplaces by Ignasi de Sola-Morales Rubio. (Davidson, 1995). Ignasi de Sola-Morales talks about these spaces as not being colonized by architecture. They are left over spaces or literary translated by its Latin words; vacant terrains. Is this western European term still viable within the context of a condition within the city of Yekaterinburg? What is the Russian terrain vague? How can the understanding of the Russian culture help to redefine the term in a way that it applies to cities where more places have the nature of the vacant place than the one of colonized architecture? Morales explained the terrain vague as a place to escape the city. Can the terrain vague be a place to escape the pressure of the city in a mental space, a space of seclusion? The state of the city resembles the nature of the Russians, an melancholic almost depressing state. But where does this come from and how can this search for the Russian emotion help to better define the Russian terrain vague? Looking at linguistics, the Russian emotion comes much more from the soul. Russian see the emotion much more as a state of the soul someone is in. Can this metal terrain vague express the soul state of the Russians? This depressing nature of the Russian leads to another understanding of the term terrain vague. It is much more within Russian context about a place which can take you away from a bad place. This turns around its premise of something that was un-colonised by capitalism towards a place where there are these archipelagos of freedom from the depression. Which then within Russian context are these capitalist non-places, creating a paradox which result back to the terrain vague that was mentioned by Ignasi de Sola-Morales?","terrain vague; Yekaterinburg; Russia; non place","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Borders and Territories","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Trends of neoliberalisation and globalisation have led to the financialisation of housing on a global scale. This has led to the increasing deployment of state-led gentrification as a strategy for urban development, as cities aim to strengthen their position as nodes in the global economy. In the Netherlands, these trends have led to the marginalisation of social housing. As the city of Rotterdam develops ambitious plans to restructure its old city harbours into dense mixed-use districts, residents of the adjoining neighbourhood Tweebos protest the forced demolition of their social housing units in the midst of a national housing crisis. These dwellings have to make way in favour of new privately owned homes for middle-income residents as part of the municipality’s plans for city-wide socio-economic diversification.<br/><br/>This thesis proposes an alternative development strategy for Tweebos based in the right to the city. By establishing a Community Land Trust in Tweebos, residents will be able to regain control over the development of their neighbourhood. The CLT holds the land in perpetuity, controlling rents and resale prices democratically through the neighbourhood and thus ensuring affordability. The CLT provides Tweebos residents an instrument to elevate the use value of urban space above its exchange value, a platform to participate in the production of urban space and a mechanism to fund those developments. This thesis argues that by doing so, the CLT protects the urban commons and institutionalises the right to the city. The principles of the CLT can thus help strengthen the right to the city in the Dutch system of housing development, and can provide a starting point for a stronger public housing sector in the Netherlands.","community land trust; gentrification; right to the city; urban commons; rotterdam; tweebos; social housing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","","51.900167,4.507397"

(mentor); de Jong, P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","There is a growing need for social housing in the Netherlands, especially in urban areas. The construction industry faces the difficult task of quickly responding to this demand while also reducing the embodied carbon emissions of new buildings. A proposed solution to these tasks is constructing mass timber buildings, leading to cheaper buildings and faster construction times while also reducing embodied carbon emissions compared to traditional buildings (Amiri et al., 2020). Due to its high strength and low weight, research finds that mass timber is suitable for reinforced concrete replacement. In doing so, a reduction of 2,4 Million Tons of C02 Equivalent annually can be established.<br/><br/>However, mass timber construction faces barriers—especially when addressing social housing associations due to their strong focus on affordability and risk reduction. Since the construction of social ‘carbon neutral’ housing is a major societal and environmental challenge, this research aims to define the barriers and develop strategies for overcoming these barriers to enable mass timber construction. For this purpose, the central research question is as follows: “What are the barriers for the construction of modular mass timber social housing, and what might be strategies for overcoming them?<br/><br/>Since this question is explorative, a qualitative research approach is used with the double design method. In the first diamond, the barriers are discovered and defined. In the second diamond, the strategies for overcoming these barriers are developed. Expectations are that the demand for mass timber buildings is above average in urban areas where a scarcity of land occurs, and municipalities have non-statutory supplementary ambitions regarding sustainability. Therefore, this research focuses on housing associations operating in urban areas. The barriers are identified by analyzing data obtained through a series of consultations with experts and eight semi-structured interviews with social housing associations. Ten barriers resulted from these interviews, which were classified into four categories.<br/><br/>The first category consists of social, cultural, and organizational barriers in adopting mass timber construction. Housing associations experience unclarity about circular decisions, show risk-averse behavior, and are having difficulties changing. The second category contains sectorial barriers. These include a sectoral knowledge deficiency, strategic alliances with the traditional industry, and the unique project-based approach that forms a barrier for modular construction since it limits the degree of repeatability and standardization. The third category are technical barriers. They consist of the perception among housing associations that modular construction results in uniformity, which is further obstructed by different programs of requirements.<br/><br/>The strategies for overcoming these barriers are based upon insights from an online expert panel meeting. The panel consisted of two representatives of mass timber construction companies, an architect, and an expert on bio-based construction materials. There was consensus among the experts about four strategies, of which the most important is to change the conditions for mass timber. This can be done with long- and short-term knowledge increase. Other strategies include the role of the municipalities and universities. However, to enable mass timber construction structurally, the construction costs must be lowered. The industrialization of modular construction could do so. Another way is letting social housing associations review their decision-making process from cost-based to value- based. This can be done by looking at total expenditure rather than building costs. The third strategy lets suppliers create a (open) building system based on standard floorplans with the flexibility for fitting custom facades. An open building system creates the opportunity for an infill industry to arise and allows a shift from a traditional design process towards product thinking. The fourth strategy is to safeguard the future value of components by using materials with common dimensions, which contributes to a total cost of ownership approach. Changing the responsibility of a product’s maintenance incentives suppliers to use durable and remountable materials, allowing circular business models.<br/><br/>This research answers the central question by presenting the ten barriers and four strategies. In doing so, this research provides implications for academia by combining modularity, mass timber, and social housing. It has delivered a well-ordered list of barriers that provides implications for practice. However, the presented strategies for overcoming these barriers do not guarantee the uptake of modular mass timber construction. Since this is a relatively new topic in the Netherlands, it also requires time to be adopted and deployed in the market. A TCO approach looks most promising to enable modular mass timber construction. Future research should find how to best incorporate this within a traditional- orientated construction value chain.","Mass Timber; Social housing; Affordable Housing; Modular construction; Barriers; Strategies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Simultaneously the unforeseen effects of ‘hard’ engineering approaches (such as dams, storm surge barriers, defensive coastal management) have been affecting biophysical as well as ecological systems, resulting in increased vulnerability to floods and loss of estuarine habitats. Therefore there appears to be a need to rethink coastal (protection) strategies. <br/><br/>The project relates to the temporal and spatial distributions of socio-economic as well as ecological vulnerabilities under the influence of increased flood probability and climatic stressors in the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta, questioning how a nature-based approach can be used to support the adaptive capacity of the delta and mitigation of altered future climate conditions. It specifically explores the development of critical land-water zones adjacent to the Eastern Scheldt, and construction of a framework for decision making in which nature-based solutions are prioritized. Initial stressing factors as well as space availability indicate the preferred solution space both landwards and seawards over the consolidation of the existing line. As means to structure proposals an adaptive framework has been developed on the scale of Schouwen Duiveland to maintain the existing qualities of the island, as well as selecting and excluding a solution pathway based on the systemic functioning of the island. The approach stands closely to the the notion that humans are an intrinsic part of nature. Therefore developments related to water safety, fresh water supply and critical infrastructures should act in accordance to the acceptance of dynamics as apposed to the idea of presumed stability.","Nature-based adaptation; Uncertainty; Urban flood resilience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","",""

However, Indonesia has abundant other renewable energy potentials, which are largely untapped. The Java-Madura-Bali (Jamali) system is Indonesia's largest electricity system. Integration of variable renewable energy resources requires flexibility options such as grid expansion and short- and long-term electricity storage. This research aims to fill the knowledge gap in the literature on the effect that different carbon emission reduction limits have on the Jamali power system design in 2050. This was done by studying the potential of various promising renewable energy technologies (solar photovoltaics, on- and offshore wind, Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC), geothermal and hydropower) in combination with short- and long-term storage (lithium-ion batteries and hydrogen storage) and grid expansions to mitigate renewable variability. For this purpose a techno-economic model was developed that optimizes operation and capacities of generation, storage and network simultaneously. The model simulates the system dynamics in the Jamali system in 2050 and was implemented in Python for Power System Analysis (PyPSA). It was found that there is an exponential relationship between system costs and carbon emission reductions in the Jamali power system. Additionally, only moderate system cost increases were found up to 80% emission reductions compared to the reference scenario with no emission mitigation efforts. At higher carbon reduction scenarios the solar capacities reach their maximum installable capacities. As a result, system cost increase exponentially due to the need for OTEC and offshore wind capacities. The high costs increases by offshore wind can be explained by the uniform costs and coarse resolution of the model. In low carbon scenarios high battery capacities were found and network expansion is limited. It is concluded that the Jamali network cannot smooth the variability of wind throughout the power system, therefore, without storage capacities the system cost almost double. On the other hand, the network remains important to transport electricity from rich renewable regions to large demand centers. Based on the results three recommendations were proposed related to the reconsideration of the energy targets for 2050, strategy to achieve the targets and present policies.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The municipality of Amsterdam plans to transition away from its reliance on fossil fuel-based energy sources for residential heating by 2040. The municipality has laid out a roadmap that details possibilities for sustainable heating on a per-neighborhood basis. One neighborhood of particular interest is Geerdinkhof in Amsterdam South East. There are three long-term sustainable transitions that can take place within Geerdinkhof; a high temperature (HT) district heating network, collectively-owned options and heating options per individual household. The present research refers to citizen social acceptance of these long-term transitions for sustainable heating. It would be ideal to address the possible lack of social acceptance for a new technology before it is implemented. It is argued that social acceptance issues can best be anticipated by understanding the underlying value conflicts associated with technologies. However, literature indicates that very few tools have been implemented for ex-ante analysis of social acceptance. It is argued that the consequences of value conflicts on a future lack of social acceptance can be anticipated by identifying scenarios of value change. In order to best balance the need for both quantitative and qualitative scenario analysis, Cross-Impact Balances (CIB) was chosen as the methodology execute this thesis. This method that can construct qualitative and semi-quantitative scenarios systematically. The values observed in this thesis regard affordability and comfort, which are at the forefront of the transition for citizens in Geerdinkhof. The analysis produced a total of 23 internally consistent scenarios of value change. This thesis defines “internally consistent” scenarios of value change as a reflection of how the prioritization of values shift over time, considering the mathematically plausible combinations of CIB calculations. Considering the heavy work-load to analyze each scenario individually, the scenarios were clustered into seven broad scenario clusters based on how these values may trend. Sensitivity analysis indicated that there is no extreme divergence in the number of consistent scenarios discovered. For each scenario cluster, the most fitting of the three possible heating initiatives in Geerdinkhof were assessed. Moreover, analysis indicated that a HT district heating network was the most fitting heating initiative as a result of the most commonly found scenario. However, it cannot be conclusively stated that this initiative is the most suitable for Geerdinkhof, given that the least commonly found scenario also suits HT district heating. Recommendations can be provided on the best possible procedure that the municipality can take in order to facilitate more socially accepted heating initiatives. Ex-ante assessment of social acceptance is dependent on observing possible trends in neighborhood and external factors. It is recommended that the municipality assess the current trends in these factors, and compare them to the findings in the present research. It is important to note that citizens would also need to demonstrate the need for sustainable initiatives. Another recommendation would be for the municipality to continue to emphasize the importance and urgency of the impending transition, for example through information campaigns or neighborhood gatherings.","value change; scenario analysis; Cross-impact balance; social acceptance; Sustainable heating","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

These risk elements are incorporated into a distributed model predictive control (MPC) framework for risk-aware multi-robot motion planning, in which the collision and congestion risks of each robot are minimized. Simulation results show that the proposed method can improve the robot's safety regarding clearance to each other and obstacles comparing to the baseline method without risk minimization.

The tool is intended to support meaningful conversations between two parents. Through conversation and storytelling, the tool encourages them to explore the world of parenting and everything that comes with that. <br/><br/>Parenting always comes with challenges. However, intercultural parents experience added stressors. Being raised in different cultural groups, intercultural parents will probably hold diverse values, beliefs, and attitudes. The more opposing the values are, the greater the likelihood of the parents encountering problems. Values translate into practices which are particular ways of doing something. The challenge for these parents is to reconcile different childrearing practices that have these contradictory aims and goals.<br/><br/>The goal that guided the project is “to support new intercultural parents, in the safe context of their home, in building a family culture that both can rely on and are comfortable with by teaching them to reflect and communicate so that they can create a stable and consistent environment for themselves and their child(ren)”.<br/><br/>PREQUEL is based on a framework comprising of six steps: awareness, understanding, evaluation, appreciation, adjustment, and execution. The framework is a way for parents to work through their experiences and evaluate their behaviour. They are supported in going through the steps, which concludes with them planning how to approach future parenting situations. They do this by identifying shared values and use them as a strength in their daily lives. This will lead to both parents and child(ren) being able to cherish the richness that sharing multiple cultures can bring.","intercultural; parenting; tool; communication; reflection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Huisjes, A.E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","ContextIn a society where sustainability is becoming more and more relevant, coal-burning kamado barbecues are more popular than ever in the Netherlands. From an ignited barbecue a significant amount of energy is lost through heated air. This brings up an interesting design opportunity; “Is it possible to design a product which proposes a more efficient use of the energy of a kamado barbecue?” This project investigates the possibility to design a product powered by energy lost during the process of a barbecue. It has been executed for the company 200Fahrenheit, a relatively young company that is specialised in ceramic barbecues known as kamados. The company is growing rapidly and where most competitors seem to barely change, the company is eager to invest in innovative products and sustainability in general to stay relevant in the future.Approach The foundation of the process was the classic double diamond design approach, consisting of Research &amp; Analysis, Conceptualisation, Embodiment and Final Product. The outcome of the Research &amp; Analysis phase brought valuable insights from extensive desk research to qualitative interviews with users and vendors. It led to a defined persona with valuable needs, preferences and frustrations. From the embodiment part of the process, the aim was to deliver answers to the high risk/high reward assumptions. The emphasis lied on the functionality and feasibility of the implemented technology, which was crucial for the company to know whether or not it was fruitful to continue developing. Research by design, design by doing and prototyping proved to give insights in a time efficient manner.ResultThe result of the project is a product that is able to keep food warm in a container at the right temperature after it has been grilled. The temperature of the container can be set to match the needs of the user. It was found that most heat energy was lost via the chimney of the kamado, which made this a suitable location to harvest energy. The energy that powers the product is completely recovered from the hot air that exits the kamado when it is ignited, in the form of heat energy collected by water. The water transfers the heat to the container, warming up the container. The electricity used by the system is generated by this residual heat as well using Peltier elements. Peltier elements are small electronic plates that are able to convert a temperature difference to electricity. This temperature difference is provided by the water which is always under 100 degrees Celsius, and the outgoing air of the kamado which when ignited, virtually always exceeds 100 degrees Celsius.The product empowers the user to take advantage of the normally wasted energy. Where kamado users were already putting an incredible amount of effort in their dishes, the product now enhances their dish until the last moment where it is presented to the table, under perfect conditions.","sustainability; barbecue; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); van Rhee, C. (graduation committee); Helmons, R.L.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The deployability, regarding mobility, of Boskalis trenchers, is currently determined by practical knowledge. The lack of theoretical knowledge means that risk assessments in the tender phase are less accurate. This reduced accuracy has two negative consequences. First, the trencher may fail. Secondly, the safety margins can be too large. Both consequences result in additional duration and costs. This research considers two ways of failure. The first one is slipping; as a result of this, the track does not have enough traction, which causes the tracks to turn while the trencher does not move forward. The slipping can happen in two ways. The first way is due to soil failure with the grousers fully penetrated. This results in the trencher digging itself in. The other way is that the grousers are not penetrated and the trenchers slips due to the tracksoil interaction. In order to prevent the trencher from slipping, horizontal stability between the soil and tracks should be obtained. The second way of failure is that the trencher sinks into the soil. Vertical stability between the applied pressure and the bearing capacity should be achieved to prevent this kind of failure. In this research a model has been developed that can approximate the operating range of different trenchers. With the help of these operating ranges, the model can make risk assessments in an early phase of the project. There will be little knowledge about the soilspecific parameters and the exact external conditions in this phase. Should there be a risk in the area of mobility along with the project, the model is also able to provide a more indepth analysis. In addition, the model aims to apply to different types and sizes of trenchers. The research answers the following question: ”Which different operational environments and soil conditions have a critical influence on the deployability of a subsea tracked trencher regarding the vertical stability and horizontal stability of the soil¬track interaction system? The model considers the trencher’s mobility in terms of vertical and horizontal stability, where the axes rotate with the slope. Meyerhof’s effective area method approximates the vertical stability. This method is used to take into account the eccentric loads. A traction calculation model approaches horizontal stability. Based on the penetration depth of the individual elements of a track, a shear mode is determined. The available traction force per element can be calculated using these shear modes using the Mohrcoulomb shearing theory. With a case study for the CBT2400, the research question is answered. In this case study, we first look at the different external processes that influence mobility. In addition, the various soil parameters and trencher dimensions are examined. Finally, the results of this study will be compared with two reallife projects. The results show that the mobility of the trencher is better in granular soils than in cohesive soils. In cohesive soils, the trencher’s mobility depends on the external factors that change in the driving direction, like pitch slopes and currents that have a frontal impact. In cohesive soils, the sensitivity is a vital soil parameter besides the undrained shear strength. Since the sensitivity is not included in the soil research, it is recommended to do it in future projects. In granular soils, external factors from all angles must be taken into account, like pitch and roll angles and currents from all directions. With granular soils, especially the relative density and internal friction angle are essential; in addition, the grain size must be taken into account. The grain size influences the permeability of the soil. The permeability, together with the relative density, determine if contractancy and dilatancy will take place in the soil. It could be interesting to change the grouser and track dimensions to improve the trencher’s mobility. However, this depends on the circumstances in which the trencher would have to operate. The model was validated using two cases involving the Borssele and Moray East projects. An important conclusion is that the model can be used to estimate the potential risk areas reasonably. However, it is recommended to test the model in predefined circumstances and soil parameters.","Trenchers; Mobility; Subsea","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-06","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Vroon, Jered (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Robotic delivery services can provide contactless delivery, a highly sought-after service under mandates of social distancing since the coronavirus pandemic has arisen. With the rise of autonomous delivery robots, humans' and robots' collaborative existence has become a crucial topic to be discussed. This graduation project aimed to explore the autonomous delivery robots' specific perception of the world through various factors: their purpose, intent, state, mood, personality, attention, responsiveness, intelligence, and capabilities, and through this understanding, design unique robot emotions that will foster them to communicate their unique needs. Since autonomous delivery robots have different concerns than people, they require different emotions. A speculative design approach has been utilised for this project. Speculative design serves two distinct purposes: it enables us to think about the future and critique current practice. It is based on imagination, imagining other worlds and alternatives, creating provocations, and raising questions, innovations, and explorations.<br/><br/>Throughout this project, several exploratory research methods were conducted to understand the delivery robots' worldview. Following, four unique robot emotions have been created. These emotions aim to serve particular concerns of the delivery robots on sidewalks. The proposed four unique emotions are called Donsul, Trittity, Loniformi and Puffalope. An online survey was conducted to examine whether people could distinguish these unique robot emotions from human emotions. The survey results show that people assumed that the robot is more likely to experience emotion when it experiences an adverse event, such as a barrier to executing its task. The project's value is not what it achieves or does but what it is and how it makes people feel, especially if it encourages people to question everydayness in an imaginative, troubling, and thoughtful way and how things could be different. <br","Delivery robot; Robotics; Emotions; Interaction design; Behaviour; Speculative design; Design fiction; Exploratory research; Creative design; Creative Research Techniques","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Lanzafame, R.C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Dutch Water board revised their guidelines for the safety assessment of dikes in 2017. A major change for the assessment of macro-stability is the use of the SHANSEP method to estimate the strength of impermeable cohesive layers. The failure probabilities are estimated with a deterministic analysis using limit equilibrium methods. The use of design values and safety factors to account for uncertainty is basic and proven to be conservative leading to over engineering.<br/><br/>In this thesis, it is investigated how the SHANSEP method can be incorporated to the more advanced Random Finite Element Method. It is found that three random fields for SHANSEP parameters S,m and POP are required. The random fields do not show particular trends in mean or standard deviation. A random field generator is coded in Python. a simple version of the in-house FEM is modified to read the generated random fields. This code is used to test various geotechnical assumptions. <br/><br/>A final version of the assumptions is coded into a more advanced version of the simulator to do the comparison. The output of the FEM code are the FOS and failure mechanism of a single evaluation with a combination of three random fields. A mean and standard deviation of the FOS results are calculated. The probability of failure is estimated by the area under the probability density function of a lognormal distribution for values below unity. The probability of failure of the deterministic case is estimated using the First Order Second Moment method. <br/><br/>The results show that the probability of failure is overestimated in a FOSM analysis by one order of magnitude compared to the most conservative RFEM simulation. It is expected that this difference is even higher for the more conservative deterministic approach the Dutch guidelines prescribe. The slip surfaces of RFEM were found to be similar to their deterministic counterpart. The RFEM slip surfaces went through local weak zones in random fields.<br/><br/>It is recommended to Dutch policy makers to investigate the use the random finite element method. Although conservatism is preferable in safety assessments, an conservatism of this significance compared to the RFEM approach is unnecessarily costly.","SHANSEP; SHANSEP NGI-ADP; macro stability; RFEM; FEM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Arkesteijn, M.H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Op de huidige Nederlandse woningmarkt heerst een krapte, waardoor de doorstroming van de woningmarkt is vastgelopen. Er is sprake van een kwantitatieve en een kwalitatieve mismatch op de woningmarkt; zowel in aantallen als in type woningen sluiten vraag en aanbod niet op elkaar aan. Hierdoor zijn de instroomkansen of doorstroomkansen voor starters en jonge gezinnen verkleind (Van der Heijden &amp; Boelhouwer, 2018). Om de doorstroming weer op gang te brengen, is het noodzakelijk om een oplossing te vinden, waarmee de mismatch in de toekomst kan worden verkleind. In dit onderzoek wordt de rol van de empty-nester als belangrijk onderdeel van de oplossing gezien. Empty-nesters bezitten veel eengezinswoningen, wonen ruim en kunnen in de toekomst meer zorgbehoefte verwachten (Crutzen &amp; Hagen, 2020; Daalhuizen et al., 2009). Wanneer de empty-nesters verhuizen en daarmee woningen voor starters of jonge gezinnen beschikbaar komen, kunnen verhuisbewegingen en daardoor de doorstroming op de woningmarkt weer beter op gang komen (Buys &amp; Hu, 2018). De empty-nesters verhuizen in de meeste gevallen echter niet, omdat zij in hun huidige situatie nog geen goede alternatieven zien (Rli, 2020). Omdat veel empty-nesters deze stap zelf niet zullen nemen, zullen zij uitgenodigd moeten worden om deze verhuisbeweging wel te gaan maken. Het doel van het huidige onderzoek is om inzichtelijk te maken wat de effecten zijn van sturingsmaatregelen, gericht op empty-nesters, op de doorstroming op de Nederlandse woningmarkt. Hiervoor is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: ‘Hoe kan de impact van sturingsmaatregelen gericht op de Nederlandse woningmarkt en het uitnodigen van empty-nesters om te verhuizen inzichtelijk gemaakt worden, met als doel de doorstroming op de woningmarkt te vergroten?’ De Raad voor de leefomgeving en infrastructuur (hierna: Rli) (2020) en de Raad voor Volksgezondheid &amp; Samenleving (hierna: RVS) (2020) onderschrijven het belang en de noodzaak van het maken van beleid om verhuisbewegingen, en daarmee de doorstroming op de woningmarkt, op gang te brengen. Zo wordt door de Rli (2020) een toetsingssysteem aanbevolen die de impact van sturingsmaatregelen kan testen. Om een antwoord te kunnen geven op de onderzoeksvraag, is de woningmarkt in zowel de huidige als toekomstige situatie geanalyseerd aan de hand van het DAS-raamwerk van De Jonge et al. (2009) &amp; Van der Zwart et al. (2009). De gegevens voor de analyse komen van het reeds beschikbare databestand van het WOoN2018. Er is een operationeel onderzoek gedaan met als uitkomst een product dat inzichtelijk maakt wat de effecten op de doorstroming van de woningmarkt zijn van sturingsmaatregelen, zoals verhuisvergoedingen, grondprijssubsidiëring, collectieve woonvormen en sociale woningbouw, welke zijn gericht op het uitnodigen van empty-nesters om te verhuizen. De ontwerpcyclussen van Hevner (2007) zijn als basis gebruikt bij het creëren van dit product. Om het product vorm te geven, is een lineair programmeringsmodel gecreëerd, dat kan doorrekenen wat de effecten zijn van sturingsmaatregelen op de doorstroming van de woningmarkt. De resultaten uit het ontwikkelde model in het huidige onderzoek laten zien dat door het toevoegen van duurdere woningen aan de woningmarkt er meer verhuisbewegingen plaatsvinden. Deze verhuisbewegingen worden vergroot wanneer er bij de nieuwbouwproductie rekening wordt gehouden met de voorkeuren van empty-nesters. Bovendien wordt door deze verhuisbeweging van empty-nesters een reeks verhuizingen teweeggebracht, waardoor er aan het einde van de verhuisketen woningen vrijkomen voor starters. De resultaten wijzen tevens uit dat er een nieuwbouwproductie van 1,5 miljoen woningen nodig is om tot het jaar 2040 aan de groeiende vraag te kunnen voldoen. Tot slot laten de resultaten zien dat het uitnodigen van empty-nesters om te verhuizen bijdraagt aan het verkleinen van zowel de kwantitatieve als de kwalitatieve mismatch. Concluderend laat het huidige onderzoek zien dat beleid, specifiek gericht op het uitnodigen van empty-nesters om te verhuizen, getest kan worden op de gevolgen voor de doorstroming van de woningmarkt door de impact van sturingsmaatregelen inzichtelijk te maken aan de hand van een lineair programmeringsmodel.","woningmarkt; lineair programmeren; doorstroming; overheidsingrijpen; Empty nesters","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

They can be used for various useful applications such as urban planning, visibility analysis and estimating the solar irradiation and energy demand of buildings throughout the day. Nowadays, Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) sensors are one of the most commonly used technologies for the acquisition of cheap, fast, dense, and reliable 3D point cloud datasets. At the same time, increasing attention has been focused lately on the utilization of these 3D point cloud datasets for the reconstruction of 3D city models. The 3D representation of a scene in the form of a 3D point cloud facilitates a variety of analysis tasks like object recognition, segmentation, and classification, which are an important prerequisite for many building reconstruction methods. Thus, having an accurate classifier that can automatically assign 3D points a respective semantic class label is of utmost importance as it can significantly reduce the time and cost required to analyse 3D scenes. Training machine learning and deep learning algorithms to perform this task has been the focus of many recent scientific works that provide promising results and insights for future work.<br/>This thesis attempted to create an accurate Random Forest Classifier for LiDAR point cloud datasets using the Actueel Hoogtebestand Nederland 3 (AHN3) dataset as training data. The aim was to assist building reconstruction methods, and for this reason, only three semantic class labels are assigned to the points by the classifier, namely ground, building and other. Multiple experiments were conducted to test how large the training dataset needs to be, what features should be included and what point density the input point cloud needs to have for the classifier to perform well. Tests were also made using the DALES dataset to evaluate the performance of the classifier for different datasets and environments. Moreover, the time and memory required to train and test the various Random Forests models and the evaluation metrics of the results were stored as benchmarking research to provide insights and guide future work.<br/>The classification approach that was used consists of five major steps. First, the input point cloud is uniformly sampled and then spherical local neighbourhoods of the points are computed in multiple scales. Height and eigen-based features are then extracted for each local neighbourhood, and the best subset of features is then used to train the Random Forest Classifier. Finally, each point of the input point cloud is assigned to the same class as its nearest neighbour in the sampled point cloud. A comparative analysis shows that the performance of our final Random Forest model stands in parallel with that of other available, more complex, deep learning algorithms if we take into consideration its simplicity and efficiency.","LiDAR; Random forest classification; 3D city models; AHN3","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Therefore, to promote sustainable and high-quality urban development, it is necessary to improve the building permit application process and accelerate the digital process of building permit checks. <br/><br/>Many studies about the digitalization of building permitting use the BIM, mainly coded in its reference open standard IFC by buildingSMART, to check compliance. However, many regulations need to consider some building context that is not supported by the current buildingSMART. This will affect the permit checks of these building contexts. The use of 3D city models for building permit checks is an alternative to BIM. 3D city models are powerful tools for city-level analysis and they can do extensions on different City Objects which able to cover the building context in the regulation, therefore it has good applicability to problems related to urban planning.<br/><br/>At present, there are little researches on building permit inspection based on 3D city models, so this study aims to provide an approach to use 3D city models and its extensions to support digital building permit checks. CityJSON has advantages over the CityGML data format in the development process, so it was selected as the 3D city model used in this study.<br/><br/>The first step is to choose the regulations for building permit checks. This involves the interpretation of the regulations, formalization process. In this study, the use case research method was selected, and the parking standards for cars and bicycles in Rotterdam were selected as the research object. We built a logic-based mechanism to map the content of the law to the corresponding 3D model. Next, we built the CityJSON conceptual model, which included four types of urban objects and expanded them. Then, the data we obtained and the data model will be stored and extended in a CityJSON model and then used for calculation and analysis in the developed tool. <br/><br/>Finally, through the tools developed, we successfully carried out a parking legal building permit inspection on the new building test data and stored and visualized the results.

It aims to strengthen the character of the existing and what is left from the Garden City design, while at the same time reacting to the future needs of the city. <br/>The green urban design concept of the Garden City will be translated into a green architectural design by using algae. Algae is a relatively underdeveloped type of greenery within the field of architecture, but has an immense potential to become the pioneer in climate proof and circular building. Through experimental exploring, the algae lab of the Living City tests new sustainable initiatives and products, applicable for architectural design. Eventually, the gained research and knowledge will be applied into the ecological restoration of Rotterdam. The public algae park that runs through the building gives an insight in the algae-innovations that are made. It explains the visitors of the park how the building system works and brings them in connection with algae-architecture in the built environment.<br/>While densifying the area, the project reuses the existing context and maintains the historical character of the Garden Suburbs and the complementing architecture of the Amsterdamse School. The vacant school complex on the site will become part of the project and is brought back to life with 55 housing units that fit inside the old classrooms. To create a flow in the existing rental housing market, the project provides three types of housing: two classes of social housing and one class of medium rent housing. The housing is a one of a kind project where all the benefits of the algae-architecture are experienced. Living in a green and healthy building with a strong social structure is the main goal of the residential part of the project. The shared green spaces aim to bring the residents in touch with each other resulting in a social network inside the complex. The ambition to provide big green spaces for all residents inside city centres is one of the main features of the housing complex. <br/>The translation into an architectural design is made with a large algae-canopy structure with algae-panels on top, which is the main element of the climate design and forms the eyecatcher. The panels are closed bioreactors that produce algae biomass. The biomass is transported to the technical rooms of the research institute, where the heat is taken out. The biomass is further transported and burned to produce energy. The open algae raceway ponds are used to clean air and water. In total, the algae ponds can reduce 6 ton/year of CO2 in the air. The complete building aims to be self-sufficient and independent from other sources.

The device is designed to cyclically stretch the cultured lung epithelial cells to recreate breathing strains, and allows for flow of culture media to recreate shear stress on endothelial cells due to blood flow in the capillaries. The design process involved coming up with an initial dimensional design with the help of COMSOL models of the device. The dimensions were further tweaked on the basis of test results for membrane stain. In comparison to the state-of-the-art LOC devices, which either fail to recreate the strain type or fail to incorporate media flow in a way that recreates blood flow accurately, the device strikes a balance between providing the cyclic strain and providing shear stress. The design focuses on making the device convenient for the end user to set up and use. It allows for direct seeding of the cells in the chip and live imaging of the cells during the experiments.","Organ-on-a-chip; Lung-on-a-chip; Microfabrication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

In many situations, a high degree of infusion accuracy is essential as deviation from the intended dose can quickly become dangerous and moreover costly. Electronic infusion pumps provide the most accurate way of infusion, but they require programming and frequent maintenance. Furthermore, they are unsuitable for austere environments, costly, and could even become scarce in times of a pandemic. Gravity infusion combined with a drop counter could pose an interesting alternative. However, this method appears to be inaccurate over time and setting an accurate flow rate is challenging. The typically used flow regulator, a roller clamp, is the cause of these complications. This study aimed to design and develop a precise and accurate manually controlled over-line flow regulator for gravity-driven infusion. The design process consisted out of three design phases: analysis, synthesis and evaluation. During the analysis, the design requirements were set up. The synthesis phase consisted of generating a morphological overview and several pincher experiments. A pincher is used to clamp the tubing to regulate the flow rate. Then, promising partial solutions were selected, and through rapid prototyping, a final design and prototype were developed. In the evaluation phase, the flow regulator prototype was evaluated based on the set requirements. The developed DropAdjust prototype demonstrated a major performance increase in terms of mean flow rate accuracy and regulation control compared to the roller clamp. In conclusion, the DropAdjust satisfies all tested design criteria and outperformed the roller clamp in terms of accuracy and precision. Moreover, it even showed a mean flow rate accuracy error comparable to the infusion pumps. Thus, the DropAdjust combined with a drop counter provides a more affordable and accessible alternative to the infusion pumps. The prototype is already practice-ready, but several steps are still needed to realise a market-ready device. For instance, conducting endurance tests and acquiring injection moulding advice from an experienced specialist are advised. Also, additional tests are necessary to verify its safety and functionality to qualify for a CE marking.","IV; intravenous; flow regulator; roller clamp; DropAdjust; infusion; flow controller; gravity infusion; IV therapy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

Intermittent energy sources such as solar and wind energy need to be accompanied with temporary energy storage to accomodate the times when production and demand do not match. Hydrogen is an energy carrier with a large mass energy density as it can be made completely green through electrolysis and it will not release greenhouse gasses when used to produce energy through combustion process. However it has to be stored in large enough volumes to reach the required energy demand. The storage can be done in the subsurface in either aquifers, depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs or salt caverns which are giant porous or cave volumes available to store compressed gases. At this moment, there is a lack of knowledge for safe and efficient hydrogen storage at reservoir (continuum cm and above) scale and pore scale (micrometer-scale). In a reservoir model the relative permeability and capillary pressure are key parameters to characterise flow behaviour and capacity. These are upscaled parameters we can find through pore-network modelling, among other approaches. For a pore-network model, the contact angle and accompanying wettability characteristics (i.e., interfacial tension) are important to obtain reliable upscaled functions and parameters.<br/>Through the use of a captive bubble method, in this thesis work, we have been able, for the first time, to characterize the contact angle of a hydrogen/brine/rock system at different pressures, temperatures, salinity's and rock compositions. It was found that the contact angle of a hydrogen/brine/rock system is in the range of between 21.1 and 43 degrees. Moreover, for the studied range of varying parameters, the contact angle stayed remained relatively constant.

The enterprise risk management methodology addresses all the risks of an organisation to reduce the negative effect and seize opportunities. In recent years, there has been increased emphasis on data-driven work, including within the risk management domain.

In the meantime, people start to pay more attention to mental health issues and Artificial Intelligence is developed and applied in many different fields. Recently, there are many studies been done on using Conversational Agents for mental illness. There are also applications of preventing suicide with Conversational Agents. In the Netherlands, 10.4 suicides happened per 100 thousand inhabitants in 2019. 113 Suicide Prevention is a Dutch national organization with a mission of pursing zero suicides. They are providing multiple services to help people with suicidal thoughts, including a self-test for evaluating suicidal risks anonymously. Even though, people who have taken the self-test receive some suggestions from the 113 websites, they might not contact the 113 helpline for further help. However, it is significant for people with suicide ideation to disclose their thoughts in order to reduce their intention of committing suicide. Therefore, a conversational agent was designed and developed to upgrade the suicide self-test service, which was aiming to resolve test-takers barriers towards contacting the helpline for human help. With the service, the conversational agent interacts with users to help them take the self-test and persuade them to reach for further help by relieving their worriers. A double-blind mixed designed experiment was conducted with 147 healthy general participants and two conditions (traditional questionnaire and interactive service) to verify the hypotheses and evaluate the service. It was hypothesised that participants would have more motivation to contact a helpline for further professional help after taking the self-test in an interactive way than taking the self-test in a traditional questionnaire way. The results showed a significant increase in the traditional questionnaire condition comparing to the interactive service condition. For participants' satisfaction and perceived usefulness, these are higher in the traditional questionnaire condition than the ones in the interactive service condition. In conclusion, the proposed interactive self-test service did not show an expected potential of increasing people's motivation to contact a helpline for professional help. However, the traditional self-test with a textual barrier intervention section showed the potential to motivate people’s help-seeking behavior comparing to the proposed interactive self-test service based on the experiment.","Conversational Agent; Suicide Prevention; Barrier Intervention; Self-Test","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Rapid urbanisation caused by economic development and annual population increment affects the housing situation in the country. In addition, climate change has increased the prevalence of natural disasters, such as floods, typhoons, rising sea levels, tidal movement, and heavy rainfall. In the city of Hagonoy, citizens struggle with the effects of natural disasters, particularly in housing conditions. Typically, locals employ ad-hoc solutions suchlike raising the dwelling one floor higher every few years, which is a costly and inefficient solution in the long term.<br/>The Filipino society is a close-knit ecosystem formed by different stakeholders with contrasting interests and needs. When combining the stakeholders with the increasing environmental pressures, it becomes an even more complex problem. This thesis presents an exploration in implementing long-lasting solutions in coastal rural areas to form resilient communities in the light of the arising problems. <br/>A holistic approach is necessary to generate a neighbourhood that corresponds to the living conditions and resists natural hazards. Firstly, literature and historical research were done to study the events that generated the current society. Secondly, participatory design sessions involved the end-user in the designing process and explored their daily needs. Then these insights were brought together in a system map of people, elements and spaces, and a city map, visualising locals' desires for the future community and analysing the solution space. Finally, the co-design of a floating neighbourhood was conceptualised based on an existing pilot floating home and the required living conditions. <br/>The generated hybrid neighbourhood shows potential to create a resilient neighbourhood where the citizens' desires are placed in the middle of the community planning. Accessibility, sociability and incrementality attributes were perceived as vital to ensuring social acceptance. <br/>The neighbourhood extension illustrates the community's possibility to grow and increment in a non-invasive manner while respecting the dynamics of the existing city. On this basis, the concept of co-creating a hybrid neighbourhood should be considered when designing resilient communities in coastal rural areas in the Philippines and countries under similar circumstances","Floating neighbourhood; Co-design; Urban Development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When you discover the diseases too late the vision will be irreversibly damaged. For this reason, diabetic people are screened preventively. In the past, this happened every year but now only every three years, all to save costs. Artificial intelligence is a promising technique in the field of eye disease detection, it is able to detect based on just a fundus picture if asymptomatic eye diseases like glaucoma or retinopathy are developing. It has the potential to make diagnosing these diseases easier and more affordable. But while AI systems often perform good in labs, the introduction in the real medical world often fails. This project focuses on designing an AI service around an AI eye detection algorithm using a human-centered approach. The goal is to create an AI service that fits and will be adapted in the clinical workflow of the different medical specialists.<br/>The project is done for the company Ksyos, this is a digital healthcare institute in the Netherlands. The service is built on top of their current ophthalmology service. The new AI service uses besides ophthalmologists and optometrists also opticians. Opticians will in the new service do the pre-diagnosis of eye diseases, they do this by taking a fundus picture and run it through an AI system. This will filter out a lot of people who do not need the expertise of an optometrist. In the current ophthalmology service, 90% of the people screened have healthy eyes. The AI service will not be just a screening service but will be a disease detection service, which means that the GP needs to count on the validity of the results of the system. To guaranty the quality, the AI system will split the patients into three categories, green for people with clearly healthy eyes, red for people who have a severe case of an eye disease, and orange for people who probably have an eye disease. The orange and red patients will be sent based on the severity of the disease and the kind of disease to an optometrist or an ophthalmologist. Explaining the results of the AI screening will not be the responsibility of the optician. The optician does not have the knowledge and the capabilities to explain the results calmly and clearly to the patient, Ksyos will take over this task from him. Ksyos will send a letter with the results to the patient that explains calmly and clearly what the next step in the diagnosis will be. While the optician does not have to interact with the AI system the optometrists does, he needs to understand why the AI system makes certain decisions. They need to know what the AI system has found and where. This way they can interpret the decision of the AI system and decide if they agree with this or not.","service design; Artificial Intelligence; Healthcare","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Sustainable public procurement is only implemented in around 10% of the Dutch public procurement tenders (Yu et al. 2020). One of the reasons for the lack of implementation is the added complexity to the job of the procurement specialist. MVI platform helps these procurement specialists by guiding them through this complex task. During their work they found out that a lot of potential positive impact is lost at the start of a project. The most potential for impact is found in the civil construction sector, due to the size of its projects. Because of this potential, the graduation project is aimed at stimulating sustainable public procurement for civil construction projects. This graduation project focusses on the design of an intervention at the early stages of a project in order to start creating more positive social and environmental impact. This is done through the design of practices that support a pragmatic and collaborative approach. During these practices, a mix of vision, management and execution stakeholders come together to share ideas, discuss and prioritize in order to decide which role sustainability should play within the project. The community of practice theory and boundary object theory as well as the SDG procurement compass from MVI platform were used to give shape to the practices. During the graduation project, two practices were created in the form of online workshops. The first workshop focussed on the definition of sustainable ambitions within the project. During the second workshop, the participants formulated measurable goals and made a list of actions and key stakeholders. The workshops were tested during multiple case studies, and iterations on the workshops were made based on the received feedback. After iterations, the early stage intervention, also called SDG impact kick-off, is designed to be a set of three workshops. The ambitions -, actions -, and stakeholders workshop. Although it was not possible to measure the actual impact of the workshops on the projects that were used as case studies, the feedback and results from the workshop seemed promising. The workshops clarified how sustainability could be implemented and helped to create a concrete implementation plan. A plan that helps project leaders with integrating sustainability and helps procurement specialist with setting up sustainable public procurement procedures. All in all, these collaborative practices are believed to aid in the creation of more positive sustainable impact in construction projects. The workshops of the SDG impact kick-off form a beginning of a practice that makes sustainability an integral part of any project.","Procurement; Sustainable procurement; Workshop; Design; Construction sector; Collaboration","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://open.spotify.com/show/6T1w8pZyeKlUX97snPBbjx Spotify link to the podcast","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

It is a cold winter afternoon and the sun is already setting. I hear the rhythm of water pulling back and passing under another wave of water. The beach is full of people many of whom presumably visit this place for the same reason as I: “uitwaaien”. While walking in the wind, I empty my mind of thoughts which have been floating around in my head that day. I find comfort in being together with the wind, the sand, the sea. “Uitwaaien” is a Dutch word that is not directly translatable to another language. It involves an activity, yet also a feeling, an experience, a change in mood. What intrigues me as an architect is that this shows that an environment has such strong influence on a person’s well-being. Architects are constructors of environments and therefore I believe that by researching and using the coastal environment as a laboratory, architects can learn to better understand how to design an environment that results in positively affecting its users. To explore the topic, the coastal environment around the harbour of Scheveningen becomes the laboratory. Around Scheveningen harbour, few buildings are left which remind me of the fishing industry which used to be the occupation for most of Scheveningen’s inhabitants. Fish is still one of the most important industries around the harbour, yet the labour has moved inside large box-like warehouses and factory-like ships. Now that the fishing industry is taking less space in the harbour, new offices, apartment blocks and warehouses are starting to appear. These new developments are a reflection of what is happening on a national level and global level. In the case of The Netherlands, the political and economic structures are creating a commercial environment in which housing developers start new building developments at a fast pace and with low budgets. The lack of action by the state in developing houses and the large housing shortage in most cities adds to this problem (Hulsman, 2021; Hulsman &amp; de Voogt, 2020; Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties, 2020). Designs, therefore, are often reduced to the minimum standard of living as set by the building codes. The result is distanced and generalised architecture without thoughts on how these environments could positively affect the user’s well-being (Hannema, 2019) (Pallasmaa, 2012, p. 34,37). In words of Juhani Pallasmaa: “homogenisation of space weakens the experience of being, and wipes away the sense of place” (Pallasmaa, 2012, p. 50). So, the new buildings in the harbour stand in a strong contrast to the spatial characteristics of the coastal environment which provide many positive effects.

Even though the hyperloop concept is still in a conceptual phase, there are already several companies working on it. Here in the Netherlands, Hardt Hyperloop is developing its vision. The hyperloop is a new mode of transportation that requires a lot of public-private collaboration from diverse sectors, generating an ecosystem. Hardt is a very technical focus company that has problems communicating its vision concerning the hyperloop. Without a good communication strategy between Hardt and the stakeholders, the hyperloop ecosystem will not reach its full potential. Good communication is required internally between members, but also externally with the stakeholders. Due to COVID-19, Hardt is facing how to keep alive the ecosystem with a working-from-home situation. Remote meetings are not as engaging as face-to-face meetings. Onboarding new stakeholders through virtual conferences, instead of visits to the Head Quarters, was not effective at all. The communication through text with other stakeholders who were already part of the ecosystem was not fluent. Hardt with the pandemic situation started to have difficulties reaching their milestones. This could affect the development of the hyperloop. Currently, the video conference tools used are obsolete (Teams and Zoom). As an alternative, a virtual environment where to showcase virtual prototypes was proposed. The concept is called Hardt Digital Lab. It is a multi-user review platform that can be accessed from the web browser, avoiding installations for those who want to participate in the design process. The platform can be accessed with PC and smartphone. Virtual Reality is also a possibility but cannot be used through the web browser. Communication with interactive visualizations improves significantly. A prototype was developed with Unreal Engine 4 to prove this concept. The project was evaluated by Hardt members with positive feedback. Even though they considered the environment to had simple but effective functions, they thought it could have promising features in the future. The main concern was to adapt the environment visualization to the workflow of the company.","Virtual Reality; Collaborative; Hyperloop","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

To find these kind of guidelines, I started my graduation at the Explore Lab studio at the TU Delft with a research. Parallel to a literary study, I researched people, their social relations, space, objects and architecture through observational studies relating to social sciences (short-term ethnography, qualitative fieldwork inquiry, praxeology). I found patterns in elements relating to social relations which enabled the drafting of design principles. Through the design of a programmatic hybrid city building in Rotterdam, challenges of social isolation were explored and addressed across scales. Not only the space in and around the home, also the workspace in or outside the home is important to consider within this problematic. In the design proposal, social relations are considered in for example the route through the building, sightlines between spaces within the building, in the program, and in the didactics and details of the facade.","Social relations; Social isolation; Interdisciplinary research; Dwelling design; Home; Workspace; City building","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

(mentor); Peng, D.L. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Today’s climate change creates a serious issue, which forces us to act by reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions across every sector. Making changes towards a sustainable world takes time and creates competition. Hydrogen has the potential to fuel a ‘clean’ economy because it is a carbon free energy carrier that can be produced from fossil fuels as well as renewable resources. This makes hydrogen the energy carrier of the future and a candidate to introduce into the European energy system. This thesis presents a geospatial techno-economic analysis on the potential of large scale low-cost green hydrogen production in Europe and North-Africa. Low-cost implies a production price lower than 1.5 €/kg. Large-scale means a minimum production amount of 1 million tons per year. Current energy market developments show enough reasons and possibilities for green hydrogen production. Europe’s energy system still consists mostly of fossil-based fuels and introducing green hydrogen could counterpart this state. But is there sufficient potential for low-cost large scale green hydrogen production? The research question is therefore: . What is the potential for low-cost large-scale green hydrogen production in Europe and the Mediterranean region in 2030 &amp; 2040? With GIS, a techno- and economical model the production price is visually depicted. System boundaries and design of a large-scale green hydrogen operation are needed for modelling. The geographical hydrogen potential visualizes the suitable areas. The technical hydrogen potential is determined by the yield of the solar and/or wind system. The economic hydrogen potential is determined by the Levelized costs of hydrogen. There are enough areas in Europe and North-Africa for low-cost green hydrogen production in 2040. The solar PV system shows large potential against low-costs in North-Africa in 2040. The results show that for the solar scenario the LCOH ranges between 1.6 - 4.6 €/kg in 2030 and 0.9 - 2.7 €/kg in 2040. The wind turbine system can produce against low costs in North-Africa and North-Europe in 2030 and 2040. For wind the LCOH ranges between 1.5 – 5.3 €/kg in 2030 and 1 – 3.5 €/kg in 2040. The solar and wind combination shows the highest amount of potential against the lowest costs in 2040 and least amount of space used. The solar and wind combination shows the lowest price range in 2030 and 2040 of 1.5 – 3.7 €/kg and 0.7 – 1.8 €/kg. Including transport and storage costs for baseload hydrogen adds around 0.1 €/kg per 1000km for transport and 0.1 €/kg for salt cavern storage. This research shows that large scale low-cost green hydrogen production has a substantial potential in South Europe and a very large potential in North-Africa. But North and Central European countries do not show sufficient large-scale low-cost hydrogen potential and will need to import from South Europe and North-Africa. The final potential and prices for the three different scenarios in North-, South Europe, and North Africa are depicted in the table below. The countries considered as North-Europe are Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ireland, UK, Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Austria, Slovenia, Hungary, and Slovak republic. The countries considered as South-Europe are Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Croatia, Romania, Turkey, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania, Bulgaria, Moldova, and Macedonia. The countries considered as North Africa are Western Sahara, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Iraq, and Syria Even with the rough estimations in the models, the results of this GIS-based research give a good first estimate for the geospatial large-scale low-cost hydrogen production potential. Using a geospatial techno-economic analysis proves to be a suitable method to visualize the future hydrogen production price. The geographical hydrogen potential is accurately depicted by the GIS program, but it comes with its difficulties with datasets. The technical hydrogen potential is based on today’s knowledge of future technology, but the factors may vary in the future. With the used cost input data, the levelized cost of electricity and hydrogen are comparable with other studies. The area size criterion used in the GIS modelling needs to be analyzed in more detail to show the total production potential of an area.","GIS; Hydrogen; Geospatial analysis; Techno-economic analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Automated electroencephalography (EEG)-based depth of sleep monitoring enables real-time continuous study of sleep in PICU patients without the need for visual assessment of the EEG signals, the gold standard. This study aims to evaluate the classification performance of various index measures and machine learning models for sleep monitoring in critically ill children.   Method: Two EEG-index-based approaches, calculated as the ratio gamma/delta and of gamma/(theta+delta) spectral powers, as well as three machine learning models - decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) - were trained and evaluated. The classification into three as well as four sleep states was evaluated. Polysomnography (PSG) recordings of 120 non-critically ill patients were used for model optimization, training and internal validation. As a proof-of-concept, the models were tested on the PSG data of 10 PICU patients.   Results: Whereas the machine learning models outperformed the index-measures in both three- as well as four-state classification in PSG recordings of non-critically ill children, the opposite was true for the PICU PSG data. Best results for PSG data of non-critically ill patients were obtained with the XGBoost model, with a 5-fold cross-validation accuracy of 0.79 (± 0.01) for three-state classification. Performances for PICU PSG data were remarkably worse for all models. The best results for PICU data were obtained with the index-based approach (accuracy = 0.60) and the gamma/delta and gamma/(theta+delta) performed equally. The individual assessment of model performances per PICU patient revealed large variation between them.   Conclusion: A simple index measure is a promising method to monitor sleep in PICU patients. Machine learning models developed in non-critically ill patients cannot easily be applied to PICU patients in whom the sleep EEG is frequently deviant. Future efforts should focus on further tuning, training and validating the classification models with more PICU data.  ","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine | Sensing and Stimulation","",""

(mentor); Brand, D.I. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","We are used to having access to a wide range of products every day of the year. Technology and import enable this offer, as fresh products were initially seasonal bound. The topic of seasonality is often researched and discussed in the light of sustainability and health. The focus is either on how to reduce food miles or why a connection with nature is beneficial for our wellbeing. However, there is an intuitive side to seasonality that is often forgotten. The overall goal of this project is to make seasonality a positive experience. Instead of focusing on restrictions (limited offer per season), the focus is on what is available. The approach for this project is social practice theory. It prescribes to not target one single form of behaviour, but analyse the whole system around it. This way, you can create links and build a system between factors that is supportive. By changing the system around a person, the behaviour changes automatically as a result. The focus is thus not on nudging or creating awareness in one specific type of situation. Qualitative user research is performed, following the contextmapping method. This enables participants to give input by reflecting on what they think, want and need. By using a sensitizing package, a reflective state is triggered in the participant. From the contextmapping research, four design directions were derived. Focusing on the circularity and continuity of the seasons seemed most promising. The design goal is formulated as wanting to enthuse a group of friends to organise a festive get-together over food to celebrate the fresh products of a season, based on traditional seasonal celebrations. The resulting design is a concept called Gaia. It is targeted at a group of friends. They can organise a seasonal celebration together, according to a tradition that has aged or has merged with Christian celebrations. The main idea is that everyone brings something to the table. This can be food, drinks, an activity or decoration. The user can indicate which task they’d like to perform on the website. The concept consists of an inspirational package that the users receive at home with specific inspiration and guidelines for their tasks. The box is received two months in advance, which gives you time to prepare different elements (e.g planting seeds to pick for making flower decorations or infusing liquor to make limoncello). The focus is on seasonal, local and fresh products. Gaia gives a group of friends a reason to celebrate the season, without unnecessary obligations. You can put as much effort in as you like. The focus is on celebrating the seasonal products and going with what is available. It is an opportunity to create your own rituals and traditions with friends. User evaluation showed that the tone of voice appealed to the target group and that the participants were eager to put effort into their tasks as they got enthusiastic by the box. They tried to make a lot of things from scratch with fresh ingredients. The amount of knowledge about the products they’ve used also increased. For future development, the most important task is to design the website to enable a complete test with the whole scenario. Social media channels to promote it can also be tested this way.","Seasonality; contextmapping; social practice theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Stored entropic energy in a polymer could act as driving force for this closure. To make proper use of this concept it is important to develop characterization protocols able to relate entropy release to gap closure dynamics and ultimately to polymer architecture. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMA) and Laser Speckle Imaging (LSI) have previously been used in separate studies to quantify entropic energy change and measure local polymer dynamics, respectively. This work aims to develop an LSI-based protocol able to relate entropic induced length changes measured in DMA to polymer relaxation dynamics. To this purpose a set of non-healing epoxies with different molecular weight between crosslinks was tested both in DMA and LSI. A recently developed analysis protocol was used to extract, from DMA data, the entropy change at the glass transition region related to displacement (i.e. shape memory effect). With the help of a micro-tensile tester and a temperature control system, LSI allowed quantifying the local dynamics of the studied polymers as function of temperature and strain. The overall relaxation dynamics in stress relaxation tests measured with LSI were then compared to the DMA results. A relation between the strain relaxation dynamics in LSI, crosslinking density, entropy release and tan δ variation with temperature was found. This was done by comparing the frequency and intensity of local displacements measured with LSI to delta length and tan δ obtained with DMA. Furthermore, this research revealed an interesting discrepancy between local strain relaxation and stress relaxation times, as the local strain relaxation time extracted with LSI was shown to be longer than the overall stress relaxation time measured by the micro-tensile tester in the same test. The characterization and data analysis protocol explored here paves the way towards experimental methods that allow a more direct correlation between coating design parameters, such as crosslinking density and chain flexibility, and local entropy driven damage closure.","Polymer; Relaxation; Dynamics; LSI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

But until all vehicles are completely automated, there will be a transition period where automated vehicles and human drivers coexist. Because these road users will coexist, it is necessary that automated vehicles understand human drivers and vice versa. This study aims to create a model that predicts human risk perception in different driving scenarios, to provide an understanding of the fundamental features of human threat perception while driving. The model created is a multi-criteria decision-making process that uses KITTI Vision Benchmark data as an input. This model is tested against the data gathered by an online survey, where 1918 participants answered the question: ""How high is the risk on a scale from 0-10?"" for 100 situations, chosen from the KITTI Vision Benchmark data. The survey response data is then compared to the model. Analysis of the survey data revealed that risk perception of driving situations is non-linear in the extremities of risk, showing that the input image are perceived as normally distributed instead of uniformly distributed. The comparison further shows that a model with features and weights solely based on literature is only slightly capable of predicting the risk of situations with a Pearson correlation coefficient with the survey responses of 0.28, whereas a model with feature weights optimised is moderately capable of predicting the risk of situations with a correlation coefficient of 0.57. However, multivariate regression is better capable of predicting risk with a correlation coefficient of 0.70, and shows that features and weights based on literature were not enough to establish an accurate model. The features that have the most impact on the result are the information about other road users' location and heading, the ego vehicle velocity, and the road type. Further research should focus on determining if speed is the cause of the perceived risk, or if it follows from other unknown predictors. Furthermore, an extension of the questions asked of the participants and the usage of videos instead of images can clarify the discrepancy between the literature-based model and the perceived risk of the participants.","Intelligent vehicles; Vulnerable road users; Driver; Threat perception; Risk perception","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Human Factors","",""

The APD variability assessment framework is customised to deal with log-transformed correlations’ uncertainty. Moreover, it is found a large dependency on Atterberg limits for claylike soils parametrisation. Only one set of correlations from CPT database is found in literature to obtain these limits, for which a new set is developed based on critical state soil mechanics and the assumption that the CPT friction sleeve is similar to the remoulded undrained shear strength. The proposed correlation is validated with a published database, showing acceptable results with similar variability when compared to the existing equation. A first validation of the complete model parameters for fine-grained soils using Plaxis Hardening Soil with small strain stiffness model is achieved. The Plaxis Soil Test facility is used and the results are compared with triaxial and oedometer tests, showing good results in compressibility characterisation and low estimation of friction angle, possibly attributed to organic and silt content. The friction angle characterisation is discussed, and it is concluded that a better estimation for fine-grained soils is needed to be studied. Further studies on soils in between claylike and sandlike behaviour is needed, as well for organics.","parameter determination; Atterberg Limits; cone penetration test (CPT); Plaxis Hardening Soil model; log-transformed correlations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor); Veerakumar, Nidarshan (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","As a power system evolves in size and complexity due to energy transition, the focus on the stability of the power system becomes more imperative than ever. Power system stability is tested when the system is subjected to large disturbances. Consequently, a conventional protection scheme is always deployed to take quick and automatic actions based on localized measurements, to restore the power system to a steady operating state. However, in many cases, further remedial actions by the system operator are necessary to avoid cascading failures and eventual instability problems. The introduction of phasor measurement units in the form of WAMS has led to improved awareness and<br/>hence, better, capability to take remedial actions. In particular, the vast amount of data provided by the PMUs have led to the development of data-driven machine learning applications to aid the system operator in maintaining stability. One such application is power system event classification. In general, event classification is achieved using supervised and unsupervised methods. A review of pioneering literature reveals that offline models trained using both these methods can achieve a high order of classification accuracy. However, in a realistic, online setting with streaming PMU data, there is a possibility<br/>of new, unknown events appearing in the data stream. In such a case, Offline<br/>models which are trained on a limited number of known classes are unable to adapt to new class data. Therefore, there is a necessity for event learning applications that are capable of incrementally identifying new classes that appear in the PMU data stream. Hence, this thesis proposes the event clustering algorithm which performs in two stages – label correction stage and new class labeling stage. In the first stage, the algorithm corrects the class labels predicted by a supervised model, and flags and collects new incoming event instances through a shape-based similarity measure, i.e. DTW measure. In the subsequent second stage, it incrementally clusters the collected new event instances using Time-Series k-means clustering, where the hyperparameter of the number of clusters is automatically determined using a silhouette score clustering metric. The results of this algorithm show successful detection of new power system events with high classification accuracy. Also, final improvements are suggested to overcome certain drawbacks of the algorithm listed in the thesis.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-10","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

The new NDCs should go beyond the commitments made in the previous cycle and reflect the ""highest possible ambition"" (UNFCCC, 2015). However, there are significant differences in the level of ambition between countries' NDCs (Tobin, 2017), leaving room to reflect on why some countries have included more ambitious mitigation targets in their pledge compared to others. A literature review revealed two gaps, whereby further research on NDC ambition should focus on comparing countries at the global level (first gap), while considering combinations of influencing national factors (second gap). There is a multitude of national factors that influence NDC ambition. Hall's (1997) ""Ideas, Interests and Institutions framework"", serves as a theoretical checklist in policy making (Walt et al., 2008), and is used to organize the variables. Based on recommendations from previous research (van Coppenolle, 2002; Lamb &amp; Minx, 2020), a fourth "" societal"" category was added to the framework. The main research question is therefore: How can national conditions (ideas, interests, institutional or societal) explain the presence or absence of ambition in a country's Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement? The aim of this study was to explore what combination of national conditions influence the ambition of NDCs submitted to the PA and therewith, being able to provide recommendations for national policymakers, decision-makers and more specifically the governing bodies of the Conference of the Parties (COP), who are the decision-makers of the UNFCCC, seeking to understand collective progress. Firstly, to identify the most relevant national conditions that affect NDC ambition, a desk study was performed. This led to the identification of six national conditions in total. The national conditions selected and analyzed in this research were corruption, democracy, individualism, dependency on natural resources, vulnerability to climate change and a country’s wealth. In this report, an NDC was considered ambitious if the pledges were consistent with a fair share effort to hold warming below 2°C. In contrast, an NDC was considered unambitious if the commitment was inconsistent with a fair share effort to hold warming below 2°C. A fair share effort is based on what a country its total contribution would need to be to implement the PA. In total, the ambitiousness of NDCs of 32 countries and the European Union have been compared, which together account for 80 percent of global emissions (CAT, 2021). As a main method, it was decided to apply a fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). fsQCA is a configurational approach, which considers the possibility that NDC ambition is the outcome of a combination of factors as opposed to the sum of net effects (Ragin &amp; Fiss, 2008). This method is selected as a main method over other statistical approaches, such as regression analysis, because NDC ambition is a complex issue for which it is assumed that the conditions do not act independently of each other. However, to check whether this assumption is correct, and to see whether a statistical approach might give additional insights, a series of bivariate correlation analyses have been performed as well. In addition, two semi-structured interviews were conducted to verify that the results were valid. The two interviewees have been selected and approached based on their expertise on subjects related to the comparison of national climate commitments and their expertise on which factors explain their success and the lack thereof. The results of the fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis and the correlation analysis have been combined and provided insights into why certain countries submit ambitious NDCs, and why other countries submit non-ambitious NDCs. In total one configuration is obtained that is sufficient in explaining the submission of ambitious NDCs, and four configurations are obtained that is sufficient in explaining the submission of non-ambitious NDCs. With fsQCA, a configuration is a set/combination of conditions that explains a certain outcome. It is found that the combination of not being dependent on natural resources and being vulnerable to climate change is sufficient to explain the submission of ambitious NDCs. When such a country also has a low gross national income (GNI) and is corrupt, there is an even greater likelihood that the submitted NDC is ambitious. Regarding the submission of non-ambitious NDCs, it is found that being dependent on natural resources and/or not being vulnerable to climate change is sufficient to explain the submission of non-ambitious NDCs. When a country presents either one of these two factors, it is already adequate to submit an unambitious NDC. Besides these (core) conditions, the chance of submitting an unambitious NDC is even greater when the society of a country is rather collectivistic, meaning people easily sacrifice individual benefit for the success of a group. It was more difficult to draw general conclusions regarding the effect of GNI or corruption. The fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis showed that the obtained configurations are sufficient, but not necessary to occur. In general, this means that knowing the configuration to be true, is adequate grounds to conclude that the outcome (NDC ambition) is true; However, knowing that the configuration is not to be true does not necessarily mean that the outcome (NDC ambition) is not true. This highlights the need for good governance, monitoring and decision-making processes. Additionally, in 2023, the global stock take will take place, in which the collective progress made towards achieving the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement will be assessed. The aim of the global stock take is to become a driver of ambition. Based on the findings of this research, recommendations for policymakers and decision makers have been established. The recommendations are of interest to all climate policy and decision-makers, but perhaps even more so to the governing bodies of the COP, who are the decision makers of the UNFCCC. The first recommendation is based on the finding that five different sufficient configurations have been identified, which shows the need for tailored strategies. For example, specific taxes can be introduced for countries that are highly dependent on natural resources, making it less attractive to show little ambition in their NDCs. The second recommendation is to emphasize just transitions principles. This recommendation is based on the finding that GNI plays an ambiguous role, and that countries with ambitious NDCs set unrealistic goals in the hope to receive financial support. Policymakers and decision-makers should focus on achieving an equitable transition, addressing country-specific challenges, and sharing the benefits of achieving PA equitably. This implies a fair distribution of both the expenses and the gains. The third recommendation is the use of iterative risk management. This recommendation is based on the finding that being vulnerable to climate change is a prerequisite for submitting ambitious NDCs. It is likely that more countries will become vulnerable to the climate as global surface temperatures rise. Iterative risk management is a framework for making decisions in such complex contexts that are marked by large potential impacts, long timeframes, and multiple climatic and non-climatic influences that change over time. Evaluating a wide range of potential impacts is critical to understand when submitting NDCs.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

However, the life expectancy for children who suffer from a chronic illness continues to increase considerably. This results in a focus on long-term effects of disease and the quality of life for diagnosed children (Van de Putte, E. M., &amp; Van der Ent, C. K., 2019).This project is a collaboration with the Wilhelmina Children’s hospital in Utrecht. In this thesis, the meaning of wellbeing in a pediatric hospital is explored and defined through literature studies and generative sessions with patients, family members and staff in the WKZ. The aim was to implement the insights from the research in a redesign for the activity room in the hospital. The design goal derived from the research outcomes was to give patients of the Wilhelmina Children’s hospital the tools and empowerment to create control over their environment and autonomy over their activities in the hospital, which will be enhanced by stimulation of social involvement among patients within the hospital. Using a participatory approach, patients and former patients of the WKZ were involved in concept development through an idea generation session. Two initial concepts were tested in the WKZ, which led to the establishment of the final concept. The final concept is a spatial design for the activity room focused on the free, independent exploration and play of children. The design gives children the opportunity to control their own playing environment with geometric lightweight blocks or to find a place of their own in cavities in the wall. It stimulates social interaction among children through a semi-transparent playing wall and allows them to express and leave their personal creativity. The results from the final concept test in the WKZ were used to establish a Vision for future designers who work in a similar context. In this vision, the insights from the research and testing sessions of this project are stated as design opportunities with possible solution areas that can improve patient wellbeing in a pediatric hospital.","Patient wellbeing; Pediatric hospital; Design for children; Playing interactions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","As the construction of sub-aerial and submarine geotechnical structures increase in amount, rate and size, so do their associated risks. Often, with use constitutive models, finite element analyses (FEAs) are performed in order to identify and mitigate these risks. NorSand, which is a consti- tutive model based on critical state soil mechanics for particulate materials (e.g., sand), is one of the first models to integrate the state parameter ψ into its constitutive framework to model dense and loose sands material with the same parameter set. Importantly, it is able to identify the liquefaction potential as it can simulate softening behaviour due to pore pressure increase of loose soils in undrained conditions. Since NorSand has recently been implement into PLAXIS, a geotechnical analysis software capable of performing FEAs, it must be verified, validated and applied with the software, which is done in this report. First, stress-path and parametric analyses were conducted at single stress points. The stress- path analyses show how the state variables evolve for different triaxial conditions. Systematically changing the input parameters to extremes found in literature helped determine their influence on the evolution of stresses and strains. The resulting figures can be used to help future calibrations to experimental lab test data. The PLAXIS implemented NorSand (PLAXIS NorSand) was verified by comparing it with an implementation written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA NorSand) by the authors of the model Jefferies and Been. Verification in this context means determining if PLAXIS NorSand is able to produce outputs as intended by the authors. Various testing conditions, both triaxial and direct simple shear, showed overlap and agreement between the outputs of both implementations, verifying PLAXIS NorSand. Then, the model was compared to, albeit not in a traditional sense, an ’analytical solution’, which is the relationship between the mobilized friction ratio Mi and state parameter ψ in its simplest form. The mobilized friction ratio and stress ratio at peak strength of PLAXIS NorSand and the ’analytical solution’ were compared. The values between both showed less than 3% difference, further verifying PLAXIS NorSand. The constitutive model was then validated - i.e., established that PLAXIS NorSand is able to approximate soil behaviour as intended. First, by using the soil parameter set that had been derived from lab tests of Erksak sand as a baseline, the input parameters were varied until PLAXIS NorSand was calibrated to individual triaxial tests as best as possible. Then, triaxial tests of Erksak, Nerlerk and Ticino sand were approximated with PLAXIS NorSand without changing the soil parameters determined from lab test data. PLAXIS NorSand is able to follow lab test data decently well with one parameter set. And if one decides to take the time and calibrate individual lab tests, and deviate from soil parameters determined from a set of lab tests, they can be matched even better. Additionally, it showed a consistent need for activation of the softening flag (S = 1) in order to appropriately model loose soils in undrained conditions. Furthermore, NorSand exhibits indefinite hardening in dense soils during undrained loading, which can be avoided by employing a ’cavitation cut-off’. The last part of this report tested PLAXIS NorSand by applying it in FEAs of a simplified submerged landslide, which was subjected to 20 centimeters of displacement at the crest through a rigid slab in undrained conditions. First, the difference in slope behaviour due to change in soil density within NorSand was determined: dense soil resulted in the slope to be able to bear the full 20 centimeter displacement, whereas increasing the void ratio (i.e., increasing the positive value for the state parameter) gave the effect of even quicker slope collapse and a lower bearing capacity. In other words, when using NorSand, the looser soil the further the failure surface moves up and the quicker the structure fails to maintain equilibrium. Lastly, NorSand was compared to Modified Cam-Clay and Mohr-Coulomb to highlight the differences in their ability to model static liquefaction, while being triggered by unrealistic loading conditions. Even though none of the FEAs showed actual liquefaction, since it is accompanied with the fluidization and loss of structure, they still gave in indication of the liquefaction potential. NorSand, contrary to the other constitutive models, showed the expected high sensitivity to forced displacement resulting in clear shear bands resembling Prandtl-type failure mechanism and early onset soil body collapse.","NorSand; Critical State Soil Mechanics; Liquefaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

(graduation committee); Druijf, Gijs (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","class=""MsoNormal"">In recent years, the increased need for renewable energy has put more interest in wind energy and therefore in making wind turbines more efficient and building them as efficiently and cheap as possible. Delft Offshore Turbines (DOT) is developing a drivetrain that replaces the heavy and expensive parts in the nacelle of a wind turbine and makes these parts more accessible and aims to improve the reliability of the wind turbines by replacing the parts that are most prone to failure.  Due to the innovative design of their drivetrain, several unknowns still have to be answered since this has never been tried before. One of the most important parts of this drivetrain requires rolling contacts that endure high contact stresses and have to operate for a long time in harsh conditions. These rolling contacts have to be tested and for this, DOT created the Roller Test Bench (RTB) to test different materials and material combinations until failure and to see what type of failure is occurring and what the lifetime of these rollers is. The rollers are a lot smaller compared to the rollers found in the drivetrain to reduce cost and testing time. The scaling of the dimensions has been done several times in different fields of research but it is unclear how this affects the results and how the results translate to the original rollers. In literature some papers have stated that the results scale in a certain way but this has not been proven or the statements have not been argumented in a clear way such that these statements hold no ground.  A rolling contact has several ways that it can fail; wear, deformation, corrosion or fatigue are most commonly found. From the literature study performed in this thesis it has been noted that the main mode of failure in the RTB is rolling contact fatigue since the rollers are smooth, have no lubrication applied, are free of external contaminants and have no significant amount of friction on the surface. With the stress applied and the material used it is also noted that the fatigue will occur after a high amount of cycles and in literature this is also called high-cycle rolling contact fatigue. Experimental testing of such problems takes a very long time, even if the rollers are smaller and are run faster through the load cycles.  With both problems stated, the lack of information on the influence of scaling on fatigue life and the testing of high cycle fatigue, the goal of this thesis was found and it was to find a method to predict the lifetime and wear mechanisms of rolling contacts in the DOT Direct Drive Pump. This method could then be used to figure out how the scaling affects the fatigue life for rolling contacts and make a possible statement of its influence.  From the literature study a numerical modelling method was found that incorporated the microstructure and included both crack initiation and propagation and was able to model high cycle fatigue. This model suited the problem the best and was proven to provide results that agree well with previously performed experiments and their experimental results. This method implemented a Voronoi tessellation to reproduce the microstructure and applied continuum damage mechanics to calculate the damage evolution and apply the damage to the microstructure. A jump-in-cycle method was applied to improve the efficiency of the model and greatly reduce the time to model until failure. The created model is able to reproduce subsurface initiated fatigue and with that produce a scatter and L10 life comparable with previous models and experimental results. The model was validated by comparing the stress distribution, crack formation and the initiation and total lives with other models and data. The model was off the required range since the models uses an homogeneous isotropic material which causes the scatter to be lower.  With the model created and validated, it was applied to several different half-widths to test how the scaling affects the fatigue life. From the results it was noted that for a larger roller size the fatigue life decreases but it has to be noted that further tests, experimental and numerical, have to be done and improvements to the model have to be made such that at some point a correlation can be made between the scaling and the fatigue life. Further recommendations were provided on improving the model and with that creating more reliable results such that a better prediction can be made on how the fatigue life is affected but also to predict the life of a rolling contact.","RCF; CDM; Voronoi; rolling contacts; Rolling contact fatigue; high-cycle-fatigue; scaling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-09","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","DOT 3000",""

The different femur shapes needed for this study can be created using a statistical shape and appearance model (SSAM). The workflow of the combined bone growth and remodeling model has been (semi)-automated for increased efficiency and other future uses. Methods: An algorithm was created that leads the user through a (semi)-automated workflow, where the necessary features are added to the simulation. The model uses remodeling and growth simulations in sequence to estimate both the change in density distribution and in shape. The used loading conditions correspond to the 10% gait cycle phase. The remodeling is driven by strain energy density, and the growth by the osteogenic index. Results: The resulting density distributions are similar to those found in other studies, while the growth model predicts larger changes in the neck-axis angle than other studies. The growth was also predicted for two MRI pilot scans and the predicted growth was similar to the growth found in follow up scans of the same children. To investigate the influence of the bone shape on the development on cam-deformities, three different shape modes were varied and their influence on the osteogenic index in the growth plate was analyzed. The results from this study indicate that an increased femoral neck-axis angle increase the growth stimulation in the cam region of the growth plate. Discussion: The created bone adaptation model performs mostly as expected, only the included growth model occasionally performs unreliably. To improve its reliability, recommendations have been given to improve its behaviour. Because of the increased growth stimulation in the cam region of the growth plate, the results indicate that femurs with a large neck-axis angle have an increased risk of developing cam type deformities. The effect of other shape characteristics is unclear, and more research is recommended to investigate the effect of other characteristics, such as the femoral anteversion.","bone adaptation; bone growth; Computational modelling; SSAM; statistical shape and appearance model; femur; FEM simulation; cam deformities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-09","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

This process has always been a crucial subject for companies in numerous industries. A company could significantly improve its business performance if the scheduling process is not performed optimally. As companies and products become more and more data-driven, new tools to improve processes are emerging. Robust job scheduling methods optimize job schedules with job duration uncertainties. Typical robust scheduling methods only use straightforward statistical metrics such as the job duration and variance. Data relevant to the process' job duration, stored as observational data, is not typically used in robust job scheduling methods. A field of research that is concerned with the use of observational data is causal inference. It can be applied to observational data to explain causal variable behaviour and therefore also the statistical metrics used in the scheduling process. In addition, it can be used to predict variable behaviour after certain variable modifications. This motivates our search for an approach that uses the tools of causal inference on available process data to identify the causal relations within these job processes. Based on this information, it predicts the effects of parameter modifications. These predictions are incorporated in the scheduling optimization to potentially further improve the job scheduling performance.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Undiscovered underground cavities might exist in the subsurface. A catastrophic ground failure event follows when such a cavity starts to migrate upwards and finally intersects with the surface, resulting in a sinkhole. Catastrophic collapse events are usually preceded by precursory subsidence. An upward migrating cavity causes the development of a (subsidence) trough at the surface. The trough deepens as the cavity nears the surface, changing its surface expression. With the technique called InSAR, displacements over a large area can be measured. Literature shows that precursory subsidence is measurable using InSAR. However, automatically detecting impending sinkholes from InSAR displacements has not yet been researched in depth. This study shows that the developed novel arc-based temporal strategy can early detect an impending sinkhole. The kinematic model is adequate to model the surface expression of an impending sinkhole. The results are used to implement an artificial sinkhole based on the kinematic model into a subset to test the developed strategies. The first strategy was based on spatio-temporal characteristics of a sinkhole. This strategy can locate the subsiding area and indicate a surface expression size range. However, during this study, a second strategy was developed to identify anomalous behavior quicker and more reliable than the spatio-temporal strategy. The second strategy is arc-based and marks point measurements behaving anomalously. The result demonstrates a potential automated early warning system based on the InSAR displacement time series. The developed strategies harbor the potential of monitoring for impending sinkholes on a large scale. This study is anticipated to be a starting point for more development in early warning systems for impending sinkholes. Future research could entail verifying the strategies in regions with collapsed sinkholes.","Sinkholes; InSAR; Early Detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

The lack of awareness about the city’s environmental, socio-demographic or socio-economic characteristics or the absence of a clear vision of the local government about how to deal with new mobility providers plays a crucial role in this. The design of a new tool called ‘cityzona’ can aid in creating a better connection between local government and mobility provider by making urban planners and/or designers more aware of the relations between variables influencing the modal split but also by improving the communication about the city between stakeholders. This paper aims to take the first steps in the development of the cityzona by designing early versions of the cityzona in an iterative process. For the design of the cityzona quantitative data is used in combination with semi-structured interviews. The results are qualitatively interpreted for the creation of the cityzona concept. Interviews showed that the cityzona has potential to function as a tool to align stakeholders for the design of a long-term mobility strategy as well as a tool for exploring and reinventing city level services for the implementation in different types of cities. Regardless of the function, the cityzona provided most useful in the early stages of a design process. However, more research is needed on the use of cityzonas in practice to further validate the fit with these potential functions.","Cityzona; Persona; Design tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Recent numerical studies have suggested the ability of surfaces with streamwise-preferential permeability to reduce turbulent friction, and a theoretical framework behind the working mechanism has been proposed. This work is the first experimental study on this concept in air and in which the permeability requirements for predicted drag reductions are met. Three different physical realisations of streamwise-preferential permeable substrates were manufactured: two seal furs, a substrate with unidirectional fibres, and a 3D-printed structure. They were investigated through wind tunnel experiments using direct force measurements and planar (2D-2C) particle image velocimetry (PIV). Results show an increase in drag for all test specimens and suggest that drag sources other than surface friction are non-negligible. One-point turbulent statistics show an overall increase in turbulence, mainly wall-normal velocity fluctuations enabled by the wall-normal permeability, which results in higher Reynolds stresses. No significant flow modulation in terms of turbulent events or change in coherent structures is observed. The measurements and results are a first of its kind and none of the theoretical framework predictions on drag reduction or flow modulation are found. Based on analytical derivations relating characteristic length scales to permeability, the validity of the framework and its assumptions in experimental settings is questioned. It is thought that there is an inherent mismatch between the pore size assumption and the virtual origin approach taken in the framework. All things considered, it is deemed unlikely that turbulent drag reduction by means of streamwise-preferential permeable surfaces is feasible in experimental settings. Nevertheless, given the relatively small increase in drag for the 3D-printed specimen, streamwise-preferential permeable surfaces might be interesting for other (flow control) purposes involving turbulent boundary layers.","turbulent boundary layer; anisotropic permeability; passive flow control; drag reduction; direct force measurement; Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-09","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

But as the number of expensive cost function evaluations required for a full exploration of the search space grows exponentially with the increasing number of dimensions, the use of standard global optimization algorithms is also not practical. To overcome this obstacle and to lower the dimensionality of the problem, the use of an autoencoder for model order reduction is proposed. In the resulting lower dimensional space, standard global optimization methods can then be utilized, as fewer cost functions evaluations are necessary. For problems with comparatively more expensive cost functions, this optimization includes the employment of a surrogate model, which reduces the necessary number of these computationally expensive evaluations further. This proposed method is then tested firstly on a number of benchmark functions, where it shows the ability to find global optima under certain conditions. Secondly, the proposed method is used to solve a compliance minimization problem, where it shows the ability to improve upon a large number of designs generated by local optimization.","Autoencoder; Global Optimization; Topology Optimization; Deflation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Precision and Microsystems Engineering","",""

Therefore, it is common that the as-built lattice has discrepancies from the designed lattice structure in mechanical properties. The main aim of this study is to simulate the transient temperature field of lattices during SLM process to predict the possible manufacturing issues for the improvement of product quality. Based on a technique, the moving grid method, growing struts of a lattice whilst it being built by SLM can be regarded as moving domain problems, and thermal process of a building lattice can be simulated numerically. The primary contribution of this study is to evaluate the effect of process parameters, including laser power, energy density and material deposition rate, on thermal evolution of a lattice during SLM. Another contribution is related to the comparison of transient temperature field between different lattice architectures. Analyzing the influences of various factors is important to recognize the thermal evolution of a building lattice.

The agreement relies on the assumption that all participating nations have accurate means of estimating carbon emissions and offsets accurately. However, global carbon emission accounting methodologies lack accuracy in approach and required carbon intensity data of utility grid electricity. From this, a need for developing a standardized accurate carbon emissions assessment methodology arises. The aim of this research is to develop an accurate carbon offset assessment methodology and determine the effect of using marginal, hourly average and annual average emission factors. The methodology is applied to a solar carport system in the Netherlands, consisting of a 465 kWp solar PV system, a 345 kWh nickel metal hydride battery and 16 DC charge points for EVs, in order to quantify the emission offset potential of the respective system components. This research presents a comprehensive literature review of existing carbon accounting methodologies based on which a new accurate methodology to calculate carbon offsets is developed. This methodology uses marginal emission factors from observed power dispatch and computes offsets on an hourly timestep. Application of marginal emission factor results in a 30 % and 23 % increase in carbon offset compared to hourly average emission factors and annual average emission factors, respectively. The carbon offset attributed to the battery system is roughly 100 kg CO2eq annually in 2019 and 1.5 -1.7 tons CO2eq in 2030. Relative to the lifecycle emissions caused by the battery system of about 200 tons CO2eq, including the battery system is not beneficial in terms of mitigating carbon emissions in solar carport applications. 99.96 % of the total offset is attributed to the solar PV system and lifecycle emissions of the solar carport can be mitigated after operation of 1.5 years when excluding the battery. Including the battery, lifecycle emissions are mitigated after 2 years and 3 months. To conclude, the results show that using marginal emission factors results in significant impact on the assessment results and are conceptually more accurate. Hence, they should be applied for carbon offset studies. Additionally, the carbon offset potential of the PV system is high while the contribution of the battery is low and installation of battery systems at solar carports is, therefore, not recommended.","Carbon offset; marginal emissions; carbon accounting; Solar carport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Arts, Martijn (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In this report a collection of experiences at Total Design is presented while looking through a lens of Organizational Designing. The concept of looking through a view-master is used as metaphor for the purpose of this report. To highlight this Organizational Designing, two main questions had to be answered; How can we look at Organizational Designing? Where do we see Organizational Designing at TD and in this project? To recognize Organizational Designing within the ways of working, some existing literature is used to set up its first attributes. By the use of design perspectives like the action-centered perspective (Schön, 1983), a Human Centered Design perspective (Junginger, 2005) and the four orders of design (Buchanan, 2019) we start to make an effort on what Organizational Designing is. Then a view on the complexity of organizations (Norman &amp; Stappers, 2015) and their ‘wicked’ problems (Buchanan, 1992) is given to see on what entity this design process works. This literature overview is closed with some things Organizational Designers encounter and work with, such as the need for ‘satisficing’ (Simon, 1969), the incremental strategy of ‘muddling through’ (Lindblom, 1979), improvisation (Weick, 2017) and designing ‘interventions’ (Stacey et al., 2000). To capture the ways of working at TD various ethnographic methods were used (Hammersley &amp; Atkinson, 2007), such as observation, participation and the use of field notes and ‘thick descriptions’ (Geertz, 1973). Throughout the report examples of these thick descriptions are presented to illustrate the point of view of me as a user of the organization TD. Together with these examples, different frames on how TD as an organization can be viewed are showed to emphasize how complex the definition of what an organization is, can be. The captured experiences are categorized into three areas where Organizational Designing can be seen. The first area is at the interface between TD and its clients, where the design inquiry in projects the collaboration with the use of online tools and the integration of different design disciplines led to organizational impact at the clients side. The second area highlights the organizational designing within TD itself, where observations triggered the process of incremental changes in interaction of the standup, and the evolution of the agency call. As well as how the hourly billing creates tension between the freedom of creativity and the need for having a financially healthy agency. The third and last area the design interventions of this project are discussed. Here, methods of reflection and the use of archetypes challenge the way TD could think about themselves. And reflection-in-action lead to shifting the purpose of a given workshop while doing. In the end we conclude with an overview of how organizational designing at TD can be seen. As well as a discussion on the fact that organizational designing can be seen in other design disciplines, since the design of an organization deals with problems that require integration of problems of communication, construction and interaction. This is why we can see organizational designing on different moments at TD, since they integrate various design disciplines to create organizational impact at their clients.","Total Design; Ethnography; Experience; Organizational design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Current classification approaches are based on vision-based optical data, however these optical data is often not available in training sessions. The aim of the current study is to use machine learning algorithms to classify pitch types, i.e., fastball, change-up and curveball, based on pelvis and trunk IMU data in training sessions. A total of 406 successful pitches thrown by 19 pitchers were used to classify pitch types. Three conditions were tested and evaluated in a binary (fastball versus others) and multi-class (fastball versus change-up versus curveball) classification approach. Condition A included the direct output of the PitchPerfect software, whereas condition B included features normalized by fastball characteristics. Condition C is a combination of both condition A and B. The random forest algorithm demonstrated the best predictions in both the binary and multi-class classification approach based on the highest accuracy and F1 scores, i.e., the harmonic mean between sensitivity and precision. Therefore, the random forest algorithm is the best fit for classifying pitch types based on pelvis and trunk IMU data in training sessions. In addition, the performance of the classification algorithm improved when using a binary classification approach. There were no relevant improvements when using additional features. The random forest algorithm can directly be implemented in the PitchPerfect application. Pitchers can use the pitch type data to track and tune their performances, whereas coaches can use the data to design match and training routines. Future research should focus on larger datasets, i.e., more pitchers and pitches, to pre-classify pitchers with similar pitching characteristics to improve the classification algorithms.","Supervised learning; Sports; Biomechanics; Off-speed pitches","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The natural development of the morphology of rivers in time is important due to the functions rivers fulfil, such as navigability and drinking water supply. Rivers adjust their morphology when there is a change in the river controls, which are mainly the water discharge, sediment discharge and downstream water level. The morphology adjustments continue until a river has reached its equilibrium state (i.e. equilibrium bed slope and equilibrium bed surface sand fraction), which is when all sediment that is supplied upstream of the river can be transported downstream. Even though an assessment of how the river changes towards its equilibrium state is important for the performance of the functions of a river, it is often overlooked. This can for example lead to increased maintenance costs and dangerous situations. A quick method to calculate the equilibrium state of a river can help prevent these negative impacts. The analytical relations by Blom et al. (2017) are a promising method to predict how a river will change, since they give useful and rapid insight in the equilibrium river state. However, the degree of uncertainty of the equilibrium river state as a result of the uncertainty in the input parameters is not yet known. It is recommended to examine this uncertainty before interpreting how a river will change. The aim of this research is therefore to investigate what the range of uncertainty of calculated equilibrium river states is, and to execute a sensitivity analysis to examine which input parameters contribute the most to this uncertainty. The river Waal is chosen as a case study for these analyses. The calculated equilibrium state of the river Waal, including the range of uncertainty, is compared to river state measurements to assess how well an equilibrium state can be identified. A model is created based on the analytical relations, and is used to perform three different analyses; a deterministic analysis that results in a spatially varying equilibrium state without uncertainties, a sensitivity analysis that assesses the influence of each input parameter on the equilibrium state, and an uncertainty analysis that results in a bandwidth of possible equilibrium states. The result of the sensitivity analysis is that the mean gravel content of the total sediment supply and the total sediment supply itself have the largest impact on the uncertainty of the equilibrium state. The result of the uncertainty analysis is that the equilibrium bed slope can be approximately 1.8E-5 smaller or larger than the mean bed slope, with an uncertainty bandwidth of approximately 3.7E-5, and that the equilibrium bed surface sand fraction can be approximately 10% to 20% smaller and 10% to 35% larger than the deterministic bed surface sand fraction, with an uncertainty bandwidth between 20% to 50%, depending on which sediment transport relation has been used. From the comparison between the calculated equilibrium state, including uncertainties, and the measured river state, it follows that the current bed slope is steeper than the equilibrium bed slope, and that the current bed surface sand fraction is either larger than or within the uncertainty bandwidth of the equilibrium bed surface sand fraction. The found milder equilibrium bed slope is as predicted. However, the found equilibrium sand fraction does not match the prediction that the bed surface sand fraction is smaller in the equilibrium state. From the comparison and the results of the uncertainty analysis follows that an equilibrium state cannot yet be identified, because 1) the uncertainty range of the calculated bed surface sand fractions is considered to be too large to predict the equilibrium state of the river Waal, and 2) the equilibrium bed surface sand fraction predictions do not match the expectation. To improve the equilibrium state identification of the river Waal, it is recommended to 1) assess why there is a mismatch between the expected and calculated equilibrium bed surface sand fractions, 2) perform research to reduce the input uncertainty, and 3) validate the equilibrium state predictions.","river; Equilibrium; Equilibrium bed profiles; Waal; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

In order to reduce the assembly and disassembly time of the frame a new type of beam-to-column connection is proposed, a so-called plug &amp; play connection.The design codes cannot be used for the estimation of the structural performance of this connection. Therefor the following objective is deﬁned:What is the structural performance of the plug &amp; play connection and how can the connection be reusable?In the state of art the beneﬁts and problems plug &amp; play connections oﬀer over traditional steel connections is given. A case study of a steel frame, which consists of stacked units with ﬁxed dimensions, is described. For this case study a global analysis is performed to investigate the possible internal forces on the plug &amp; play connection.With the results obtained from the state of art and the global analysis an initial design is made. This initial design assumes a perfect ﬁtted connection.Both the stiﬀness of a column major and minor axis joint is investigated for a hogging, sagging and out-of-plane bending moment. For all cases the joint is classiﬁed as semi-rigid. The inclined parts of both socket and plug will yield for all cases and the highest plastic strain will occur in the inclined parts of the connection. The thin base plate of the socket causes that the socket shows a bending deformation for all displacement cases, this bending deformation makes that the plug will be easier to pull the plug out of the socket, which reduces the stiﬀness. So an optimized design is checked for the minor axis case. For this optimized design the base plate thickness of the socket is increased in order to prevent the bending deformation of the socket. This optimized design also includes tolerances. The optimized design has removed the bending deformation of the socket. For a downwards displacement slip will occur, as a consequence of the tolerances, before contact between plug and socket is initiated. No slip will occur for an upwards or out-of-plane displacement as the bolt will be immediately in tension. So for the downwards case the initial stiﬀness is depending on the contact between plug and socket, while for the upwards and out-of-planed is placement the initial stiﬀness is provided by only the bolts. For all cases the stiﬀness is increased compared to the initial design.The ﬁnal step is to evaluate the re-usability of the connection. The plastic de-formation has to be limited in order to be able to reuse the connection. For the upwards and out-of-plane case, in the optimized design, no plastic strainoccurs in the inclined parts of the connection when the moment is below the elastic moment resistance. This is because the elastic moment resistance is only provided by the bolts. For the downwards case there is plastic deformation in the inclined parts. However, increasing the thickness of the plug has reduced the maximum plastic strain compared to the initial design. So when the moments on the connection are below the elastic moment resistance the connection should be reusable. A visual inspection should prove whether the plug still ﬁts in the socket.A real test should prove whether the plug &amp; play connection reduces the assembly and disassembly time. If this is the case, then the moments on the joint should below the elastic moment resistance, so the connection could be reused. The joints will not be classiﬁed as rigid, so their semi-rigid behaviour should be taken into account in the global analysis.","Beam-to-column connection; Plug & Play; Steel joints","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Using microphone measurements, the location of acoustic reflectors can be inferred. Current state-of-the-art methods for room boundary detection focus on a two-dimensional setting. Detection of arbitrary reflectors in three dimensions increase complexity due to practical limitations, i.e. the need for a spherical array and the increase of computational complexity. The presence of horizontal reflectors cause inaccuracy for wall detection due to model mismatch. Loudspeakers may not present an omnidirectional directivity pattern, as usually assumed in the literature, thus making the detection of acoustic reflectors in some directions more challenging.<br/><br/>In this thesis, a LiDAR sensor is added to a smart loudspeaker to improve wall detection accuracy and robustness. This is done in two ways.<br/>First, the horizontal reflectors that are not present in the acoustic model are sought detected with the LiDAR sensor to enable elimination of their detrimental influence. Second, a method is proposed to compensate for the challenging regions for wall detection in highly directive loudspeakers, using the LiDAR sensor.

Doing so can help mitigate against events such as tourism damage, natural disasters, and war. It also enables access to three-dimensional data for researchers of all disciplines all around the globe to study these artifacts at the same time. Furthermore, future generations can benefit from an online database of archaeological artifacts for educational purposes. Several high-end solutions are available. However, the cost to purchase or leasing can be too substantial for heritage institutions that often run on small budgets. Therefore, there is a need for cost-effective solutions to create high-quality 3D-images of archaeological artifacts. This thesis focuses on the 3D-imaging of small archaeological artifacts. When creating 3D-images of the artifacts, it is important to capture the texture details and preserve color information correctly. An extensive literature study was done on the existing 3D-imaging technologies and systems. It was concluded that photogrammetry is the most suitable technology available to create 3D-images of small archaeological artifacts. Photogrammetric systems have been studied for their ability to create high-quality 3D-images. Literature states that the quality of the 3D-images created with photogrammetric 3D-imaging systems suffers from a small depth of field. By the nature of optics, this small depth of field occurs when photographing an object from a close distance. This thesis provides the design and validation of a cost-effective photogrammetric 3D-imaging system for small archaeological artifacts. This system is optimized for the depth of field and is able to successfully create high-quality 3D-images with highly detailed textures and color information.

A beam model is a simplified method of modelling complex structures out of circular hollow sections. In a standard beam model, no attention is paid to modelling the tubular joint itself. In the model, beam elements of the braces are extended from the surface of the chord to the centerline of the chord. This connection is considered as rigid. In reality, tubular joints possess considerable elastic flexibility through local deformation of the chord wall. It is suggested that modelling local joint flexibly leads to a reduction of member-loads and thereby an increase of predicted fatigue life. A method to determine and model local joint flexibility in a beam model is developed. A numerical test-case is performed to investigate the influence of modelling LJF on the predicted fatigue life of the braces in the stinger. As effect of modelling LJF, the accumulated fatigue damage in the critical hot spots of the braces has changed with factor 0.29 up to factor 2.88.

We apply these techniques and study network and mission level aspects of time synchronization to Orbiting Low Frequency Array for Radio astronomy (OLFAR), a proposed distributed radio interferometer. In the first step, the Frequency Pairwise Least Squares (FPLS) that estimates clock skew and relative velocity in a pairwise setup using only frequency measurements is formulated.

Since frequency domain methods do not estimate clock offset and pairwise range, relying purely on frequency domain estimates is not feasible for various applications. To harness the potential of frequency domain synchronization and ranging, the Combined Pairwise Least Squares (CPLS) has been proposed. The combined method reduces the number of minimum required messages from 4 to 3 compared to current methods and decreases the computational complexity. Using a generic simulation with nodes in pairwise non-linear motion, we show that frequency domain methods can outperform time domain methods in clock skew and relative velocity estimation and that the proposed multi-domain method delivers better clock offset and pairwise range estimation in low to medium SNR conditions. In the second part of our work, we apply the proposed methods to OLFAR –— a space-borne large aperture radio interferometric array platform.

(mentor); Möller, M. (mentor); Toshniwal, D. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This thesis poses a new geometric formulation for compressible Euler flows. A partial decomposition of this model into Roe variables is applied; this turns mass density, momentum and kinetic energy into product quantities of the Roe variables. Lie derivative advection operators of weak forms constructed with this decomposed model naturally follow to be self-adjoint, which results in skew-symmetric discrete advection operators in any number of dimensions. Under certain conditions these conserve products of the Roe variables, leading to a discrete model formulation with advection operators that simultaneously conserve mass, momentum, kinetic energy, internal energy and total energy in compressible Euler flows. While this idea is not new the novelty of this work lies in its extension to mimetic finite element methods and its application to discontinuous compressible Euler flows.The regular geometric Euler model and its Roe variable decomposition have been discretized through mimetic isogeometric analysis. At the core of mimetic discretization methods lies the idea of retaining the De Rham sequence of differential form spaces when projecting these to finite-dimensional approximations and when constructing discrete operators. B-spline differential form spaces have been defined such that the exterior derivative maps in a topologically exact and metric-free way, while the interior product has been discretized in a weak way in order to retain its map between appropriate spaces in the De Rham sequence. Only primal grids are used; the Hodge star operator is discretized through the definition of an L2 inner product to resolve weak forms. Cartan’s homotopy formula allows for a consistent discretization of the Lie derivative through compositions of the interior product and exterior derivative.Several tests were carried out to determine the efficacy and behavior of this regular geometric Euler model, its Roe variable decomposition and the resulting discrete advection operators. Testing one-dimensional linear advection and Burgers’ equation on periodic domains shows that discretizations of the self-adjoint advection operators are consistent with conservative formulations. Sod’s shock tube is used as one-dimensional discontinuous compressible flow test. Both the regular Euler model and its Roe variable decomposition display strong oscillatory tendencies, yet solution convergence is obtained without any issues. While application of a simple moving average-filter removes the worst oscillations more sophisticated methods are necessary for obtaining solutions that are free of unphysical oscillations. The Roe variable decomposition negatively affects the accuracy of shock speed predictions. The presence of strong oscillations likely affects the numerical conservation errors of both methods. Compared to finite volume package Clawpack and the nodal Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method of Hesthaven &amp; Warburton both models have less numerical diffusion on coarse meshes with the regular model outperforming the Roe variable decomposition. Convergence of momentum conservation error is slow and the errors are large compared to the reference methods. For two-dimensional periodic vortices both the regular geometric Euler model and its Roe variable decomposition outperform both reference methods for stationary and moving vortices. Clawpack displays diffusive behavior, resulting in large L2 errors and high amounts of numerical diffusion. While the L2 errors of the DG method are comparable to those of the two models developed in this work for all basis function orders considered, the resulting DG discretization requires significantly more degrees of freedom to attain this. To obtain similar levels of numerical diffusion the DG method needs up to ten times as many degrees of freedom as the methods presented in the current research.","mimetic discretization; Roe variables; Compressible Flow; Euler equations; Advection; Burgers' equation; Shockwave; Isentropic vortex; isogeometric analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double degree in Aerospace Engineering and Applied Mathematics","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Doorn, N. (graduation committee); Dannijs, Natasch (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In the recent years, police violence and discrimination towards minorities have become widely criticized by news outlets and within society. The trust in the police has decreased over the last years as ethnic profiling and the deaths of multiple people of colour have come to light. The police law enforcement and their officers have been criticized for their behaviour, as there has been a disproportionate number of arrests targeting people of minority. However, studies researching the occurrence of discrimination in police law enforcement and its effects, have not been conducted in The Netherlands. This study aims to identify which factors influence a police officer’s decision, as this arguably has the most impact on a citizen, and whether discrimination can occur in these factors. The first step is to identify the factors, which is achieved through a literature review. As not much research is performed in The Netherlands regarding discrimination in police law enforcement, multiple interviews are held with police officers to verify the obtained factors from the studies. This resulted in five factors being identified, namely type of crime, ethnicity, gender, familiarity with the police and group size. The above mentioned factors are used in the survey, which was distributed among the police officers stationed in the bureau Haarlem, North-Holland. The factor ethnicity influences a police officer’s decision for citation. However, contrary to the results obtained from the literature, a Non-Western individual is not more likely to be arrested compared to a Western individual. This study found the exact opposite; an individual of Non-Western ethnicity is less likely to be cited compared to a Western individual. The relative importance of this factor is however very small as it contributes for less than 5% on the decision of a police officer for citation. The other factors that influence a police officer’s decision for citation in this study are mixed gender and type of crime, with a relative importance of less than 8% and 87% respectively. The factors group size and familiarity with the police are not statistically significant, which means that they do not influence the decision of a police officer. There are multiple limitations in this study. First, this study was conducted with a limited number of respondents and hence it is hard to generalize to the population. Secondly, the study was conducted with police officers stationed only in Haarlem, therefore hard to generalize to the police officers in The Netherlands. Thirdly, the results may have been exposed to hypothetical bias. Lastly, the research method can be seen as a limitation as this method is used for consumer preferences and not to explore moral considerations. Lastly, this study provides four recommendations for further research. Firstly, more research must be conducted with regard to discrimination in police law enforcement. Secondly, respondents participating in the study should be increased and multiple bureaus should participate to be able to generalize the results. Thirdly, future research should incorporate the police officer’s educational level. Individuals, who have experience in critical thinking, rely less on profiles in their decisions. Lastly, by identifying heuristics and shortcuts, and researching whether these methods contain possibilities for discrimination to occur, is valuable knowledge to obtain to succeed at the aim of policing for everyone.  ","Choice modelling; Discrimination; Police law enforcement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Although inland waterways (IWW) are considered one of the most reliable transport modes, it is very vulnerable to climate change, more than other transport modes such as rail and road transport. The inland waterway transport (IWT) performance strongly depends on the available water depth in the waterway, which is related to the river discharge. Due to climate change, it is expected that the number of days with low and extremely low discharges will occur more often during summer and autumn and that the absolute values of these low discharges will reduce. It is essential to maintain the current inland waterway transport capacity and promote a modal shift of transport by road and rail to IWT. <br/><br/>The Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathway (DAPP) approach is used as a starting point for this research because the structure and steps cover objectives similar to the objective of this thesis. The essence of the DAPP approach is to develop an adaptive planning that can cope with deep uncertainties that a decision-maker has when the concerned time frame consists of many years in the future. <br/><br/>In step I of the DAPP approach, the objective of the inland waterway transport of dry-bulk and liquid-bulk is defined as performing better than railway transport during periods of low flow. This study considers the inland waterway transport of dry-bulk from Rotterdam to Duisburg and liquid-bulk transport from Rotterdam to Wesseling.<br/>To assess if the objective is met, the transportation costs per ton kilometre of IWT are compared with the transportation costs per ton kilometre of railway transport. The condition for which the IWT value exceeds the railway transport value is called a tipping point.<br/>To determine tipping points in steps II and III of the DAPP approach, a simulation model has been set up in the form of a stress test. The model concept chosen for the simulation is based on the OpenCLSim software package, a rule-based planning tool for cyclic activities.<br/><br/>No tipping points were found for the dry-bulk supply chain, indicating it performs better than railway transport during low flow periods based on transportation costs per ton kilometre. This also implies that no adaptation measures are needed to contribute to achieving the objective.<br/>However, the liquid-bulk supply chain experiences tipping points between 35 and 65 consecutive days of low flow. Two adaptation measures have been analysed for the liquid-bulk supply chain to improve its performance during low flow periods. The first is an adjustment of the maintenance criterion of the waterway. This means that skippers know exactly where the bottlenecks are located so that they can sail around them. This results in a larger available water depth. The second adaptation measure is the availability of a diverse fleet, which means that extra vessels are deployed during low flow but idle during high flow. Adjusting the maintenance criterion results in an extension of the tipping points, and implementation of a diverse liquid-bulk fleet results in a situation where already tipping conditions occur after five days, based on transportation costs per ton kilometre. Based on KNMI ’06 climate scenarios covering a time horizon from 2001 to 2100, an estimation can be given on the timing of the tipping points. <br/>As no tipping points were found for dry-bulk, it can be concluded that the supply chain is a more attractive transport modality than railway transport until 2100. The liquid-bulk supply chain is expected to experience its first tipping point around 2030, but this can be extended to 2072 by adjusting the maintenance criterion. <br/><br/><br","Climate Adaptation; Inland Waterway Transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) is a standard theory for nonlinear pose estimation by modeling state uncertainty to Gaussian distribution. However, EKF has requirements for proper initial estimate and system noise to obtain bounded optimal estimate. Meanwhile, model nonlinearity and non-gaussian noise modeling affect the performance of EKF significantly in practical applications. In this thesis, we focus on improving the performance of nonlinear pose estimation by reinforcement learning. By formulating an EKF measurement update as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), reinforcement learning agents can be trained to learn the estimator gain through data samples and executed as the online estimator for pose estimation tasks. <br/><br/>Based on the above idea, we propose a novel reinforcement learning-compensated EKF estimator (RLC-EKF), where the RL agent serves as a second-time measurement update that subsides the residual error from the standard EKF estimate. The estimator is developed and testified on two specific pose estimation scenarios. Firstly, as a continuous work from the previous study, a framework for 3 DOF orientation estimation using inertial sensor and magnetometer is replicated. Then, the framework is extended by different RL algorithms training and multi-scale robustness validation. Besides, we implement the estimator on a feature-based 2D plane localization framework. The proposed framework shows the feasibility of the underlying algorithm on a localization task with a known map. As a result, the RLC-EKF estimator gives superior performance and convincible robustness compared to classical methods in severe conditions such as varying initial states, degree of noise intensities, and model covariance.","DRL; EKF; Orientation Estimation; 2D Plane Localization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Cognitive Robotics","",""

In order to become carbon neutral by 2050, it is evident that the paper industry must become more sustainable as well. Most of the energy is consumed in the dewatering process. Therefore, optimizing this process is key for efficient operation and reducing the carbon footprint. Since the late 1950's, there have been several models proposed to describe the dryer section of a paper machine. However, the majority did not capture internal transport phenomena resulting in inadequate models for heavier paper grades. In this work, a comprehensive physical-numerical model is developed that describes the internal transport phenomena in multicylinder paper drying. The model solves a set of two differential equations describing the moisture content and temperature in the thickness direction of the sheet. The model can be solved by imposing time-varying boundary- and initial conditions. The model includes unfelted and double-felted cylinders. Correlations for multiple thermodynamic properties are proposed and evaluated. Heat and mass transfer coefficients at the open surface are determined using the Chilton-Colburn analogy. Furthermore, the sorptive characteristics are fully accounted for. In order to find the most applicable thermodynamic properties, the model is validated against data gathered in a field survey, carried out as part of this project. In this field survey, a paper grade of 203 [g/m^2] running at 403 [m/s] was investigated. Temperature measurements were performed in order to determine the conditions per cylinder. A final moisture content and two temperature profiles were used as test criteria to validate the model. Furthermore, the survey gave direct insight on the state of the dryer section: Cylinder 23 was found to be in the flooded state and the warm-up time was too long. The model was found to slightly overestimate the final moisture content: the calculated final wet-basis moisture content at the end of the pre-dryer section was 0.235 [kg/kg], which is 0.022 [kg/kg] above the measured final moisture content. The calculated temperature profiles closely followed measured values. The effect of changing three operating conditions was evaluated. This involved fixing the relative humidities in the pockets, felting the first 10 cylinders and varying the machine speeds. By fixing the relative humidities in the pockets, the final moisture content increased by almost 20%. However, a 60% reduction in volumetric flow rate over the fans could be achieved. Felting the first 10 cylinders results in a 50% reduction in the warm-up length and a 8.9% decrease in the final moisture content. Lastly, it was found that for an increased machine speed, the final moisture content increases as well, due to reduced heat transfer and drying time.

However, with only a small portion of the water on earth being suitable for direct human use and consumption, this growth makes water scarcity an increasing problem. Seawater desalination is an effective method to counter such water stress. Reverse Osmosis (RO) is an efficient desalination method with relatively low energy consumption, where a semipermeable membrane rejects dissolved contaminants present in the feed water. Delft Offshore Turbine (DOT) aims to produce a seawater hydraulic wind turbine that performs this RO process directly from wind energy. However, there are some challenges with this new concept of how to regulate the production of fresh water and electricity optimally. The main challenge in the optimisation of this system lies in the control of the electricity production, which is pressure-based, and control of the fresh water production, which is flow-based, while having a direct influence on each other, as well as that these controllers need a fast direct response to wind fluctuations. An interesting control approach that can handle such multivariate systems is Model Predictive Control (MPC). MPC optimises the overall performance of a system, while handling input and output constraints. A drawback, however, is that the performance highly depends on the accuracy of the system model. This work investigates the use of machine learning to extend the MPC framework, where in addition to a nominal system model, a Gaussian Process (GP) is used to learn unmodeled system dynamics, making it possible to use approximate system models.

Models of initial adsorption and growth of adsorbates are used to verify if certain structures are formed. Structural complexity and diversity of overlayers often determines this growth. Understanding the difference between a clean single crystal transition metal surface and adsorbate covered surfaces at the atomic scale are a first step. Characterization at atomic scale however can be challenging and help can come from electronic structure theory. Much is known about the overlayers of oxygen on a Ru(0001) surface, yet little research has been conducted in understanding the interaction between phosphorus and Ru(0001). In this work the adsorption mechanism of phosphorus on a ruthenium (0001) is studied. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to find optimal adsorption sites on a Ru(0001) surface for P. The four high coordination positions were then used to form distinct combinations upon stacking layers. There it became evident that in the regime of first layers, the adhesion and stacking of adsorbate layers is governed by the Ru(0001) stacking order and highest probable coordination sites on the surface. Upon stacking more layers, the adsorbate layer follows a pattern of ’on top’ stacking with alternating layer heights. The bond distances and lack of electron transfer show a tendency to form P-P bi-layers. Binding enegies within the P-P bilayer (intra-bilayer) are stronger than binding energies between successive bi-layers (inter-bilayers). Latter one being dominated by VanderWaals forces. A minimal analytical sum of binding interactions is proposed to the surface and bilayer energies showing an accurate description of the DFT results. Bilayer formation and weak inter-bilayer interactions indicate the possibility of formation of two-dimensional phosphorene structures. At last as a point for future work possible supercells are constructed an tabulated that could accommodate adhesion of phosphorene (oxide) structures with minimal strain.","DFT; P; Ru; Adsorption; Surface Chemistry; Phosphorus; ruthenium; Stacking; growth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These often very detailed sensor data could be utilized by many different parties in order to improve services. This same tendency is seen in the automotive sector, where lots of data are gathered by newer and smarter cars. However, despite the fast data collection, car businesses seldom utilize this potential value. One way to make better use of automotive data is to share it with others via data marketplaces. Furthermore, data gathered by increasingly smarter cars is often very sensitive data. By aggregating and analyzing these car data, other parties can learn a lot about individual car users which could be experienced as unpleasant. Therefore, Multiparty Computation (MPC), a fairly new technology that facilitates encrypted and anonymized data sharing, tries to overcome this problem in order to increase worldwide data sharing. Academics and businesses realize that these data marketplaces have huge potential but most of the research done on MPC is very technical. As Multiparty Computation is a fairly unknown and not yet massively adopted application and also not specifically on data marketplaces, it is unclear to what extent car users are willing to provide their car data. The scientific problem herein is to find the consumers' preferences in the main measurable data sharing factors which influence consumers' data sharing behavior on MPC-enabled data marketplaces. To do so, we will employ a explorative approach by the Discrete Choice Modeling (DCM) method. Conclusions are drawn on how to improve these data marketplaces by revealing the relative importance of general data sharing factors. This paper aims to explore the consumers' preferences of MPC-enabled data marketplace factors to reveal the consumers' willingness to share automotive GPS data on data marketplaces in order to enhance data sharing and increase (road suggestion) products and thereby overall innovation. The findings revealed that the factors risk of data disclosure and benefit stay far more important to consumers in data sharing on MPC-enabled data marketplaces. Data control and trust (in terms of a herding effect) were least important to consumers, although consumers feel they are losing control over their data in this online era. This knowledge can then be utilized to create a data marketplace in which data providers are more likely to join.","data marketplaces; Multiparty computation; data sharing; automotive; data control; risk of data disclosure; trust; benefit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Nevertheless, these models often rely on two underlying assumptions: (1) the significant wave height and peak wave period adequately describe (directional) wave fields, and (2) these two parameters sufficiently describe the conditions causing weather downtime. However, little is known about how these underlying assumptions affect the reliability of logistic optimisation tools. This study, therefore, presents an alternative model that integrates response motions of vessels and turbine structures into a logistic optimisation tool to address and expose the implications that follow from using these assumptions. A case-study approach, on two recently realised offshore wind farm projects, showed that integrating response motions results in, up to 10%, less favourable workability conditions. Further analysis on the data showed that it is crucial to include the two-dimensional wave energy distribution to expose more complex sea states that induce weather downtime. Moreover, a failure analysis approach found that the conditions inducing downtime events are more accurately described by response motions instead of sea state parameters. Therefore, the findings of this study suggest that integrating response motions into logistic optimisation models improves the reliability of the model estimates. Besides, this study suggest that the industry’s approach potentially overestimates the true workability and, therefore, imposes unnecessary operational risks. Hence, the results of this study demonstrate the importance of integrating hydrodynamic engineering knowledge into the assessment and optimisation of project planning, costs, and workability.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-02","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor); Lanzafame, R.C. (graduation committee); van den Eijnden, A.P. (graduation committee); van Zuylen, J.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Two types of calculations are currently used to assess dikes for macro stability. These are the semi-probabilistic calculation and the probabilistic calculation. In practice, the semi-probabilistic calculation is currently mostly used. However, the probabilistic calculation is the most accurate calculation of the two methods resulting in the most realistic results. Performing a probabilistic calculation is on the other hand less simple and a lot more time consuming. Therefore it would be more efficient to still regularly apply the semi-probabilistic calculation to save time and also find a way to make this calculation more accurate. Although the probabilistic calculation results directly in a reliability index, this is not the case with the semi-probabilistic calculation. To link the target reliability index to the factor of safety of the semi-probabilistic calculation, a calibration formula is used. This formula was made using a set of probabilistic calculations from the calibration study. The formula is designed in such a way that in reality 80% of dike profiles are calculated too conservatively with the semi-probabilistic calculation and 20% not strict enough. This means that this formula results in a lower reliability index for the majority of dike profiles than what the realistic value would be. The result of this conservative formula is that in some cases actual reliability of the dike profile can deviate reasonably from the probabilistic reliability index. Some profiles can therefore be made far too robust, while a few others may be approved unfairly. There could be a lot of profit to be made in both safety and in the amount of reinforcement required if the existing calibration formula can be further elaborated. This leads to the main question of this report: “How can the current calibration equation for the assessment of a dike on macro stability be elaborated by using the results of probabilistic calculations from the calibration study and SAFE?” As emerges in the research question, the probabilistic calculations of two projects are used for the research; the calibration study and the project SAFE. The calibration study is the project from Deltares on which the current calibration formula is based. The set of dikes in this project consists of a mix of local and regional dike profiles around the Netherlands. The set is arranged in such a way that almost every type of dike in the Netherlands appears in it so that it can be applied as widely as possible. In contrast to the dataset from the calibration study, the dataset from SAFE consists of dike profiles of only two dike sections at the Lek. The dike profiles belonging to SAFE have been compiled by the water authority and calculated probabilistically by Sweco and Arcadis. The data set from safe is composed in such a way that the critical dike locations of these 2 sections on the Lek are included. Several ways to see if the current calibration formula can be made more accurate are investigated. Initially, SAFE's location-specific set is compared to the calibration formula. It is checked to which extent SAFE corresponds to this and what the reasons can be for existing differences. It is also examined whether the current calibration formula can be improved on the basis of different dike characteristics. A distinction is made of several general , soil and geometric characteristics. The research shows that SAFE's dike profiles require a slightly different calibration line than the line from the calibration study. Instead of 80%, only 64% of the dike profiles lie below the calibration line of the calibration study from Deltares. Especially at the lower reliability indexes, the profiles from SAFE are not calculated safely enough. It is not demonstrable that the profiles from SAFE lead to different results due to the fairly similar type of dikes from the project or the specific location. The difference will therefore mainly be due to the different calculation methods of both projects. In addition, there were also two dike cases/characteristics that has an influence on the difference in reliability index; the design profiles and the berm. With Both, it seems useful to draw up a special calibration line that takes this into account. Especially a calibration line for only the design profiles produces a much more accurate result. This new calibration line results in 30% more accurate reliability indexes. The conclusion of the report is therefore that it would be effective to apply a separate calibration line for SAFE and for the design profiles. For SAFE, the difference with the current calibration line could also be solved with a better calibrated schematization factor, using frequently probabilistic calculations or by renewing the existing calibration study because the difference that occurs seems to be mainly due to the calculation method. Moreover, a separate calibration line for the design profiles thus produces a lot more accurate results. However, the consequence of these more accurate results is that fewer profiles will be on the positive side of the calibration line. The separate calibration line for the dike profiles without designs is 20% less accurate but resulted in safer calculations. When both formulas for designs and normal profiles are used, the complete data set gets a little more accurate with 8% and also even safer than the current calibration formula. So there is certainly something to be improved from the current calibration formula by distinguishing between dike profiles without design and with design.","calibration study; macro stability; semi-probabilistic calculation; probabilistic calculation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

In The Netherlands today, 11.1% of the primary energy demand is obtained from renewable energy and the biomass accounts for 54% [1]. Another promising material for value added chemical synthesis is carbon dioxide. By utilization of CO2, the production of valuable chemical materials such as methanol, formic acid that can be used as a fuel, heat or power source and reducing the greenhouse gas effect by lowering emission levels will provide industrial and environmental advantages at the same time. Formic acid, used in the agriculture, pharmaceuticals and textile, is a key chemical that can also be used in energy conversion processes. In the current industrial practice, formic acid is produced by carbonylation of methanol with carbon monoxide. However, methanol is another value added chemical that is used in energy production, hence expensive for the process. Therefore, researchers started looking into alternative methods. Biomass and carbon dioxide utilization methods are two of them. In this thesis study, 10 kton and 100 kton annual production of 85 wt.% formic acid from wet oxidation of glucose and catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide, have been modeled and a techno-economic analysis is carried out. Additionally, the processes of obtaining glucose from lignocellulosic biomass and carbon dioxide from syngas by pre-combustion capture are also simulated. ASPEN Plus V8.8 process flowsheeting package program has been used for the simulations. From the results, in energy analysis biomass based formic acid synthesis process showed higher efficiency than CO2 based production. When the hydrogen peroxide and oxygen based biomass wet oxidation routes are compared, it is observed that oxygen based operation is more efficient than hydrogen peroxide based conversion because of lower utility requirements. It was determined that biomass based formic acid production can be economically profitable, but only for large scale wet oxidation via oxygen together with the sale of by-products obtained in pre-treatment process. On the contrary, no profit was obtained by the hydrogen peroxide route. In carbon dioxide utilization route, the breakeven selling price (BSP) of the formic acid was computed to be 7% more than the current market price. In order to improve the process, two case studies were created. In the first case, economically the most suitable reactor amount configuration is determined. However, the process was still not profitable. In the second case study, two times more active catalyst, Au=Al2O3, has been utilized. The process took half the residence time of the previous case and BSP value determined to be 2.6% lower than the current market price. Also, slight increase in efficiency is observed. In conclusion, more research should be done and experiments regarding reaction and intermediate substance performances should be conducted, in order to simulate the process more in detail. However, despite the uncertainties, in this era where the transition to greener energy production through the use of biomass and the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions have been made a definite target by the governments, the synthesis methods studied, will gain importance as the purposes of formic acid use increase.","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; formic acid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Hydrokinetic energy is an environmentally friendly source of electricity and it has the advantage to be more predictable compared to other renewables. According to IRENA (2020), the capacity of converting hydrokinetic energy into electricity is expected to increase in the coming decades as many concepts are in the pipeline. One of these hydrokinetic energy concepts is the patented Van Rompay Turbine. The Van Rompay Turbine consists of a duct, an air chamber and a paddlewheel. The duct, which is based on a Venturi working principle, consists of a converging inlet, a throat and a diverging outlet. Above the throat, an air chamber is present to provide an air environment to reduce resistance for the paddlewheel. The goal of this research was to experimentally and numerically test a prototype (L:4.05m x W:1.17m x H:1.17m) of the ducted system.Three inclination angles: 21°, 26° &amp; 31°, for the converging inflow and diverging outflow segment were tested, referred to as the small, medium and large ramp size, respectively, to determine which size represents the lowest energy losses in the system. The small in -and outflow ramp represents the lowest energy losses compared to the medium and large ramp. Subsequently, on the small inflow ramp, five designs were tested, referred to as the straight, curved and the high, mid &amp; low frequency waved designs; to again determine which design represents the lowest energy losses. Roughed waved wall designs are streamwise wavy walls with each a different wavelength and amplitude. The small ramp with a high, mid &amp; low frequency waved design results in the lowest energy losses in comparison to the straight and curved designs for inlet velocities between 0 m/s and 0.4 m/s. For inlet velocities between 0.4 m/s and 0.5 m/s, the small ramp with a curved design represents the lowest energy losses in comparison to the straight and high, mid &amp; low frequency waved designs.The data points acquired during the experiments were scattered due to external factors increasing the uncertainty of the measurements. Besides this, the experimental investigations were tested over an inlet velocity between 0 m/s and 0.5 m/s, limiting the data analysis. For this reason, several CFD simulations were carried out to acquire data with no influence of external factors and to investigate the system for higher velocities. The CFD simulations were executed for the five different inflow ramp designs with an in -and outflow inclination angle of 21°. The CFD model solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations with a k-epsilon turbulence closure model. Based on these CFD simulations, the best performing design for the inflow ramp in terms of the lowest energy losses for an inlet flow velocity between 0 m/s and 0.75 m/s is the high frequency waved design. Regarding velocities between 0.75 m/s and 3 m/s, the curved design represents thelowest energy losses compared to the straight and high, mid &amp; low frequency waved designs. After scaling up the ducted system in CFD simulations with a factor 2 and 10, the flow velocity reduces as there are more energy losses in the system. However, as larger systems have a marginal lower specific surface of contact between the water and the duct, an increase in available flow power could be found. The extent to which the ducted system can be scaled up depends on the space restrictions at the specific location. Besides, the minimal required inflow area of the free water flow should be met. It can therefore be concluded that the potentially available energy for generation also depends the location where the Van Rompay will be deployed.Experiments need to be performed to study the hydrodynamic impact and the hydrodynamic efficiency of the paddlewheel to determine the power performance output and thus its potential value for the hydrokinetic energy market. It is recommended for future research to test the prototype at higher velocities and to test the prototype in a laboratory facility as these offer the benefits of controlled testing.","Hydrokinetic Energy; Tidal Energy; Ducted system; Venturi; CFD simulations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Together, these elements lead the target group to collect inspiring insights from quantitative data by stimulating reflection and creative thinking through physical interaction with data. By consciously engaging with data while creating a physical representation of a dataset, users better understand the data and reveal patterns that lead to new insights. The toolkit is designed for use during creative sessions, led by a session facilitator. With recent advances in data-based technologies like AI, machine learning and IoT, designing with data is becoming impossible to avoid. Within Ford, the amount of collected data is growing, forcing the design team to look for new ways to integrate its data to improve continuous product and service innovation. This led to the initial goal of ‘using data as creative material’, as quantitative data is currently solely being used for testing and validation rather than to inspire the entire design process. To specify and achieve this goal, the fields of creativity and data representation were identified and studied, focusing on answering the following research question: How can data be represented in a way that stimulated creativity during the design process at Ford? It was concluded that data physicalisation could stimulate creativity and lead to better insights as it encourages reflection and creates deepened understanding through active interaction with the data, which led to the development of the toolkit: the Ford Concreate.","data physicalisation; creativity; reflection; data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

But as jobs are becoming increasingly less active, and working adults are spending almost a third of their lives in the office, most of their time is now spent sitting behind a desk. This time spent in sedentary behavior is increasing rapidly on a global scale and has become a great area of concern, as research has proven that prolonged sedentary behavior is linked to an increase in all-cause mortality To reduce the sedentary nature of the workplace, many companies are now replacing the standard desk with sit-stand desks. Unfortunately, even as more companies implement these desks in the workspace, many studies show that there is a lack of utilization among working adults, with many only using the desk once a month or less. The goal of this thesis is to figure out why this lack of utilization occurs and to design a solution capable of altering the working adult's behavior.\ To design this solution, an agile design process was followed involving the user at almost every stage of the design process. By focusing on the differences between the non-active and active users, several design opportunities were formed (1) Increase awareness of the effect of sedentary behavior, (2) Promote social support among coworkers, and (3) Increase body and mind awareness so people are more conscious of how sitting affects their physical and mental status. Through ideation and concept development, the final concept was formed: The BMDesk Application and Controller. The BMDesk App and Controller combines a digital and non-digital product designed to aid working adults in reducing their sedentary behavior by becoming more aware of its effects on their bodies and mind. The product provides a simple solution that reminds users when it is time to do a self-check-in and see how their body and mind are feeling. Once the user has finished the self-scale, the app provides personalized tips on how to adjust their sit-stand desks to help them feel better and optimize their work experience. Users can also use the BMDesk Digital Application to check in on their progress, learn more about better workplace practices, and join social networks aimed at promoting physical wellbeing in the workplace. By joining the social networks, users can feel less alone and supported by a community of their coworkers who are all going through the same process.","Sedentary Behavior; Static Sitting; Static Standing; Workplace; Working Adults; Sit-Stand Desks; Physical Wellbeing; Behavior Change; Habit Formation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Of er kan een afhankelijkheid van de temperatuur worden geïmplementeerd, zodat bijvoorbeeld $Q$ afhankelijk is van de temperatuur.","","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""
