In the second chapter of this report an Analysis of the Tetra pods on breakwater of the “Sunny Day Marina is presented, where the damage is determined and different approaches are used and compared to determine the significant wave height. In the third chapter the beach measurements are described. An analysis of the development of the beach line and the beach profiles is compared with other years and a sieve analysis is carried out. Chapter four describes wave measurements for the area; these are made visually and with a pressure gauge. In chapter five, the contours of a groin in the area is measured and compared with data from other years.Chapters six contains information about the stones measurements in the quarries we visited. In chapter seven the bottom of the sea is mapped by using the echo sounding data. In chapter eight, the sediment characteristics are determined. At the village of St-Constantin a group of investigators wants to make an artificial island in the sea, requirements are presented in chapter eight. The final chapter nine relates about another project, the expansion of hotel White lagoon.","fieldwork; Varna; Bulgaria; CT5318","en","student report","TU Delft, Department Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","Campus only","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Our existence and our economical activities are very dependent on this resource. Proper management of the available water is therefore essential. This research is part of the operational level of quantitative water management, which concerns the daily operation of the water system infrastructure (sluices, gates, pumping stations, etc.). It is done in collaboration between the Delft University of Technology and the Irrigation Training and Research Center in San Luis Obispo, California. The research object is the southern part of the Delta-Mendota Canal (DMC) between the O’Neill Forebay and the Mendota Pool and flows through the western part of the San Joaquin Valley, California. These 75 km of the DMC are divided by nine check structures, creating eight reaches with an average length of 9.4 km. The canal was completed in 1951 and is mainly essential for irrigation supply. The upstream controlled structures consist of three parallel radial gates and two short crested weirs. At the downstream end of each reach an irrigation district has its turnouts located, to distribute water from the canal to the users. The controlled irrigation system cannot respond fast enough to large downstream water demands, resulting in water level deviations in the downstream reservoir. With a faster response, the size and duration of the water level deviations can be reduced. Several requirements apply: 1. the 'solution' has to be an additional component to the controller so that the robustness of the present control system is not affected; 2. only the measuring points upstream of each check structure may be used and 3. the communication frequency is limited to once every 5 minutes. One solution is found in a feed forward controller in combination with re-tuned constants. An alternative solution is formed by a temporary flow controller, but special attention is necessary when dealing with varying turnout flows.","feed forward; controller; actuator; feed back; Delta Mendota; ITRC; operational water control; water control; water management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-03-19","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor)","2004","The data content of remote sensing (RS) images of sea surface temperature (SST) and normalized water-leaving radiance (nLw), for the year 1998, with respect to the River Rhine plume, is investigated. Questions that this study tries to answer are: is it possible to identify the plume from the available RS images, and under which conditions is this possible? How much information on the plumes behaviour can be derived from these images? Does or can this information contribute to our general knowledge of the plume? The images provide a spatial resolution of I km2 and a temporal resolution of I or 2 images per day per sensor for nLw and SST, respectively (in the case of a cloudless atmosphere). In the presence of clouds, no signal is detected for the area of surface water underneath the clouds. Two hypotheses are set up to explain how the RS images can be used to trace the plume. In the hypotheses links are established between salinity gradients that delimit the plume and SST and nLw respectively. The results are based on these hypotheses. From the available images, 9 SST images in spring provide detailed information on the stratified plume and allow for derivation of indirect information on sub-surface processes. In winter the temperature gradients as visible on SST imagery seem to indicate the broad plume patterns. From the nLw images it was not possible to identify the boundaries of the plume. However it is expected that the nLw images are an excellent source for monitoring suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the North Sea. The general conclusion of this study is that the RS data used in this project provide a valuable source of information, with respect to the Dutch coastal zone, in addition to the currently available measurement techniques and computer models. The SST imagery turns out to be particularly useful for tracing stratification, whereas nLw imagery seems to be an excellent source for monitoring SPM in the North Sea. For detailed monitoring of the DCZ and the plume, increased spatial and temporal resolutions are required.","pollution; plume; Rhine river; North Sea","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Organisations can benefit from this by integrating ICT solutions in their business processes. However these integrations have to be well founded and elaborated. Another opportunity that arises in the shipbuilding industry is the shift from being a producing industry to being a service industry, focussing more and more on knowledge and information management. ICT solutions can play an important role for organisations to enable the necessary changes for hs shft to a service industry. Keppel Verolme, a shipyard specialised in the conversion, modification and repair of offshorevessels and ships paid attention to these developments. This resulted in an research assignment with the following central research question: ''Wkch processes within Keppel Verolrne are suited to benefit from a higher level of support by ICT?'. To provide an answer to hs research question, the following objective of this master's thesis was defined as: The design and application of a decision support method, which assists in the economical decision-making on which process within Keppel Verolme should be improved with the help of ICT...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Ship Design, Production and Operation","",""
