(mentor); Groenveld, R. (mentor); Labeur, R.J. (mentor); Veldhuyzen, W. (mentor); Ingenieursbureau Lievense (contributor)","2007","The current port of the city of Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas, encounters a capacity problem for the current port. A previous study for the Bahamian Government concluded that the area of Clifton Point is most suitable for relocating the main part of the port structure. This report will focus on the feasibility of the appointed project site. With a relatively small amount of wave data, the operational and extreme conditions of the port are determined. Because the project is situated in the Caribbean, the influence of hurricanes is also included. The site conditions show that the conditions at Clifton Point are relatively calm. The next step is to determine the characteristics of the relocated vessels and cargo. Therefore a forecast is performed. With the forecast the functions of berths and terminal areas are determined. For this reason a capacity study is performed. Several alternatives are generated for the new port design. Because of the restricted availability of surface area at the project site, the alternative options are limited. The limited surface area is caused by the presence of an industrial area and the fact that the shore in front of the coastline is relatively steep. After performing a multi criteria analysis it is clearly that an inland port design is inefficient in relation to a port which is based on land reclamation. In a detailed study the configuration of the breakwaters is optimised; variant layouts are elaborated to select the best option of construction costs in relation to the occurring annual downtime. Also the manoeuvring of the vessels arriving at the new port structure has to be checked. The breakwater will also be designed in more detail. The geometry and composition of armour protection are part of this design. Also details of the structure like for example the armour layer at the head of the breakwater are determined. Finally it can be concluded that the chosen design is technically feasible. All design vessels are able to berth in a port, which provides a sufficient capacity and a safe turning basin for the navigation of the vessel.","ports and waterways","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

This study presents indirect Heat Induced Attachment and Detachment (HIAD) as a new concept for single side tissue attachment and detachment to improve translocation of the graft. Method A micro scale prototype with an electrically heatable wire was built that heats the instrument-tissue interface indirectly. To study the attachment and detachment properties of the prototype a series of tests was performed on chicken meat. The electric signal applied on the prototype was a 9V DC signal for amplifier input signal lengths varying from 0.6-1.5 ms. Results Attachment and detachment occured with 98% and 90% certainty with 41 mJ and 110 mJ energy supplied to the prototype tip in 0.7 and 1.5 ms respectively. The attachment strength was estimated as at least 0.2 mN. Macroscopically, visible damage appeared to be ? 0.005 mm². Conclusions The principle of indirect heating of the instrument-tissue interface proved to be effective as a prototype with an electrically heatable wire could induce attachment and detachment of tissue. Indirect Heat Induced Attachment and Detachment may be applicable in many different surgical applications.","tissue manipulation; attachment; detachment; surgery; heat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Breedveld, P. (mentor)","2007","Colonic cancer is the second leading cause of death among cancers in the Western world. Early detection greatly improves the chances of survival. Colonoscopy is a non-invasive detection method through natural access, making it possible to look inside the colon, take biopsies and remove small polyps that can develop into cancer. Colonoscopy is often experienced as a painful and uncomfortable procedure. A cause for the pain a patient experiences is the buckling of the colonoscope, a long, lighted tube with camera and biopsy canal, that stretches the colonic wall. This buckling occurs because the colonoscope has to take difficult bends while being pushed from behind. In order to prevent this buckling, a device is presented that pulls the colonoscope from the front. The presented design is that of a device that uses a rolling mucoadhesive films to create friction with the colonic surface to pull itself forward into the colon. A demonstration model was constructed and tested in vitro in the colon of a pig. Tests showed that it is possible to move a device through the colon by using a rolling mucoadhesive films. It can be concluded that the presented design is a step forward to come to an improved design of a colonoscope that is not only pushed from behind but also pulled forward from the front.","colonoscopy; mucoadhesive; friction; rolling film","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","The overflow mixture of hopper dredgers contains fine sediment which when released in the environment forms a so-called plume. The spreading of this sediment and the related turbidity increase and sedimentation pattern can be of environmental importance. Understanding the behaviour of these plumes is therefore important. The first phase of the plume is called dynamic. It is characterized by the rapid descent of a dense mixture under influence of its initial momentum and buoyancy. The dynamic phase is followed by the passive phase that is governed by the settling behaviour of the particles. The behaviour and fate of the dynamic phase is depending on several influences and is therefore more difficult to model than the passive phase. This M.Sc. thesis is focused on getting more insight in some of these influences. Also the implementation of these influences in dynamic plume models is investigated. A preliminary study was carried out to investigate both theory and modelling of dynamic plumes in order to define the knowledge gaps present. The possibilities to fill these knowledge gaps were studied which resulted in carrying out experiments on two interesting influences on the dynamic plume: stripping and vortex divergence. Stripping is defined as the removal of material from a dynamic plume by the cross flow. Its process is not well understood and the few quantifications presented in literature were found to have no proper base. To obtain more information laboratory experiments were performed at a 1:100 distorted Richardson scale. The experiments were partly hindered by the limited flume dimensions of the experimental setup, but the tests yielded interesting observations. Vortex divergence is depending on the strength of the vortex pair that is formed when a plume is bent over by a cross flow. In homogenous surroundings the plume is said to be non-bifurcating, but the vortices of the vortex pair are diverging at a near constant rate. This divergence was already observed in the stripping experiments and was further investigated in extra specialized experiments. Next to that the need and possibility for an extension of the CORMIX model to include this divergence was investigated.","plume; environmental impact dredging","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","The Netherlands houses a great variety of subsidy agencies, each very different in their organizational and operational approach to achieve their goal (the distribution of subsidies). These subsidy agencies share the common problem of being unable to adapt their subsidy system quickly due to a high grade of customization in their information systems. Subsidy processes and supporting systems are tightly coupled and a change in one of them leads to a lot of organizational and operational costs and causes delay which is not desirable. A more adaptive subsidy system is needed to reduce organizational and operational costs and to reduce delay when the system needs to be changed. In this thesis, the concept of Enterprise Ontology has been explored by using generic components to design a generic subsidy system, in order to provide a more adaptive subsidy system, which can be fine-tuned to match the requirements of a variety of governmental organizations. To come to this generic subsidy system the clustering of subsidies as used by subsidy agencies has been analyzed first. Next, the administrative descriptions of five subsidy agencies at different governmental levels have been analyzed with respect to their processes and services. The administrative descriptions also provided an understanding of the actors involved in a subsidy system. Using the analysis results, an abstraction has been made by comparing the process and service models of the five performed case studies to yield a generic process and service model, composed of generic components. Next, the design of the generic subsidy system started with defining the initial conditions followed by the composition of a requirements set which contained requirements to be respected during system design. From this set, a subset of feasible requirements has been selected, since the initial set turned out to be far too large to satisfy in this research. Next, the generic subsidy system has been designed by means of an ontological model (fully independent from its implementation) and an implementation model (containing all the details for implementing the generic subsidy system). To evaluate the design of the generic subsidy system, a prototype has been used to conclude whether the generic subsidy system indeed provided a more adaptive system and to find out potential side effects of implementing a specific subsidy system by using the generic subsidy system as its reference. Concluding this thesis, the evaluation of the generic subsidy system illustrated that a more adaptive subsidy system can be realized using generic components, since: · A subsidy system using a centralized orchestrating process and decentralized process components allows the subsidy process and/or its supporting components to be changed without harming each other; · Changing a subsidy process no longer introduces delay in transitioning from the current version to the next version of the process, since the generic subsidy system and orchestration technology allow various versions of a process to coexist. As a side-effect of implementing a specific subsidy system, overhead in a subsidy system can be reduced as well. Taking the generic subsidy system as a baseline for implementing the specific subsidy system, redundant elements can be left out and only the essential elements are implemented in the specific subsidy system. Implementing the generic subsidy system could have negative side effects when adaptivity alone is not enough and is enforced. These negative side effects however, are not researched in this thesis.","DEMO; subsidy; subsidy reference model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","MSc Information Architecture","",""

(mentor)","2007","BitTorrent is a popular peer-to-peer file sharing protocol. From a user’s perspective, it is important that a BitTorrent client downloads the files as fast as possible. The socially enhanced BitTorrent client called Tribler – from the Delft University of Technology and the Vrije Universiteit – was presumed to be lacking in speed. This presumption started this thesis’ research project. The research focused on two questions. How poor is Tribler’s download performance and what determines the performance of a BitTorrent client in general? To understand the problem, we need to be aware that the limited available upload capacity of the peers in the swarm is a speed bottleneck and that one own’s upload capacity is a valuable, but limited currency that can be exchanged for speed from others. However, it is not known which behaviour is best. In order to solve this mystery, we have to compare different behaviours through measurement. Important aspects to measure include:  Peer discovery and try out, measured by connection attempts and optimistic unchokes.  Implementation of the tit-for-tat algorihtm, measured by chokes and unchokes. To measure and analyse these aspects, two approaches were taken. Our first de- sign involved modifying existing BitTorrent clients to log internal events, but its applicability was limited to open source clients. As a result, we came with a design that analysed network traffic and was therefore applicable to all clients. However, a wrongly taken design decision limited its analysis power. The knowledge gained from our analysis is that the initial phase and the end phase of a download are important. For the initial phase, a good discovery of peers required. For the end phase, a different piece selection algorithm is required. There are also some questions left that need to be answered and work to be done. Questions left are:  Do different peer discovery algorithms benefit in different situations?  Does the Mainline BitTorrent client benefit from its new DNA service or is it malware? Future work involves improving our measuring tool and answering these questions.","tribler; download; performance; torrent; bittorrent; vuze; utorrent; mainline; tornado; peers; seeds; p2p","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Parallel and Distributed Systems","","","",""

(mentor); Soons, F.A.M. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor)","2007","The Port of Fujairah is situated on the Eastern coast of the UAE, approximately 70 nautical miles south from the Straits of Hormuz. The export of aggregates is the main activity in the port, together with the bunker trade. Currently the port faces a capacity shortage. However the Port of Fujairah is not using their container loading facilities actively, Dubai Port that is current leasing the quay and cranes in the Port of Fujairah has expressed their desire to be able to unload bigger vessels and handle more containers. This is not possible with the current facilities. The local authorities of Fujairah are planning to expand the existing Port of Fujairah. The expansion should supply for the anticipated growth of the coming 25 years. The objective of this study is twofold. The first objective is to find a favorable layout for the Expansion of the Port of Fujairah in which the port can expand its activities for the coming 25 years. The second objective is to propose technical designs for the civil and marine works of the expansion project. In fact this study covers the masterplan process including analysis, generation of layout alternatives, evaluation and selection of these alternatives and preliminary engineering. The port expansion should be realized, preferably north of the existing port and south of the existing oil terminal. Three scenarios of growth in demand for throughput capacity have been composed, representing low, medium and strong growth. To determine the requirements for the new port a basic simulation model was developed. Based on the spatial constraints and the requirements according to the composed scenarios, a number of layout alternatives have been proposed. A monetary evaluation as well as a multi criteria analysis finally resulted in the selection of a limited number of most promising layouts. For the marine and civil parts of the project, the quay walls, coastal protection works, liquid bulk terminal and dredging, several principle technical designs where proposed. The cost estimations that where used for the monetary evaluation where based on these designs. The final conclusion is that realization of the port expansion north and partly south of the existing port is necessary to reach the throughput capacity as described by the highest growth scenario. The area south of the port was originally reserved for other developments. The available area, north of the existing port however does not provide enough space for a terminal that is capable of achieving the anticipated throughput. It is proposed to realize the container terminal south of the existing port and to handle other commodities at the preferred location, north of the existing port.","Fujairah; masterplan; port; expansion","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

Because of the holes, hollow core slabs save up to 30% in material and weight. The hollow core slabs will shorten and bent because of the prestressed tendons, which are positioned low in the cross-section. Creep effects will continue the deformation.

(mentor)","2007","At breakwater and seawall projects at Port St Francis and Scarborough breakage of single layer interlocking armour units was observed. It is generally assumed that breakage of single layer armour units has a significant negative effect on the hydraulic stability of a rubble mound breakwater. The significant decrease of interlocking capacity and mass of the broken units would lead to displacement of these units and surrounding units. The broken parts of the damaged units would act like projectiles. The waves would ""throw"" these broken parts back and forth to the armour layer. More armour units would break due to the impact of these broken parts leading to rapid damage progression of the armour layer and finally to failure of the total construction. This damage behaviour has however never been confirmed. The main objective of this research is to determine the effect of single layer armour unit breakage on the hydraulic armour layer stability and potential damage progression. A 2-dimensional model of a rubble mound breakwater with typical cross section was tested with individual and clustered positioned broken Xbloc armour units around the still water line. The residual stability of the armour layer was determined. The armour unit displacement and damage progression was assessed. It is concluded that breakage of single layer armour units has a significant negative effect on start of damage of the armour layer. Breakage of single layer armour units has no significant effect on failure of the armour layer. This damage behaviour leads to a long and gradual damage progression. This type of damage progression looks more like the damage progression of an armour layer consisting of rip-rap rock. The majority of the broken parts show little to no movement. It is therefore unlikely that rapid damage progression occurs due to broken parts damaging other units.","breakwater; stability; damaged; armour; units","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""
