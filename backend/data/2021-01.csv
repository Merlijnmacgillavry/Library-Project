By providing data-driven AI planning software as a service, the company strives to improve the delivery planning process of its customers and thereby allowing them to handle the growth in demand for home delivery. The home delivery market is expanding at an exponential rate. The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed the e-commerce market five years ahead, more packages are delivered every day and this volume is rapidly growing. Online shoppers are reshaping the delivery economy from supply- to demand-driven. They expect their deliveries to be free, fast and convenient. At the same time, logistics operators and (online) retailers strive to find the optimal balance between costs, operational efficiency and customer experience. Improving environmental performance is getting increasingly important as well. This puts significant stress on their planning and delivery process. Plotwise seems successful in terms of its product-market fit. Hence, the management team wants to rapidly scale the company through signing new customers in at least four additional European countries between now and 2022. For this reason, the Head of Sales of Plotwise asked the author of this thesis to design a sales strategy that guides the company in entering European countries with its current product. The author created this sales strategy through performing a literature review, an internal analysis, an external analysis and quantitative market research. Strategic design principles complemented these research methodologies. This thesis presents the results of this research. In the literature review, the author discusses theoretic elements of traditional market entry strategy literature. The review synthesises the findings into a model that guided the development of the sales strategy. An internal analysis on Plotwise’s vision, mission, product, business model and culture shows that the company is fit for international expansion. However, the analysis shows that the sales team faces several challenges that possibly slow down this scaling. To tackle the identified challenges, the author presents three sales tools in combination with a roadmap for 2021 and 2022. The expectation is that these tools will improve the lead conversion, thereby increasing the number of signed customers. The author created a market analysis framework to conduct a quantitative market study. The result of this analysis is a list of most attractive countries to enter; the advice is to enter the UK market first, followed by Sweden, Norway and France. This advice deviates from an initial assumption on entry sequence as made by the management team of Plotwise. Additionally, the author advises to focus on logistic service providers (LSP), third party logistics (3PL) companies, electronics e-tailers, brands and (online) grocery stores as first customer segments. Lastly, the author advises Plotwise to position as “future-proof planning partner for delivery service optimisation”. This positioning resonates with online shopper behaviour and differs from the competition. Moreover, it leverages the core competencies of Plotwise.","International strategy; Sales strategy; Market entry; Country selection framework; Last mile delivery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Retrieving actionable information from large datasets is increasingly computationally expensive due to the current trend of ever-increasing dataset sizes. Reducing dataset sizes with dimensionality reduction techniques is often necessary for statistical analysis techniques, such as classification, to be computationally feasible. Most dimensionality reduction methods do not require any additional information to accomplish their task. However, datasets used for classification, for example, are accompanied by a set of class-labels as well. This extra information can improve dimensionality reduction techniques by explicitly preserving features that explain differences between classes. A field where high-dimensional and large datasets are standard is Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS), a technique that simultaneously records the abundance and spatial location of molecules throughout biological tissue samples. Classification has been applied to IMS datasets for a wide range of scenarios, including the diagnosis of disease, distinguishing between tumour types for personalized treatment, and identifying biomarkers. A recently introduced dimensionality reduction method called Soft Discriminant Map (SDM), designed to incorporate class information and prevent overfitting when used on high-dimensional datasets, is a promising candidate to reduce the size and dimensionality of IMS datasets. However, SDM currently requires manual setting of a free parameter β that influences class separation in the newly constructed feature-space. This thesis explores the use of SDM on IMS datasets in classification use cases and proposes a framework to set β in a data-driven way: Data-Driven Soft Discriminant Map (DD-SDM). Furthermore, the sensitivity of the classification performance to changes in β is examined. DD-SDM is compared to similar state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods in terms of classification performance. The performed experiments show that DD-SDM successfully finds a value for β where the classification performance is on par with, or in some scenarios better than, state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods while using fewer features. Setting β either too low or too high results in a suboptimal feature space and worsens classification performance. Golden section search, the search strategy used to find the optimal β in DD-SDM, succeeds in finding the optimal β in fewer iterations than more naive methods. With the use of an artificial dataset in combination with a novel evaluation metric, the Peak Conservation Score (PCS), the distinctive ability of DD-SDM to discard features that are common between classes and to actively select for discriminative features is demonstrated. The DD-SDM framework is furthermore applied to real-world IMS measurements of rat brain and mouse kidney tissue.","Dimensionality Reduction; Supervised Learning; Imaging Mass Spectrometry; Feature Extraction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Therefore, this research proposes a visual analysis tool that presents an accurate sail shape structure and supports sailors in investigating the optimal sail shape of certain weather conditions. In order to achieve our goals, we reconstruct the sail shape using two triangulation methods. For incomplete reconstructed sail shapes caused by the uncertain image quality, we deform a complete template sail under the constraints of the incomplete sail shape and use the deformed sail as an estimation of the proper shape structure. We designed a visualization dashboard for sailors to explore the 3D structure, 2D profiles and characteristics of the time-varying sail shape and analyze their relation to boat speed. The usability of the visualization tool is tested by a qualitative evaluation with two sailing experts. The result shows that the reconstruction and deformation of sail shape are valid, and the visualization dashboard has the potential to enhance sailors' comprehension of sail shape and provide insights into the optimal sail shape trimming.","Data visualization; sports data; Visual Analytics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Drag in pipelines is composed almost solely of skin friction drag. The most common technique to achieve drag reduction (DR) is by adding drag-reducing agents. However, in the aerospace industry, various impressive passive drag-reducing techniques have been suggested to reduce skin friction drag in the past decades. Among these techniques, dimpled surfaces form a relatively unexplored terrain. Research into reducing skin friction drag in the turbulent regime by using dimples has been performed in the aviation industry since the '80s. The excessive amount of skin friction drag in pipelines forms an intriguing challenge to break new grounds. Several researchers investigated the potential of DR of turbulent flows using dimpled channels. Even though most of these studies that found DR are disputed, studies published at the National University of Singapore (NUS) obtained positive results time and again. NUS's exact test setup was reconstructed at Delft University of Technology, which has not been done yet as far as the author of this report is aware. Identical pressure measurements were performed, yielding an absolute DR of ≈ 5%, which is slightly less than what was obtained at NUS (&gt;7%). Flat plates return a DR between 8-15%, dimpled test plates returned at DR between 12-20%. The test plates were covered for 99.5% with diamond-shaped dimples of 100 mm long and 50 mm wide. In total, 29 pressure taps were used to determine the change in drag in an 8 m long channel of 20 mm in height. Tests were done at Reynolds numbers, based on half channel width and centerline velocity, between 6,000 and 40,000. Accurate results were perceived up to a Reynolds number of 21,000, likely due to test-setup limitations. Multiple verifications such as two-dimensionality of the ow, comparison of theoretical and experimental skin friction coefficients, and instantaneous pressure tests were used to allow for an objective analysis. The pressure measurements were also supported by 1D hotwire anemometry (HWA) tests and surface oil ow visualizations (SOFV). The majority of the investigated boundary layers were absent of anomalies. It should be mentioned that the viscous sublayer could not be captured, neither a quantitative momentum analysis was performed. However, a shift in the velocity profile, acquired at the same test location, for different test plates was observed. Furthermore, an increased velocity near the wall was observed for dimpled test plates. Surface oil ow measurements did show similar ow patterns to what was recorded at NUS. However, the actual behavior is not investigated through HWA. Hence, it cannot be confirmed nor denied if the change in drag is a consequence of these near-wall ow mechanisms. SOFV did not show irregular ow structures such as ow reversal. Finally, tests were performed with a correction for test volume increase caused by the dimples. After this correction, the drag over dimpled plates increased instead of reduced. Considering other studies on dimpled surfaces that also found an increase in drag, it is strongly believed that the positive effect of dimples in turbulent channel flows does not stem from skin friction drag but rather from the increase in channel volume. Although the precision of the results was relatively high, the accuracy of the wind tunnel was insufficient. Additional research is required to narrow down the 8-15% error that was obtained while testing at plates.","Dimples; Channel; Drag Reduction; turbulent boundary layer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An important step in the development of alternative fuels is the characterisation of its combustion characteristics. There are various diagnostic tools which aid in the determination of flame properties. Optical diagnostics play a crucial role by providing a non-invasive form of measurement. In the current project the idea is to utilise the passive chemiluminescence from flames to determine flame properties. The focus is on the emission from the OH* radical present in flames. This radical is responsible for radiation in the ultraviolet region ranging from 280 nm to 350 nm. This radical was also chosen as it is a radical common to both hydrocarbon as well as hydrogen flames. The objective of the project was to develop an emission spectra model of the OH¤ radical and to test its feasibility in predicting flame temperature by comparing it with emission from a laminar premixed methane/air Bunsen flame. The underlying physics regarding the various aspects of the project are discussed in detail in the initial part of the report. In the latter part, the work done for the project is explained. An emission model was developed for the OH* radical in MATLAB. The model is capable of calculating the emission spectra at different temperatures and line shapes. Then a spectrometer was built to capture the radiation from the flames in the UV region. The obtained data was post processed to get the flame spectra. The flame spectra obtained from the flame was compared against the emission model to determine the best temperature fit. It was observed that the temperatures were much higher than the gas temperatures observed in methane/air flames. This is attributed to a non thermal population distribution in the excited molecules. There however exists a unique mapping to the equivalence ratio which can be utilised for equivalence ratio determination when properly calibrated. There are many possible directions uncovered to take the work further by exploring the applicability of the tool for other fuels and flame regimes.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-01-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Therefore these breaks are repaired, primarily by one of the three major repair pathways. Two of these pathways are non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and theta-mediated end-joining (TMEJ). These pathways leave genetic alterations in their repair products, a form of DNA damage. DNA damage is linked to several diseases such as cancer. Understanding of these pathways is important and being able to recognize which pathways are active can be beneficial for research. In this work, repair products are used to predict repair-deficient genotypes using Cas9-induced repair products. Ku80 and PolQ deficient genotypes are used, impairing NHEJ and TMEJ respectively. The ability to recognize a repair-deficient genotype is tested using two predictive tasks. First statistical machine learning algorithms are used to predict the genotype where a repair product can be found. This is done by only using a single repair product as input. Secondly, a set of Cas9-induced repair products from a single cell culture is used to predict the genotype of that cell culture. Results show that when given a single repair products, models have difficulty predicting the correct genotype. However, results are modest and the best classifier achieved an AUC of 0.76. For predicting the genotype of a cell culture using multiple repair products of that culture showed really promising results. When predicting on cell cultures with breaks induced on a target site which the model has seen in the training data, results are near perfect. Predicting on unseen target sites shows that there is room for improvement but the best performing models showed an average AUC of 0.879 across target sites.

(mentor); Janssen, C. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Urban renewal is seen as an opportunity to improve the environmental and socio-economic performance of cities. Yet, it appears hard to tackle the social challenges by a focus on spatial interventions only. A more participating society and more user involvement could help to improve the social environment. Dutch urban area development, such as urban renewal, is becoming more private-led, while the government is trying to shift responsibilities. The Environment and Planning Act is a tool to ensure the involvement of users during private-led developments. In theory, an involvement process can contribute to the objectives of the most important stakeholders in urban renewal projects: the government, users and private developers. Since these potentials in practice are often not achieved, literature advises to involve users early and intensively in the development process and to develop with flexibility along the process. However, for each project, boundaries limit the development options for a private developer and therefore, as well the options to involve users. It seems that private developers do not have enough room for involvement to align the involvement process with the objectives of the three stakeholders. This study explores that hypothesis. Considering the perspective of the private developer, the main question of this research is: to what extent do the development boundaries leave enough room for private developers to align user involvement with the objectives of users, the municipality and the developer themselves? The research is conducted through a case study analysis of three private-led urban renewal projects in which users were involved. Developers, municipal officials and users were interviewed to gain insights. The analyses show how development boundaries are defined, what room is left for user involvement and how the involvement process aligns with the objectives of the three parties. By considering the developers perspective, it is explored why the current involvement processes are not reaching their full potential as described in theory. This study shows that full alignment is difficult due to conflicting demands. Municipal broader, cross border objectives often conflict with those of the local users. It appears that the boundaries defined by the municipality are quite fixed, while those of the developers are flexible. This flexibility could be used when there is a lack of support for the plans. Since full alignment seems impossible, a second interview round provides insights into what extend of alignment would be important for private developers to aim for. For developers, long term business continuity and a positive corporate image are important to ensure profit gaining in the future. For them, this is more important than profit gaining in the short term. Flexibility can be found in the development boundaries when these long term objectives seem to be threatened. Game theory, approaching user involvement as a negotiation process and integral development offer opportunities for private developers to improve the alignment of everyone’s objectives with user involvement without having to adjust their development boundaries, unplanned. This will need to be further explored in new research. The insights from this study provide knowledge about the relation between the important stakeholders in urban renewal projects and how they influence a user involvement process. This new knowledge can help to reach more potentials of user involvement in practice.","Urban renewal; Social city performances; User involvement; Private-led development; Development boundaries; Alignment of objectives; Environment and planning act","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Bakker, M.C.M. (mentor); Yang, Y. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Aluminium recycling is a crucial process when it comes to recycling of metals. To make the metal industry part of a circular economy, this process must be efficient and for the interest of companies it should be economical. Singulation is such a process which does both the tasks. In this work, aluminium scrap recycling has been positioned as a commercially beneficially process which encourages companies to take up the process and since the process is environmentally advantageous as well, there has been mentions of how the authorities provide policies which support this process. The first part of the work looks at how and why aluminium is produced which looks into the processes such as Bayer and Hall-Heroult and into multiple uses of the aluminium alloys and also mildly touches upon some of the compatible alloy series. Aluminium is a highly recyclable material so it is interesting to study about what happens one it has reached its End of Life (EOL) stage. Sorting is an essential stage in the recycling of aluminium and there are solutions which encourage sorting based on alloy series which again is economically and ecologically beneficial. And for this to happen efficiently, singulation is essential. Singulation of aluminium is important to achieve better efficiency in the process of recycling which is the aim of companies such as Reukema. Although useful, singulation has many challenges. Since it is a solution which depends on the problem i.e., there is no universal way to singulate every kind of material, the problem here has challenges such as entangling of material, their landing on top of each other are just some of such problems which are looked at here. By simulation, it was found that the arrival pattern of the material follows a homogenously random distribution for smaller size fraction but a highly regularized distribution for large size fractions but smoothens to a homogenously random distribution as we increase the number of particles for both size fractions. The experiments performed after developing a time series were compared to a simulated singulation process and the results were not ideal in terms of singulation since the chute was not included in the process. The experimental setup needed to be optimised which could lead to even better and accurate results. Higher particle speed on the vibrating feeder could have played a crucial role.","aluminium; recycling; Circulaire Economie","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The spatial structure of public spaces, including the mobility networks, functional distribution, and presence of appropriable spaces and co-creative processes emerge as critical dimensions within which women’s needs must be met in order to achieve a state of social resilience in these systems, and promote women’s spatial and social mobility across the city. While urban planners and designers highlight ecological and economic resilience, social resilience is vital to establish, in order to achieve a balanced system of resilience. This research proposes an evolutionary approach to addressing and mitigating gender inequality in cities through urban planning and design practice using a strategic planning framework. This is proposed with the goal of increasing women’s capacity for participation through the strategic shaping of their local contexts according to their spatio-temporal needs. By redefining the parameters through which urban planning and design decisions are made, and addressing who is needed to make these decisions, the research proposes a guide to decision-makers on enhancing the socio-spatial integration of city residents. Through the comparison of the three distinct cultural contexts of Cairo, The Hague, and Seoul, across the dimensions of society, economy and space, the unique needs and variables contributing to women’s inhibition are pinpointed, and actions can then be proposed, using the local conditions, to tackle the spatial issues. This allows the framework to be implementable across cultural specificities, and provides a guide for urban planning practice holistically. The strategic framework proposed is therefore a tool that utilises local stakeholders and conditions to co-create and anchor urban transformations in the local context, and does not provide a definite spatial plan. Through addressing the role of urban planners and designers in creating conditions for gender equality, the research aims to provide a frame of reference for actor dynamics in co-creation processes, empowering women to appropriate public spaces as they see fit to reach their needs.","Space and gender; Gender-inclusive planning; Co-creation; Access; Mobility; Performativity; Strategic Planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","Planning Complex Cities",""

Using classes and interfaces, the new version makes it easier to do advanced computations on the results, while the interface makes it easier for Bluetick to add additional parts on which recommendations can be based. Secondly, similar to many existing webshops, the new system provides the user with insight into why items are recommended.

Their goal is to increase labor mobility between these organizations through sharing vacancies, exchanging employees and partaking in joint projects. Rotterdam Werkt! has tasked us with creating a central platform on which all vacancies are automatically combined from the websites of all the organizations in the network. The two main challenges of the project were to gather the vacancies from all the organizations affiliated with Rotterdam Werkt! and allow their recruiters to search and filter through them. This meant that a significant amount of research needed to be done in order to find a suitable scraping tool as well as a suitable search engine. Whilst gathering the vacancies, we ran into the problem that each website was significantly different in the way it is rendered. Furthermore, we also needed to categorize the data correctly such that it becomes searchable in the search engine. Lastly, the retrieval function needed to be optimized such that the most relevant vacancies would be returned for a given query. In order to assess whether recruiters could use the search engine effectively in practice, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the search engine was done. Three retrieval functions were compared based on a significance test of several effectiveness measures that indicate to what extent a retrieval function is able to retrieve relevant documents, or in this case, vacancies. Out of the three, the retrieval function that scored the highest was chosen to be used in the platform, so that recruiters will have a bigger chance to find the vacancies they will be looking for. In the end, we consider our project to be a success. We managed to scrape all vacancies from all the websites of the organizations in Rotterdam Werkt! and to combine these on a centralized platform. Furthermore, the search engine evaluation allowed us to select the best vacancy retrieval function out of the three evaluated retrieval functions. However, more work can still be put into evaluating the search engine in the future by testing more retrieval functions based on more vacancy data, so that the search functionality can be further improved.<br","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A design for a large housing complex in the transformed harbour area in the Merwe-Vierhavens in Rotterdam contributes to a solution to both of these issues at hand. The building contains a variety of compact dwellings that is suited for starters. This variation in dwelling types, however, makes the dwellings appropriate for many other types of residents. Because of this the building can evolve over time, according to changing societal conditions and demands on the market. The project is for a large part constructed out of renewable materials and demountable. A large green garden in the heart of the building serves as collective space. Moreover it acts as the key aspect in how the building deals with the aspect of water. Rainwater is not only collected in the garden and used in the building, it is also applied as a design element and with this adds to the quality of the garden and the awareness of residents concerning climate conditions.

The studios brief is to design a large residential building in the Merwe-Vierhavens (M4H) in Rotterdam, a former port area that is being redeveloped by the municipality. The guidelines from the municipality are to create a dense, dynamic urban area consisting of a living-makers function with an informal collective character . The studio's provided additional guidelines, namely, design for an urban area with a collective and inclusive living environment. The structure provided by the studio for this project is divided in a group and individual part. As a group we did literature research on Sennett, Building and Dwelling; Rasmussen, Experiencing Architecture. Furthermore, as a collective we did a multi case study on collectivity in residential buildings. One of the first things in every design process is to get a better understanding of the location. However, the M4H is not yet developed so, the task at hand was to collectively design an urban development plan for a part of the M4H, the Keile kwartier. The location was divided into four quadrants and each quadrant was developed in groups of four. The quadrant assigned to my group was quadrant C. The individual part of the studio started with research into our own fascination, the research was required to have a relevance to the society we live in. My research was triggered by the recent events around the corona crisis and this let me to the individualization of the society. The individual research needed to connect to a specific target group to whom this topic was applicable. The target audience for my graduation project consists of small households, like starters and empty nesters. These target groups needs are in line with the municipalities vision for the M4H development. The municipality requirements for the location are that it should become a live-work environment, more specifically a maker’s district. The research, target audience, and makers have to form a coherent entity. This entity has let to multiple design hypotheses that are translated into a concept design.","Social Cohesion; Individualization; modular architecture; CLT; Loneliness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Dwelling","","51.906327, 4.428442"

Any natural material used to be manipulated manually and made into an object of use, be it adobe for house building, timber beams for furniture making or linen yarn for cloth fabrication. The type of material remained the same, however the way of manipulation has changed strongly over the centuries. Mechanisation and industrialization have moved manual production away from the hands, towards machines. In Europe, craftsmanship played a major role in the economy until the industrialisation. Dating back to medieval times, the acquisition of a certain craft used to be taught in craft schools in which apprentices gained knowledge of the manipulation of different materials. Masons, carpenters, sculptures, weavers etc. were each consolidated in guilds that promoted the respective craft. Today, craftsmanship has almost been fully replaced by industrial mass production. Also, the education of traditional craftsmanship has almost completely disappeared from European culture. Mechanisation, however, has led to mass production of goods which in turn has become the cause of environmental damage, both on nature and on humans. Considering the effects of the industry on the wellbeing of the planet, craftsmanship has started to be reconsidered in many different fields of production. The statement “less is more” has become much more than the modernist desire for minimalism in architecture * - it has become a statement against mass production and a plea for a sustainable fabrication of goods. Today’s handmade production has the potential to bring about a smaller quantity with a better quality and strongly reduce the negative impact on the environment. Craftsmanship therefore needs to be given a new platform in the European culture, a platform that promotes the education and exertion of the traditional practice in a modern society. This research deals with the re-introduction and re-interpretation of crafts in the 21rst century in the Dutch context. Focussing on the crafts of textile it explores the specifics of textile production and proposes the conceptual framework of a school for textile craftsmanship in the city of Delft.","Textile School Gasthuisplaats","en","master thesis","","","","","","can be founding the appendix of the research report","","","","","","","Crafts in the City",""

To date, research of biomechanics and motor control discussed whether entropy algorithms could be used as a convenient tool to identify healthy gait function, to evaluate outcomes of physical therapies and to monitor the progression of disease. Here, we show that Sample Entropy (SaEn) is a sensitive measure for exposing complexity changes in human gait function.<br/><br/>Methods – We analyzed signal complexity changes in electromyography (EMG), ground reaction force (GRF) and joint angle (GA) time series data of asymmetrical step tasks. We used the coarse-grained time series method and the SaEn algorithm, to determine the temporal resolution that contained most complex structures per datatype. Subsequently, we analyzed complexity changes with age and with walking velocity in the selected resolution. We analyzed complexity changes with age, since healthy gait function is known to deteriorate with age. In turn, we analyzed complexity changes with walking velocity, since walking velocity is known to alter gait function. Eighteen young (mean age 23.27 +/- 1.79 years) and nineteen old (mean age 66.37 +/- 5.26 years) subjects were analyzed for an equal number of strides, described by an equal number of samples, to account for the SaEn dataset length bias. <br/><br/>Results – Age increased entropy in EMG signals. Consecutively, age decreased GRF entropy in the medial-lateral (ML) component for short steps and increased entropy for long steps. Lastly, age decreased entropy in GA signals. Furthermore, walking velocity decreased entropy in EMG signals. Consecutively, walking velocity increased GRF entropy in anterior-posterior (AP) and vertical (VE) components and decreased entropy in the medial-lateral (ML) component. Lastly, walking velocity increased entropy in GA signals. <br/><br/>Conclusions – We portrayed that EMG, GRF and GA signals of human gait altered in entropy with walking velocity and with age. Therefore, our results demonstrate the feasibility of SaEn to quantify changes in healthy gait function. Additional research should confirm possible future clinical applications for entropy algorithms.","human; gait; analysis; emg; ground; reaction; forces; kinematics; joint; angles; complexity; motor; variability; entropy; algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

In order to receive dialysis, adequate access to the circulation is needed. The golden standard, the Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF), hasn’t really changed since the 1940’s and comes with disappointing patency and reintervention rates. This is most likely due to increases in the flow pattern in the shunt and vein adjacent to the shunt. For a novel type of shunt that can regulate the blood flow, an implantable actuator needs to be developed and validated that can function as an interface and supply a force to the valve regulating the blood flow. In this study, an implantable actuator was developed using a methodological design approach that can deliver various output forces over an axial displacement using a magnetic coupling. It gives maximum control over the shunt by allowing control over the speed of the displacement and introduces multiple locking states. The actuator was then tested using various experimental tests. First the maximum force output was tested, then the reliability and durability were tested. Lastly, a goat cadaver study was performed to test the function of the device. From this study it was concluded that the actuator met all the design requirements and therefore provided an adequate proof-of-concept for the actuator as part of a dynamic arteriovenous shunt system. Next, the actuator should be implemented in the full shunt system and get connected to the valve using a suitable transmission system.","design based research; Validation and Verification; Actuator; Implant; Medical device design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-01-29","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The models are based on literature and data from CBS. Strategies are developed to assess two policy strategies, the use of (unmanned) pick-up points and the use of light electric freight vehicles (LEFV). The growth of e-commerce leads to logistic efficiency at the beginning, but eventually this efficiency growth will stop. Currently their is still logistic efficiency gained, this results in a less steeper growth of the negative impacts. The use of pick-up points is based on the same parameters providing the logistic efficiencies and are a strong long term solution to the growth. Furthermore, using pick-up points increases the rate of successful first time delivery, this results in less needed shipping capacity. Passenger transport is needed to pick-up the package, this effect is not incorporated. The use of LEFV’s reduces the amount of emitted pollution and the amount of road traffic movements.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This paper presents a machine learning approach to the aircraft and crew recovery problem. The presented model utilises a two-stage sequential approach recovering the aircraft and flight schedule first, followed by that of cockpit crew. At each stage, the recovery is assisted via use of decision tree-based machine learning classifiers to select a subset of relevant aircraft and crew, reducing the scope of the recovery operation. The aircraft stage is able to directly account for aircraft maintenance constraints, and indirectly account for the impact of the aircraft recovery on crew schedules and passenger itineraries. In the crew stage, the model directly accounts for the common cockpit crew labour constraints set by airlines operating within the US. The combined performance of the recovery model is evaluated via a case study on the US network of Delta Airlines. The results show that the crew selection algorithm can find an optimal solution to the crew recovery problem in 89% of non-trivial disruption instances, completing in 27 s on average, with an average objective function value only 5% higher than optimal. When including aircraft recovery results, the proposed approach increased the percentage of instances that obtain a solution within the AOCC-defined time limit from 47% to 95%, speeding up the average computational time threefold. The solution to the aircraft and crew recovery problem was globally optimal in 83% of cases, with an average objective function value 11% higher than optimal.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Air Transport and Operations","",""

(mentor); Rosbottom, D.J. (graduation committee); Pimlott, M. (graduation committee); Parravicini, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Protest has become a ubiquitous part of urban life as a result of the conditions that command processes of urbanisation. This project concerns itself with the advocation for spatial agency in cities by understanding how public space can contribute a form of cultural resistance within turbulent political and social contexts. The thesis aims to be understood as a manifesto; an architectural provocation that is committed to the democratic potentials of urban spaces. The research focused on the 2019 Santiago protests in Chile, a relevant precedent that demonstrates how ‘deliberative democracies’ of 21st Century Latin America are being challenged under current economic and political climates. The project considers the phenomena of protest as a manifestation of collective conscience translated into the physical occupation and de-powering of an urban territory, specifically the transformation of Plaza Italia to Plaza Dignidad in Santiago.<br/><br/> Throughout the previous 50 years, Latin American cities have experienced radical rates of urbanisation. A concrete plateau situated within the Andes Mountains, Santiago’s urban growth has been galvanised by the implementation of a neoliberal economic model under the dictatorial regime of Augusto Pinochet in the 1970s. It appears only the San Ramon tectonic fault line is capable of limiting the subordination of the rural to the urban, exposing the exploitative nature binding capitalism and urbanisation as a critical anchor of political and class struggle. The production of a protest culture has become a pivotal part of public life, where protest is not so much an abnormality, but a continuous urban condition in flux. A capacity for change commences with the awareness of the societal production of space, and the right to command and disrupt the urban structure: to decolonise the city.<br/><br/> In an effort to understand the capacity of public space to engage with processes of decolonisation, the research references fields such as sociology, political theory, and material culture to ensure a comprehensive analysis of the place. An in-depth theoretical understanding of the historical, cultural and political contexts supported observational work carried out during the protests in Santiago. This provided the framework for further post-situ ethnographic research on the spatial processes of decolonisation. In order to illustrate the act of decolonisation of Plaza Italia to Plaza Dignidad, a graphical documentation of the city's quotidian conditions alongside the destruction after protest took inspiration from methods and techniques used in archaeological drawing. The traces of protest thus delineated potential sites of intervention and provided a graphical representation of the physical, material and spatial conditions of the place.<br/><br/> During the months of protest, monuments throughout the country were repeatedly damaged and dismantled in a collective effort to reject the acceptance and permanence of stone statues that gave testament to a manipulated history. From monuments to ruins, the remains of colonial, oligarchical and patriarchal figures littered the streets, pronouncing the continent’s stolen identities. Within the urban fabric, the imposition of Monuments represent loci of power and conflict, where the iconographic glorification can be experienced as a violent intrusion on the public and collective sphere. Thus the re-purposing of monuments becomes the significant genesis of the project. By removing the existing statues from their plinths, power is dislocated and the status of the monument is redefined. An iconoclastic inventory documents these artefacts, their material, their dimensions, and their histories. The extensive catalogue archives the data of the defaced monuments and their respective plinths, in order to imagine how these artefacts could be re-appropriated and represented within public space in a sensitive and democratic manner.<br/><br/> In relation to the city, the brief imagines embedded scales that resist urban conditions and provide moments of spatial agency. The protest route is understood as an urban territory composed of three significant elements: the presidential palace, the street and the plaza. As the city’s main site for mass social manifestation, Plaza Dignidad forms a focal point within this symbolic and political landscape, through its convergence of principle roads, the river Mapocho and the Andes mountains. Translated into a programme, the project forms 3 spatial infrastructures: a Cultural Itinerary along the protest route incorporating the constellation of remaining plinths within the identified urban territory; Plaza Dignidad a civic infrastructure for urban ecology, civic engagement and public mobility; and a Public Archive facilitating a civic programme that aims to re-define the monument through the documentation and conservation of defaced statues. The urban strategy speculates a collective collaboration with actors within the city. Alongside the Chilean Council of National Monuments, the existing cultural and educational institutions that populate the avenue Alameda take responsibility to intervene with the surrounding empty pedestals according to their specific institutional programme, creating a constellation of didactic moments that puncture the public space. <br/><br/> The project focuses on the design of Plaza Dignidad as a monumental void that resists the dense urban fabric contained between two existing linear infrastructures: the L1 Metro line and the Mapocho River. Through a cultural, historical and political itinerary along the protest route, the spatial experience of a continuous public space seeks to be pedagogical and symbolic, by focusing the citizen perspective to engage with the provocative idea of ​​the horizon as a device to dismantle urban spatial hierarchies and power structures. The proposal to materialise Plaza Dignidad as a new horizon in the city encouraged the design approach to focus on the articulation of the territory and the ground. Expressing the plaza as a plinth, it is designed as a civic stage for daily rituals and social manifestation. The communication of the soil was extended to the material and construction processes. Led by an investigation into the existing soil conditions and the sedimentation layers that revealed the geological formation of the site, the main construction methodology sought the use of earthen construction, referring to vernacular traditions and proposing unconventional uses of the construction of rammed earth underground.<br/><br/> As an idea that tries to recover an urban territory to its people and its environment, the project brings together Plaza Dignidad, the Mapocho Riverbank and an underground public archive into a connected programme. The river promenade and peripheral gardens populate the urban site with native flora that once grew in abundance throughout the Santiago valley. In a symbolic gesture that relocates statues underground and replaces them with stone caryatids, these abstracted geological sculptures redefine the monument. The concept of ​​the ‘natural monument’ transcends the entire project across various scales and extends to the materiality of the square, which celebrates the richness and beauty of Chile’s geological diversity. The status of the political monument is subverted and redefined through ecology by empowering place, culture and memory. <br/><br/>The act of decolonisation comes from displacing political power and iconography, by returning a piece of the city to its indigenous landscape in which the re-appropriation of the square becomes a catalyst for the re-appropriation of the city as a whole, confronting the political and redefining the horizons between the ground, monuments, people, the city and the landscape.","Decolonisation; Archive; Public Space; Monument; Protest; Santiago","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

This graduation project explores whatis needed to make a shift from multi-leg flights to air-rail journeys withinEurope in 2030.The project is executed within the Seamless Personal Mobility Lab.Partners of the project are NS International, Schiphol Group, KLM RoyalDutch Airlines and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water management.The stakeholders are involved during the entire project. Above all, theproject took an use-centered approach, which means that the user’sperspective is leading. The project explores how the future air-rail journeycould truly address the needs and wishes of the international air-railtraveller.The goal of the project is to create a design vision for air-rail journeys, thatfacilitates in creating a seamless travel experience between planes andinternational trains within Europe. To create this design vision, researchregarding the rationale, steps &amp; patterns, users and stakeholders isconducted. This creates understanding of the needs, wishes and currentproblems surrounding air-rail journeys.Based upon the user research, the needs of international air-rail travellerscan be defined with the use of six need-based personas: The determinedsurvivor, the vulnerable rookie, the self-sufficient manager, the peacefulcollaborator, the spontaneous adventurer and the certainty seeker. heanalysis shows that international trains and flights are not well integrated,which makes the system hard to access, results in an incoherent serviceand creates an uncertain travel experience. This negatively influences thechoice for a more sustainable alternative than the air-air journey.Based upon the gathered insights, a design vision for future air-rail journeyis designed. First a concept vision is created, which is evaluated with usersand stakeholders. After that, the final service design vision of the AirRailAlliance is developed, based upon the gathered insights.The AirRail Alliance aims to unify air and rail, stimulates travellers to choosefor air-rail and assures them about and throughout the journey. By creatinga fair choice and providing a comfortable transfer and coherent services,the service aims to stimulate international air-rail travellers to choose forair-rail journeys instead of multi-leg flights. The AirRail alliance integratesservices, provides continuous guidance and manages disruptions over theentire journey. The traveller should experience this collaboration betweentrain operators and airlines, in the feeling of one coherent and unifiedjourney. Ultimately, continuous guidance, support and integrated disruptionmanagement should result in a feeling that nothing can go wrong, thefeeling of assurance.By implementing the service according to the strategic roadmap, anambitious scenario of substitution from air to rail can become reality in2030. This scenario will mean that around 12.000 air-rail travellers a daywill travel with the AirRail Alliance, which could lead to the substitution of63.000 flights on a yearly basis.","Air-rail; Substitution; Service Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-01","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In this dissertation, the adhesive characteristics of offshore high plasticity clay will be analyzed in support to deep sea mining applications. Adhesion of clays are particularly relevant in 2:1 swelling clays, where the magnitude of the force is highly dependant on the clay properties itself, working conditions and the soil engaging component surface material. The most prevalent force in offshore saturated conditions arises from the suction forces between micro-channels in the clay and the soil engaging component. Methods to reduce this adhesive force were assessed, ranging from solutions such as vibrations and electro-osmosis, to modifying the soil engaging surface to break continuous contacts between the clay and component. The natural adhesion of two typical offshore clays were experimentally determined by interface shear tests for the shear adhesion and pull-out tests for tensile adhesion. Interfacial shear strength was measured for typical materials found in the offshore industry, that being steel, aluminium, rubber and a polymer coating. Results from the tests showed that materials do have an impact on adhesive stresses. Similarly, pull-out tests showed this variation pattern. The influence of pull-out rates and contact time on adhesive tensile strength were also assessed and showed to increase with faster rates and longer contact times, respectively. In application to a typical rotational cutterwheel in deep sea mining, a scaled test-setup of a rack of cutter-teeth was dragged through the test clay to acquire horizontal cutting forces with the utilization of the experimentally found natural adhesion in the interface tests. The found adhesion value for the test clays were utilized to validate the cutting clay model from ""The Delft Sand, Clay &amp; Rock Cutting Model"" (Miedema, 2019). Practical results from the scaled experiment seemed to coincide relatively well with the theoretical model. It is therefore recommended to further investigate the use of experimental means to determine adhesion of clays to develop an even more accurate empirical model.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-02-05","","","","Geotechnical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Prins, André (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Active inference is a method for state estimation and control actions that is based on the Free Energy principle, which explains how biological agents infer the state of their environment and act upon it by maintaining a model of that environment and evaluating predictions. This method merges both action and sensory processing and is therefore a promising approach for robotic control. In active inference, the internal representations (or states) in the agent can be described by applying hierarchical dynamical models (HDMs). This offers a way to describe the dynamical development of states, and to structure them hierarchically. Despite the possibilities of this hierarchical approach, there are very few examples of hierarchical active inference being applied to robotics or control problems. This thesis aims to make a step in exploring the possibilities of active inference under a HDM. We describe the implementation of a control algorithm based on the hierarchical formulation of active inference on several continuous control problems, most importantly a 2-D robot arm. The algorithm is first demonstrated with a basic single level cart simulation, analysing the effect of the various parameters and inclusion of higher dynamic orders on the stability. A following simulation of multiple carts demonstrates a simple example of a hierarchical division of goals, and how high level objectives are realized by reaching lower level goals. It also shows how insolvable prediction errors at lower levels are propagated up the hierarchy. Finally, the simulation of a 2-D robot arm shows how these hierarchies can introduce goal-directed behaviour in practical control problems. We made several attempts to design a hierarchical generative model capable of realizing position-reaching behaviour in the robot arm, dictating joint angles from desired positions, with varying levels of success. Several pitfalls were encountered in choosing a suitable model for the control task. Most importantly, it was found that the convergence was faulty when higher levels contained more independent states. This emphasizes the information-reducing role of hierarchies. Lastly, we demonstrate that the hierarchical generative model is capable of adding complexity to the robots behaviour, by expanding the goal-reaching objective with a path-tracing task. In short, hierarchical active inference can be applied effectively to the demonstrated goal-reaching control problems, however this requires a careful consideration of the generative model for the task at hand.","Active Inference; Hierarchy; Robot arm control; Robotics; Free Energy Principle; Generative Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Continuous sea level rise and growing environmental awareness have led to increasing implementation of nature-based solutions to counter coastal erosion. An example in the Netherlands is the Sand Engine---a mega-scale sand nourishment designed to feed the Dutch coast over a period of 20 years. For such designs to work, a good understanding of the governing natural processes is paramount. The behaviour of the sandy coast, however, is subject to natural variability in future weather and uncertainties in the interactions between sand dynamics and hydrodynamic forcing. To predict the evolution of coastal systems, engineers apply numerical models. Next to uncertainty due to variability in natural forcing, such models introduce a series of model-related uncertainties, which are often not consistently included in predictions. With limited knowledge of the magnitude of these uncertainties, the long-term strategy development and design of projects are impeded. Parameter uncertainty denotes our limited knowledge of the values of free model parameters and is an important source of overall model uncertainty. This study aims to quantify parameter uncertainty in process-based coastal area predictions by analysing uncertainty bounds for morphodynamic predictions of the Sand Engine. The analysis of parameter uncertainty is carried out for a study period of 14 months, from August 2011 (directly after construction of the Sand Engine) until October 2012. Using advanced numerical acceleration techniques, a synthetic dataset of 1024 morphological Delft3D predictions is generated, each with an identical hindcast period but different model parameter settings. First, a sensitivity analysis (elementary effects method) is performed to find the most influential parameters on three morphological indicators: cumulative volume change, shoreline position, and bed level change. Based on the sensitivity analysis, five parameters are selected for an uncertainty analysis. Subsequently, parameter uncertainty is quantified by the Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE). To increase the convergence speed of the samples, quasi-random Sobol sampling is applied. To validate the applied parameter ranges and assess model performance, the predictions are compared to observations. Using GLUE, uncertainty bounds for the morphological indicators and posterior likelihood distributions of the five parameters are derived from the 1024 model runs. Finally, through a simplified uncertainty comparison, the relative influence of parameter uncertainty and wave climate variability is examined. A first key conclusion is that uncertainty in input parameters translates to significant uncertainty in predictions: cumulative erosion volumes for the peninsula show a spread of 1.3 -0.4/+0.7 million m3 after 14 months. Extended to bed level changes in 2D, the uncertainty bounds result in spatial uncertainty maps, which reveal that uncertainty is highest (5--6 $m$ spread) in the northern area of the peninsula, where a sand spit develops. Most uncertainty (90% for volume changes) develops in the first seven months, during which uncertainty growth correlates strongly to periods of high morphological activity (r &gt; 0.95 for volume changes). Further, posterior likelihood distributions of the parameters indicate that, of the five selected parameters based on the sensitivity analysis, only three (f_sus, gamma, and d_50) significantly contribute to parameter induced uncertainty, while the other two (alpha_rol and theta_sd) are considerably less influential. This contrast in results is attributed to a resolution problem in the sensitivity analysis. Optimised parameter sets derived from the posterior likelihood distributions result in similar model skill as the best GLUE simulations (BSS = 0.8), implying that they may be close to the maximum achievable model skill within the examined parameter ranges. Finally, a simplified estimate of the variation due to wave climate variability is in the same order of magnitude as the parameter induced uncertainty bounds, implying that both uncertainty sources form significant contributions to overall prediction uncertainty. The presented results have an impact on two key levels. First, they can be used to communicate and address uncertainty in predictions of coastal change. For example, the spatial uncertainty maps can let stakeholders understand the potential range of outcomes for a certain design. Second, the results, combined with the created dataset, can provide valuable information for future morphodynamic studies. This work contributes to justifying the need for stochastic simulations, which are expected to be increasingly used for many coastal engineering and management purposes in the years to come.","Sand Engine; DELFT3D; Morphodynamic modeling; Uncertainty Analysis; Parameter uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The human interacts with the remote environment by manipulating a haptic device. Recently, research effort into tactile internet and haptic devices has seen a significant increase. However replicating one aspect of executing an action, feeling textures, is still in its infancy. Current devices that can portray texture are severely limited, which also interferes with the ability to research the topic. In this thesis, we propose a novel device that can realistically portray textures to the fingertip, and respond to displacement in real-time. We call this a Haptic Texture Device (HTD). The design features custom actuators, with low latency &lt; 0.6ms and at least 50mN per mm2 of pushing force. The actuators are placed in a grid with a 2.0mmpitch at the fingertip. TheHaptic TextureDevice (HTD) can be moved over a 2D surface. Movement of the HTD results in real-time updates to the portrayed texture to reflect the displacement. The end-to-end delay between displacement and update of the texture was measured to be 17 ms. However, we demonstrated that the theoretical limit of the end-to-end delay could bewell below1 ms, by making use of higher quality displacement sensor. Readily available heightmaps are used as a source of texture data. Because a method for characterizing the performance hitherto did not exist, a novel benchmark was developed that incorporates realistic textures and human participants. The results of our benchmarking yielded an average score of 61%. Since the device is the first of its kind, it cannot be compared to similar devices yet, but it can be used as a starting point on which future HTDs can improve.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-30","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

Having developed a country below sea level, Dutch people are aware of the challenges of the sea, but are committed in an endless fight against it. Nowadays, with global warming increasing, the challenge for them is even bigger. Sea level rises threateningly, and the estimations about the future conditions are characterized by deep uncertainty. For that reason, the Dutch government identified 13 weak links in the coastal defence system, one of which is the area of interest for this research, the Scheveningen district and its surroundings, belonging to the Municipality of The Hague. Apart from its vulnerable coastal defence position, the area is densely populated and the most popular beach destination of the country. The aim of this research is to provide water safety solutions in the long term (until 2100), while taking into account the stakeholders demands. Secondly, compare the designs and identify specific aspects in which decision makers in the Municipality of The Hague would be forced to make compromises in order to implement a final solution for the project. Thirdly, investigate on additional measures that can complement and optimize the water safety design. For that reason, a background research was conducted through literature reviewing, interviewing experts and stakeholders, in order to collect information about possible sea level rise scenarios, existing boundaries of the system and stakeholders perspectives. The water safety issue was tackled with nature-based solutions following the principles of Integrated Coastal Zone Management by Building with Nature a framework that delivers solutions for sustainable infrastructure. Two solutions packages were obtained. The first one uses a Preserve strategy, attempting to maintain the current coastline position with soft (sandy) interventions where possible, keeping construction costs relatively low. The second package uses an Advance strategy, extending land in the seaward direction, and creating a large space for the development of natural habitats and human activities. To evaluate and compare the resulting designs, a Multi Criteria Analysis was conducted according to five criteria: Recreation and tourism, Social values, Ecology, Economy and Finance, Sustainability, Design. The goal of this part of the analysis is not the selection of a winner option but the assistance to the decision making process by providing strengths and weaknesses of each option, as well as a comparison between the two in terms of the above mentioned criteria. From this point on, this research identified a total of eight aspects where the decision maker, the Municipality of The Hague, would be forced to make some sort of compromises between different interests, in order to implement the project. The evaluation process resulted in a slight preference for the Advance strategy as the most integrated solution package. The optimization of this design was realised and four additional measures were proposed, leading to a more holistic proposal with more chances to bring acceptance among all stakeholders involved.","Building with Nature; solutions in coastal landscapes; Integrated Coastal Zone Management; Scheveningen; Water safety; Climate Change; Water Resilient; Nature Based Solutions; sandy solutions; Multidisciplinary; MDP","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","Delta Futures Lab","52.1143, 4.2786"

An entrance of around 100 km wide narrows into a funnel­shaped bay towards the Sittaung River in the north. The entire estuary region is subject to strong dynamic morphological activity which is alleged to be driven by the large tidal energy and sediment inputs. The dynamics of the tidal channels in the Sittaung estuary have resulted in rapid bank erosion of up to 3 km/y. The Sittaung estuary harbours a unique set of characteristics. This has made the question of which processes and mechanisms cause the bank erosion a complex one for which no clear cut answer is currently available. The knowledge of the main processes and mechanisms is valuable to improve the understanding of morphological functioning in dynamic estuaries. The main research question has thus been formulated as: • What is the effect of the large incoming tide and storm events on the bank erosion of the Sittaung estuary and to what extent can this erosion be simulated with a numerical model? The research objectives have been achieved through a literature analysis, system analysis, satellite analysis and modelling simulations. Main conclusions of the research have been as follows: The satellite analysis has shown little to no correlation between the wet season discharge increase and the bank erosion rates. It also showed large differences between erosion rates at different heights of the estuary. Modelling results indicate a prominent role but cannot substantiate a quantitative impact of the tidal forcing and associated tidal bore. River discharge fluctuations were shown to have little effect on the bank erosion. • The results of both the satellite and numerical modelling analysis have shown no additional implications on the dynamic morphology caused by large incidental storm events. Long­term simulations with respect to the bank erosion resulted in several hindrances. Heightened levels of channel incision occurred through a fault in the numerical schematization. The representation of bank erosion in the model has also been subject to stalling.","Dynamic Morphology, Bank Erosion, Estuary, Modelling, Delft3D, Satellite Analsysis, Modelling Analysis, Tidal Bore, Sittaung Estuary, Myanmar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16°57′54″, 96°59′15"

Important functions of beaches are the protection of the inland to the forces of the sea and providing local opportunities in recreation. The impact of storm events on the beach is therefore an important topic of research especially with future climate change predicting more extreme events with the influence of Sea Level Rise expected to result in a worldwide decrease in beach area.The famous Copacabana beach, located at the South-Atlantic ocean is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Rio de Janeiro with thousands of visitors per year. The beach is characterized by its parabolic shape with rocky headlands on either sides. In July 2019 a storm event occurred at the beach with a 7-day period of energetic waves. This resulted in significant erosion along the whole beach up to 40 meters leaving not more than 10 meters of beach width in the South part of the beach. The period of erosion was followed up by a period with year-round average wave conditions resulting in rapid natural recovery with the beach returning to its original beach width within a period of 4 weeks. The focus of this research is on the cycle of erosion with subsequent recover which is important in having a long-term sustainable beach cycle.The history of Copacabana beach is marked by one major nourishment in 1970 which resulted in the 55 meter widening of the beach parallel avenue and an average widening of the beach of 35 meters. From 1970 onwards historically available satellite images show a stable beach behavior with the equilibrium profile of the beach showing smaller beach widths in the South compared to the North. A dataset of high resolution Sentinel 2 is analyzed in terms of beach width for a period of 4 years. This clearly shows the short-term variations in beach width of which most are the result of the impact of storm events. This highlights the impact of the July 2019 storm event showing rapid recovery in terms of beach width.Storm events are characterized by a 2 to 7-day period of energetic swell-dominated waves often from in between the South and SSE. The maximum wave height during the July 2019 storm event was of a yearly return period in combination with an erosional impact which was of lower frequency according to locals. What caused the big erosional impact was the long 7-day duration of the storm in combination with an extraordinary wave direction from the SE. Under this wave direction the South part of the beach is most vulnerable due to a convergence of wave energy as a result of bottom refraction. In combination with a lower equilibrium width in this part of the beach due to the lack of sand placement during the 1970 nourishment this part of the beach is most vulnerable to storm impact. The subsequent beach recovery process shows rapid beach width recovery with recovery rates up to 1.4m/day. This is the result of mild wave steepness due to the swell-dominated wave climate in combination with the equilibrium beach state characterized by an attached sandbar. Both these system characteristics are positively related to the recovery rates (Phillips et al., 2017). However, structural erosion is visible in terms of backbeach elevation in the South part of the beach which as of 16 months after the July 2019 erosion event shows no signs of recovery.To further test the beach vulnerability, the July 2019 storm and subsequent recovery period are modelled subsequentially with the XBeach Surfbeat and- stationary mode. With the use of scenario modelling an attempt is made to test the vulnerability related to wave characteristics, erosion/recovery duration and the frequency of storms. Judgement of the model performance resulted in good model applicability and realistic model results for the erosion simulation. The results confirm the highest impact is in the South part of the beach under a SE wave direction. Besides this, the impact of an increased wave height (resulting in a 21% increase in erosional volume with a 10% increase in wave height) is more significant along the whole beach compared to an increased extreme event duration (resulting in a 9% increase in erosional volume with a 20% longer duration). During periods of recovery the swash zone processes become more important. These processes are not well represented in XBeach. To compensate for these effects the Bermslope model can be used forcing the slope in the swash zone to a pre-defined value (Roelvink &amp; Costas, 2017). The model results however still shows a limited interaction between the beachface and the sub-aquatic part of the beach resulting in accretion further offshore than is observed in reality. From this it is concluded that it is not possible to assess the beach vulnerability in relation to recovery rates with XBeach.The third and last part of this research looks into the future changes in beach vulnerability taking into account the effect of climate change. Local long term climate trends are analyzed with the use of multiple data sources. This results in a clear positive trend showing a future increase of mean wave height. For the other climate parameters like the extreme wave height, storm frequency and wave direction a wide range of trends is found. This often shows both a positive and negative trend among the available data. Within the range of future climate trends there is a clear indication of a future increase in beach vulnerability. Both an increase in the mean wave height as a potential increase in extreme wave heights has significant implications on the erosional quantities judging from the model results. Where a 10% increase in extreme event wave heights results in a 22% increase in erosional quantities according to the model results. With a possible eastward change of mean wave direction chances of SE directed storm events increases resulting in increased beach vulnerability in the South under convergence of wave energy. For Sea Level Rise the impact is relatively highest in the South of the beach with beach decay predictions being approximated at a maximum of 8.4 meters as of 2070 with the use of the Bruun rule (Bruun, 1962). From this it is concluded that the vulnerability of the South part of the beach is bound to increase the most in the future with also taking into account the structural backbeach erosion as a consequence of the July 2019 erosion event. Future interventions with the goal decreasing beach vulnerability should focus on either widening or further protecting the South part of the beach.","Embayed Beach; Brazil; Beach erosion; Vulnerability; Beach recovery; XBeach; beach scarp; Climate change; Nourishment strategies; Diffraction; Hydraulic Engineering; Coastal Engineering; civil engineering; TU Delft","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","Master Thesis","-22.970465,-43.182436"

A fundamental issue is that the shaking forces and moments of the manipulator cause the UAV to tip-over and become unstable. Control based methods have been applied in which the UAV provided a compensation force or moment at the propellers. However, the dynamic model required was too complex to compute on-board in real time and simplifications led to poor performance. This thesis resolves the issue of shaking forces and moments by creating a new manipulator using inherent dynamic balancing principles. The advantage of these principles is that the manipulator architecture achieves both functions of supporting and positioning the end effector as well as balancing. This helps to reduce the weight of the manipulator. The result of the synthesis work is a manipulator which is reactionless, lightweight, has 3 degrees of freedom, and is compatible with a UAV. First a manipulator is designed using inherently force balanced architectures. Next, active moment balancing is developed through a novel control scheme. Finally, a simulation is performed to prove the dynamic balancing and control method. It shows the manipulator is reactionless. However, the control scheme’s tracking still needs improvement. This work is useful to enable UAVs with manipulators to perform a variety of tasks such as inspections of surfaces at height.","Dynamic balancing; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; Manipulator; Mechatronic System Design; Control system; Robotic manipulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-29","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

Current FVEP assessment may be elaborated with the acquisition of stimulus response (SR) relation of the visual system. A drawback of this adjustment is the time required for data acquisition. This study aimed to develop an optimal (rapid) stimulus paradigm for assessing the SR relationship using FVEP.SR relationships were obtained using two different protocols in eight healthy participants; one considered 100 stimuli for 10 different intensity levels (standard technique), the other considered 1000 stimuli of varying intensity levels within a fixed intensity range (novel technique). Hypothetically the novel technique produces a similar SR relationship but requiring reduced number of stimuli. However, the present study did not find a significant intensity dependency on the FVEP. Consequently, no mathematical model for the SR relation was fit to the data, and exploration of the novel technique was excluded. Instead, the present study investigated the minimal number of stimuli required to acquire a representative FVEP component. Secondly, the potential change of FVEP components during the experiment was investigated. This study demonstrates that it is possible to acquire a reliable FVEP component with on average 54 stimuli (gross mean (39) + 1 SD (14)), independent of stimulus intensity. Additionally, this study demonstrated that the FVEP components change significantly (p&lt;0.05) for most stimulus intensities when 1000 or more flashes are used; amplitudes increased with time for low intensity stimulation, while amplitudes reduced with time for high intensity stimulation. Although the present study did not find an intensity dependency of the FVEP component, it demonstrated that stimulation time is an important parameter when acquiring SR relationships using FVEP. The stimulation time certainly influenced the SR relationship calculated in the present study. Further studies can and should reduce the number of stimuli to produce a representative SR relationship using FVEP.","Electroencephalography (EEG); Flash Visual Evoked Potential (FVEP); Stimulus-Response (SR) Curve","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Key characteristics that this tool must incorporate to be successful are defined as feedback (the ability to provide rapid and reliable analysis results), guidance (the ability to guide the user towards better designs), design freedom (the ability to allow users to make their own decisions and use their own expertise) and structural overview (the ability to make the general structural behavior clear instantly). Graphic Statics has been identified as a suitable method to model and compute the force flow with, and has been incorporated as the base of the tool. A workflow has been devised where the user first identifies and investigates a design problem manually, creating an initial design that must be used as input for the tool, which includes a definition of joints, members. loads, supports and certain boundary conditions. Due to the nature of Graphic Statics, this initial design must be statically determinate. The tool has been developed for Grasshopper, a parametric and associative modelling plugin of Rhinoceros, which provides a platform that meets the defined development criteria of accessibility, real-time modelling, geometric flexibility, extensibility, and presentation independence. The developed prototype bearing the name of GSDesign consists of custom components scripted in C# containing the main functionality, as well as Grasshopper clusters for specific visualization sequences. GSDesign facilitates the design of 2D truss-like structures, which can be interpreted as force flow designs, whose efficiency is quantified in the total load path. Feedback is generated in real-time, and is presented in a force diagram, form diagram, unified diagram, and/or as numerical values, providing precise and accurate results. Guidance is incorporated intrinsically through Graphic Statics, but also by the incorporation of an optimization process using the total load path value and the genetic optimization component Galapagos native to Grasshopper. Design freedom is ensured through the general setup of the tool, which allows for maximum utilization of the design flexibility that Grasshopper offers. The tool provides a clear structural overview through the visualizations that characterize Graphic Statics, which can be customized to preference by the user. A user experiment has been set up to test the functionality and workflow of the tool in a simple design case carried out by structural engineers to ensure its practical value. Eleven participants were asked to first create an initial design by hand, and subsequently reproduce that design in GSDesign and improve it with optimization. The use of GSDesign visibly led to new insights towards more efficient structural forms, which was supported by an average drop of 31% in structural material volume when comparing the fitness data of the optimized design with the initial design. Also the participants on average rated their own optimized design more than 40% higher on structural efficiency than their initial manual design, importantly without compromising on practical feasibility.","Graphic Statics; force flow; Structural design; design tool; Structural Components; Force distribution; Grasshopper; Efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/FlorisWL/Graduation-BE The GitHub page of the author containing the C# code and the force flow design tool.","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

Offshore wind energy has shown great potential to financially compete with traditional energy sources. Recent developments like the slip-joint connection increase this potential. However, for further optimization of the design of a slip-joint, the location of the contact areas between the two cones must be known. Previous attempts to detect these contact areas based on techniques such as heat transfer or ultrasonic measurements have proven insufficient. A possible new way of detecting contact areas, is through the behaviour of Energy Flux. Energy Flux methods have shown great potential as a damping identification tool in other applications. Therefore, in this study the relation between Energy Flux behaviour and the presence of a contact point in the time-, frequency- and time-frequency-domain is studied. To this end, a numerical analysis of a vibrating simply supported Euler Bernoulli beam is conducted, simulating a contact area with a point load. The analysis in the frequency-domain showed the most promising results. Presence of a contact point (i) introduces peaks at twice the first and twice the second eigenfrequencies, and (ii) increases peak height at the location of the contact point. The pressure of the simulated contact point increased these effects. In the time-domain the presence of a contact point increased the amplitude of the cumulative energy flux. This change was most significant at the antinode of the first eigenmode. The location of the contact point was of little influence on this effect. These results show that the presence of a contact area influences the behaviour of the energy flux. The results are encouraging for a later implementation of the energy flux method for the detection of contact areas in a slip-joint. As a validation of these results, an experiment has been proposed. After execution of this experiment, further research is needed in (i) the behaviour of Energy Flux in a conical shape, and (ii) Energy Flux measurements of higher frequencies.","Energy Flux Analysis; Slip-joint; vibration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Over the past four years, the market share of online grocery shopping showed an average growth of over 20% per year. While it was already challenging to keep up with this high demand, it became increasingly more difficult due to COVID-19. In fear of getting infected, some consumers no longer visit the supermarkets, and instead, order their groceries online, further increasing the demand for e-groceries. One of the challenges caused by the high demand is handling enough customer orders in the online grocery fulfilment centres. These fulfilment centres can be described as “supermarkets” in which groceries are collected by operators instead of the consumer. After the groceries have been collected, they are either delivered to the consumer, or they can be collected at a pick-up point. While multiple strategies are described in literature that allow for the handling of more customer orders, most of them have only been applied to warehouses and distribution centres. Due to the significantly different operations of fulfilment centres, it is unknown whether the same strategies can be applied here. This thesis examines which strategies are appliable to online grocery fulfilment centres and how much additional customer orders can be handled. The identification of strategies was done through a case study at AH Online’s fulfilment centre in Rotterdam. A discrete-event simulation model was then used to evaluate the strategies. The output of this thesis is an overview of four strategies including their performance on timesaving, order picking productivity, and of course, the additional number of customer orders that can be handled. <br","Online grocer; Strategies; Simulation Model; 3D Model; Process Flow Model; Covid-19; Groceries","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Due to the presence of the water storage layer, a green-blue roof is better capable of retaining heavy rain events. A movable valve makes it possible to manage the amount of water on the roof and the timing of drainage from the roof to the sewer system, while in addition the stored amount of water is made available to the vegetation layer via a passive capillary irrigation system. This could potentially result in a higher evapotranspiration rate and therewith a reduction of the sensible heat flux compared to green roofs. Because of its qualities, green-blue roofs have been added to the list of measures that contribute to mitigation of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect and pluvial flooding. However, during dry summers a third climate related challenge arises namely drought. The question arises whether it is sustainable to increase the amount of vegetation in cities, as this increases the water demand during droughts. During long dry spells it can be challenging to store enough water for vegetation and cooling while keeping sufficient empty storage available at the same time. A conflict in water related functionalities of the roof is the result. It was the aim of this thesis to investigate how implementation of green-blue roofs can be made climate resilient by defining its strengths and weaknesses regarding temperature management and water consumption and come up with possible ways to improve the roof system. By conducting a measurement campaign in the summer of 2020, it was investigated if the presence of a water storage layer indeed enhances the cooling effect of a green-blue roof on the indoor and outdoor environment. Thermal fluxes at a green-blue roof and a conventional black roof were analysed, as well as two situations with either an empty of full water storage layer at the green-blue roof. Furthermore, a bucket model was designed to study the climate resilience of green-blue roofs for the climate scenarios of the KNMI for 2050. Based on the results, it is concluded that additional adaptation measures are required to make sure green-blue roofs can still contribute to a better and more resilient urban area towards the future. Several measures are available to improve the performance on water retention and drought resilience, like valve management, enlargement of the storage capacity on the roof or on ground level and irrigation. Closing the water cycle locally is important to make green-blue roofs self-sustainable in water consumption, which reduces the risk on conflicts on water use during droughts. Only regarding UHI mitigation, other measures like creating shade could be more efficient as the enhanced cooling of the urban area due to unlimited water availability is small, unless largescale application of green-blue roofs.","Green Blue roofs; Climate resilience; Urban environment; Urban drought; Extreme rainfall; Urban heat island effect; Bucket model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

(mentor); Lagendijk, R.L. (graduation committee); Roos, S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Network covert timing channels are techniques to covertly transmit information over computer networks, by utilizing the time between subsequent network packets. Previous work on the detection of the various techniques has introduced numerous new methods, with high reported success. From these previous works we have noticed that there is little confirmation on these results in subsequent works, as well as there being a lack of an overview for the efficiency of each method. Next to this, we have found that many works use data in their experiments that may not be representative of real network scenarios. In this thesis we attempt to remedy this lack of information, by performing a broad performance evaluation on the currently existing singular detection metrics. This performance evaluation was done on a total of 18 different detection methods, applied to the 8 most prevalent covert timing channels. For the underlying network data, we gathered SSH and HTTPS traffic from the TU Delft, and applied varying amounts of simulated network jitter to them. From the resulting evaluations we find that there are cases where the detection methods do perform similarly to what has been shown in previous work, but we also find those that have a large difference in performance. Further, we discuss possible strengths and weaknesses of each of the detection methods, based on their performance, and in some cases how this performance might be improved. Using the (simulated) network scenarios we show the effects that jitter and different traffic types can have on each of the detection methods, and also find those that are resilient to network effects. Finally, we combine the full experimental performance evaluations into a comprehensive overview, for each combination of detection method and covert channel technique. We find that the current detection methods are likely not sufficient to be reliably applied in a realistic network setting, and more work needs to be done in this field to reach that point. The overview and discussions we have provided can then serve as a basis for future research, to give an indication of where performance needs to be improved.","network covert channels; covert timing channels; detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

This research investigates the use of learned world models to create more sample-efficient algorithms. We present a novel multi-agent model-based reinforcement learning algorithm: Multi-Agent Model-Based Policy Optimization (MAMBPO), utilizing the Centralized Learning for Decentralized Execution (CLDE) framework, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of sample efficiency on a number of benchmark domains. CLDE algorithms allow a group of agents to act in a fully decentralized manner after training. This is a desirable property for many systems comprising of multiple robots. Current CLDE algorithms such as Multi-Agent Soft Actor-Critic (MASAC) suffer from limited sample efficiency, often taking many thousands of trials before learning desirable behaviours. This makes these algorithms impractical for learning in real-world robotic tasks. MAMBPO utilizes a learned world model to improve sample efficiency compared to its model-free counterparts. We demonstrate on two simulated multi-agent robotics tasks that MAMBPO is able to reach similar performance to MASAC with up to 3.7 times fewer samples required for learning. Doing this, we take an important step towards making real-life learning for multi-agent robotic systems possible.","model-based; Reinforcement Learning; Multi-agent; Decentralized Control; deep learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The use of improved learning methods has paved a way forward for researches to explore various theories to improve existing methods. One among various learning methods is Hierarchical learning which has showed impressive benefits and performance over traditional sequential learning approaches. In general, machine learning models require a lot of data for every new scenario which is not always possible and if so, is very expensive. Transfer learning, which focuses on transferring knowledge across trained machine learning models, is a promising machine learning methodology for solving the above problem. In this thesis, we propose an end-to-end neural network architecture on the NM500 neuromorphic chip using an incremental hierarchical learning approach. We first design a hierarchical representation of a taxonomy, develop a batch of pre-classifiers and use their output to construct a custom feature vector that is the input to the front-end network which learns the taxonomy. In other words, the taxonomy is embedded in the clustering method and not trained by a backpropagation algorithm. The custom feature vector has been structured to accurately incorporate the taxonomy based on the Manhattan distance norm. The structure has been proven mathematically and validated using experiments. A Radial Basis Function (RBF) is used for learning and a combination of RBF and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification. The applicability of the proposed framework has been demonstrated on a road sign classification problem which is represented as a taxonomy. The ability of the framework to incrementally learn new categories and update the taxonomy online has also been shown. Lastly, we show a case of transfer learning where the entire back- end networks is used as a starting point to learn new features without significantly forgetting prior knowledge. This transfer learning framework showed comparable performance to the standard learning method in terms of accuracy while using significantly less labelled data. This work paves a way forward for researchers to develop transfer learning frameworks and more importantly explore neuromorphic hardware for machine learning tasks.","Neuromorphic computing; transfer learning; incremental hierarchical learning; road sign classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The research suggests that, while society is becoming increasingly mobile, refugees and other ‘undesired movers’ are excluded from the otherwise unrestricted possibilities to move that have been established across national borders. Following the integration of spatial and social mobility as described by Vincent Kaufmann, it is suggested that enhancing the potentiality to be mobile for all can improve equal access to opportunities for people in border space. The thesis proposes an urban design strategy for the area along the Como (IT) – Chiasso (CH) border. The design moves away from nation-oriented planning, in which borders are seen as in-between spaces that should be crossed as efficiently as possible, towards a cosmopolitan perspective on planning and design as described by Ulrich Beck. The nation state is put forward as a malleable social construct that urban planners and designers should challenge, by planning and designing for various, hybrid territories that overlap, rather than for a singular national territory. The proposal puts forward border space as an integrative space that can accommodate inclusive mobility (i.e. to establish equitable access to opportunities by securing people’s potentiality to be mobile). Migration is framed as a permanent temporality and design measures are adapted to this notion. Three main design ambitions are experimented with through research by design: the development of affordable housing, diverse public spaces and slow traffic networks. Each of these interventions are expected to contribute to the liveability of border areas as well as access to social and economic opportunities, both for people who currently benefit from border crossing, as well as for those who are stuck in isolated places. To further highlight certain themes, two zoom-in projects explore the themes of designing an adaptive plan, flexible to various futures, and the theme of refugee integration. The first theme is researched through the development of a landscape in place of a current customs area. To research the second theme, a small scale refugee community is integrated into the urban border space envisioned. The ‘camp’ is designed according to the principles of incremental urbanism, meaning that the inhabitable spaces are designed to grow in quality over time and to form the foundation of what will later be part of the interwoven urban fabric.","borders; migration; incremental housing; landscape park; affordable housing; diversity; refugee camp","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","45.832006842024235, 9.034823855099457"

In 2020, the UK left the EU and a transition period began in which the terms of its future will be set, and with an increasingly independent Scotland to the north, it faces further estrangement into a marginal borderland. Meanwhile, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne attempts to initiate the reurbanisation of its post-industrial riverfront. In an effort to draw new industry and commerce, landmark architecture and an entertainment-led rebranding impose a generic identity upon the riverside, enabling further privatisation and an inactive public realm, insensitive to the climate and culture of the region. The vacant riverfront at Spiller’s Wharf is at the frontline of Newcastle's development, presenting an opportunity to reconcile a conflict of interests in the region. It marks a point of juxtaposition between the brash Quayside, and Byker: Newcastle’s poorest Ward. Following continual neglect from government investment and policy, today it remains relatively isolated in terms of its geography and infrastructure, and identity. These problems disproportionately affect people from already deprived areas. With public resources slashed by austerity, there are few prospects for social mobility amongst young people, driving an increasing inequality gap. This context provides the backdrop for the project; a place dedicated to education and new industry. A regional institution designed to accomodate intimately local communities and interests, containing A craft school, experimental materials lab and a institute for sustainable regional development. The designation of such a landmark institutional building at Spiller’s Wharf makes a clear statement about the ambition to build a more sustainable future for Newcastle and the North East. Furthermore, the proposal draws upon Patrick Geddes’ concept of ‘bioregionalism’ to define and build region-urban networks for timber construction. Research into the potential of timber from the local Kielder Forest, and subsequent study trips set the link between territory, resources and industry as a key parameter for the project.","Industry; Timber; Craft; England; Brexit; education; Resistance","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvafeusVjzw 200901_Abstract_Craft in the North East of England","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","54.967027, -1.580888"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","With a shortage of approximately 315,000 homes, 4% of the existing stock, the Netherlands continues to face a significant and growing shortage of housing. This shortage is a result of various factors that either directly or indirectly have effect on the housing market. Of which some of the key factors are demographic developments such as population growth and changing household compositions; economic developments such as rising house prices, construction costs and income developments (affordability); political developments in regard to rising sustainability goals and changing regulations. These factors have a direct effect on all segments of the housing market, causing a shortage within all and predominantly for affordable of mid-priced rental homes with an estimated demand for 60,000 – 200,000 such homes over the next ten years. This demand or pressure on the mid-segment rental sector is a direct result of the inaccessibility to owner-occupied and social housing sector. As the house prices increase and the waitlist for social homes get longer the mid-segment housing market faces high demand and in turn pressurising both market parties and municipalities. Although there are developments within this segment and both parties are striving to ease the pressure on the market the supply of such homes is slow. Hence this research aims to increase the supply of mid-segment rental homes and contribute towards reducing the housing shortage in the Netherlands by hypothesising that improving the existing development process and policies within the mid-segment rental housing market would in turn improve the supply. Which brings us to the goal of the research to recommend measures/changes, that municipalities and market parties, could possibly make to improve the supply off mid-segment rental homes in the Netherlands. Given the regional characteristics of the housing market, this research adopts a case study method to analyse the development process and policies within different market types. Implying that the cases are market types and the phenomenon being explored, the development process of mid-segment homes. Learning from professionals in practice with the assistance of semi-structured interviews to first understand the existing process and policies, the problems encountered by them in the past and then collating recommendations from these actors to as how the process could be improved. Synthesising the information collected from the field research with theoretical findings to arrive at conclusions and in turn trying to answer the main research question: How can the development process of mid-segment rental housing, in the Netherlands, be improved to meet the rising demand in this segment of the housing market? On completing the research, through the interviews conducted it was found that the various actors along the process face challenges predominantly in the planning phase and challenges that arise from each other hence creating a rather uncertain environment to act in. Thus, reluctance in taking initiative and the shortage of mid-segment homes, although through this research an attempt was made to answer the main question by concluding that in order to improve the delivery of mid-segment homes it would essential to establish a well determined process, seek alternative land development approaches, allowing flexibility during negotiations and regulations, improving actor relationships, and developing policies that would not only regulate this segment but also stimulate market actors to develop mid-segment homes. Following these conclusions and aligning to the goal recommendations were made to the actors involved at an organisational and project level. Of the made recommendations the ones that stand out would be of municipalities supporting one another, involved actors form consortiums to share development risks, development of policies at a national level and finally establishing a trustful, transparent, certain, and supportive environment for each other.","Mid-segment rental; real estate development process; housing market; Development feasibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

(mentor); Mostert, E. (graduation committee); Vardon, P.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) is a geothermal technique that is an important component in the transition towards renewable energy in the heating and cooling industry, which accounts for half of the world's energy consumption. However, the technology has not yet been implemented in many countries. The main reason is that extensive preparation and site-specific analysis are required for the implementation of ATES systems and many stakeholders need to be involved. These stakeholders are typically unfamiliar with the technology and unaware of the potential applicability. To stimulate stakeholders and the decision-making process within the ATES sector, several studies emphasise the necessity of examining the potential of ATES technology on a local level. Such potential studies support ATES decision-makers as they evaluate the technology, potential scale and its commercial viability.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is therefore to develop a methodology to determine the technical and commercial potential of ATES while incorporating local characteristics. Until now, ATES feasibility studies have mainly been focused on large-scale ATES suitability. For generating more representative results, however, this new methodology also incorporates local geohydrological conditions and the interests of and restrictions imposed by its local ATES stakeholders. The methodology can be applied globally to every region that has available aquifers and moderate climate conditions. The developed methodology in this study is applied to the region of New York State (NYS). High expected energy savings and promising geothermal trends are among the main reasons for this geographic selection. Moreover, no commercial ATES project is yet in operation in the US, a country of which the potential energy savings are expected to be highest in the world. A successful introduction of the technology in NYS could therefore function as a valuable use-case for many other states in the US and also for other countries.<br/><br/>Firstly, the stakeholders in NYS are identified and analysed in this study. They are assessed based on their level of influence, attitude and their ability to solve current barriers that are preventing ATES from being adopted. This analysis indicated that geothermal architects are the most influential stakeholders and are therefore essential to engage for the successful implementation of ATES in NYS.<br/><br/>Secondly, the technical and commercial ATES potential is examined by analysing local geohydrological conditions, building characteristics and the identified requirements from geothermal architects. It is concluded that over 99\% of all buildings in Nassau County (around 400,000) could technically receive the required amount of heat and cold if an ATES system was installed for those buildings. Moreover, it is found that for buildings with ATES systems, heating is twice as efficient as conventional methods in Nassau County and cooling is even 10-30 times more efficient, depending on ATES design parameters. Furthermore, it is concluded that ATES is already a commercially attractive solution for 385 separate buildings in Nassau County, accounting for an estimated 10\% of the total heating and cooling demand of buildings in the county. This number is expected to increase significantly when multiple buildings are connected to a single ATES system.<br/><br/>This research shows that ATES is a technically and commercially viable geothermal solution for buildings in NYS. Therefore, it is critical that ATES is included in the existing evaluation tools developed and currently used by the city and state authorities of New York. The methodology developed in this study is characterised by the inclusion of local characteristics such as the interests and requirements of a region's key stakeholders and local geohydrological conditions, which are found to be essential to generate realistic and accurate insights into the technical and commercial potential of ATES. The model that has been developed is scalable and can be applied to other regions and the accuracy of the model can be increased further by also incorporating groundwater models in the analysis. All in all, the methodology developed in this study offers valuable support for local decision-makers and is an effective resource to increase the adoption of ATES technology worldwide.<br","Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES); Geothermal; New York; Renewable energy; Thermal energy system; buildings; Commercial; Technical feasibility; Potential; Stakeholder analysis; Nassau County; Heating transition; Adoption of Innovation; Renewable energy transition; ATES; WKO; Cooling; Groundwater; Groundwater wells; Geohydrology; Barriers to innovation adoption; GIS; Geospatial analysis; Evaluation method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Currently available methods to prove sustainability in architecture play into this demand.

How is it, that proving sustainability is so difficult, that even these great corporations cannot deliver a method to unequivocally prove sustainability? This questions is researched in this study. Professionals in the world of (Dutch) sustainable architecture are interviewed. Analysis of these interviews showed that the problem of proving sustainability is such an immensely complex and extensive one, that it can – and should – be approached as a Wicked Problem. Theory on Wicked Problems and results from the interviews are combined to explain the difficulties one faces when attempting to prove sustainability in architecture. Literature on strategies to approach Wicked Problems is discussed, to give an understanding on how problems of this size can be tackled. This gives a better understanding of why proving sustainability cannot be done with one general method, but rather needs a multitude of methods or approaches as every project is unique and therefore actually needs a tailor-made method of proof. Several approaches on how to think about proving sustainability are mentioned that might pique the interest of the architect.","proving sustainability; measuring methods; wicked problem; architecture","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.086570, 5.077590"

The gap is caused by the different educational background, perspective, approach and language used in the respective fields. It causes multidisciplinary projects like the redevelopment of Schieoevers Noord in Delft to be unnecessarily difficult or inefficient. </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">This thesis studied the effect of the gap in discourse on the redevelopment plans of Schieoevers Noord, with the aim of bridging the gap and making the plans more water inclusive. To achieve that, the area and plans were thoroughly analysed and research was done into the principles behind healthy surface water systems in the Netherlands and climate adaptation measures. Using the data from these analysis five evaluation criteria were set up. </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Next using the principles of water management and the climate analysis of Schieoevers Noord, four strategies for an improved water system in the area were made. The evaluation criteria helped define the strengths and weaknesses of these strategies. This made it possible to take the strong points and combine them into a final proposal for the water system in Schieoevers Noord. The proposal was also tested using the evaluation criteria and the results showed that it held up really well in all categories.    </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">The lessons learned from going through this process for Schieoevers Noord, are that bridging the gap between urban designers and civil engineers within urban water management is achievable. But it requires effort from both parties to go back and forth between the two fields, while using existing tools to ease communication. A very useful tool for this would be the Climate Resilient Cities Toolbox. With some further research into quantifying design goals this toolbox can be improved even more, and therefore become a great tool for bridging the gap between the two fields. </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Another important lesson learned from this research is the importance of thinking about the water system in a very early stage of the planning process. Surface water systems are often complex and adding to them will take up a large amount of space. However, a healthy surface water system is more efficient than only using climate adaptation measure, when combatting the negative externalities of climate change. Because the effects of climate change are rapidly increasing, it is imperative that developers, municipalities and other stakeholders prioritise healthy water systems in their development plans.","water inclusivity; urban water management; climate resilient city; climate adaptation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.99783, 4.36433"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Society is aging at a rapid phase and the increasing technological possibilities make it possible that a solution or treatment method is found for many life-threatening situations.<br/>As a result, the costs for healthcare have been increasing and because of this the government has decided to close a large number of care homes and thereby encourage society to take more care of each other.<br/>The trend is therefore that a large proportion of the elderly want to continue living in their current environment, where they receive the care and support they need.<br/>However in practice this is more problematic, because young adults often experience difficulties to provide care for their parents in addition to a busy full-time job. They are largely dependent on nursing at home by external healthcare authorities. In the Netherlands there is a shortage of informal care, which means that we as a society have to look at new combinations and ways of living.<br/>It is therefore good to think about possible alternatives and the position that urban planning, architecture and housing in general may have in this. Other ways of student living might offer a good alternaltive. For example, a student can live in a complex mixed with elderly people, in which the student can provide in a social task to relieve the pressure on the informal and formal care system.<br/>My design will respond to these political developments, thus meeting a need that arises from society and changing governmental policies. Furthermore the complex will become a building for an ever-increasing group of older people who want to continue living independently on the one hand, but on the other hand want to have the facilities that are important to them within walking distance and, if necessary, fall back on a social network that offers guidance and social support. Lastly, the role of collectivity played an important aspect in the design of my building. The definition of collectivity within the city reflects on building blocks and their relation with public and collective spaces. In what way should collective spaces within buildings represent the city as a whole? This could mean that public functions within the plinth could lead to more livelyhood within the building as well as the whole neighborhood or even the city. Functions of collective spaces within the city should represent the direct needs of the people who are using them, but at the same time not excluding anyone. The inclusive city is also part of a topic that we addressed from Richard Sennett’s book: Building and Dwelling. In this book he mentions the five open forms of the city. One of these five forms is “seed planning”, which could play a role in explaining how buildings are part of a larger ambition of Rotterdam in becoming a city of Making. Hereby ‘making districts’ or spots for making activities could have different outcomes on different places within the city, taking into account the specific needs of the direct surrounding community.<br","Open City; Elderly care; informal care; collectivity; Elderly housing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.908334, 4.430400"

The current agricultural landscape offers limited habitats for animals and insects and lacks resilience to cope with the effects of climate change. A strong departure from the current system is required by adopting nature-inclusive agriculture which utilizes and protects biodiversity in and around the farm. At the same time, there is a structural shortage in housing stock. The problem is that the increased demand for housing and the need for nature-inclusive agriculture are competing issues, where one has to make way for the other. But what if the development for new homes could be integrated with the transition towards nature inclusive agriculture? There are clear indications that demand is changing towards more spacious homes in natural environments. To build homes with the future agricultural landscape, they must be designed differently: in a nature inclusive way that facilitates biodiversity in and around the farm without reducing the current amount of food production. In addition, the integration of homes could enable the transition towards nature-inclusive agriculture, either by establishing a collective farm or by involving multiple partners. To conclude, a case study project is proposed in the Noordoostpolder, an area that is uniquely suited as a test ground for exploring the future of countryside living because it offers a relative central location and is highly adaptable and scalable. <br","Architectcture; Landscape architecture; agriculture; countryside; residential architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","","52.744374, 5.652585"

Adapting the built-environment to cope with soil sealing, climate change, the densification of cities with the ‘compact city’ concept and other urban demands, constantly pressure the quality of urban environment. Being part of the Dutch building culture for centuries, urban domestic gardens have played a significant (spatial) role in Dutch cities, taking up a significant part of the urban environment, and providing a private outdoor space for residents. The ongoing urban processes can or will affect the role urban domestic gardens play and how they are being used or implemented into the urban environment. For this research, the neighbourhood the Tarwewijk in Rotterdam has been used to investigate and explore how urban domestic gardens can contribute to a more liveable urban environment through a sustainable urban regeneration, in response to concrete urban demands. The research shows that rethinking the implementation of urban domestic gardens leads to an increase of the liveability in the Tarwewijk, by using specific, transferable values to improve the quality of the public spaces and buildings. Transferring the values related to eating, learning, working, playing and meeting from the social environment, and greening, cooling and infiltrating from the physical environment into public spaces increase the accessibility to values of gardens, without the need to provide urban domestic gardens to every single household, taking up valuable space in existing cities. It also shows that the regeneration of urban domestic gardens to semi-private shared gardens serve as a mechanism for the densification and diversification of the built environment, improving urban structures and physical forms, with related social processes and liveability.","urban domestic gardens; urban fabric; urban regeneration; public space design; private gardens","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Organisations actively engage sustainability in strategic missions and objectives. However, how these visions translate proactively to the tactical and operational levels of decision-making is still considered an exploratory area for the extant theoretical body of knowledge. Therefore, this research aims to support managers in tactical and operational decision-making for sustainability by means of a diagnostic research in the context of a long-term Strategic Partnership between client and contractor at Schiphol Airport. Their collaborative agreements based on Best Value aims for synergy by close cooperation between the partners and valuing professional expertise. To become highly committed to sustainability, organizations need to take responsibility over decisions regarding their organisational processes, in terms of dedication, motivation, and long-term investments to achieve effective solutions. Interventions require the direction of efforts into an organization-wide approach, meaning that both tactical and operational level management are internally aligned and stimulated to involve sustainability in their considerations. Also, a future directed mind-set and long-term investment approach are required to overcome technical and respectively cost related barriers. Fragmented decision-making can be overcome by engagement of stakeholders in sustainability ambitions. Moreover, proactivity in strategic partnering collaborations also requires extending responsibility towards supporting the partner’s responsibilities in order to achieve the best outcome for all parties involved. Therefore, it is key for both parties to allow each other to showcase their expertise within the set boundaries and ambitions of the Best Value principles. Currently, the client initiates new projects in which utility infrastructure projects play a role, whereas the contracting organization becomes involved after scope, budget, and planning are mainly determined. A mutually structured approach of formal meetings in the initiation process needs to be enhanced to collectively explore opportunities and define ambitions. Based on the gathered elements on proactive implementation of sustainability in decision-making levels, a conceptual framework is developed to test the case studies by analyzing sustainable outcomes in terms of their level of effectiveness. The analysis framework introduced by this study connects the different levels of proactivity with a chronological order of project phases, ranging on tactical and operational decision-making levels. This developed framework provides a practical solution for the collaborative setting between client and contractor, as it stimulates the development of mutual ambitions, substantive opportunities and directions for sustainable outcomes.","Sustainability; Utility infrastructure; Proactive; proactive management; Client-contractor collaboration; Best Value Procurement; Strategic partnership","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-28","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

To respond to the projected demand, around 80,000 houses should be built every year towards 2030. At the same time, the Dutch government has had ambitions and plans towards a circular economy by 2050. Their plans were released in 2016, after which concise reports were made on how to transition certain sectors of the economy towards circularity. These reports are called ‘Transition Agendas’, of which five have been written: Biomass &amp; food, Plastics, Manufacturing industry, Built environment and Consumer goods. This project attempts to merge the housing challenge with the circular ambitions of the Dutch government for the Built Environment, with input from all five Transition Agendas to start.  The Built Environment is one of the largest consumers of resources and energy of any industry. As it stands, this industry relies heavily on primary materials, as conventional materials and ways of construction and demolition are not tailored to reuse or recycling of resources. The other sectors covered by the Transition Agendas also highlight a general reliance on primary materials and a lack of application of reused- or recycled materials by product manufacturers. This may be because the product is not designed to facilitate these processes or since some manufacturers are reluctant to use non-primary resources due to pricing or quality concerns. Pollution and contamination of used products is also a common issue for recycling. Finally, interests and ambitions may vary between parties when it comes to circularity.  This project has three main goals. The first is to connect ambitions and material streams from different resource sectors, the second is to increase the circularity of conventional housing elements and the third is to apply resources from linear material streams in a circular way. The focus of the goals is on the housing envelope. This leads to the main research question: How can the circularity of conventional Dutch housing envelope elements be increased, through the application of residual resources from linear material streams?   First, it is researched how circularity can be defined and measured towards the project goals. Then, contemporary Dutch houses are analysed to distinguish all common envelope elements and their conventional materials. It is then speculated what circular improvements can be made on these elements, either by using the original material in a different way or by using alternative (linear) materials. From these ideas, a handful of promising examples is picked as the basis for creating three product case studies, to compare to conventional products. Based on the entire research process, an advisory framework is created, intended for use by those seeking to apply residual materials into new building elements or to simply develop building elements based on circular principles.  ","circularity; housing; building envelope; residual materials; linear material streams","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

The Dutch DSOs could expand the network capacity, but it is not sure if the network can be expanded fast enough. Network expansion will result in higher total consumer costs and if the network expansion rate is too low, the reliability of the distribution network would be highly affected. Currently, the distribution network tariff in the Netherlands for residential consumers is only based on the connection type. Changing the network tariff structure to stimulate demand response is an option to deal with these challenges. The effects of different network tariff structures in the Netherlands are still unknown. This paper investigates the effects of two configurations of a capacity bandwidth tariff and a personal peak charge on the maximum network peak and the expected consumer charge. This is done by using the model of Hennig et al. (2020) that simulates the allocation of flexible demand of consumers under different network tariff structures. To be able to compare the different network tariff structures, the five key regulatory principles are used. Since these regulatory principles are often ill-defined and unclear, we first propose a set of normative criteria which can be used to quantify if a tariff structure adheres to these principles. The results show that all examined network tariff structures significantly reduce the overall network peak. Furthermore, the examined tariff structures are more efficient and cost-reflective than the current fixed tariff. A capacity bandwidth tariff with bandwidths of 2, 4, 8 and 17 kW seems the best option for a future-proof network tariff structure in the Netherlands.","Distribution network tariff design; Electricity distribution tariffs; Optimisation modelling; Demand response; Flexible demand scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Especially air travel is a huge contributor to climate change, with its large amounts of polluting carbon emissions. Due to increasing concerns regarding the environmental impact of air travel, international train travel may become an increasingly popular mode of transport for European journeys in the near future. However, current European train journeys are not an integrated and supported experience from start to finish. Finding suitable tickets can be complicated due to the variety of booking platforms and irregularity of ticket prices. Moreover, train journeys themselves can be stressful because of delays in transfers and the inflexibility of departure times. As a result, many people are withheld from actually taking the train and prefer to travel by plane or car. In order to stimulate more people to choose the train as their mode of travel, this project created a design vision towards seamless European train journeys. In this future vision travellers are able to travel anywhere they want, whenever they want to. It allows you to just hop on any international train, without having to book a ticket in advance. With your personal travel account and location being updated behind the scenes, it is possible to travel across borders and pay as you go. Standard journey fares are introduced, so travellers will not face any unpleasant surprises afterwards. This project puts forward a strategic roadmap presenting the main steps, actions and developments that are needed to realise the future vision. Seamless European train journeys should take shape by incremental scale increases over time, starting with current pilots that make it possible to seamlessly travel across borders in the Netherlands. Governments, railway companies and mobility providers should collaborate to break down borders and create an integrated cross-border travel experience. The European Commission should take up a guiding role to foster this implementation and collaboration, by setting regulations on data transparency and rolling out the essential network. After implementing the future vision, it is expected that more European travellers prefer to travel by train instead of plane or car. In the longer term, the train becomes the default option for European travel and the future vision and roadmap developed in this project can positively contribute to the transition towards more sustainable transportation.","Train services; User experience; Future vision; Strategic Roadmap","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-29","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

To spread out the power yield over more frequencies a multi-modal harvester can be used which can resonate at multiple frequencies. A vibration with more than one sine wave can be manifested in a number of ways. The two frequencies can be present simultaneously, or they can alternate each other. How the energy harvesters react to these different vibration inputs is researched in this paper. Two fundamentally different multi-modal energy harvesters are used here. One which can be described by a coupled system of equations and one uncoupled. Two prototypes of an uncoupled and one coupled device are made and tested on an electromagnetic shaker. The vibration signals are sent to the shaker and the power output of the energy harvesters is measured using piezoelectric transducers mounted to the mechanisms. The results show that a phaseshift in the sine wave input signal generally results in a increase in power, where a decrease was assumed beforehand. When switching the input vibration from the first to the second eigenfrequency the power output does drop significantly, but the coupled mechanism has a substantially higher power output than the uncoupled device. And when the mechanisms are excited by a vibration with two eigenfrequencies at the same time no significant difference between the two can be observed, nor does the power output drop significantly. While the comparison between these two mechanisms is probably accurate, the quantitative conclusions must be taken with a grain of salt as it was noticed in a later stage of the research that the vibration signals were not consistent over the entire time period. At this point it is unclear if an overall better mechanism can be picked between the coupled and uncoupled one. However, it is shown that both have their distinct advantages where they outperform their counterpart, which can be used for designing a better energy harvester in future applications","Energy Harvesting; Piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH); Transient; Vibration Energy Harvesting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

The need for sustainable urban water management is recognized and understood on a broad scale. In order to realise a transition multiple stakeholders are involved, leading to fragmented knowledge. Communication and knowledge boundaries hamper joint action. Using Q methodology, distinguishing visions and perspectives of nineteen relevant stakeholders towards circular water management are identified, analysed and validated in a focus group. To realise change, a consortium should be established to exchange knowledge. Policy makers seem to be the most equipped to initiate a transition. The scientific contribution of this study is the integration of boundary spanning theory, the Pestel framework and Q methodology. The societal contribution focuses on promising future pathways towards long term circular water availability for the green urban infrastructure functions sport and recreation.","Urban water management; Circular water availability; Governance transitions; Boundary spanning; Pestel framework; Q methodology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Neuroscientists have recorded experiments with high-speed cameras in which untrimmed, head-restrained mice are provided with air stimuli. These videos required the development of algorithms to reliably track whisker movement. Recently, a Whisker Tracking System, WhiskEras, emerged, which is able to detect and track whiskers over the course of such videos in a more accurate way than pre-existing methods. WhiskEras is slow, processing less than 1 frame per second. Additionally, it involves a great number of parameters which need tuning for different experimental setups and recording settings which were used for this experiment. This thesis addresses these two problems. First, the algorithm was examined and its shortcomings were exposed. A more accurate whisker point detection algorithm was suggested and implemented, among a range of alternative solutions which were studied. Furthermore, its Stitching stage was modified to replace a range of hard-to-tune parameters with more robust ones. Finally, the improved WhiskEras was accelerated by porting the MATLAB code to C++ and using advanced parallelization techniques with CUDA and OpenMP to achieve a speedup of 74.96. Overall, the improvements yielded better tracking results in our benchmarks, while the parameters were much easier to tune and remained constant under different video setups of whisking experiments.","whisker tracking; acceleration; GPU; Algorithm Selection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

Unfortunately, these energy sources have their negative side-effects: local air pollution and global CO2-emission. The latter has never been this high, resulting in an extra, more negative, important role for fossil fuels: in global warming. Not to mention that these fossil sources of energy are depletable resources; once we’ll be running out of them. The project ‘Repurposing the Port’ combines this issue with the challenge of port-cities to house the expected growth in number of citizens, reach their climate goals ánd bring back the former intimate connection of the city and the port. In this project the Petroleumhaven in Amsterdam, symbolically being the first port outside the city and the first fossil fuel-specialized port, is transformed to a future-proof, mixed-use neighborhood. In this transformation both the existing structure of the area, and the available building structures (and materials) are reused to make it a fully circular redevelopment. The flexible wooden building system provides for a community-driven realization and on top of that for a carbon-negative footprint of the project. To do so, the aboveground steel storage tanks (AST's) in the area are analyzed in the research paper, and used as the main starting point for the design project.","reuse; aboveground steel storage tanks; oil; port area; redevelopment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.412465, 4.856936"

According to the European Commission1 every year over 250 000 public authorities in the EU spend around 14% of GDP (around €2 trillion per year) on the purchase of services, works and supplies. Often perceived as a purely bureaucratic process, it is in fact one of the key procedures to shape the quality of the public spending. Public spending in question addresses wide range of the problems including metropolitan challenges of the modern world. As the local and national governments approach key issues such as climate change, public health, or transition towards zero-emission economy, they need to do it accordingly with the public procurement regulations. There are always exceptions possible but overall and on bigger scale it is not possible to avoid them. Having said that, public procurement with all its own challenges is one of the key elements of public policy creation and implementation. From the author's own working experience, challenges of public procurement include a wide range of issues from personal relations, procedural and financial requirements to sourcing knowledge and information necessary for describing the procured services, works or supplies.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The aim of this research is to find the influence of rapid drawdown on dike stability with the Delta21 project as case study. The Delta21 project is a proposed plan for a waterdefence system in front of the Haringvliet, The Netherlands. Its main element is a water retaining lake with an extensive pumping and turbine system. Whenever other storm surge barriers close, water from inland rivers can be pumped to the sea. The water retaining lake can act as an energy storage system as well by using the turbines to generate electricity at moments of high energy prices. The pumping system has the capacity to reduce the water level with 17.5m in 12hours. The dike surrounding the lake has a gradual slope as the height/width ratio below the water line is 1/20. It consists fully of a homogeneous and permeable fine sand. The estimation of material properties were based on limited CPT data, samples from the adjacent Maasvlakte II and empirical relationships. The rapid decrease of the water level in the lake causes rapid draw down conditions in the dike. Hereby the external hydrostatic pressure is reduced due to unloading effect of removing water, while a delay in the dissipation of pore pressures inside the dike is produced. This causes stress relaxation and slope instability. The research was performed using a numerical model verified with physical modeling in the form of centrifuge tests. For the numerical model the finite element model PLAXIS2D was used. A fully coupled flow deformation analysis was chosen, which can solve the full interaction between deformation, consolidation and groundwater flow simultanously in the same phase. It considers a reduced permeability and degree of saturation in the unsaturated zone. The Hardening Soil small strainmodel was selected as constitutive model due to the potential of capturing hysteresis in the stress-strain regime. Hysteresis could occur as a result of multiple cycles of water level fluctuations. To gain better understanding of the capabilities and weaknesses of the numerical model, it was verified with several physical tests from literature. The first test is a centrifuge test with failure due to increasing hydrostatic pressures within the dike. The moment of occurrence and shape of the failure contour were compared with the numerical model. The second test was a centrifuge test where a dike experiences rapid draw down conditions with the purpose to validate the pore pressure and saturation level. Thirdly, a full scale test of a dike with a changing water level was added, because full scale tests offer the closest resemblance to situations in the field. The field test was modeled to double check pore pressures and saturation. The research aimed to further investigate the development of a failure during rapid draw down, a centrifuge test was performed at 100g. Rapid draw down conditions were simulated on a sand dike with slope 1:1.6 to generate failure. By tracking grains with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), correctness of estimating displacement by the numerical model was verified. The addition of pore pressure sensors could give further information on pore pressure development. The numerical model proved to accurately predict positive pore pressures and the moment at which macroscopic failures occur due to drawdown. Negative pore pressures, saturation and development of the failure, in terms of size and deformation could not be accurately approximated. With understanding of the capabilities and weaknesses of the numerical model, the dike of the Delta21 project was modeled. The original design proved to be stable with a FoS of 6.20. Increasing slope angles were modeled resulting in a decreasing FoS. The influence of hysteresis was found to be very small after modelling multiple cycles of changing water level. The positive effect on stability the addition of a high permeable filter layer was modeled. Finally the risk of erosion due to outflow was analytically calculated and proved to be closely related to the numerical results.","rapid draw down; dike stability; DELTA21; Physical moddeling; PlaxFlow; PLAXIS2D; Geotechnical centrifuge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","DELTA21",""

(mentor); Luiken, R.J.N.J (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","To increase the benefit of wind energy, the next generation wind turbines are becoming larger and are moving into deeper waters. This significantly increases the size and weight of the corresponding monopile support structures. In current practice, the majority of monopiles are installed using jack-ups or floating vessels using so-called monopile gripper frames. Both vessels have their advantages and disadvantages. Jack-ups are limited by weather conditions and lifting capacity depending on the jack-up legs. For floating vessels, it is difficult to achieve stability and verticality of the monopile during installation, because the gripper frame moves with the vessel. This reduces the operating weather condition for installation of monopiles using a floating vessel. To operate in larger weather windows and to be able to lift larger loads, Van Oord is investigating the use of a monopile gripper on the seabed, so that the gripper frame is no longer subject to the motions of the vessel. To install a monopile support structure using a seabed gripper, the monopile gripper frame is installed first. The monopile is then slewed into the gripper frame, which is able to hold the monopile in position and vertical while hammering it. After the installation of the monopile, the seabed gripper structure is removed and transported to the location where the next monopile is to be installed. This thesis covers the optimized design of such a re-usable seabed monopile gripper. First, the different options for the gripper structure and its foundation currently available in practice are identified from a literature study. Suitable concepts for the gripper structure are generated based on the requirements, of which the two optimal concepts are selected based on a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA). A four-legged Jacket and a Tripod are chosen as the best concepts for the gripper structure using either Helical piles or Suction buckets for its foundation. A preliminary design of both the gripper structure and the foundation is done to identify the initial member sizing and reactions of the piles at the seabed. A FEM model of the gripper structure including a soil model is created in ANSYS and analysed for both members and joints in ULS conditions. Due to the required opening on one side of the gripper structure (to slew in the monopile), the stresses at the joints of the gripper frame are higher than anticipated and strengthened accordingly. Based on the soil-structure interaction, the four-legged jacket structure is selected as the best concept, because its piles are further apart than for the tripod structure, thereby leading to minimal interaction between the piles of the gripper structure and the installed monopile. Still, both helical piles or suction bucket can be used as the foundation for jacket. A fatigue analysis shows that the gripper frame is subjected to cyclic loads that lead to high bending stresses at the joints leading to possible failure. Based on this, certain modifications have been made to the gripper structure to properly distribute the stresses. A case study has been performed comparing the monopile installation by a floating vessel with and without seabed gripper. This case study shows that the time taken and cost associated with monopile installation using the jacket gripper structure is most economical using suction buckets. However, modification of the installation using helical piles may lead to time- and cost-reduction compared to using suction buckets. However, installation without using a seabed gripper is more economical compared to with using a seabed gripper. From this thesis, it is thus concluded that a four-legged jacket structure with either helical piles or suction buckets is an optimal seabed gripper structure. However, it is not an economical solution to use seabed gripper for monopile installation for Van Oord.","Monopile Installation; Seabed gripper","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-27","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The two types of active hand prostheses available are the myo-electric prosthesis and body-powered prosthesis. Even though both allow a user to grasp objects, the downsides are major. The high actuation force required for the operation of body-powered prostheses and the high costs and low feedback of the myo-electric prostheses lead to high abandon rates. A hybrid solution could combine the best of both worlds: high output force and transparent feedback. In this study we introduce a body-powered prosthetic hand with force assist, that allows for user operation without muscle fatigue, while still providing the user with transparent feedback.   Design requirements are set up following parameters from literature. For this study the outer shell and closing mechanism of the 100-Dollar Hand have been used and adapted to purpose. An extensive mechanical analyses, a new conceptual design and the addition of a micro controller led to the new closing mechanism of the Hybrid Hand. The proposed prototype has been tested on a test bench and results have been compared to the conventional body-powered 100-Dollar Hand. The Hybrid Hand decreases the actuation forces needed for a pinch force of 15 N with 33% in comparison to the 100-Dollar Hand. Moreover, the system increases the output pinch force at 80 N actuation force with almost 80%. With a weight of 320 gram and costs of under 200 dollar, the hand can amplify the pinch force with a maximum of 29 N. However, due to the low efficiency of the worm gear, the opening time of the hand (3.5 s) has to be improved. This paper presents the first 3D printed hand prosthesis with force assist that allows for user operation without muscle fatigue. With a low weight, low cost, high pinch force the prosthesis is accessible to and could aid people with an upper limb deficiency all over the world. Future research should further investigate the durability of the system and should introduce ways to improve and optimize the efficiency of the transmission of the system.","Upper limb prosthetics; Hybrid System; Force Amplification; 3D Printed","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-28","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The population that can afford air travel is growing and this demand is likely to double within the next 20 years. This increasing demand comes at a hefty price: the emissions of greenhouse gases cause climate change and local air pollution. One of the main research topics at the moment to try to stagnate these consequences of air travel is the electrification of aircraft. Although all-electric aircraft might sound like a good idea for smaller aircraft, the current electric component technology level is still insufficient to propel larger aircraft. Currently more researchers are shifting their focus towards hybrid-electric propulsion systems. The objective of this study was to add to the scientific knowledge about the performance of hybrid-electric aircraft by assessing changes in the mission of a hybrid-electric A320neo. For this purpose the aircraft performance tool MASS (Mission, Aircraft and Systems Simulation) has been used, which has been developed at NLR (Royal Netherlands Aerospace Centre). This tool assesses parallel hybrid-electric aircraft for a given mission. This mission model had to be redesigned to be more efficient at automating the mission variation process. The main mission variables that this study focuses on are: cruise altitude, Take-off and climb velocities, range and hybridization factor The study shows that designing a new mission for hybrid-electric aircraft does have an impact on the overall fuel consumption and emissions. However, the gains are very small for EIS2030 battery technology forecasts with 3.10% fuel reduction compared to the reference aircraft. Mission assessment is therefore a tool that has the potential to increase the performance of hybrid-electric aircraft, but it needs to work alongside other measures, such as hydrogen technology in the future.","Hybrid; hybrid-electric; Aircraft; Mission Analysis; mission; performance; flight; hybridization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

We investigate current solutions to this problem, and propose criteria to which an all-encompassing solution to this problem must adhere. After that, we present a design pattern for the Statix meta-DSL for static semantics specification that allows to model loosely coupled, composable type system specifications. This pattern entails that the semantic concepts of a particular domain are encoded in an interface specification library, which is integrated in the type system of concrete languages. This allows controlled but automated composition of type systems. We show that, under some well-formedness criteria, the system provides correct results. A runtime, executing composed specifications, is implemented using PIE pipelines for partial incrementality, and integrated in the command-line interface and Eclipse IDE platforms, using the Spoofax 3 Framework. This allows using multi-language analysis in concrete projects. The design pattern, and the accompanying runtime are validated using two case studies. These case studies show that the approach is effective, even in a case where there is an impedance mismatch in the data models of the involved languages.","Statix; Multi-language; Type checking; Name binding; Scope graph; Spoofax","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

A common practice for a company to protect its sensitive data is network segmentation. The network is segmented in different domains with distinctive security levels. The sensitive data is stored and managed within the domain of the highest security level. To access this domain from another domain of a lower security level, a highly reliable connection is required. You want to have full control over the incoming and outgoing data flow between these network segments. A variety of solutions provide a highly-secured connection to link those segments which differ in range of features and control. An upcoming trend is the network diode. This device will allow data flow in only one direction. All the flows going into the opposite direction are being blocked. However, to feature an arbitrary flow between two network segments, the diode should consist of a numerous amount of properties. To narrow down the optional features a network diode should provide, this thesis will focus on TCP streams. TCP is one of the most common protocols used in internet traffic. Furthermore, TCP is a challenging protocol as it is a connection-oriented bidirectional protocol, which is intrinsic controversial with the concept of the data diode. To ensure the security of the data diode, this thesis will focus on a complete hardware design of the data diode. Software inside the data diode is still a risk for a security breach. This thesis will investigate the critical operations of TCP to implement them in the data diode. The aim is to utilise TCP's characteristic operations of the acknowledgement managing, the sliding window system, the congestion control algorithm, and explores the advantage of existing TCP options. To evaluate the feasibility of a high performance data diode featuring TCP, the system is broken down to project the behaviour of a TCP stream on a one-way connection device. This results in two separate TCP connections, with only the precious data as common shared information. This model requires a buffer at one side of the diode to transmit data in a TCP stream. To analyse and examine the influence of the diode configuration to the size of the buffer, a diode module is created to simulate in a OMNeT++ environment. From this simulation tool, a minimal set of parameters can be extracted that are essential to configure the data diode. With the assumption of having control on the network management at the trusted side of the diode, a configuration without a congestion control algorithm and without adding radical TCP options is recommended to minimise the required buffer size. Thereafter, this thesis proposes a high-level hardware design to implement the data diode on a hardware project. The design focuses on the high data rate which should be available to satisfy the data diode's requirements. Finally, this thesis concludes with an elaboration on the assumptions of the limitations of the network environments and recommends features to implement in future work.","FPGA; TCP/IP; Network Security; Data Diode","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

Idling in front of traffic lights is seen as one of the major inconveniences of commuting by bicycle. By giving personalised speed advice, the probability of catching a green light can be increased whilst taking the cyclist preferences into account. Due to its adaptive properties, Reinforcement learning (\acs{RL}) is a suited algorithm for developing optimal speed advice policies when dealing with a dynamic traffic environment and unique cyclist preferences. Generally, a large amount of training samples is required to successfully train a \acs{RL} algorithm. This poses a problem for this specific application since training samples must be generated by humans and are therefore scarce. Moreover, exploration of the environment is challenging since humans will not comply with irrational speed advice. These factors currently restrain the practical implementation of \acs{RL} algorithms for giving speed advice. This thesis aims to overcome these problems whilst maintaining a competitive performance compared to conventional \acs{RL} algorithms. This is done by using function approximators and a combined planning and learning method called Dyna. During a case study, three different function approximators are compared to reduce the amount of required training samples, namely polynomial functions, radial basis functions, and artificial neural networks. Secondly, the effectiveness of Dyna to improve the quality of the speed advice in an unknown environment is assessed. Finally, these methods are applied in a framework focused on the practical implementation of \acs{RL} for giving speed advice. It was concluded that function approximation method can significantly reduce the amount of required training samples to train a \acs{RL} algorithm. Dyna can increase user retention by providing cyclists with a high quality speed advice algorithm during the early learning phase of the algorithm. Therefore, it can be concluded that this \acs{RL} approach for giving personalised speed advice to cyclist approaching intersections is practically implementable and can even outperform benchmark algorithms in terms of travel time, energy consumption, and safety.","Reinforcement Learning (RL); Dyna; function approximation; Artificial Neural Networks; radial basis functions; speed advice; Traffic Control; Cyclists","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

To contribute to this development, the temporal and iridescent appearance is characterized, captured and communicated within this graduation project. The appearance of naturally grown Flavobacteria on marine growth medium is characterized regarding its size, iridescence and dominant colour. This is done by capturing colonies of Flavobacteria every 8 hours of their lives from different angles. It turns out the surface area grows quadratically; the colony appears the brightest when looking at the retroreflection from a height of 45° degrees; the colony reaches its green colour with red edges within 24 hours. A setup is created to capture samples of Flavobacteria consistently and densely. To properly capture the temporal and iridescent appearance, the setup is automated and able to tilt and rotate the sample, as well as change the azimuth angle (i.e., the angle between the light and the camera). To create straightforward visualizations that communicate Flavobacteria’s unique appearance, an interactive webpage is created. This communication tool shows the captured sample and allows users to control the variables of the data (i.e., the tilt and rotation of the sample, the azimuth angle and the time). Besides communicating Flavobacteria’s appearance to designers and artists, the communication tool can be used during experiments regarding influences on the appearance. These experiments need to be conducted in the future for designers to be able to steer the appearance to grow colours on artefacts to our own liking. To easily draw conclusions from these experiments, a second version of the communication tool is created, showing two samples side by side. At the end of the project, design guidelines are formulated based on the characterization and experience of working with Flavobacteria, for designers that will integrate Flavobacteria’s structural colour. Finally, further research is recommended regarding the definition of properties, the communication and perception of Flavobacteria and the search for potential application areas.","Flavobacteria; Appearance; Iridescence; Capturing materials; Communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

From 1919 to 1964 Katoenveem was used for the storage and transshipment of cotton. Thereby it was related to the water and its surrounding area. Over time the building lost its original function and its connection to the surrounding area. In 2002 the building got listed as a national monument. Although between 1964 and 2002 the building was sometimes occupied it never got a new permanent or long-term function and has been vacant for some years now. This project proposes a design for the adaptive reuse of the old cotton warehouse. The research question of the project is: How can Katoenveem be adapted to accommodate a new cultural function that fits within the context while keeping its historical and cultural values? This research question is answered according to two strategies: contemporary continuation and mixed program. The mixed program ensures a connection to the surrounding area and its (future) needs while the contemporary continuation ensures the preservation of historical and cultural values. The original ideas and design are translated to contemporary needs. By using the original layout and a modular system this project refers to the past while also thinking about the future.","Katoenveem; heritage; reuse","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","","51.905644, 4.427249"

It is important to address these problems in order to improve urban resilience, reduce flood damage, and promote quality of life. This thesis addresses these problems by focusing on increasing the ecosystem resilience in the urban environment. It seeks to address current shortcomings in cities’ approaches towards urban development; the potential of nature-based solutions as an alternative to grey solutions; and the integration of climate sensitive urban design in the built environment. The main research question is “How can an ecosystem resilient approach guide the built environment in order to integrate climate sensitivity in human-oriented urban design?” The development of a detailed urban design follows from a literature study on ecological urbanism, climate resilience, and nature based solutions, which is supplemented with an in-depth site analysis that focuses on spatial and technical aspects of the built environment in relation to heavy floods, spatial quality, and urbanized landscapes. The study draws on theories of persuasive visual storytelling and research by design. The interdisciplinary approach taken in this project culminates in an urban design proposal for the Buffalo Bayou Downtown corridor in Houston, Texas. The design proposal introduces new nature-based and water-based features into the urban environment. By reintroducing elements of the lost ecoregions of the East Texan coast (including wetlands and prairies) the design proposal not only contributes to improvements in quality of life, but also to greater urban resilience to pluvial floods.","ecosystem resilience; flood resilience; persuasive visual storytelling; human-oriented urban design; reconnecting to nature; Houston","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Transitional Territories","Transitional Territories","29.764874, -95.365466"

The first step in this project has been research into the reusability of building elements. As part of this process a factor based rating method was developed that can be used to evaluate how well specific building elements score on reusability. After this, both a building system -including the most rudamentary building elements - and two different building designs in strongly differing contexts were developed. These different building designs were used to test the universal usability of the building elements, whereas the developed rating method was used to test the reusability of the designed building elements. The end result suggests that a similar system has great potential to reduce both the climatic impact and economic costs of the building industry. The system was effectively integrated in both a relatively normal or standard design and a more extravagant and architecturally interesting design. The project ends with a suggestion of improvement that could be made towards a fully circular building future.","Modular Building; Universal Modular Building; Circular Building; Reusability; Remountability; Building System; Sustainability; Building Resource Production","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

As a tool to measure sustainability performance, the three bottom lines refer to the environmental, social and economic aspects of sustainability respectively. The implementation of the TBL framework in the construction sector is considered to be insufficient due to the industry’s reluctance to change. The objective of this research is to create an assessment tool based on performance indicators that will encourage construction companies to continuously monitor and improve sustainability performance. Initially, the large scientific database Scopus is being reviewed. The literature study resulted in the identification of 71 performance indicators (24 for the environment, 24 for the society and 23 for the economy, respectively. Moreover, 13 assessment frameworks were studied, however, they fail to provide holistic, quantitative results. Thus, a new assessment methodology is developed where the initial inventory of indicators is refined according to specific criteria, weights are allocated to indicators in order to reflect their importance to the project and its stakeholders, and then, the weighted sums are calculated and plotted in spider diagrams and bar charts. The case study was employed as a research method and the purpose was twofold: Firstly, to investigate the current practices in the field of sustainability in the construction industry and, secondly, to examine the feasibility of applying the proposed assessment tool. The results confirmed the poor integration of the TBL framework in the construction industry and the suggested tool was confirmed to be comprehensive, simple and straightforward, and at the same time the results could be very easily communicated with the project’s stakeholders. The most important deficiency of the proposed model was found to be the subjectivity in the assessment procedure. For that purpose, four assessment criteria are proposed in order to limit the subjectivity inserted in the evaluation process. A conceptual framework is also proposed to help organizations adopt the assessment tool in their daily practices.","Construction sustainability; Triple Bottom Line; Assessment method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

While vegetated foreshores can be colonized by several plant species (mainly mangroves or marshes), this thesis presents the study of phenomena occurring at salt marshes in an attempt to determine which are relevant indicators that can predict the presence or absence of this ecosystem at a given location. Moreover, the wave height attenuation capacity of such vegetated foreshores under different conditions is also assessed for different effectiveness indicators, in a way that provides insight into whether this habitat is not just feasible, but also effective as a coastal protection measure, with respect to wave height attenuation.<br/><br/>Results suggest that within a water system with similar sediment composition, inundation-free period and daily-occurring hydrodynamics can explain the presence/absence of vegetation at most sites, while storm conditions can the determining condition for vegetation absence in other locations.

On the other hand, results treating the different wave loads further indicates that greater attenuation may be achieved in sheltered coastal locations such as the Western Scheldt estuary, indicating that this system may be more effective in sheltered than in exposed coastal areas.<br/><br/>Finally, the set of conclusions provided by both sections may serve to determine whether an arbitrary location is capable of hosting salt marsh vegetation, as well as the effectiveness of such nature-based solution with respect to wave height attenuation.

In the Netherlands, these mechanisms are mainly provided by the public sector and housing associations (HA), with some minor mechanisms coming from the private market. After that, a qualitative research also identifies opportunities and barriers in the Dutch housing market. The qualitative research includes 19 in-depth interviews with housing experts from different sectors. The opportunities include a list of similar mechanisms in Europe and the Dutch context.

The procurement of this type of MRI through specific correction acquisition sequences tries to eliminate the maximum possible standardization problems that the technique inherently possesses. However, this does not provide perfect results. Deep learning could be used as a tool to finalize this harmonization after acquisition is finished. In this project, a CycleGAN is used to transfer the style of one specific MRI scanner into the images of another specific scanner. The aim is to achieve a better harmonization that eases posterior image analysis and to possibly solve other issues like hardware obsoleteness. Inspired by the literature, which has never applied image style transfer to this type of images, different methodologies are tested. Some have been applied to other MRI modalities, like an extra similarity measure in the loss function. One novel implementation is tested. It consists on an extra discriminator that tries to reinforce the classification of the original and fake/generated images of one scanner as one class, as opposed to the class formed by the original and fake images of the other scanner. Validation is based on visual inspection; histogram comparison; SSIM, NRMSE and correlation measures and CNN classification of the generated images (in a network trained to distinguish the origin of the scanners). Experiments show the inconclusiveness of the possibility to apply the general CycleGAN loss function to a set of images with such visual similarity. A further study on the specific details that a discriminator uses in order to classify images as coming from a given scanner could help design a specific loss which’s optimization generates the desired results.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Nowadays, natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is investigated and tested. A NOTES procedure includes flexible instruments, which are inserted through natural orifices such as the mouth, nose, anus or vagina. The instrument then passes transluminally towards the areas of interest. Benefits of this surgery method compared to conventional open surgery include, among others: the reduction in tissue trauma, no external scar tissue, less blood loss and a shorter recovery period. However, the method requires highly advanced medical devices that are slender and able to bend and form different paths to reach the area of interest. Bio-inspired by the movement and the propulsion of a snake, new instruments are being developed that provide a follow-the-leader motion (FTL-motion). In a follow-the-leader mechanism, the user steers the tip of the instrument. The position given to the tip is stored and passed on proximally from segment to segment. This thesis aims to improve the existing mechanically controlled FTL-mechanisms, in which the shaft is controlled with four-cable control. In this research, a cylindrical mechanical path-planning module is designed and manufactured: the Cryptex Programmable Memory Mechanism (CPMM). The cylindrical shape improves cable-control, as it can simultaneously steer one cable and its antagonist, and control the motion of a compliant shaft in one plane. Two prototypes were developed: a machined prototype and a 3D printed prototype. Both designs were manually tested in four phases: individual components and subassemblies; the key component solely; integrated design excluding the key component; completely integrated design. It is concluded that the design of the 3D printed prototype is limited by the accuracy of the parts and the material properties. The machined prototype shows promising results, as it can form diagonal and curved paths as an output. Even though the performance of the CPMM prototype leaves room for improvement, it validates that the proposed concept can provide the follow-the-leader motion.","Path Planning; Follow-the-leader; Minimally invasive surgery; NOTES; Medical instrument; Cable-driven; Mechanical snakes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-20","","","","","",""

The accurate modelling of glacier heights is crucial for determining their past, current and future state. The new lidar altimeters ICESAT-2 and GEDI were launched in 2018, which could provide valuable new data in this regard. ICESAT-2 uses a novel photon counting technique that delivers elevation data at an unprecedented 0.7 m along-track resolution. This also poses questions about how such data should be processed. GEDI uses a more conventional full waveform sensor, which creates a vertical profile of surface returns every 60 m representing a footprint with a 30 m diameter. In this thesis the potential of ICESAT-2 and GEDI for detecting glacier changes in Austria is examined. The vertical errors on the Austrian glaciers of the ATL03 geolocated photons and ATL06 Land ice elevation data products of ICESAT-2 were found to be 1.94 and 1.72 meters respectively, which outperforms most alternative sensors. The GEDI L2A product provides an error of 5.80 m for the same area. For both sensors, the horizontal geolocation error was found to be relatively large, which results in a strong relation between the surface gradient and the vertical error. The high resolution and accuracy of ICESAT-2 can provide valuable detailed information about glacier height differences worldwide. The inclusion of GEDI data can help provide observations in sparsely sampled areas, but considering its relatively poor resolution and accuracy better alternatives may be available. The satellite observations were confined to glacier inventory outlines and compared to a high quality Digital Elevation Model of Austria. The results show an average glacier height loss of 5.85 m for ICESAT-2 and 4.86 m for GEDI, with the majority of observations representing the period 2010-2019. The height differences were compared with their local elevation, slope, orientation and their distance to the glacier edge, in order to find what features could assist in extrapolating the observations. All features show some relation with the glacier height differences, but the elevation and distance to glacier edge were found to contribute the most information.<br/>Spaceborne lidar data is confined to narrow profiles of the surface, so they require extrapolation to make conclusions about the total state of the glaciers. The total mass difference of Austria was estimated first by simply applying the average height difference to the total glacier area, and secondly by ordinary cokriging with the elevation. Both techniques agree on a total mass loss of 1.59 gigatons, while the cokriging method additionally results in a more detailed image of mass loss for individual glaciers. For the Ötztal region a mass loss of 77.07 megatons annually was estimated for the period 2010-2019.","glaciers; LIDAR; ICESat-2; GEDI; Austria","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

Co-location is already being implemented within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). However, co-location has remained as a vague concept within MFA ever since its introduction. There is no strategy backing the concept; only some guidelines have been developed for more clarity from an operational perspective. Besides, the policy takes an opposing stance: a no, unless.. policy. Due to this concept's vagueness, co-location adds limited value to MFA. On the other hand, the number of co-locations indicates there is a clear need for the concept. Research objective: The objective of this thesis is to help the primary process of MFA achieve their goals and add more value with a better implementation of co-location by using the step-by-step plan developed in this research. The step-by-step plan with best actions/practices can be used to select the most suitable co-location alternative (with the decision tree and SWOT analysis) and improve the implementation of co-location as a CRE intervention (with the success formula); Consequently, more value is added to the organization. The main research question central in this thesis is: How can co-location be used as a tool within the CRE strategy and as part of the CRE portfolio that adds more value to the organization, specifically in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? Research method: With the use of a hybrid research method, in which elements of operational, theoretical, and empirical research are incorporated, the answer to the main research question was obtained. The first part of the research method used was establishing the theoretical background on co-location and adding value. This knowledge establishment formed the basis of the following parts of the thesis. For the second part, an analysis of the current situation within the Ministry of Foreign affairs completed: strategic analysis of the general situation (stakeholder demands, corporate strategy, CRE strategy, Etc.) and an assessment of the current co-location cases (incorporates the empirical elements of the research). This assessment was completed using surveys (to assess the performance and perception) and interviews to develop an anecdotal success formula. The final part of this thesis incorporates the operational elements of the hybrid research method. The obtained information from the previous parts was combined for the development of a step-by-step plan to improve the current situation of co-location within MFA. Findings and conclusion: The developed step-by-step plan consists of the following products: a decision tree and SWOT analysis that both can be used to select the best co-location alternatives of a particular co-location embassy/consulate, based on the demands and objectives of MFA and the embassy/consulate. After selecting an alternative, the step-by-step plan's success formula can then be used as a tool to manage the implementation process. The last part of the step-by-step plan is needed to assess and, if needed, readjust the co-location after the implementation: the check and act phase. For assessing the co-location cases, a recommendation list of possible KPI's per demand (including the objectives) and the related adding value parameters are provided.","Co-location; Corporate Real Estate Management; Added value; Ministry of Foreign Affairs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Local treatment options for patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer may increase tumor control and benefit patient survival. This study aimed to test the feasibility of a possible new treatment method utilizing intratumoral holmium microsphere injections. Method: In this study, non-radioactive holmium-165 poly(L-lactic acid) microspheres (165Ho-PLLA-MS, HoMS) were injected in pancreatic adenocarcinoma in an ex-vivo setting. Patients signed informed consent to donate their resected pancreas with tumor to this study after conventional pancreatectomy. HoMS were brought in a suspension of Pluronic and Saline (5 mg HoMS per milliliter suspension) and was homogenized using an intratumoral injection device for HoMS. Pre- and post-injection MRI and CT were analyzed for holmium distribution. Visual holmium artefacts on MRI were manually segmented for a volume estimation. Results: Three tissue samples of 9.4 ml, 5.6 ml, and 11.2 ml were injected with 4.95 ml, 2.3 ml, and 1.8 ml HoMS suspension, respectively. Pre-injection MRI was used for treatment planning. Two tissue samples were injected using the pre-injection MRI and tumor palpation. In the last-sample additional ultrasound-guidance was performed. Injections were performed with minor leakage or needle obstruction. MRI segmentation showed fractions of the holmium artefacts visual in or near the tumor increased per sample with 26%, 43% and 68%, for sample 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Holmium quantification was performed on sample 3 and gave a simulated mean tumor dose 6 Gy and a mean dose in the largest deposits of 33 Gy. Small deposits were most likely excluded from quantification because of a low resolution. HoMS were not visible on CT. This was most likely caused by automated scanning parameters and a low HoMS concentration. Conclusion: Preliminary results show that intratumoral injection of HoMS in pancreatic adenocarcinoma is feasible in an ex-vivo setting. Improvements regarding microsphere concentration, imaging and quantification may be investigated during the final three patients in this trial. Considering the already reached distribution and injection control, intratumoral holmium microsphere injection may soon benefit patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.","Pancreatic cancer; Holmium microspheres; intratumoral injection; medical device","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-27","","","","Technical Medicine","",""

Additionally, the gravity compensator is required to have a low stiffness to limit the disturbance forces due to vibrations present inside the machine. The state of the art gravity compensators are based on permanent magnets, as they are a non-contact solution providing the best performance and excellent vacuum compatibility. However, the current designs are limited to a single operating point. To enable the development of the next generation of nanometer precision positioning machines, a gravity compensator with an operating line is required. Therefore, the goal of this research is: “To design and experimentally validate a magnetic long-stroke gravity compensator for a nanometer precision positioning machine”. In this study the most suitable magnetic design was developed using various modelling techniques. Subsequently, the model and the design were validated by means of measurements taken with an experimental setup. From this study it was concluded that the design requirements can be met using high grade magnets. Thereby, with this Master Thesis, the first step has been taken towards the next generation of nanometer precision positioning machines.","gravity compensator; Vibration Isolation; gravity compensation; Long-stroke; magnetics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

(mentor); de Bruijne, M.L.C. (graduation committee); Schraven, D.F.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In the Netherlands, from time to time, remarkable bids can be observed among the results of tenders for large infrastructure projects with design and construction integrated in a single contract. This observation sparked interest in the decision-making processes that Dutch contractors apply. Contractors determine their bid amount with the mark-up approach; the construction costs are marked-up, to account for; risk, general overhead and profit. Decision makers balance the profit with the probability of winning the tender, by adjusting the mark-up. This is challenging, because they are faced with little information, limited time and large uncertainties. The mark-up decision is made based on a mixture of experience, individual beliefs and gut feelings. This makes the decision-making susceptible to biases and emotional responses to external pressures. Hence, the research question is; how can the bidding price determination process for large infrastructure projects by Dutch EPC contractors be improved? The general viewpoint in literature is that the decision-making would greatly improve if it would be more rational. Over the years, several methods have been proposed to assist decision makers in their mark-up decision, however, they are not used by Dutch contractors. A literature study of the proposed mark-up models and decision-making literature was used to compile a theoretic framework. Semi-structured interviews are conducted with six of the largest Dutch infrastructure contractors to obtain a notion of contractors’ bid determination processes. The obtained notion is compared with the theoretic framework, which resulted in the finding that multi-criteria mark-up models are most congruent with current practice. In addition, a barrier to rationalizing a contractor’s bid determination is identified. There is a misalignment between the phase in which the contractor conceptualizes the tender and the final phase in which the bid amount is determined. The misalignment is present at different levels; 1) between a structured tender process and a unstructured mark-up decision process, 2) between a focus on data during the tender which disappears when other, more intangible items are considered in the bid amount decision as well and 3) between bounded rational decision-making during the tendering phase and a more entrepreneurial type of decision making at the mark-up decision. Implementing a multi-criteria mark-up model is recommended to reduce the misalignment and subsequently improve the decision-making. This model is most congruent to contractor’s current processes. In addition, it promotes a more complete, well-considered decision-making, which reduces the sensitivity to biases.","Tendering; Contractor; Mark-up; Procurement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

The findings show attention should be paid to culture within different management areas, with a specific focus on communications management. Management elements in which culture should be managed are expatriate personnel / foreign staff and operatives, design approaches, negotiations, codes of conduct and ethical standards and professional standards and construction codes. Specific actions can be taken to manage cultural differences more effectively, such as addressing the subject during project start-up meetings, making one’s own general expectations, procedures and guidelines explicit and organising team building activities to help project team members keep an open-mind and gain understanding of their own cultural bias and that of others.","project management; cultural differences; international building projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

From the first propeller powered wood and canvas aircraft to the modern day aluminium and carbon fibre reinforced plastics jet aircraft [33], aviation has evolved. Next to the evolution of materials and aircraft going from propeller to high bypass ratio turbofan engines, the flight deck of aircraft has seen an incredible advance in technology. It has gone from countless gauges displaying all kinds of information to the pilots towards a digital flight deck, displaying information on screens. The latest step has been the introduction of touchscreens, allowing pilots to interact with the displayed information directly [2]. The novel use of touchbased interfaces allows for a lot of benefits like the direct interaction with information as mentioned, however, there are several drawbacks when using a touchbased interface. A main one is the difficulty of interaction with a touchbased interface when in a turbulent motion environment [6]. Research has been done before on the usability of touchbased interfaces when in an atmospheric turbulence environment, such as by Cockburn et al. in 2017 [6], but this work focuses on mitigating the effects of the atmospheric turbulence. On the other hand, research has been done on constructing a predictive model for the usability of a touchscreen, as performed by Bi et al. in [3], but this was in a stationary environment. In this research thesis a predictive model will be constructed that incorporates the effects of atmospheric turbulence into Fitts’ Law, [11], and Finger Fitts’ Law specifically, [3], in order to predict the usability of touchbased interfaces under various levels of atmospheric turbulence.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Introduced as a patient friendly alternative to open surgery by significantly reducing incisions size, benefits such as faster patient recovery time, and less pain for patients, are achieved. However, in MIS, rigid instrument shafts can impair surgeons’ dexterity as access to pathology sites is complicated. Steering mechanisms have been developed to locate and orientate an instrument tip for tissue manipulation. Many steerable Minimally Invasive (MI) instruments are intended for single use only, because the actuation cables in those instruments cannot be properly cleaned. Consequently, costly and well-functioning instruments are disposed after each surgical procedure, forming a burden to both hospital sustainability and financial expenses. A platform technology suitable for reuse is brought to the market by the Delft University of Technology in collaboration with Surge-On Medical B.V. Problems with this platform arise in the integration of an internally routed cable, since a hinge in the steering mechanism leads to a critically small cable bending radius. In the present master’s thesis, a bare minimum design approach is followed to make the platform technology compatible with internally routed cables. Based on set requirements, multiple concepts of steering mechanisms are generated and evaluated. The most promising concept is modelled, tested and validated with computer models and experiments. The final design comprises a four-bar linkage mechanism and an innovative joint is used to kinematically stabilize the mechanism. The mechanism achieves 140 degrees of tip articulation and guides internally routed cables with a bending radius of 5mm. The steering mechanism fits through trocars of 5mm and can support loads of 40N, as applied by internally routed cables. The design can be integrated in reusable minimally invasive surgical instruments, since detachment of components allows for effective cleaning and inspection. The designed steering mechanism can be used as building block for reusable minimally invasive instruments, providing an important step to the next generation of steering technology in MIS.","SATA technology; Steerable instrument; Steerable mechanical joint; Reusable instrument; Minimally invasive surgery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-01-26","","","","Biomedical Engineering","MARL project",""

Converting the heart wall vibrations into electricity through a vibration energy harvester has been considered a promising solution to this problem. However, the complexity of the heart signals on which the energy harvester has to operate is a challenge. The human heart signal is a broadband signal, consisting of a varying acceleration amplitude at low frequencies. Most of the testing signals used in the labs are harmonic signals, Gaussian white noise or Gaussian coloured noise. These signals do not have the same characteristics as a human heart signal. In addition, the dynamical behaviour of an energy harvester differs per input signal. Therefore, it is important to test energy harvesters on the operation signal, in this case human heart acceleration signals. A heart signal differs per person depending on, for instance, someone's age, sex and health. This means that multiple human heart input signals are needed. Ethical requirements make the measurement of these signals with the necessary details a challenge in itself. In order to meet this demand and to avoid this ethical issue, a heart signal generator is developed as a first step towards the testing of energy harvesters on an approximation of human heart signals. Three different sources of heart signals are combined in order to obtain a new source of heart signals, an approximation of reality, which can be used for the testing. Speckle Tracking Echocardiography signals, open-chest pig heart acceleration signals and human chest motion acceleration signals are analysed and their characteristics are used as the source for the heart signal generator. This heart signal generator is able to mimic multiple heartbeats and the influence of the heart rate on the amplitude and signal duration. The disadvantages of accelerometer measurements are compensated with the advantages of Speckle Tracking Echocardiography measurements, and vice versa, in order to obtain an accurate and detailed heart signal. The output of the heart signal generator is a one-dimensional acceleration signal. An energy harvester is tested on multiple generated heart signals for a heart rate range of 120-200 bpm. It was observed that the mean power output and the efficiency of the energy harvester differs per heart signal. This shows that testing on multiple heart signals is crucial in order to validate that enough power is generated for charging the battery.","Energy Harvesting; Pacemaker; Heart Wall Motion; Human Heart Acceleration Signals","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

Many energy harvesters are produced in the form of a resonator, where resonant amplification enables efficient operation of the energy harvester. At low frequencies below 10 hz, input motions quickly increase for a constant input acceleration and resonant amplification results in energy harvesters that are too large to implement them. A solution is sought in creating a nonresonant energy harvester. The stiffness of a strongly coupled piezoelectric beam is compensated by adding negative stiffness to bring it to a near statically balanced state. This negative stiffness is embodied by attracting magnets. To model the dynamics and voltage output of the harvester, a modal analysis based distributed parameter model is used and further developed by including negative stiffness and force-displacement measurements of the stiffness compensated piezo. To investigate the mechanical behaviour of a compensated piezo, force-displacement measurements are carried out at different deformation speeds and load resistances. From these measurements, it has been observed that the stiffness of the compensated piezo strongly depends on the connected load resistance and the deformation speed. Furthermore, memory effects in piezoelectric hysteresis found in actuators such as curve alignment and wipeout have also been confirmed in force-displacement measurements. The performance of the harvester has been evaluated by exciting it on a linear air bearing stage. It has been found that for excitations between 2 and 6 hz, the error in RMS power between simulation and measurement remains below 10%. For its range of excitation, this harvester has been observed to be the most efficient with respect to prior art from literature. Therefore, stiffness compensation of a piezoelectric energy harvester can be considered as a successful method to improve the efficiency at low frequency excitation.","Vibration Energy Harvesting; Piezoelectricity; Stiffness compensation; Zero stiffness; Static balancing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

Use of radioactive palladium (<sup>103</sup>Pd) seeds for producing localized effect with brachytherapy is already in practice. However, they are known to result in uneven dose distribution with creation of ""hot spots"" in the vicinity of seed implants. Alternatively, conventional thermal ablation or hyperthermia treatments using mechanical or electromagnetic systems also have difficulties with localizing the thermal effect to the target region. Composite and biocompatible palladium- (Ultra-small) superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (PdO-USPION) on the other hand have the potential to diffuse throughout the tumor ensuring relatively more uniform dose distribution and improve the ease of clearance from the biological system without causing long-term side effects. Magnetic property of (Ultra small) superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles can be exploited to induce and deliver heat energy to kill cancerous cells upon exposure to Alternating magnetic field (AMF) and generate contrast enhanced magnetic resonance images (MRI) by subjecting them to static magnetic fields. Heating and contrast enhancement ability depends on the physical, chemical and magnetic properties of nanoparticles which in turn rely on the synthesis method. In this research, spark ablation technology is employed to produce the nanoparticles from metallic electrodes. Although, for the purpose of the current research, inactive palladium is used to reduce complexity given that the synthesis of PdO-USPIONs with this synthesis method is employed for the first time through this research.

Consequently, the cities we build many years ago are not resilient to climate change in the long run. In response the national government created the Delta Plan on Spatial Adaptation (DPRA) to adapt to the new situation and achieve a climate-proof and water robust urban environment. Climate change adaptation requires a local approach as the climate change effects can differ per neighbourhood. Therefore, local governments are in charge to implement the DPRA. Since the urban environment consists of both public and private space, the involved stakeholders will have to collaborate to ensure a climate-proof environment. Meaning they have to agree on their roles and responsibilities to adapt. Yet, in reality this is not always the case. In this research, the Q methodology is used to find the different perspectives of sixteen public and private stakeholders in two neighbourhoods of The Hague. Next, stakeholders with different perspectives are invited to participate in a risk dialogue (the second ambition of the DPRA). Using the constructive conflict methodology, the effect of the dialogue is analysed. This research did not bring the perspectives closer together, which entails that public stakeholders might have to limit their expectations to increase the perceived responsibility of private stakeholders using the risk dialogue. However, public stakeholders can apply the method of this study to improve their knowledge of the differences in perspectives during the dialogue, their preparation of arguments, and analyse the effect of the dialogue.","Climate change adaptation; participation; COM-B model; spatial planning; urban environment; risk dialogue; waterlogging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

To reach this goal, the use of smart sensor pants is researched. The data will be used to develop models for finding injury risk factors that are related to movements. Currently, the system is capable of reading out the IMUs and storing the data on an SD-card, for post-analysis of the data. As next step, the communication link should be implemented, for real time feedback to the football players. The design of an efficient communication system in terms of power, size, and reliability, is quite a big task. By looking at similar research to body-worn devices, it is noted, that most devices deal with a 10 times lower data rate than the current device. On top of that, it is noted that the absorption of the body is causing problems on the link reliability. Based on these observations, it is decided to focus the research of this Thesis on the reduction of the data load, and the optimization of the transmission part of the smart sensor pants. The Thesis is split into two parts, the first part will show the use of lossless data compression. The second part will start with showing the benefit of using a patch antenna over a dipole antenna and continues by showing the benefit of using a dual antenna configuration over a single antenna configuration. To be more specific, the first part of this Thesis starts by comparing different lossless data compression algorithms, from which the FELACS algorithm is chosen as most suited. This algorithm is then implemented on the current hardware and tested on data from the smart sensor pants in a realistic football scenario. These results show an average compression ratio of 43 %-45 % in the most intensive 5-minutes of a football game, with a minimum of 38 % in an interval of 10 s. To improve the compression algorithm, an adjustment to the FELACS algorithm is proposed. This adjustment is theoretically tested and shown to outperform the FELACS algorithm with a higher compression ratio. In the second part, the use of a dual antenna configuration is discussed, whereby the use of a patch antenna is compared to a dipole antenna. It will be shown, that a dual antenna configuration can significantly improve the signal strength around the player, resulting in an almost isotropic radiation pattern, using pattern diversity. On top of that, this form of pattern diversity is observed to increase the reliability of the link, using switched combining. Moreover, it will be shown that a patch antenna will be more suited for this application, due to the higher gain in the front, and the robustness against interference when placed close to a conducting material. In summary, the two main contributions of this Thesis, are the reductions in data load, and the testing and verification of the dual patch antenna configuration. These contributions provide the basis for the communication part of the smart sensor pants.","lossless data compression; pattern diversity; smart sensor pants; Wireless Communication; Patch Antenna; Dipole Antenna","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-26","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

Stakeholders are not willing to consider reuse as a strategy to deal with heritage vacancy. Studies have tried to grasp this complexity by identifying success factors, but till this point, practitioners have not been able to put this to work to improve the process. This research proposes to find out what the success factors are, and when, how, and why they are present, and give them a place and time within the adaptive reuse process. That way, it becomes easier to align resources and attention in future adaptive reuse projects, leading to process improvement. Doing so facilitates the elements to deliver a project successfully. This research will answer the following question: How can success factors improve the process of adaptive reuse of heritage? This research aims to provide insight and recommendations into the complex issue of adaptive reuse projects. Through the literature review and three case study projects, all the key aspects of the main research question were covered on the subjects: adaptive reuse of heritage, the reuse process, success and success factors, process improvements and the actual improvement of the reuse process. This has led to a general adaptive reuse process and a list of the twelve success factors that were perceived as being most important in the case study projects, combined into a process map. The process map describes the adaptive reuse process from idea until delivery where the main activities, complexity, degree of freedom, and success factors indicate how stakeholders can manage the process. This research showed the value and reuse potential of heritage buildings by providing the right tools to increase the chance for successfully delivering a reused building. This research shows that the complex adaptive reuse process can be made simple and insightful by bundling knowledge and experience from practice to ignite the drive to reuse out cultural and historical past. For the process model to impact future adaptive reuse processes, stakeholders have to actively embed the model into their work to learn from it. Next to that, the attractiveness of adaptive reuse projects depends on the collaboration between public and private parties.","Adaptive reuse; Process improvement; Process map; Success factors; Heritage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

The current scientific literature does not fully address the link between abrupt change in the workplace and the impact of this on employees. More generally, research on the employee perspective and employee experiences is often not performed in the context of change in the workplace. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the experiences of abrupt change regarding the workplace due to Covid-19 in depth. It analyses the individual and organisational factors that help deal with this abrupt change. The study adds to research on gradual organisational change and contributes to knowledge about the added value of the office as a workplace, and employee perspectives on change processes. <br/>Preliminary interviews give insight into the lived experiences of employees concerning the abrupt change process and experiences of working from home. Next, an embedded case study analyses employee expectations and preferences through semi-structured interviews. The research findings provide new insight into the abrupt change experience. The motivation and productivity of employees are harmed due to lack in variety of work activities and a monotonous way of interacting with colleagues, both formally and informally. Working from home resulted in a decline in informal interactions. The reduced contact resulted in a reduced feeling of involvement in the organisation. This is disadvantageous to the change process, as communication between the organisation and the individual help foster the transition during abrupt change. To improve the abrupt change experience, the study recommends a 5-step implementation plan for organisations. The process helps to better align employee preferences and expectations with organisational objectives. A more employee-oriented approach in workplace strategy creation is recommended. This would incorporate employee preferences in the process of change, to ensure employee wellbeing and enhance competitive advantage during abrupt change.","Covid-19; abrupt change; Workplace; Employee Experience; Organisational change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

However, in advanced cervical cancer patients commercially available BT applicators are particularly ill-adapted and therefore result in suboptimal local control and frequent occurrence of substantial tissue morbidity. Additionally, cervical cancer BT is associated with large dosimetric uncertainty which has been shown to significantly impact the delivered dose and the occurrence of normal tissue complications. The clinical outcomes of treatment may be improved through combined efforts in sophisticated applicator design and robust treatment optimisation. Patient-tailored BT applicators have been introduced to improve dose conformity, but currently rely on manual indication of needle channels. Automated needle channel planning software exists, but does not account for OAR dose constraints or uncertainty in planning. Robust treatment optimisation potentially improves the dose conformity of plans in the presence of uncertainty, but relies on the questionable presumption that optimisation of dwell times can fully correct for suboptimal dwell positions. In this thesis, the freedom of source placement that 3D-printed applicators allow and the principle of robust treatment optimisation are leveraged to develop robust needle channel planning software for personalised applicators. This thesis was accordingly divided into three parts. In the first part, literature was reviewed to establish the dosimetric uncertainty budget and evaluate geometric uncertainty of OARs. Inter and intra-fraction uncertainty are likely the greatest contributors to the uncertainty budget, possibly increasing the delivered dose to OARs with up to 4.0±20% (k = 1). Using dose-response models it was established that this may realistically increase the occurrence of moderate to severe morbidity of the bladder or rectum by 1.5 and 3.7% respectively. The BT needle channel planning problem under uncertainty was accordingly defined as the problem of computing multiple feasible, non-intersecting curvature- constrained channels under probabilistic or bounded spatial uncertainty of OARs. In the second part, a tool termed motion-planning quality function deployment (MP-QFD) was developed to select a suitable motion planning class. Using the results from a pilot study among nine medical specialists, this tool substantiated the preferred choice for an incremental sampling-based motion planning algorithm. In the last part, robust variants of sampling-based planners were introduced that are capable of computing trajectories for non-holonomic agents in environments under uncertainty. In a two-dimensional simulated patient case, it was shown that these planners were able to generate near-optimal trajectories that (probabilistically) guaranteed not exceeding OAR dose constraints. Subsequent dose-based optimisation showed that (robust) trajectory planning could theoretically yield treatment plans with improved dose conformity over those generated for conventional applicators. Due to modelling assumptions, robust motion planning did not result in improved dose conformity over a nominal motion planning approach in a worst-case scenario. Future work should therefore focus on improving our understanding of OAR movement in and during BT treatment and validating this theoretical work in a patient case series.","Brachytherapy; Cervical cancer; Personalised healthcare; Robust optimization; Uncertainty quantification; QFD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-26","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

(graduation committee); van den Elzen, Martijn (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The city of Amsterdam contains about 1600 bridges and 600 kilometres of quay walls. Of these walls, about 200 kilometres are of masonry walls placed on a timber floor and founded on timber piles. These quay walls are sometimes over 100 years old. Due to the increasing loads in the past century and the degrading of material properties in the masonry wall and timber elements, the quay walls are in bad shape. When designing a quay wall, a cross-sectional analysis is used to calculate the desired dimensions to withstand the loads. When this calculation is performed on a quay wall over a 100 years old, containing a failing pile foundation, the quay wall should fail. However, many of the quay walls under the condition of a partly failing foundation, are deforming, but still standing. During recent years, at 16 locations in Amsterdam, the risk of collapse appeared imminent, and emergency structures are put into place. Possible practical measures are removing trees on the quay walls, traffic limitations in the city centre and placing temporary struts and sheet piles to provide stability. Since the scale of the problem in Amsterdam is large, the time to renovate all the quay walls is lengthy. Therefore, there is a need for knowledge on the state of quay walls at the end of their life phase when partly failing. Different failure mechanisms occur, and various measures are developed to control those and provide (temporary) stability. This research answers the question: How can 2D analyses of quay walls, in multiple directions, under the condition of a partly failing foundation, provide insight into the hidden structural capacity within the masonry work? The study focuses on the severeness and scale of the foundation defects in the quay wall's cross-sectional and longitudinal direction. For the longitudinal models, the effects of the masonry material qualities are studied by using different material properties. Also examined is the effect of the failing foundation pile's post-peak behaviour, modelled as brittle and checked for plastic behaviour. Finally, the relevancy of the timber floor is studied for a stiff continuous floor and most notable, the full removal of the floor. To study this, two 2D regular plane stress, nonlinear elastic, finite element models are created in Diana FEA. The foundation piles are modelled as nonlinear elastic springs via a force-displacement diagram. The foundation piles' defects are modelled by assuming a smaller pile diameter, resulting in a weaker force-displacement diagram and larger displacements in the quay wall system. The foundation defects can be scaled over a small or big area by adapting multiple foundation piles over the length of the quay wall. The masonry's behaviour is researched by using a macro material model using smeared material properties for the brick and mortar, resulting in a continuous material. The material model used is the Total Strain Rotating Crack Model, which can be used in a 3D analysis of the quay wall system in future research. Finally, the interface between the timber floor and masonry is modelled using a coulomb friction interface criterion. This simulates the effects of the mortar layer connecting the timber floor and masonry work in a quay wall. The results conclude that analysing a foundation defect in the cross-sectional direction of the quay wall results in instability of the wall without further horizontal and vertical constraints to keep the quay wall in place. Modelling the pile foundation defects using a reduced pile diameter and consequently, a decreased force-displacement diagram as spring input provides the model with temporary stability. Ultimately, the cross-sectional analyses contribute little knowledge on residual strength and hidden structural capacity. Separately, the longitudinal model implements a vertical constraint in the masonry by using the bending capacities of the material. The results present an expected correlation between the scale of the foundation defects and the vertical displacements. Similar to the cross-sectional analyses, the reduced pile capacity of the foundation piles provides the model residual strength compared to the situation where the total failure of a timber pile is used. The timber foundation pile's failure mechanism needs to be researched in-depth since the results present a notable difference for crack patterns and force-displacement curvatures when modelled brittle or plastically. For brittle failure, a horizontal crack forms at the tip of the central, vertical crack, due to the abrupt enlargement in vertical displacement of the quay wall. The functionality of the timber floor in the longitudinal analyses presents itself when the crack patterns are analysed. The presence of the timber floor results in multiple smaller cracks instead of a single large crack when foundation defects of the quay wall system are analysed without a timber floor. It can be concluded that the masonry quality, most notably the tensile strength, affect the results significantly in terms of maximum values in the force-displacement diagrams and crack development. The material properties are based on Groningen masonry experiments, and it is recommended to perform experiments to the masonry quality of Amsterdam quay walls. Finally, the observed displacements related to the intervention points of the municipality conclude that foundation defects result in cracks for displacements below the marking points of 20 and 25 millimetres. For weaker masonry, the quay wall fails before the indication values. It is recommended to perform more measurements to the quay walls in Amsterdam and study the reliability of the intervention points.","Quay walls; Masonry; Finite Element Analysis; Pile foundations; Amsterdam; Total Strain Crack Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""

(mentor); Labeur, R.J. (graduation committee); Verlaan, M. (graduation committee); Kranenburg, Wouter (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","class=""MsoNormal"">Due to climate change and human interventions, saltwater intrusion is becoming a topic of increasing concern worldwide. Salt water intrudes into the Rotterdam Waterway (RWW) by an exchange flow, where the denser sea water propagates landwards at the bottom. The main competing mechanism for this stratified exchange flow is vertical mixing, which can be realised by internal wave induced shear instabilities or wave breaking. The goal of this study is to investigate whether internal waves generated over undular bottom topography in the RWW can generate additional vertical mixing. The underlying assumption is that a decrease in stratification decreases salt intrusion.   The approach to answer the main research question is a combination of an analytical and a numerical analysis. The analytical study is based on frictionless linear theory. Internal wave behaviour is further analysed with FinLab, a finite element model which includes the non-hydrostatic processes and effects of density differences. FinLab is evaluated for the application of this study by means of a validation case.  In the analytical study, linear theory is applied to obtain a relation between the bed wave parameters and average internal wave energy density E for internal waves generated over sinusoidal bottom topography in a linearly stratified fluid. The derived expression describes that the bottom topography amplitude h0 and bed wave number kT both have a positive quadratic relation with the energy. Additionally, kTkinfluences the resonance conditions.  To validate FinLab for internal wave breaking and mixing an experiment in a wave tank, according to an example from literature, is simulated. The validation case reveals a shortcoming in the turbulent mixing parameterization. However, on scales relevant for the RWW the effect of this will not have the same significance. The validation case offers a suggestion for a subgrid closure of diffusion, where density effects are taken into account.  Numerical simulations of a 2D channel stretch with sinusoidal bottom topography, a linearly stratified fluid and a linearly varying background velocity, show generation of resonant trapped internal waves for the first two resonant modes. These occurrences correspond to the highest values of kinetic energy as function of vertical velocity averaged over the bed wave domain. The vertical buoyancy flux b is downward directed during occurrences of internal waves and becomes upward directed for increasing background flow. Vertical mixing is associated with an increase in average potential energy Ep, which is 17% higher for the base case (containing bed waves) than for a similar case without bed waves. This increase is larger when bottom shear stress increases. Richardson numbers below 0.25, associated with shear instabilities and mixing, are only observed near the bed, mainly when internal waves are present. The effect of variations in bottom topography wavelength LT and amplitude h0 on internal wave energy can be explained by the analytical formulation. The effect of bed wave parameter changes on b and relative increase in Ep can be related to the effect of the changed amount of bed friction rather than the difference in wave energy.   The first resonant mode is the most energetic, however, the average energy density found for these waves is only 0.4% to 6.7% of the potential energy anomaly (PEA); the energy required to fully mix a stratified water column. In the simulations the only mechanism that could transfer internal wave energy to turbulent kinetic energy are shear instabilities near the bed. Over the full simulation, the net vertical buoyancy transport is of negligible magnitude, where Ep shows significant increases between 6% and 99% compared to similar cases without bed waves and is enhanced during the presence of internal waves.  The main discussion point is that the quantification of vertical mixing requires improvement, particularly to determine the importance of mixing by internal wave-induced shear instabilities and by bed shear. Mixing by local shear instabilities (of which the relevant scales cannot be resolved with the current grid resolution) does not have an adequate parameterization, because density effects are not included in the turbulence closure. The bed friction parameter, which greatly influences the behaviour of the system, has to be validated. Furthermore, cases where internal waves might break in practice (e.g. at banks) were not considered. Finally, the observed internal wave energy is of small magnitude, however field measurements by Pietrzak(1991) shows that turbulence production by internal waves was significant.   ","Salt Intrusion; Internal waves; Turbulent mixing; Stratified flows; Estuarine circulation; FinLab","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Offshore pipelines represent major items in the oil and gas industry nowadays. These submarine pipelines are usually covered with backfill for protection and a well-known method for this is sand backfilling with a trailing suction hopper dredger (TSHD). Although pipeline installation with a TSHD is a developed technique, there are still some challenges regarding uplift movements of the pipeline during the backfill procedure. This action is called pipeline flotation, which is a frequently occurring problem during the sand backfilling process and the costs for repair measures afterwards are very expensive. Accurate modelling of the sand backfilling process over a pipeline can lead to significant cost reductions by optimising the sand backfilling technique. Pipeline flotation is induced by the development of upward buoyancy forces from the sand-water mixture on the pipeline. If the weight of the pipeline is not sufficient enough, it will experience uplift movements during the backfilling process. The purpose of this research is to develop a better understanding of the mechanism of pipeline flotation. Due to a lack of available field data, it is anticipated that a set of laboratory experiments will provide a better insight into the parameters involved in pipeline flotation during sand backfilling. This research builds on the study Yang (2020), in which a small-scale set-up and 2D calculation model are designed to perform experiments concerning pipeline flotation during sand backfilling. A total amount of 50 experiments is performed with Geba Weiss sand in four different stages: with horizontal discharge, vertically upward discharge, elevated initial pipe positions and increased pipe specific weights. The set of experiments have provided better insight into physical processes that influence pipeline flotation during sand backfilling. The discharge of the sand-water mixture is dominated by its sedimentation and dispersion, so the model is based on empirical equations and the sedimentation theory. The main conclusion regarding the static force balance on the pipe is that the degree of pipe embedment influences the magnitude of an additional frictional force working downwards on the pipe body. A new approach for assessing this frictional downward force, due to the presence of sand that has deposited, is described and added to the model. In the small-scale experiments, this influence plays a significant role in pipe flotation triggering. An undesirable result from the small-scale experiments are the additional hydrodynamic effects from the fluid in the experimental tank, which are induced by the geometrical constraints. A pipe flotation limit was found in the parameter of sand volume concentration in the surroundings of the pipe. This flotation limit was defined at a domain concentration of approximately 7.5% for the experiments with a pipe specific gravity of 1.03. The boundary of flotation for heavier pipes was not achieved in this research, but evidence points towards a significantly higher flotation limit. The discharge flow rate and the total discharged sand volume are the key factors for development of domain concentration in the small-scale experiments. With the acquired data as a strong foundation, additional research regarding pipe flotation during sand backfilling is recommended. As there is still a strong variation in several important input parameters in the small-scale experiments, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis is suggested to relate the domain concentration to the input parameters at every moment in time. Additional 3D experiments on a larger scale are also recommended to optimise the sand backfilling process and validate the CFD analysis. From this analysis, a prediction can be made regarding the boundary of pipeline flotation on the seabed when discharging with a TSHD. Moreover, additional research regarding the stress and drainage conditions underneath the pipe is proposed to validate the cause and accuracy of the relatively high friction coefficients. Finally, a model could be built to examine the friction force generated on the pipe due to its embedment. With this method, the suggested approach of the frictional resistance due to pipe embedment could be further analysed.","Pipeline flotation; Offshore pipeline; Trailing suction hopper dredger (TSHD); Sand backfilling; Buoyancy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The water levels along the dike of Kampen are affected by the magnitude of the discharge on the IJssel and the water level set-up caused by the wind characteristics on the IJsselmeer. The Kampereiland has been assigned as a retention area to reduce the water levels near Kampen during a storm. This area should store excess water during a storm at the IJsselmeer of a magnitude corresponding to an annual exceedance probability of 1/500, to prevent this water from flowing in the direction of Kampen. The Kampereiland is protected by dike trajectory 225 and a part of this trajectory has been made resistant to the overflow of water. According to new insights, the crest of this dike section seems too high and the Kampereiland inundates less frequently. Furthermore, not sure is whether the water level at Kampen benefits from the inundation of the Kampereiland and what the consequences are for surrounding dikes. The Kamperzeedijk is one of these surrounding dikes and protects the city IJsselmuiden, along with the polder behind. The influence of the crest height of this overflow resistant part on the water levels at Kampen and at IJsselmuiden is investigated. The most important assumptions are that dikes do not breach and that the water level at Kampen remains constant after water flows into the Kampereiland. The influence on the water levels at Kampen and at the Kamperzeedijk is evaluated for multiple crest heights of the overflow resistant dike section. Eventually, these water levels are processed with a statistical model to compute multiple water level exceedance frequency lines for each location and for various chosen crest heights of trajectory 225. The results show that higher crest heights of trajectory 225 lead to increased maximum water levels at the Kamperzeedijk and to lower maximum water levels at Kampen, and vice versa. The water levels in front of the overflow resistant dike section remain unaffected. The return periods for overflow at Kampen and IJsselmuiden are derived by comparing the water level exceedance frequency lines to their individual crest heights. Concluded is that the inundation of the Kampereiland does not immediately lead to a load increase in front of the Kamperzeedijk. A delay is observed as a result of the storage capacity of the Kampereiland. As soon as water from the Kampereiland flows into the Ganzendiep, the loads rapidly increase. Furthermore, concluded is that the Kampereiland is capable of reducing the water levels at Kampen. Based on the results from this research, a crest height of 2.7m +NAP leads to equal return periods for overflow at trajectories 10-2 and 11-2. The reduction of the crest height by ten centimeters increases the return period for overflow at Kampen from 30,000 years to 45,000 years. At the Kamperzeedijk, the return period is reduced from 80,000 years to 45,000 years. In reality, these return periods are also affected by other failure mechanisms. A full dike assessment has to elaborate on this. Furthermore, trajectory 225 is assessed whether it meets its safety standard. It would be more legitimate to assess trajectory 225 by explicitly quantifying its consequences on trajectories 10-2 and 11-2","Kampen; Kamperzeedijk; Dijktraject 225; Kampereiland; Trajectory 225","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.596142,5.836929"

Due to higher flame speeds and lower quenching distances, hydrogen-rich fuel mixtures are prone to boundary layer flashback (BLF), where mixture flow speeds are low compared to the local flow velocity. Research at TU Munich (Eichler 2011) has resulted in new insights into the mechanism of BLF in confined geometries, revealing a strong interaction between the incoming flowfield and the flame. BLF occurs due to flow separation in confined geometries. Studies from Gruber (2012) also confirmed this effect and it was hypothesized that Darrieus Landau (DL) instability can cause the flow separation. Studies from TU Munich also showed increased flashback propensity in the presence of adverse pressure gradient. In this thesis, detailed study of the flow structure in the diffuser is performed. LES simulations are performed for the channel and diffuser and are validated with the results from the literature. First a comparison of subgrid scale models is performed for the channel case. Then, a detailed study of the time resolved structure for the channel and diffuser is performed with the two point correlations and cumulative distribution functions of instantaneous velocity. It has been observed that the turbulent structures are shorter in the diffuser compared to the channel. Then, the relevance of DL instability is investigated in the channel and diffuser geometries. It has been found that DL instability is more prevalent in the diffuser due to decrease in the turbulent frequencies. Together these effects could be the reason for the increased flashback propensity observed in adverse pressure gradient flows.","Gas Turbines; Hydrogen; Combustion Instability; Large Eddy Simulation; Boundary layer flashback","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such battery will be installed under the sea with the purpose to store the surplus power produced by wind turbines in the form of potential energy by filling an elastic bladder, exposed to the ocean pressure, with water. This thesis has two purposes: the first is to create in Simulink a model that can simulate the dynamic behavior of the hydraulic and electric components used for the filling and draining process of the bladder. The second, is to study how the engagement and dispatch protocol of the Battery Management System, applied to different configurations of the electric components, changes the efficiency and the performance of the system. Ultimately, the optimal configuration and protocol are evaluated and decided. <br/>By “Machine Engagement and Dispatch protocol” we define the procedure adopted to determine how many, which and how the units forming the different stacks should be activated and operated given a certain power demand value. The protocols created will indeed communicate the system how many and which machines should operate in full load conditions and how much power the ones operated in partial load should exchange at any instant of time. The study solves the problems of the company which now has a dynamic model able to simulate the behavior of the power exchanging parts of the Ocean Battery and knows what the strengths and the weaknesses of the different configurations and protocols are. An optimal solution for the considered case has been found. Nevertheless, this study does not include the possibility of having more storage units communicating among them which remains an unsolved problem for the company. This further work could possibly be implemented starting from this thesis and using the created Simulink program, which is a new useful tool the company now possesses to progress in its growth.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Strauss, Friedolin (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Traditional fuel system designs do not provide the combination of sucient cooling and low system weight at the Mach 5+ range. Thus, if currently available non-cryogenic propellants are to be employed, an additional heat sink source beyond a simple physical heat sink is required to meet the regenerative cooling demand. The endothermic decomposition reactions of hydrocarbon fuels can provide this additional difference in heat sink. In order to verify the decomposition behavior and heat sinks of JP-8 under both temperature and pressure, a heat exchanger has been designed and built to evaluate fuel cracking decomposition products, both gaseous and liquid. The testing apparatus is intended to provide the expected heat sinks required of an endothermic fuel operating up to Mach 6 free-stream flight at pressures up to 50 bar and temperatures up to 1100 degrees Celsius. The test system measures temperatures and pressures before and after a single-stage tube heater. A series of automatic valves and quick coupling connections is also employed to remove both gaseous and liquid samples for a discrete period of time for subsequent Gas Chromatograph characterization. As the Gas Chromatograph (GC) is newly procured for this DLR project, the manufacturer’s training will need to be finalized before extensive testing and carbon species characterization can proceed. A brief initial GC Simulated Distillation for a liquid sample is shown in the report as well as an initial fuel characterization performed externally by DLR Stuttgart. Upon the conclusion of extensive preliminary testing and a handful of JP-8 tests, it was determined that deposition presents a significant barrier to reaching decomposition temperatures of at least 755 Kelvin [1]. In the first JP-8 test run at maximum heater temperature, the fuel lines were completely blocked with solidified carbon inside the heater. This blockage is likely largely attributable to thermal oxidative deposition but may also include some pyrolytic deposits as well. The remaining tests were run at a lower heater temperature to demonstrate the functionality of the system as time was too limited to mitigate deposition issues experimentally. Fuel temperatures of roughly 630 Kelvin were achieved however further e↵orts to minimize deposition are required before the heater temperatures can be increased to successfully reach decomposition. A simple bulk fuel heat transfer model was also written in Matlab to help predict the increase in the fuel temperature along the length of the tube heater.<br/> Subsequent stages of this multiple year-long DLR project will address the deposition mitigation issues, particularly in the thermal oxidative regime through nitrogen sparging processes to deoxygenate the fuel. With the free oxygen radicals removed below 1 ppm, oxidative deposition can be effectively eliminated [2]. This will require either some modifications to the existing setup to deoxygenate the fuel immediately prior to the test or to deoxygenate the fuel in a storage container under slight pressure of nitrogen. Precise characterization of the oxidative deposition behavior will be particularly useful in understanding the relationship between the temperature and pressure boundary conditions and carbon formation. With the assistance of the Gas Chromatograph, decomposed samples both liquid and gaseous can be analyzed to determine the relationship between the boundary conditions and the decomposition products and heat sinks. This will inform tests with the hope that these cracked samples can eventually be injected and combusted in the scramjet combustion chamber at M11.1.","hypersonic; heat sink; endothermic reaction; cracking; decomposition; catalytic cracking; scramjet; propulsion; cooling; heat exchanger","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Endothermic Heat Sink - DLR Internal Project",""

In the twentieth century, the harbour rapidly grew larger to being the largest harbour in the world for over forty years. The first part of the Maassilo was built in the beginning of the twentieth century. As the harbour grew larger, the Maassilo expanded along, in search for the enormous scale that the harbour gained in this period. Nowadays, the Maassilo is centrally located in the urban neighbourhoods of the city, while the harbour its activity is concentrated further west. Future plans of Rotterdam are to develop the nineteenth and twentieth century harbours into cultural harbour areas. The goal of the project is to (re)connect four different layers with each other: the new users of the Maassilo (makers, collaborators and visitors); everything that is integrated with Rotterdam as a harbour city, especially elements that make the building a ‘machine’; the new local cultural context; and the international cultural context. By connecting these layers, the Maassilo can still be strongly connected with Rotterdam as a harbour city, and at the same time with the new urban, cultural harbour area in the future. The goal is to create space for makers, collaborators and visitors, whose energy and activities are the fuel for this machine building for local and international exchange of culture. The building is divided into three zones, for each group of users, with individual routing for visitors, artists, makers and collaborators. A central hall with daylight, organic shapes and warm materials, adds a warm heart to the rather harsh and cold concrete building, while also connecting the infrastructure and different zones inside the building with the urban infrastructure in the surrounding area. The Maassilo is initially designed for storage and exchange of grain, not for a large amount of visitors. The spaces where used to be infrastructure for (vertical) transport of grain, are reused in this design to make elevators and stairs for the new users. As a visitor to the exposition space, you can experience the route of the grain: visitors travel to the top floors with an elevator and can walk down with a spiralling staircase inside the silos. Even if the exposition space is completely empty, there still is an exposition. The space that visitors move through, is now also exposing the Maassilo. The large amount of silos of the Maassilo are not only interesting to move through as a visitor. The silos also pose interesting opportunities to play with acoustics in the designed music hall and could perhaps play a role in storage of energy as a buffer for the building and the surrounding area. With this design, the Maassilo attempts to be a link between Rotterdam as a port city and the new cultural harbour area in the future. While giving space to different groups of makers, collaborators and visitors, and for (international) exchange of all sorts of cultural activity.","Heritage & Architecture; Rotterdam; Maashaven; Harbour heritage; Cultural Heritage; Culture; Creative Industry; Transformation; Cultural center","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","",""

The methodology makes use of the presented Surrogate Measures of Safety to objectify road safety, by classifying each into three different safety levels. The methodology is presented in a rubric that can be used to assess road safety of conflict situations. The methodology is demonstrated for a case-study in the Netherlands, analyzing 163.5 km of road with a total of 118 conflict situations. For each conflict situation, road safety is assessed and accident risk factors are identified. Common accident risk factors found are reduced visibility of a cyclists’ trajectory path, unclear infrastructure due to missing road surface markings, and infrastructure facilitating visual communication and occasional cyclist traffic violations. Although safety primarily needs to be on-board of AVs, road authorities can improve road safety by providing clear and predictable infrastructure, with good visibility of conflict situations and cyclists’ trajectory paths. Future research should focus on improving the performance of cyclist detection, classification, and trajectory prediction by AVs. Potential conflict situations between AVs and cyclists should be analyzed in more detail to quantify their safety level, and AVs should be trained in conflict situations where cyclists can be encountered.","Automated Vehicles; Cyclist Safety; Surrogate Measures of Safety; Accident Risk Factors; Road Safety; Situation Awareness; Automated Driving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

The building is situated in the Merwe-Vierhavens of the port delta of Rotterdam. It was constructed as a part of the infrastructure that relied on the import and export of Cotton. The position of the Katoenveem in this transit system divines the character of the building. The way the building used to function determines its architecture with innovative installations. The Katoenveem is an architectural object that contributes to the memory of the historical relationship with the harbor. In the development of the cultural program, they attempted to match the preservation of architectural values and the type of use. In order to preserve its industrial scale, interior expression of the concrete structure, the character of the infill needed to be as temporary as possible. This resulted in a contemporary art space where exhibitions change with a wide range of arts. Approaching the former warehouse spaces as one type of use large open spaces arise to match curatorial ambitions and diverse programs of contemporary culture. The exhibition spaces themselves are unprecedented in the Netherlands in terms of scale and character. This museum concept is a result of an alignment between the ambition of future use and the conclusions of the cultural value assessment. The design proposal can be divided into three main types of architectural methods: preservation, intervention, and addition. Each strategy safeguards different elements of Katoenveem’s cultural significance. The restorative approach to the existing fabric consists of restoration, reconstruction, and preservation of its exterior expression. The interventions provide accessibility to the walkways on the 1st floor while extending its durability and safety with a minimal visual impact. The addition is a continuation of the Katoenveem as an ensemble providing all the spaces a museum function needs without compromising on the industrial scale of the interior. The architecture’s concept of this temporary character is embedded in its adaptability and flexibility considering the new and the old. Minimal interventions in the existing fabric allow improvements to its internal climate and functionality. The new building is conceived as an engine for an unique art space facilitating close collaboration between exhibition, curation, and production. For the exhibition spaces in the Katoenveem, an operational framework limits the options of display. Supportive, electrical boundaries determine the place of display and lighting. The new ensemble can accommodate the whole process of art, generating an infrastructure rather than a museum. Therefore the architecture needs to provide the ability to adapt quickly, resulting in an open architecture.","Harbor Heritage; Adaptive Reuse; Contemporary Art; Addition; Rotterdam; Open Architecture; Cultural platform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","","51.90570681452667, 4.426831047743809"

The most important prognostic factor for the survival of advanced-stage ovarian cancer is the complete resection of all microscopic tumour tissue during cytoreductive surgery. Still, even after complete CRS and removal of all visible and palpable tumours, more than two-thirds of women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer experience recurrence due to microscopic residual tumour. Therefore, an intraoperative visualisation technique is of great importance to detect these microscopic tumours. In this pilot study, the feasibility of NIR hyperspectral imaging for the detection of malignant ovarian cancer metastases was evaluated ex vivo. METHOD: Patients with suspected primary ovarian cancer planned for cytoreductive surgery were enrolled in the study. Hyperspectral images from the resected tissue were acquired in the wavelength range of 665-975 nm. All hyperspectral data was preprocessed by image calibration, min-max normalisation and noise filtering. The the most important features were selected before implementing the hyperspectral data in the classifier. The linear SVM, RBF SVM, and a k-NN classifier were used to discriminate malignant ovarian tissue from the surrounding tissue. The performance of the classifier was evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation. RESULTS: Ten patients were included in the study. The linear SVM classifiers had the highest performance with a sensitivity of 0.81, a specificity of 0.75, AUC of 0.83 and MCC of 0.41. Thereafter came the RBF SVM classifier followed by the k-NN classifier. CONCLUSION: This pilot study shows that hyperspectral imaging with the use of a linear SVM classifier is a promising technique to discriminate malignant ovarian tissue from the surrounding tissue. Hyperspectral imaging can scan a whole area, is fast, non-contact, non-invasive and can be used inside the operation room. However, before HSI can be implemented in real practice, further validation is required in vivo and technical enhancements need to be made such as enlarging the training data set, evaluate the SWIR wavelength range, include a registration algorithm which accounts for elastic deformation of the tissue, evaluate several feature selection methods, and compare other classifiers.","Hyperspectral imaging; ovarian cancer; classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-01-25","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Vibration energy harvesting is a promising step towards a more sustainable society. The world is getting more and more connected through electronic devices, which all require electrical energy. A battery can deliver electrical energy; however, such a battery needs to be replaced or recharged; this is where energy harvesters become interesting. Energy harvesters convert energy from ambient sources to electricity; this source can be, for example, solar or thermal energy but also vibrational energy. Extensive research has been done in vibrational energy harvesting so far. The subject of human motion energy harvesting is increasing interest. An energy harvester for human motion can be used to power health monitoring devices. However, there is one significant problem; human motions are dominantly low-frequency with high amplitude motions, while energy harvesters tend to work better on high frequencies. A limiting factor for successful experimental research is the equipment. The lack of sufficient stroke, controlled and low-frequency excitation impede research regarding human motion. In this research, a new test setup is developed for experimental research. A linear air-bearing stage is used to reproduce the human motions with an amplitude up to 500 mm. The air-bearing stage has an incremental encoder to ensure a precision of at least 20 µm. This stage may be used for many different testing situations ranging from vibration testing to impact testing. The stage can reproduce motions that were impossible to reproduce with a shaker, for example. The research is expanded with a nonlinear oscillator to assess its performance on large amplitude motions. A transducer can be attached to the oscillator to transduce the vibrational energy into electrical energy. By using an oscillator, the frequency is increased, causing a higher energy output at low frequencies. The dynamics of the nonlinear oscillator are numerically calculated. For which a new method is proposed to simulate the bouncing behavior in the spring numerically, called the bounce loss coefficient. The new method shows better results than the traditional model used to simulate the bouncing behavior (coefficient of restitution). The numerical model is experimentally verified on the newly developed testing setup. It was shown that using a new model for the bouncing behavior, the dynamical behavior of the nonlinear oscillator can be reproduced when excited at a large amplitude motion.","Energy harvesting; nonlinear dynamics; large amplitude vibrations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-25","","","","","",""

In order to make the obtained system of equations solvable, it is assumed that the air density and pressure follow the International Standard Atmosphere relations and that the wind speed is constant over time. Additionally, it is assumed that the gravity force is constant, that the air is incompressible and that there is no wind speed variation in x- and y-direction.<br/>If the additional assumption of no vertical wind speed is made, then the relations simplify to the Ekman equations of motion, which result in the Ekman spiral. Not making this additional assumption results in a system of equations that can be solved exactly or using asymptotic matching. As expected, the solution that was derived using asymptotic matching approaches the exact solution.<br/>The derived relation is compared to wind speed relations from literature, such as the log law, the profile by Gryning, the profile by Peña and the profile by Kelly. It appears that the log law performs best in terms of simplicity and accuracy, but a final conclusion cannot yet be drawn. Additional research is recommended into what types of locations can be accurately represented by the derived relation and into what input data is required and obtainable in order to increase the accuracy of the wind speed predictions by the theoretical profiles.","wind shear; asymptotic matching","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The best performing Gaussian process and artificial neural network are applied as surrogate in a model that optimizes a trajectory from Earth to Mars using a differential evolution optimization strategy. The performance of the models is evaluated on both the Euclidean distance between the inputs corresponding to the predicted minima of the surrogate method and the nearest local minimum obtained with the shaping method, and the accuracy of the predicted Δ푉 budget required. For both quantities, the Gaussian process outperforms the artificial neural network.

In this thesis, a newly developed method (Correia et al. 2014; Boue et al. 2016) to deal with tidal interactions in a 2D two body problem is validated and for the first time applied to Solar system dynamics on a short time-scale. This method uses a Maxwell rheology for the tidally perturbed body, to calculate the instantaneous deformation of the body with a differential equation at the same time as its position, spin vector and orientation. The coupling between the translational, rotational, and tidal dynamics is incorporated in a consistent way, taking into account the frequency dependency of classical tidal parameters. The coupled model is more general and is in contrast to currently used models valid for every eccentricity, spin rate and orientation. The model is applied to the Mars-Phobos and Earth-Moon systems and the tides are determined separately on both the central as the satellite body in various propagations. Several parameters of tidal effects of these systems are obtained and compared with currently available literature approximations and currently used tidal models. The instantaneous deformation of the tidal body and the evolution of the system's orbit for the tides on the primary compare to the literature approximations and currently used direct tidal force model (Lainey et al. 2007). However, the coupled model displays behaviour of the tidal time lag and angle, which are accompanied with the deformation, that cannot be captured by the classical method. Small differences between final states of the coupled model and the direct tidal force model are obtained that could potentially be important in future space missions and ephemeris determination. The tides on the locked secondary show a larger difference between the coupled model and the current tidal direct force models (Lainey et al. 2007; Lari et al. 2018) in the case of an existing libration. Phobos has such a libration and huge differences in evolution of the states and orbit are found. The coupled model's evolution values can be partly justified by the theoretical work of Efroimsky et al. (2018) that states the additional dissipation in these bodies with large librations. Altogether, currently used methods or literature approximations can still be used for inaccurate propagations. However, for more accurate propagations, and for bodies with large physical librations, it rewards to switch to a coupled method. Especially when regarding the tides on the satellite body a coupled model is beneficial.","Tidal dynamics; Maxwell model; Tidal evolution; Libration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

A sectional base, large floating plinth, and towers connect water and city with a programmatic cut and add urban scale to the river. Urban program is loaded onto the river by introduction of a boat-in cinema, a Maaspodium opening towards the water, and multiple pools and piers.

A weather radar is one of the instruments to measure rainfall by reflected microwave signal from raindrops. However, the rainfall rate estimated by weather radar has various errors as it is an indirect measurement of rain. One type of errors relates to the measurement of other objects than raindrops and noise. These objects are termed clutter and represent buildings, trees, airplanes, birds, insects, … One type of techniques mitigates clutter and noise using polarimetric measurements in the spectral domain. This methodology, spectral polarimetric processing, can be reinforced by digital image processing techniques. Image segmentation is the image processing technique chosen due to its similar objectives with spectral polarimetric processing. There are two major challenges for this project. The first one is to search and design effective methods with the help of image segmentation techniques to remove clutter and noise while retaining precipitation. Most of the image segmentation studies were done to tackle images from other areas which have different features from compared to Range-Doppler spectrograms. The methods from image segmentation should be thoroughly tested before being applied. Another problem to be resolved is to assess the techniques applied without any ground truth data. And those methods used in previous studies may not be suitable for testing large data sets. A framework is proposed to understand and quantify the features of polarimetric spectrograms which can be useful for tackling the two challenges. Then, a new filtering technique, criteria for good results and evaluation methods are proposed based on the framework. Three different filtering techniques are tested by the evaluation methods in different scenarios.

There is a lack of places for residents to connect with each other and with their built environment. The zones between the private and public domain, the transition zones of the ‘General Expansion Plan’ aren’t enabling or encouraging residents to appropriate, modify or participate in them. This graduation focusses on finding out what conditions enable the use of and give quality to the transition zones and will be the starting point for revitalizing a neighbourhood. The design question was: ‘How could the design of new transitional zones between the private and public domain of the infill, support and tissue level, enable and encourage appropriation, modification and participation in the Lodewijk van Deysselbuurt, in order to improve the solidarity between current and new residents and their attachment with the built environment?’ The research was oriented towards Open Building projects. The focus was on the participation of residents on various levels of the design process and the measures that are integrated to enable residents to change parts of the building to their preferences and also the process of enabling this and processing it up till today. How were the residents involved in the design process and after the completion? Did the residents make use of this possibility to change? And how was this managed? The research question was: ‘How is the Open Building concept over time enabling and encouraging residents to appropriate, modify and participate in the transition zones of the support and tissue level?’ The result of the research paper together with a project site analyses created conditions for the design phase. The relation between research and design can be found in the physical and non-physical elaboration of the project. The outcome of the research created both physical and non-physical conditions to use in future Open Building projects, of which this project is one. The translation was done by relating it to the specific site. The conditions for transition zones of future Open Building projects are: 1. Create predestined transition zones with pre-designed frameworks that are subject to policy. 2. Early involvement and participation on multiple levels will clarify ones responsibilities and possibilities within that framework. 3. Communication between owners, users and committees lead to a shared valuation and affinity of collectiveness. This will result in a balance between privacy and interaction that origins from the users themselves. My role as an architect was to create a framework with boundaries and regulations in which users can participate, appropriate and modify. A framework is, a space or zone, in which regulations, rules for certain actors and factors apply. At the same time it is important to give freedom to the users, but also create a coherency for the building and its community. Four different zones can be distinguished: the collective, circulation, entrance and outdoor spaces. These spaces are housed in a basic wooden construction. To visualize the responsibilities and possibilities of the various actors related to the various phases of a project, from the pre-design up to the future, a scheme was created.","Transformation; Open Building; transition zones; Appropriation; Modification; Participation; Reassess","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","One million homes","52.37820696985133, 4.811999185244851"

(mentor); Tonnaer, Rik (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The aerospace industry increasingly uses fibre-reinforced plastics that are manufactured using automated fibre placement (AFP). A common problem in AFP is the occurrence of gaps and overlaps that affect the structural perfromance of laminates. Tow width fluctuation is an important cause of gaps and overlaps. Two developments in manufacturing are combined to create a new mitigation method for gaps and overlaps. One development is fibre steering, which harnesses the flexibility of AFP to vary the fibre orientation within the ply. Another development is smart manufacturing which includes responding real-time to changes. The combination is local fibre steering which compensates for tow width fluctuation by placing tows adjacent to each other. In three steps it is assesed how effective local fibre steering is in increasing the structural performance of composite laminates by reducing gaps and overlaps through compensating for tow width fluctuation in automated fibre placement. Firstly, it is determined to what extent gaps and overlaps are reduced by constructing a conventional and a steered laminate. The tow width is modelled using a cubic spline. The steered laminate uses numerical approximations of the equations for parallel parametric curves. Two problems occurs that are: the accumulation of curvature leading to self-intersections and cusps, and large angle deviations. The curvature accumulation is tackled by using smoothing splines and the fibre angle deviation can be limited by taking a weighted average. Secondly, the tow width model is validated by measuring the tow width of two different materials. Thirdly, the effect of the reduction in gaps and overlaps and the fibre angle deviation on the structural performance is determined by using a finite element method based on the defect layer method that calculated the buckling load and the effective stiffness. Results show that gaps and overlaps cannot be completely eliminated but local fibre steering is able to increase the effective stiffness.","Aerospace Composite Structures; Automated Fibre Placement; Smart Manufacturing; Industry 4.0","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

For many of us, a regular day can feel like running on a treadmill. This results in fast, restricted and shallow breathing throughout the day. Whereas, the right breathing rhythm can have a profound impact on our (mental) well being and overall happiness. It is argued that habituating deep breathing exercises is a promising solution to increase stress resilience. This explorative study aims to find a productisable solution for habituating breathwork meditation. The proposed solution (Sensescape) is supported with a novel, yet ‘grounded’ theory. The working principle of the product is validated with several small scale user tests and experiments. Furthermore, market potential was explored via market analysis, business modelling and strategic roadmapping. It is argued that Sensescape is able to differentiate itself from the competition by building a closed-loop-system in horizon 2 and a focus on first-responders in horizon 3. A brand identity was crafted based on those insights. Sensescape, is a handheld meditation device to guide breathing, through haptic and light feedback. Soothing vibrations will bounce between two handheld pulsators, to orchestrate the right breathing pattern. This will help you to ‘get out of your head’ and unwind from everyday stress. On top of that, the immersive tactile effect will naturally grab your attention and sustain focus during a meditative session. An extensive literature review was performed on the areas of neural entrainment, tactile vibrations, rumination and the art of breathing. These areas formed the foundation for the building of the novel grounded-theory. It was found that; bilateral tactile phantom sensations lead to easy neural entrainment. This phenomenon is exploited in the working principle of the product to create a natural point of focus. The physical sensations will help disrupt negative thought flow.

(mentor); Heurkens, E.W.T.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Netherlands has a wide range of partnerships in urban area (re)development, which differ greatly from one another and can be deployed depending on the local situation, scope, parties involved and state of the economy. Over the past decades, these models have grown and been evaluated within the context of rapidly changing social planning development, with the government increasingly leaving implementation to the market. As a result, private parties have built up considerable land positions in the expectation of being able to realize them in the long term. Land ownership provides a significant dominant position, given that the landowner has the right to (re)develop. When there are several landowners, this fragmented land ownership can be an important barrier to urban area redevelopment. Before the economic crisis, many areas were transformed by being all properties of one party. The development rights model and the joint venture model were often used to solve the problem of fragmented ownership. Both models require a large capital requirement from the initiators of transformation, as in both cases all land (and buildings) have to be acquired in the plan area (Hobma, Heurkens, &amp; van der Wal, 2019). Since the crisis, the acquisition of land and buildings for transformation has been approached differently. A possible strategy applied in urban area redevelopment with fragmented ownership is: Developing Apart Together (DAT). The partnership DAT offers both public and private parties the opportunity to retain land for area redevelopment. In which the initiating party sets out a vision for the redevelopment of an area, but does not ending up by owning the area. Surprisingly little information is available about the partnership DAT. What can be found is limited exclusively to vague definitions. Therefore, the aim of this research is to provide insight into the experiences of public and private parties with the DAT partnership This includes providing insight into the relationship and agreements made between the two parties. It also provides insight into how the parties can fulfil both the area redevelopment project and deal with fragmented ownership. This is done by answering the following main question: “What insights does an initial study of the start-up phase of developing apart together (DAT) provide?”. Two research methods were central to this research. The study started with a literature review and followed by an empirical research. From the literature it can be concluded that the insights concerning DAT are limited. As far as the characteristics are concerned, DAT is described in the literature as a public-private partnership in which a common general vision has been drawn up. There is no strong governance structure and land transactions are limited. The literature also shows that within a DAT model there is an area organisation that takes care of issues that cross plots. In practice, these characteristics are partly similar, but other issues are also specifically mentioned. The shared vision and/or desire to transform corresponds with the literature. On the other hand, the use of anterior agreements is often mentioned and turns out to be an important part of the financial and legal agreements within a DAT model and something that is not mentioned in the literature. Another thing that is not mentioned in the literature either, but which emerges several times in practice, is the number of agreements made for social facilities. Literature and practice correspond well with regard to the conditions for applying a DAT. From the literature it became clear that these are transformation areas with fragmented ownership. In other words, there are many different owners present in the area. This is confirmed in practice. It is emphasised in the literature that the public and private parties form a coalition of the willing. This is not mentioned in practice. In terms of variants, literature and practice also correspond. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned here that DAT is still at a too early stage to be able to conclude whether there are actually different variants and where they differ and/or correspond. In both literature and practice the pace at which area developments are progressing is described as low. Because many parties are involved within such area developments with different ambitions and interests, plans are less likely to get off the ground. This is also recognized in practice as an important barrier. In the literature, non-cooperating parties are seen as an obstacle. This is not specifically mentioned in practice. In practice, however, the distrust towards the public parties is mentioned. Municipalities do not seem to have confidence because they often fail to keep their agreements. Finally, the difference in knowledge in which this cooperation is based is named as an obstacle by the many different parties.","urban area development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","fragmented ownership",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The development of a wind farm is a highly sophisticated task, whereby many stakeholders are involved and several unique disciplines come together to form a whole. Commonly, the unique disciplines are optimized individually which leads to sub-optimal windfarm designs. Therefore, it is of great importance that an interdisciplinary approach is used to overcome sub-optimal designs and that they work together to accomplishing a common objective. To capture the interdisciplinary dynamics of the different disciplines, a Systems Engineering (SE) approach is used. This approach makes it possible to design the wind farm in an agile manner, whereby the in- and outputs, from the different disciplines, are coupled to accomplish a combined objective. The foundation of systems engineering in this report is the Multidisciplinary Design Analysis and Optimization (MDAO). The MDAO framework includes models for various disciplines in a wind farm, such as the wake aerodynamics, rotor nacelle assembly, support structure, cabling, etc. The MDAO framework facilitates system-level analysis by capturing interdisciplinary interactions - both implicit and explicit - to analyze the system for a particular objective. The research objective of this thesis is to determine the effect of up-scaling on the optimum design of an offshore wind farm for different drive train configurations. This is done by constructing engineering models and implementing these in the MDAO framework. The analysis will specifically focus on the three configurations: Doubly Fed Induction Generator with a 3-stage gearbox (DFIG - 3S), Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator with direct drive (PMSG - DD), and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator with 1-stage gearbox (PMSG - 1S). The implementation of the updated models, will contribute to the dissemination of knowledge on the utility of the MDAO framework, whereby the process of selecting the optimal drive train configuration will become easier. Alongside, the updated models implemented in the framework will result in better cost predictions and therefore a wind turbine size closer to the optimum will emerge. At first, the missing links of the current drive train models are tackled by the implementation of the higher fidelity engineering models. This is done for the generator and gearbox of the three drive trains configurations. The updated engineering models assure better estimations of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) and therefore a better estimation of the optimum wind turbine size in offshore wind farms. Once the models were updated, the framework was run for two case studies: a far offshore wind farm and a nearshore wind farm. This leads to an optimum wind turbine size in the range of 4 to 6 MW. The optimal wind turbine sizes for the different configurations are very close to each other. The DFIG - 3S configuration is the most economical option, followed by the PMSG - 1S configuration, thereafter the PMSG - DD configuration. The sequences applied for both the wind farms that were analyzed and for all scales when upscaling the wind turbine. The PMSG - 1S is a promising configuration, whereby further cost reductions in the permanent magnets is expected and further optimization and integration of the power electronics is possible. The optimum power densities for both wind farms were similar, whereby the spreading in power density was large. The optimal wind turbine size when upscaling was found for power densities from 200 to 400 W/m2. In the far offshore wind farm, the optimal configuration was a 6MW DFIG - 3S wind turbine with a power density of 290 W/m2. The optimum power density in the nearshore wind farm was 209 W/m2 for a 4MW PMSG - DD wind turbine.","Multi-Disciplinary Optimisation; Offshore wind turbine; Upscaling; Drive train","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Langelaar, M. (graduation committee); van der Linden, L.P.L. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","As of writing this thesis little research has been done in truss layout optimization for multiple design alternatives. A hybrid scheme is proposed in which the fast gradient-based search of the Ground Structure Method (GSM) is employed for the search of optimal topology and size, while a population-based meta-heuristic algorithm explores the non-convex parameter space of geometry optimization. The scheme works by employing a meta-heuristic algorithm to optimize the nodal coordinates of a truss structure where for each iteration and each member of the population a small-scale (i.e. problems with a small number of degrees of freedom) GSM is performed, in order to obtain the optimal topology for the given nodal locations. Three variants of the scheme based on three different meta-heuristic algorithms are developed: Firstly, an Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) variant are developed in combination with an original topology identification method, to extract design alternatives from the solutions found throughout the optimization process. The developed topology identification method identifies different design alternatives based on topological differences by making use of existing graph isomorphism testing algorithms from graph theory. Additionally, the topology identification method employs a multi-step filtering process to prevent members which are non-critical to the performance of the structure to influence the design alternative selection process. Finally, a Multi-Species Particle Swarm optimization (MSPSO) variant is developed without the need for a topology identification method. For all methods convergence speed in terms of number of iterations, topological variety and computation time per iteration have been evaluated and are compared. Of the developed methods, the ABC variant converges fastest towards a single good solution, however the topological variety is lacking. The slower converging MSPSO variant produces solutions with moderate topological variety, as well as reasonable material volumes. The PSO variant requires the least computation time per iteration of the developed methods. Its produced topological variety is closer to that of the ABC than the MSPSO variant and it has a slightly faster convergence speed than the MSPSO variant. Direct usage of the MOSEK API is made instead of the more commonly used CVXPY API which reduces GSM problem setup times for small-scale (28 degrees of freedom) problems by a factor of 13. Computation times for the hybrid method, from start to finish, for 3D structures with 4 to 8 movable nodes (12 to 24 geometric degrees of freedom) range from 15 to 50 seconds on standard desktop PC hardware. Because of the multiple design alternative nature of the hybrid method, and consequently the end-user does not require fast back-to-back optimization runs, these computation times are deemed acceptable. It is concluded that while in its current state the methods based on the hybrid scheme are unlikely to be suitable for usage in practice, further developments in methods to distinguish design alternatives could make the hybrid scheme, in particular the ABC variant, useful in the design of more material efficient truss structures.","Ground Structure Method; Layout Optimization; Topology Optimization; Meta-heuristic; Hybrid Optimization; Structural Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

This property is used in many fields like physics, biology and chemistry, to model various system behaviours, for instance: circadian rhythms in the chemistry of the eyes \cite{Rompala2007}. <br/>\newline\noindent This thesis focuses on synchronisation and entanglement in systems consisting of quantum Van der Pol oscillators. After looking at the exemplary properties of the classical VdP oscillator, it follows the methods of \cite{EshaqiSani2020} to explore the behaviour of two coupled QVdPOs, quantum Van der Pol oscillators, using Monte Carlo simulations for trajectories of this system. The system is then expanded to three-oscillator systems with all-to-all and chain coupling. The validity of the extension of the properties found in two QVdPOs in \cite{EshaqiSani2020} with regard to synchronisation and entanglement is tested. Does an Arnold tongue, the region of parameters for which a system shows synchronisation, still exist and if so has its shape changed? Do synchronisation and strong entanglement still show a positive correlation? \newline\noindent Simulations of the 2-oscillator system gave results which were just slightly different from those obtained in\cite{EshaqiSani2020}, validating the occurrence of synchronisation within the Arnold tongue and showing a positive correlation between synchronisation and entanglement of the system. Both the 3-oscillator systems showed synchronisation as well in their respective Arnold tongues, which were increasingly smaller for the all-to-all coupled and the chain coupled system when compared to the 2-oscillator system. Overall, the amount of synchronisation, shown in three oscillators was very close to the amount shown in two oscillators when strongly coupled and just a little less for weak coupling. The correlation between synchronisation and strong entanglement was also found for three oscillators, though for weaker coupling the chain coupled system showed a little more entanglement than before.","quantum; van der pol; Oscillator; Monte Carlo Simulation; synchronization; Entanglement; trajectory","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

An indoor velodrome, minimizing the environmental effects, could be a suitable location for quick, reliable, and easy measurements on cyclist CdA. However, the effect of banked straights and bends on the CdA determination remains unclear. The goal of this study is to investigate how the track geometry impacts the CdA measurements. Two methods for the calculation of CdA where compared, one that does and one that does not take track characteristics into account. For the measured CdA, no difference between the two methods was found. Additionally, a moderate intraclass correlation was found between the two methods and the drag measured in a wind tunnel (method 1: ICC = 0.76, method 2: ICC = 0.77). A difference in drag of 7.6 Watts and more at a speed of 50 km/h was found to be accurately measured by both methods. In the bends, a significantly lower power output was found, resulting in a different CdA value between the bends and straights. This difference remains after taking the track characteristics into account. It can be concluded that for velodrome aerodynamic drag measurements, the banking and bends do not have to be considered. In this study, no conclusion can be drawn on the found differences in CdA between the bends and the straights. Future research could determine whether these differences are due to incomplete dynamics or a real difference in aerodynamics.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Boess, S.U. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The consequences of climate change are becoming visible more and more, also in The Netherlands. Most people consider the environment to be important and want to act sustainable, but they find it hard to really take action. “Where should I start?” “What is actually sustainable and what not?” “What can I do within my budget?” are questions that arise. As a designer, I became aware of the overflow of products that are meant to make our lives better but at the same time harm the environment, which motivated me towards this graduation project. Research shows that stuff scores the highest in the impact top 10 of the average Dutch consumer (Porcelijn, 2017). Therefore, the initial goal of this project was to make consumers aware of the impact their purchases have on the environment and stimulate them to buy less. Literature research is done towards our shopping behaviour and what can be done to motivate sustainable behaviour related to the purchase of product. This research revealed that, in the long term, activating intrinsic motivation is more successful than providing extrinsic motivation in the form of rewards for example. One way to stimulate intrinsic motivation of consumers to act more environmental friendly is to give them positive feedback about the sustainable behaviour already performed. This enlarges their environmental self-identity, which is defined as: the extend to which one sees him/her self as a sustainable person. (van der Werff, 2016). Since the effect of the positive feedback is bigger when feedback is given on multiple categories of sustainable behaviour (such as waste, energy usage, transportation etc.) instead of one category, a shift in this project is made from products alone towards more sustainable behaviour in general. Thereafter, existing initiatives to stimulate sustainable behaviour are evaluated by comparing them to the findings in the literature research and interviews are held to get a more clear image of consumer experiences. Based on this research, three possible design directions are being presented and the direction of positive feedback is chosen. The final goal of this project is defined as motivating consumers to act more sustainable<br/>by enlarging the environmental self-identity with positive feedback on sustainable behaviour from the past. The second phase is the ideation phase where in which brainstorms are done for possible solutions towards the chosen direction. A generative session is organised to involve the target group in the design process. With the results and insights of the brainstorm and this session, three concepts are formed which are formed and tested by the use of Google forms. The results are evaluated and the concept of sustainable art is chosen, whereby the user tracks his/her sustainable behaviour by creating an artwork on the wall. In the third phase, iterations are made to the concept and two more tests are executed, whereby the concept developed into the final design: SusA. SusA is designed to make the user more conscious about their sustainable behaviour, and provide positive feedback for all the sustainable actions by creating an artwork on the wall. It stimulates interaction between the user and house mates and/or guests, and makes users aware of how much of a sustainable person they already are. The product comes with an smart phone application, where pictures and tips can be shared with friends, statistics of one’s sustainable behaviour can be found and inspiration for sustainable actions in the different categories is available. To conclude, suggestions are given to introduce SusA to the market, the concept is evaluated and recommendations are made for further research and development.","Design; Sustainability; Sustainable behaviour; Design for behaviour change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Were people have had gas hobs for a long time it is now changing to cooking on induction. Cooking on gas will be banned from 2050 on and is disappearing already. The way induction hobs are implemented at the moment is with a glass plate on top while still taking up space on the countertop like with a gas hob. Boretti thought of a solution to use another kind of ceramics able to have the looks of all kinds of materials like marble or nature stone. The concept provided by Boretti at the starting point of this graduation project was a standalone oven with this induction hob solution on top. The assignment was to create a version totally integrated into the countertop since the whole countertop can be made of the same ceramics. To make a design that fits the needs of possible user groups, fit with the trends at the moment and in the future and suit the ways of living from 2021 on, an analysis was performed. Main conclusions were the shift in the marketing Boretti has to make., the change of the way people are living, house are becoming more open, smaller houses in cities are getting more expensive and multifunctionality of space with also making more connection between living room and kitchen are trends to take into account. This results in design changes in kitchen blocks, the need for better air circulation and purifying and multifunctionality in countertop space. The analysis was followed by an ideation phase in which partial problems were tackled with different solutions. The topics ideated on were the user interface, multifunctionality cooking zone indications and the integration possibilities of a combined air extractor and air purifier. This ideation resulted in three different concepts were combinations of partial solutions were made. After making three different concepts, two were combined. The new combined concept has an accessory bar that breaks up the countertop surface into a living part and a cooking part. This accessory bar has space for a range of simple accessories to things like a Boretti water tap. Personalisable Qi charging spots can be chosen while the consumer configures the countertop. To make sure the surface above the cooking zones can be used totally for other purposes, the control interface is not fixed. This interface is a smart rotational knob with which all cooking zones can be controlled. The final concept is a kitchen island version is worked out in detail. The control knob has a light ring which refers to a gas burner and has haptic and visual feedback for the intensity of the selected zone. The main USPs are the multifunctionality and styling made possible with the material, an improved orientation during cooking and the smart knob. Since there will be differences in the needs and configurations consumers will want to have for this concept. A range of product is suggested to Boretti around this concept.","Induction; Kitchen; Ceramics; Smart product; Cooktop","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

They allow for large amplitude oscillations between their stable equilibria, from which much energy can be generated. However, the stable equilibria are separated by a potential energy barrier that has to be overcome. Therefore, we cannot guarantee these oscillations, and the performance advantage diminishes. As a solution to this, a novel method of stiffness compensation in compliant bistable mechanisms is explored to lower the potential barrier. This method makes use of interaction between the buckling modes. Whereas this phenomenon is most undesired in structures due to their increasing proneness to catastrophic failure, we cleverly use it to our advantage. During the deflection required for the large amplitude oscillations, a transition between these buckling modes occurs, causing the increase in potential energy. By bringing the corresponding buckling loads closer together, the transition is eased and the potential barrier is lowered. An analytical framework was set up as a fundamental test of this method. Using a discrete analytical model of a bistable buckled four-bar linkage with torsion springs, it was shown that the potential barrier can be flattened upon matching the first two critical buckling loads, resulting in static balancing. This was achieved by making two torsion springs three times stiffer with respect to the other two springs. To put theory into practice, three compliant mechanisms were designed using the ratio between the first two buckling loads. Their force-deflection characteristics were experimentally determined and it was shown that the stiffness may be tuned according to the ratio between the buckling loads. Furthermore, it was shown that in designs having the first two buckling loads equal to each other, near zero stiffness is achieved. Hence, this method is proven a successful addition to the arsenal of methods in stiffness compensation and static balancing of compliant mechanisms.","Stiffness compensation; Compliant mechanisms; Buckling; Vibration Energy Harvesting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Precision and Microsystems Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In practice, many structures among which quay walls are designed according the Dutch national guidelines (CUR). Dutch national practical guidelines (NPR), with guidelines for renovation, is still in development for the building industry. These guidelines follow the Dutch Norms (NEN) and Annexes. The guidelines propose procedures in which newly-built or existing quay walls are designed. This study investigates the effects of past performance on the semi-probabilistic level I method for the purpose of design and evaluation of quay walls. This research is performed with a case study considering a CUR class III quay wall from. The objective of this research is gathering insight into the different aspects of past performance, among which degradation and information about survived years, on the reliability level and corresponding influence factors. Firstly, prior analyses including deterministic validation are performed. The output resulting from characteristic values of the cross-section is validated by means of Blum and analyses with the subgrade reaction method. The computed deterministic output appears to be in accordance with the results from the reference study. Afterwards, prior probabilistic analyses were performed in which the reliability, weight factors and corresponding partial safety factors are reconsidered. Failure mechanism ’yielding of front wall’ is a frequent phenomenon and is assessed in this research. Level II FORM is used for the calculation and level III Importance sampling for the validation. The cross-section is adjusted according the reference case and the results are reasonably in compliance with the results found by GeoDelft for CUR class III. The computed 50 year reliability index β = 4.53 and corresponds well to the target reliability level of β<sub>t</sub> = 4.5. Additionally, the situation in which random input variables are correlated and model uncertainty is included, is considered as well. These correlations and model uncertainty are determined based on previous researches among which. The cohesion of clay, internal friction angles, wall friction angles and water levels are correlated. The model uncertainty factor is lognormally distributed and applies as multiplication factor on the maximum bending moment. Explicitly, the latter results in a significant influence on the limit state. Effects given the reference period are considered as well. Large numbers of the dominant load variable q are simulated. The (extreme value) distribution converges to a Gumbel distribution with σ = 0.61. The stochastic distribution of the dominant load is transformed from and to different reference periods: 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 years. Eventually, for posterior analyses the 50 year reference case is translated to an annual situation in which the annual reliability index and sensitivity factors are derived. Including model uncertainty and cross correlated random variables, one finds a reliability index β = 2.33 as assumption for the posterior analyses. The Equivalent Planes method (EPM) has already been applied in the field of flood defences for reliability updating. This method formulates an failure plane equivalent to two or more combined limit states. In this research, the method has been applied in the temporal context. This means that the Equivalent Planes method is considered in the derivation of the reliability given effect(s) of past performance. The annual reliability index and sensitivity factors are used in this reliability updating method. The autocorrelation represents the correlation of the concerned variable in time. Time-dependent variables including uniform load and water levels assume an auto-correlation of 0, other parameters initially assume an auto-correlation equal to 1. The annual reliability index and sensitivity values are iteratively applied in this method for combining limit states. The equivalent failure plane Z uses a simplified expression in the standard normal space. Eventually a time-dependent reliability curve, as presented by the green line in figure 1, is found. Without model uncertainty, the blue curve is obtained. A higher initial annual reliability index results in a relatively smaller increase of the conditional reliability index. Hence, the effect of past performance decreases when a higher start value of the reliability index is used. Due to the reduced cross-correlation between the water levels on both sides, the time-dependent reliability significantly increases. At last, the time-related effects of quay walls are considered. These effects include: <br/><br/>• The irreducible time-dependent uncertainty related to the model uncertainty factor. Randomness or natural variation is included in the model uncertainty factor. This is performed by considering situations with a reduced autocorrelation ρ(Z<sub>i</sub>, Z<sub style=""font-size: 10px;"">j</sub>) (0.25, 0.50 and 0.75). The reducible time-dependent uncertainty of load variables including q, w<sub>a</sub> and w<sub>p</sub>. Knowledge uncertainties (epistemic uncertainties) are reducible in time, meaning autocorrelation approaching 1. The autocorrelations of the considered variables distributions are derived by using transformed random distributions. <br/><br/>• Degradation by corrosion of the stiffest elements in the steel front wall. Corrosion is studied by considering the effects of a log normally distributed wall thickness loss according to corrosion curve 3. This corrosion rate affects the primary element characteristics of the equivalent combined wall. The correlation between the water levels on the active and passive is reconsidered and changed from 0.75 to 0.25. <br/><br/><br/>As follows, the below figures show the annual development of the annual reliability as a function of time t. Notice that the annual reliability index increases as the extent to which the uncertainty is epistemic increases. Further, the reliability converges less rapid to larger value(s) in case of auto-correlation approaching 0. In this research, corrosion is considered as an epistemic uncertainty. Two modelling approaches have been considered: an engineering approach, a second order approach. The engineering approach solely considers a reducing section modulus W, whereas the second order approach is additionally including the second moment of inertia I. Corrosion curve 3 results in both approaches to a flattening of the conditional reliability index as time progresses. In addition, the speed in which the influence of time-independent epistemic uncertainties decreases, is less in case of corrosion. Hence, the involvement of stochastic degradation negatively affects the extent to which the uncertainties are reducible. The updated reliability index is also calculated per reference period. This is performed with probabilistic calculation rules. The corresponding sensitivity values, given survival of previous years (see figure(s) 5), can be used in the semi-probabilistic level I method for derivation of the updated partial safety factors. These factors can be applied in the derivation of the design values per random variable considering a service life time t. Hence, the reliability of a quay wall and the transformed sensitivity coefficients can be updated with the Equivalent Planes method. Incorporation of degradation and other time-related effects is seemingly possible. However, further research with finite element modelling is recommended for verification purposes.","Reliability; Quay walls; FORM; Reliability analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""

(mentor); Ghotge, R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In a world where electricity demands are progressively growing along with the worsening climate crisis, it is essential to conduct research and build systems that can meet this demand in a sustainable, reliable and cost effective manner. The building sector accounts for nearly 40% of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU, this is primarily due to the dependence on fossil fuels to provide heat for spaces, heating water and for cooking. Countries have made ambitious goals to reduce these emissions, and one such way is electrification. By electrifying heating, some research suggests that all the Renewable Energy Sources (RES) planned to be deployed in the Netherlands will not be suffcient to meet the demand, even with storage technologies. There are multiple ways to address this problem, one of them is decentralising energy production such that each household or institution accounts for their own production and consumption of energy. While this is in theory a simple solution, in the higher latitudes becomes harder during the colder months to meet the increased electricity demand using only renewable sources. Thus, a combination of them must be used to combat the effects of seasonal RES production. Simultaneously, the wholesale electricity prices in the Netherlands are also projected to increase in the near future, to almost 57e/MWh. Universities being large load customers, will feel the effects of this increase in electricity prices and the need for heating electrification by 2030. This need could be due to policy implementations or personal choice. It is in the benefit of the university to increase their self-sufficiency, to decrease costs and carbon emissions. Thus, a microgrid is proposed for a university in the Netherlands. This microgrid, utilises on-site Photovoltaics (PV) generation, Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) in the capacity of back up generation and a battery to store any excess energy generated by the PV system. In order to ensure the smooth integration of the components mentioned, an energy management system is designed. Furthermore, a new value proposition is made for the energy storage system where it is utilised during times of high electricity prices. For the energy management system two control strategies are proposed with different end goals; one based solely on increasing self-sufficiency, while the other is based on decreasing costs. A comparison is made to understand when each control returns the most benefits and what exactly these benefits are. Using a combination of MATLAB and Simulink each of the components mentioned above were modelled using current practices in literature. Scenarios were developed to create a basis for comparison: baseline scenario, Self-sufficiency based (SSB) scenario and Price-based (PB) scenario. The last two are collectively termed the Distributed Energy Resource (DER) scenario. The electrification of heating has a significant impact on the load prole, the largest loads occur in the winter. It was found that the highest self-sufficiency achieved was 43% utilising the SSB control, whereas with the PB control a maximum self-sufficiency of 41.3% was achieved. These percentages can mainly be attributed to the combination of large load and low PV production during the colder months of the year, indicating a clear need for studies into the impacts of heating electrification for consumers. This fraction can be increased by identifying further combinations of DERs that are sustainable, low cost and also available during the colder months of the year. Furthermore, levelised cost of electricity of the PV system accounted for only 19% of the total system levelised cost of electricity; while the zinc-bromine flow battery and and FCEVs accounted for nearly 60% of it. On average the proposed system provides energy at an average (across both controls) cost of 0.304e/kWh. The costs of the proposed system are relatively high, and the largest contributors to this are the FCEV fleet and the chosen battery.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This shift in the theory of transport, accompanied by developments in transport and communication technologies, has revolutionized the way we buy, leading to the digitalization and ""logisticalization"" of trade. E-commerce is effectively eliminating the functional necessity for urban commercial space and replacing traditional stores with suburban distribution centers and virtual platforms. However, commercial space has long since held an important role in the public and social life of cities, a role which is only amplified by urbanization and the densification of cities worldwide. As the online market is becoming saturated, online brands are increasingly turning to physical space as an effective means of promotion. A new typology emerges: The Experience Space, aiming not to distribute but to advertise through experience. Through a particular focus on the human experience, this typology presents a new alignment of public interests and private funds, and an opportunity for corporate funded urban recreation space. The city of Rotterdam is facing rapid densification in the upcoming years and demonstrating a need for new types of public amenities. In the context of an exceptionally fragmented and competitive online market, the Dutch city creates an opportunity for the success of an architectural strategy in brand promotion.

It is an open space where everybody can come and where people can meet and interact with each other. But is the street designed as a place for interaction? Or is it intended to get from one place to the other? Is the street a logistical way of working, to structure the city and the flow of people? Research has been done about the street, what is a street, and how do we experience a street? To create a better understanding of how streets are designed different street typologies around the world are analyzed. The exciting part about the streets is that they are everywhere, they already designed in a certain way during medieval times. Everage cities exist 1/3 out of streets. Can we see the street still as a public space, or is it occupied by the car? Looking at Rotterdam, 75% of the public space exists of streets, and are mainly occupied by vehicles. So what if we can see the street again as a public space, rather than a place for movement. This research focuses on how the connection between houses and the place for social interaction can increase in the street in relation to the built environment. The research question for this paper: How can the street become a public space through the design of a building? The research question will be tested in Rotterdam city center. Rotterdam is after the bombing design in a car-oriented way, which makes the topic very interesting. Besides of urbanization the big cities becomes denser and denser, this also includes Rotterdam. So the city needs to extend to household all those people. What you can see in Rotterdam is that the centre of the city is slowly moving more to the south. The city’s municipality created a high-rise strategy that will make it possible to house 50.000 more people/houses in the future. But through so, the number of buildings in the center is increasing and the amount of public space decreases. Streets are playing a significant role in the design of the of new households, and to keep the city livable. To test the research question through the design of a building, a specific location in Rotterdam’s center is chosen, called the Kop van Zuid. Through analyzing streets around the world and researching the different aspects of the street. Three main ambitions are defined, which will play an essential role in this project: designing a place for social interaction, establishing a human scale in the city center, and creating a connection between the street and the building.","Street; social interaction; built environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Currently, the TU Delft is accountable for 47.957 tCO2-eq emissions, uses 166.038 MWh of energy for electricity and heat , and is for approximately 5-15% circular. There is a need to improve in order to meet the goals set by the TU Delft. On campus the Applied Physics buildings consumes the most energy, equivalent to 12.873,2 MWh or 425 kWh/m2 in 2018 for electricity and heat combined. The technical state of the building is mediocre and is in need of a thorough renovation to meet the current standard. The goal of the graduation project is to develop a re-design and renovation strategy for the Applied Physics building, by re-using as many of the existing materials and closing the energy flows on a local level. Architecture – reuse existing The building is designed by the architecture firm Roosenburg, Verhave and Luyt and built in 1963. It has an area of 43.100 m2, making it one of the largest buildings on campus. The building is located in the centre of the campus next to the Aula and the Library. It is embedded in the urban fabric of the TU Delft with a 175-meter-long rhythmic façade facing toward the Mekelpark. The concrete façade has a sense of monumentality however, it has quite a closed look and is not overly inviting to visit. The new architecture starts from the existing building and the desire to reuse as many of the existing materials as possible to reduce the CO2 impact of the renovation. An inventory of the materials present in the structure and façade has been made. 93% of the materials analysed are in the concrete structure and therefore this will be completely reused. The remaining 7% of the materials are located in the façade and they will be carefully harvested. Prefab biobased façade panels, based on the existing structural grid, will be attached to the existing structure. On site the harvested materials will be re-used to clad the newly insulated façade. Energy flow To move away from an energy system that runs on fossil fuels, there is a need to introduce so called cyclifiers to create a closed loop system. Firstly, the energy consumption needs to be reduced by introducing a well-insulated façade and a smart building system that regulates the temperature and ventilation. The remaining energy needs to be produced sustainably. A biogas plant is introduced that turns waste into three valuable products, namely biogas, fertiliser and clean water. The biogas plant runs on waste from the sewer system as well as on algae, which are integrated in the roof of the atrium that is added to the building. The algae serve a triple purpose because they provide sun shading in summer, absorbed CO2 and are a renewable energy source. PV panels are added to the roof and facades of the building to produce even more renewable energy. The heat for the whole campus is supplied by a geothermal source connected to the already existing heat grid and a heat and cold storage is added to the building.","Circularity; Renovation; Flows; reuse materials; CO2 neutral; campus development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.0008681, 4.3740258"

These algorithms interact with a system and build a hypothesis of what the state machine describing that system looks like according to the behavior they observed. Once the algorithm arrives at a hypothesis, it sends it to a so-called equivalence oracle to be checked. The equivalence oracle returns a counterexample trace describing different behavior between the hypothesis and the real system if one exists. Traditionally, this task is done using a technique called the W-method, which provides certain guarantees about finding a counterexample if one exists, but this is rather slow due to the thorough search it needs to do. In real systems, there are sometimes patterns to the counterexamples to be found during the learning process, which can be exploited to speed up the process of finding new counterexamples. Instead of performing an exhaustive search each time, we first use the already observed patterns to generate new traces to try before falling back to traditional techniques in case no counterexample was found in the first step. This allows us to find counterexamples more quickly than usual, and because we can always fall back on the techniques that do provide guarantees we do not have to sacrifice correctness. In the same amount of time, our method provides an up to 26x increase in the number of states found compared to the W-method, while remaining fully black box and without degrading worst-case performance. We also show that, when not working in a fully black-box scenario, fuzzing can be a successful complementary technique to apply next to active learning. However, we also show that relying on fuzzing alone does not always fully capture the behavior of a system, and when correctness is critical such as in the case of model checking, it needs to be supplemented with additional techniques to result in fully correct models. Finally, we use our home-grown state machine learning library to participate in the 2020 RERS challenge, and apply the techniques we studied so far to attain a perfect score on the sequential LTL track.","State machine learning; Active Learning; Equivalence checking; RERS; Mealy machine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Even though hundreds of CubeSats have been launched, few have launched with a micropropulsion module on board. Propulsion would allow for an extended lifetime and better mission capabilities, thus greatly increasing the attractiveness of CubeSats. TU Delft is working on a type of thruster suitable for CubeSats, called the Vaporizing Liquid Microthruster (VLM). For micro-propulsion it is viable to generate sufficient thrust by using an external heat source to vaporize a liquid and expanding the vapour via a nozzle. The usage of such micropropulsion modules is still inhibited by issues in the nozzle and heating chamber. One issue is the multiphase flow occurring inside the micronozzle, which lowers the thrust and specific impulse performance of the thruster as well as the stability due to the explosive boiling phenomena. Previous research indicates that the multiphase flow in the nozzle most likely occurs inside the heating chamber and flows into the nozzle. Little is known on how exactly this multiphase flow looks like, ranging from annular flow to dispersed droplets, nor on how it is generated within the chamber. It is indicated that the boiling may lead to large pressure oscillations inside the chamber, which contributes to the instability of the thruster. These pressure oscillations occur due to multichannel interactions from nucleate boiling in microchannels, as well as explosive boiling. In this thesis, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is used to simulate the complex phase change multiphase flow occurring inside the microchannels of the vaporizing liquid micro-thruster. This method has recently gained a lot of attraction in simulating microscale fluid problems. Research shows that LBM applied to multiphase flows can be an order of magnitude faster than conversional Navier-Stokes solvers. This thesis utilizes the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) collision operator in combination with the pseudopotential method to simulate the multiphase flow. A modified Guo forcing scheme is used to ensure thermodynamic consistency. The water is modelled using the non-ideal Peng-Robinson equation of state. The thermal problem is solved using the double distribution function method, in combination with a semi-hybrid source term solved via a multiple relaxation time (MRT) collision operator. The phase change term is derived from the local balance of entropy, using the equation of state to calculate the latent heat. The open-source lattice Boltzmann method solver OpenLB is extended to be capable of simulating phase change flow. Verification tests are performed to show that the code extension is correctly implemented. The code was released to the OpenLB, making it the first open-source lattice Boltzmann method framework capable of simulation phase change flow. In the analysis of the tool developed, the pool boiling simulations showed how nucleation, bubble formation, and departure occurs. Correct behaviour are shown in the thermodynamic consistency, Laplace pressure and wall wettability. The effect of the spurious currents on the thermal solution are analysed in more depth than found in literature. The procedure for the multichannel simulation verification and validation is given, including a novel analysis method. The novel analysis method can estimate the multiphase flow type occurring inside real thrusters without any additional equipment required in a test setup. The required experiment data are the specific impulse values at various massflow rates, and the massflow rate at which multiphase flow starts to occur. The simulations are strongly limited by the BGK collision operator, which is apparent by the large spurious currents at high density ratio multiphase flow. The spurious currents can cause simulation instabilities, but are mitigated by using a thicker diffuse interface. This mitigation results in a larger metastable phase change region, which inhibits the nucleation process. Thus, nucleation inside the microchannels did not occur. However, using a MRT collision operator should reduce the spurious currents without needing to increase the diffuse interface thickness, allowing for nucleation to take place in the microchannels.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Therefore, both the sectors are actively looking at energy-efficient methods to reduce their carbon emission by shifting to more sustainable solutions. One such solution is Vertically Integrated Greenhouses (VIG). This research investigates the impact of such systems on the building’s energy consumption. The case study has been performed on the EEMCS building of TU Delft, in the Netherlands. The crop chosen for the study is strawberry, as it is one of the most consumed greenhouse fruits by the Dutch population. The energy needed for the building and the greenhouse to maintain the comfortable indoor temperature was calculated. An additional novel method of storing the surplus heat was incorporated in the design in the form of Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES). This system provides heating and cooling energy which reduces the dependency on fossil fuels and reduces the carbon emissions. A comparative study on the carbon footprint due to energy used in the building was done in order to analyse the impact of introducing an ATES system in mitigating climate change. Further, a rainwater harvesting system was incorporated aiming to fulfil the water requirement of the plants, this thereby reduces the dependence on an external water source. Such synergetic systems reduce the dependency on fossil fuels and thereby significantly reducing their carbon emission. The proposed design of integrating VIG on the façade of the existing building showed an additional 292 MWh of energy consumption when compared to the current scenario. However, the introduction of ATES resulted in a 40% total reduction in the carbon emission of the energy consumed by the building. In addition to the carbon emission reduction, an annual yield of 227 tonnes of strawberry is also achieved. Thus, the role of having such a synergetic system is highlighted.","Vertically Integrated Greenhouses; synergetic system; carbon footprint; double-skin facade; urban farming; Aquifer thermal energy storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); van Gelder, K.B. (mentor); Vaniushkina, V.

Aligning a transition piece onto its substructure under offshore conditions is a complicated and time-consuming procedure. Another issue found in a number of commissioned offshore wind turbines is related to the sustainability of the connection between the transition piece and the substructure. With wind turbines increasing in size and wind farms being built further from shore in deeper waters, the current bolted- and grouted connections are seemingly not the most suitable future proof options. This is where the Double Slip Joint steps in. A simple plug- and go connection device provided by KCI The Engineers. The Double Slip Joint’s innovative solution takes away the time-consuming phases like manually fastening a number of bolts or the buffer period of waiting for grout material to fully solidify before commissioning a wind turbine. This study aims to gain more useful insights on the installation behavior of the Double Slip Joint during the mating phase under various offshore environmental conditions. The chosen system for this study consists of a hoisted wind turbine tower which is lowered onto a monopile. A numerical model for this tower-monopile system is developed in Excel where the user is able to manipulate input parameters such as mean wind velocity, tower lowering velocity, crane motions etc. After a series of validation using Ansys Finite Element models, simulations from the developed Excel model were carried out to study the Double Slip Joint’s behavior during the mating phase from both a jack-up - and a floating vessel. A key finding from this study is the necessity to round off the sharp edges of the Double Slip Joints conical rings in order to avoid contact stresses that might lead to unwanted damage. The simulation results indicate that installations carried out from a jack-up vessel can be optimised to perfectly tolerate a mean wind velocity of 15 m/s, whereas that of a floating vessel can be optimised up to 13 m/s. The possibility of achieving higher mean wind velocities indicate that the weather window for offshore installations can have a greater range. The results obtained from this study confirm the potential of the Double Slip Joint for future offshore wind turbine installations.","Double Slip Joint; Lowering phase; Impact Assessment; Offshore Installation; Excel Simulation; ANSYS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-16","","","","Marine Technology","",""

However, the morbidities accompanied with this procedure are not negligible (e.g., wound infection, lymphoedema and seroma). With the goal reduce the incidence of morbidities, this thesis investigated the possibility of minimally invasive sentinel lymph node biopsy (MISLNB). Preceding this thesis, a literature study was written by the writer of this thesis to examine whether there was already a possible solution for this problem. This literature study showed that there are no off the shelf available solutions for MISLNB. Therefore, three solution with the reduction of comorbidities and the importance of \textit{en bloc} excision at their core were proposed. These solutions were found through literature, patents, and some ingenuity. The solution with the highest probability was selected to develop further. This concept was then subjected to different experiments to determine whether it was viable option for MISLNB. This study also aimed to fill some of the missing data on the material behaviour of lymph nodes (LN), specifically stress-strain behaviour under compression. By using a set of requirements one solution was selected to be the most viable given the available information. This solution was called the Pull-and-Harvest method. This concept uses a vacuum to grip the sentinel lymph node (SLN) and stash it in a tube, hereafter a snare would cut the lymph ducts and blood vessels. This concept scored well mainly due to the low risk of damaging SLN and its simplicity. The next step was to determine whether this concept was a feasible solution to MISLNB. The problem was divided into three subproblems to estimate this feasibility. The first being the force required to separate the SLN from its surrounding tissue. Since no data on this subject was available a simplified model was created to estimate this value based on the stretch of lymph ducts. The second part of this problem was, determining the force required to stash the SLN inside the tubular volume. Finally, the maximal force of two silicon suction cups was determined. From these experiments several conclusions could be drawn: the conical silicon suction cups used in this study are very inefficient (10%) efficiency) for gripping LNs, these suction cups will stash the LNs but probably not with the additional estimated adherence force and the risk of damaging the LN using a vacuum seems to be low. Based on these observations during these experiments possible ways of were suggested and could make the Pull-and-Harvest a viable procedure. Lastly stress-strain behaviour of LNs could be described using an exponential relationship. This thesis outlines the problem of MISLNB and highlights the areas of interest for further research. However, there is more research and development needed to find a definitive solution for MISLNB.","sentinel lymph node; minimally invasive surgery; minimally invasive; vacuum; Medical instrument; biopsy; suction cup; lymph node; Design for healthcare; gripper","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-21","","","","","",""

All prominent European car-makers announced diverse fully and partially electric product portfolios for 2021 and beyond with strong indication that the era of the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) is slowly fading into history. While Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are already well on their way in establishing a strong market share in the personal vehicle domain, the field of long haul transport is left to search for solutions elsewhere as battery technology does not present an efficient solution at this time. Fuel-Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) pose a solid performance base to close the gap that batteries cannot<br/>and provide sustainable, zero emissions solutions, for all heavy transport sectors - automotive, aviation and maritime. Within fuel cell systems, a component whose criticality is often overlooked or even understated is the hydrogen storage tank. Current state of the art uses type IV composite pressure vessels (CPVs) with a plastic liner and Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) composite overwrap to ensure structural integrity. Recognizing the complexity of a CPV is crucial in order to allow for the development of robust and worthwhile<br/>design processes that could yield a significant decrease in material use, making FCEVs more cost effective and an attractive long-term solution. This thesis aims to provide some detail on the behavior of CPVs and their depth through the development of an automated numerical analysis framework and the execution of a focused experimental study that examines the impact of laminate stacking sequence as well as manufacturability factors on overall CPV behavior and, in particular the cylinder-dome transition of the vessels. The details and experimental correlation of the developed numerical analysis framework are shown and discussed. The framework heavily utilizes the outputs of an industry standard filament winding software, Composicad, which is used as a basis that is then further refined in order to generate a satisfactory geometric description of the vessel and its laminate composition. Major emphasis is placed on the discussion of processes made for the geometry correction and attention is placed on particular factors that were also tested in the experimental study - hoop ply drop-off and stacking sequence. The framework is correlated to experimental results and laminate configurations from previous and current experimental results to showcase its versatility and potential for future optimization studies given the high level of automation involved. Two Finite Element (FE) models are investigated within the scope of the developed framework - a solid and shell element model. The performance and predictive ability for each are presented and discussed. The experimental study presents data on the impact of stacking sequence effects and hoop ply drop-off<br/>on CPV behavior - in particular, the cylinder-dome transition. The influence of both parameters are discussed and contextualized with previous studies in order to identify relevant trends. Novel results were obtained for the relationship between hoop layer placement and burst performance. The results further indicate a delicate interaction between vessel stacking sequence, burst strength and manufacturing robustness. The results of this study highlight important factors for future numerical studies of CPVs and showcase the development of an analysis approach with low computational cost while retaining acceptable accuracy. Furthermore, the experimental study helps put focus on future areas in need for further investigations in order to identify design-critical performance trends.","Composite pressure vessels; Filament winding; Finite element modelling; Automation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-21","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(ZEF) is a start-up company developing a fully autonomous methanol synthesis micro-plant that will be energy driven by solar panels. The process implements an alkaline water electrolyzer, which supplies the methanol synthesis reactor with hydrogen. The electrolysis system includes a small-scale stack of cells and is designed to operate at 90 <sup>o</sup>C and the high pressure of 50 bar, with a 30% potassium hydroxide electrolyte. The system is also self-pressurized through the continuous accumulation of the electrolysis gases in the closed flash separation vessels. To control the process, the company has designed a novel system that aims to maintain the gas pressure at 50 bar and the liquid electrolyte level inside the flash separators at a fixed point. <br/>The present work has two main objectives. The first is to characterize the transient dynamic response of the company's current experimental electrolysis setup under the effect of the operating conditions and control. The second objective is to predict the level of gas crossover that is induced during the system's operation and evaluate the risk of explosive mixtures formation. Two different models were developed to fulfill the research targets.<br/>The first model is based on a 1-d transient hydraulic network analysis. Simulations were conducted using Simulink for a current density range of 500-5000 A/m<sup>2</sup>. The model predicts the electrolyte flow and pressure response in the various elements and locations of the network respectively, indicating also the oscillatory behavior induced by the operation of the valves. A key finding is the high differential pressure between the stack anodes-cathodes that is caused when the valves open, posing a danger for the integrity of the separators between the half-cells.<br/>The second model was developed in MATLAB and uses the predicted flow response of the first model to estimate the crossovers by solving numerically the unsteady 1-d advection-diffusion equation in the corresponding elements. The effect of the supersaturated electrode boundary layer was also considered as an enhancing parameter of the mass transport through the separators of the cells and a sensitivity analysis was conducted. The main finding is that this parameter has an important effect, especially on the hydrogen crossover inducing 1% higher hydrogen impurity when it is increased by a factor of 10. The crossovers of both hydrogen and oxygen are found to gradually increase and reach an almost stable value under the effect of the control system. A comparison of the model with preliminary experimental data indicates a supersaturation intensity between 5 and 15 times higher than the solubility of the components. In this range, the system will safely operate above 2000 A/m<sup>2</sup> without the formation of explosive mixtures. ","alkaline electrolysis; high-pressure electrolysis; control; hydrogen; gas crossover","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-21","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Process and Energy Technology","",""

At its core, the Segment barrier is a temporary structure that can be assembled before the advent of a storm surge and dismantled afterwards with the intent of mitigating the long-term environmental and ecological impact associated with permanently fixed hydraulic structures. However, the Segment barrier is equally able to function as a typical structure with a long design life if necessary. Long Island Sound served as a case study for the development of this concept.

Cavitation is the forming of vapour bubbles in a fluid due to a local drop in pressure, followed by a subsequent implosion of those bubbles due to an increase in pressure. The vapour formed can significantly decrease pump efficiency and the implosion can be detrimental to the pump and damage components. Centrifugal pumps play an essential role in dredging, here cavitation can be problematic, both due to loss of efficiency and because of damage to the pump. The condition related to the onset of cavitation is called the Net Positive Suction Head (NPSHr). Knowing the NPSHr conditions of a pump is important for its design and to define the conditions for operating a pump. Unfortunately it is difficult to predict NPSHr properties of a newly designed pump and it is expensive to test a full scale dredging pump. Therefore it is relevant to be able to predict NPSHr conditions of a full scale pump by performing small scale experiments in a lab environment. In order to do this a lab setup was designed for centrifugal pumps with an inlet diameter of 100 [mm]. In this setup the inlet conditions (flow rate, inlet pressure, water temperature) of a centrifugal pump were controlled to determine the NPSHr properties of the small scale pump for a range of shaft speeds and flow rates. The relation between the flow, shaft speed and inlet pressure were investigated for the lab scale experiment. Also the data was compared with available full scale data and analysed to find an expression for NPSHr conditions as a function of flow, shaft speed, inlet pressure and pump diameter for geometrical identical centrifugal pumps. The relation of the NPSHr with shaft speed and diameter appears to be quadratic, provide the flow profile is comparable (i.e. the specific capacity is constant). This relation is optimal at the Best Efficiency Point .","Centrifugal dredge pump; cavitation; NPSHr; flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

However, conventional solar home systems pose various disadvantages concerning modularity, flexibility and ease of installation. The Photovoltaic Battery Integrated Module (PBIM) is an alternative approach towards integrating all the components of a solar home system into one device, in an attempt to tackle such challenges. Together with the possibility to interconnect several PBIMs to constitute a small grid, new challenges appear particularly related to the way in which the general power flow is decided. This project evaluates how forming a PBIMG grid can help mitigate the effect of mismatches between the various PBIMs during operation. It is expected that due to differences in PV generation and battery state of charge levels, the individual PBIMs should coordinate with other PBIMs to operate optimally. Although research has been made in the context of individual PBIM modules, forming a grid of multiple modules could provide feasible and scalable solutions for both on- and off- grid applications. All the advantages of the PBIM (scalability, modularity, ease of installation etc.) could potentially be scaled up to a microgrid level as to form an independent power source. The scope of this project is to evaluate how the formation of such a grid can improve system performance by performing a comparative energy and economic analysis between interconnected and non-interconnected PBIMs. The case studies simulated include: a) independent vs interconnected PBIMs powering an offgrid household in Costa Rica b) multiple grid-connected household powered by PBIM grids versus an interconnected neighborhood, powered by a bigger PBIM grid in Costa Rica and the Netherlands The results indicate that PBIM grid shows superior performance than multiple non-interconnected PBIMs, as smaller systems can achieve comparable performances when interconnected by reducing both battery degradation and the need to exchange power with the main grid, leading to considerable financial gains.","power management strategy; PV System; Battery Energy Storage System; integrated solar system; PBIM; Photovoltaic Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

These aging structures have reached the end of their designed service life or will reach it in the short term. It is estimated that 15% of these structures have a box-shaped cross-section as being reinforced concrete underpasses and culverts. Replacing all these structures in the short term is not practical and financially feasible. In order to preserve these structures, it must be demonstrated based on a structural assessment that the structural safety is guaranteed. So many assessments will be performed by different engineers which is a time-consuming process and results in a non-consistent assessment where unnecessary disapproval occurs which in turn leads to unnecessary costs and loss of time. The aim of this thesis is to set up a structured consistent automated method with which unnecessary disapproval and unjustified approval is avoided, a necessary efficiency improvement is achieved and structures where structural safety is at risk can be identified. Quantitative research has been conducted in which numerical data from parameter studies is collected and analysed to investigate relationships between the studied variables, find patterns and generalize results. First a data analysis of existing underpasses and culverts in the Netherlands was carried out, after which the modeling of the load effect and the capacity of existing reinforced concrete structures was investigated. An automated analytical model was created for the first step to determine the load effect, including the method of Guyon-Massonnet for traffic load distribution for the determination of bending moments and an application of method 7.3-7 from CEB-fib model code 2010 to determine the shear force as a result of the local tandem system loads. The determination of the capacity of existing concrete structures was investigated arithmetically. As a second step to determine the load effect, a model refinement was performed by automating a 2,5D FEM plate model. Structures from the database were assessed with both the analytical model and the 2,5D FEM model and a sensitivity analysis was performed based on theoretical structures within the boundaries derived from the data analysis. It is concluded that it is the most efficient method to first assess the large batches with the analytical model and that the 2,5D FEM plate model for structures with an intersection angle smaller than 80gon and structures that are disapproved with the analytical model offers added value in terms of a lower UC. From the comparison with the 2,5D FEM plate model it is concluded that the method as an extension of method 7.3-7 from (CEB-fib, 2010) results in too optimistic values for the occurring shear force as a result of the tandem system load due to an overestimation of the vertical load distribution. This research shows that an automated structural assessment can be of added value on the classic approach of assessing existing concrete underpasses and culverts by significantly improving efficiency and therefore to realize a cost-efficient method.","Existing concrete structures; Automated assessment; Underpasses; Culverts; Automated FEM; Scripted FEA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-01-20","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

(mentor); Colenberg, S.E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","class=""MsoNormal"">The amount of people working from home has been increasing. However, working from home has its issues and consequences. The degree to which one experiences recovery from stress and fatigue is limited when working from home, which has consequences on motivation, performance, health, and well-being. The aim of this project was therefore to develop a product that supports restoration during working from home. One way to achieve restoration is described by the Attention Restoration Theory, which poses that interaction with an environment can restore mental fatigue if it meets four properties: 1) a sense of being away, 2) fascination, or effort less attention, 3) extent, or a feeling of immersion, and 4) compatibility and congruence between the person and the environment. If an experience meets these properties, it can have similar restorative powers.  User research with homeworkers following the context mapping method revealed where the opportunities for an intervention lie. This user research showed that the four properties of attention restoration were not all met in the current home-work-environment, thereby limiting the possibility for the home-work-environment to be restorative. Especially the sense of being away is limited, due to inability to distance oneself physically as well as psychologically from the workplace. A design direction was defined: re-establishing the borders between work and non-work, and making the switching moments more conscious.   Nature is particularly good in meeting the four properties of attention restoration. Besides, nature can reduce stress, and improve mood and wellbeing. Biophilic design takes into account these advantages of nature and translates them into guidelines for design. A red thread throughout the concepting phase of this project is therefore biophilic design. The resulting design of this project is Ecflo, an inflatable lamp that functions as a break-reminder through dynamic light textures. Ecflo creates a liminal moment at the switching moments between work and non-work. Upon the start of a home-work-day the user inflates Ecflo, an interaction functioning as energizer. When it is time for a break, Ecflo moves and creates light effects, drawing the user’s attention away from the screen, towards a moment of fascination. Ecflo creates a conscious decision at this switching moment: continue work, or take a break. This way, it helps in structuring the home-work-day and helps separate work and non-work. Ecflo is restorative in the sense that it creates fascination through random and ephemeral patterns and movements. The design sustains interest, and thereby creates extent. The design is compatible in the sense that it is suitable for working from home and the home environment. However, evaluation study showed that the feeling of being away is limited, as Ecflo does not fully create an escape experience. Evaluation of the concept was done using the Perceived Restorativeness for Activities Scale. However, this scale is not fully suitable for product evaluation. Development of a research method suitable for evaluation of a product’s restorative potential is thus needed to evaluate Ecflo’s restorative potential. For further development of the concept, a functioning model should be made and tested with homeworkers.  ","Biophilic design; attention restoration; Homeworking; contextmapping; working from home; experience mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The survey frequencies vary from location to location depending on a set of factors defined by the authorities. These are the minimum depth, draught (the difference between seafloor depth and ship’s keel), shipping intensity, human interventions and seafloor dynamics that are taking place in an area. The project is about developing a methodology using the available time-series of bathymetric data to automatically make a well-informed decision on the survey frequency of critical areas of the NCS. This study aims to contribute to the decision-making by performing a risk-based analysis using a probabilistic approach. The main objectives are to estimate and map the risk that the seafloor is changing significantly. Risk severity should be measured and the probability of risk's consequence to occur should be estimated and mapped in temporal and spatial scale indicating if possible, the optimal surveying frequency. Firstly, the accuracy, quality and reliability of the prediction values were defined and computed. This was a necessary step to realize how powerful are the predictions used as an input dataset for the risk assessment of the seafloor to change significantly. As a step further, the risk's impact and probability to occur should be determined. Hence, it was necessary to define quantities related to seabed dynamics that express the evolution of the seafloor. These are mentioned as risk indicators and are the Relative Depth Change (RDC), the Rate of Change (RoC) and the direction of change. The RoC was used for probability estimation and the rest of it as informative variables for the analysis. Finally, an adjustment of the method used here with the Netherlands Hydrographic Office (NLHO) standards was done and conclusions were made regarding the survey frequency of the chosen study areas. The analysis was applied for two study areas: West IJmuiden and West Rotterdam, as these areas according to the NLHO are highly prioritised (should be resurveyed every 2 years) and thus, they are critical areas of the NCS. The method applied and the results can be used as an informative tool in designing a successful, reliable and cost-effective bathymetric survey plan of the NCS.","Bathymetry; Survey; Sand waves; Probabilistic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Miniaturization in spacecraft is an ongoing process in which the launched satellites become smaller and smaller. This trend introduces issues, such as the choice for a reliable and efficient propulsion subsystem. The implementation of engines would enable the spacecraft to perform maneuvers such as orbit changes, drag compensation and attitude control. Solar Thermal Propulsion (STP) has been identified as a promising candidate, due to its theoretical specific impulse being well above that of the best chemical thrusters when hydrogen is the propellant of choice. The concept has never been flown in space but would benefit from ground demonstrations proving that the potential can be realized. This work will focus on demonstrating the STP performance. The goal was set to reach a Sea Level (SL) specific impulse of 90.0 s at a continuous mass flow of 300 mg s−1 and input power of 250 W. During the project, a demonstration thruster named Solar Thermal Thruster 2 was designed. The resulting engine consisted of a copper heat exchanger and nozzle with a highpowered laser as the irradiation source of choice. Concurrently, a Preliminary Design Tool was developed to assess the performance of STP engines. Verification and validation was done by comparing the tool outputs to other theoretical and experimental results. Verification was completed, but for validation STT2 experimental results were required. Preliminary test results of STT2 showed that the motor had some shortcomings, due to concessions made. Erroneously, its heat exchanger had been built with a reduced number of channels, rendering the thruster unavailable for testing. Next to that, the engine suffered from leakages. For further validation of the tool, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed. The thermal part of the tool was validated, but the pressure loss results deviated too much. As such, further experiments are required in this area. In the end, an updated design (STT3) was made of the thruster. The number of channels in the heat exchanger was increased and its mass and area was reduced. It proved to have an SL specific impulse of 84.9 s, almost meeting the goal set for the thesis. It is recommended that the engine is built and tested at Delft University of Technology (DUT) in order to complete validation of the tool and demonstrate the feasibility of STP.","Solar Thermal Propulsion; Micropropulsion; Demonstration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

With this early involvement of the contractor, this project delivery method contains two agreements during the project. The first agreement is for the contractor's involvement in the design and the second one is for the project execution. Therefore, price determination becomes a two-phased process. With this two-phased process, both the client and contractor are involved in determining the price for the execution agreement. However, it is currently not clear how they could develop this price cooperatively. This research aims to find success factors for the price determination process in a Bouwteam, by which success factors are strategic management attributes. Due to a lack of literature about the obstacles in the price determination process, the research starts with a focus group discussion. Here, experts identified five obstacles to the price determination process. Accordingly, mitigation strategies for the obstacles were researched with a literature study. Those strategies were hypothesised as success factors in a conceptual model. The hypotheses were studied with four cases studies, including document research and interviewees with both the client and contractor side. Experts evaluated the result of a revised conceptual model of success factors as last. The research concludes with a final model with success factors for the price determination process in Bouwteam projects. This model includes thirteen critical success factors and six indirect success factors that support other critical success factors. Accordingly, the research developed recommendations that contribute to a smooth price negotiation and a price that satisfies both the client and contractors. In further research, the model with success factors can be validated, and more relationships between the success factors and the soft characteristics can be studied.","Bouwteam; Pricing; Early Contractor Involvement; 2-Phased pricing process; Success factors; Construction costs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Without understanding and possibly elimination of the pitch break, the flying V’s usable maximum lift coefficient is lower and the pitching moment behavior and gust response unpredictable. Three possible solutions are investigated empirically, with the ultimate goal of eliminating the unstable pitch break. First, the application of a trip strip to the suction and pressure side of the wing is investigated. Second and third, the implementation of vortilons and fences is investigated. The experiments are performed in the TU Delft’s Open Jet Facility using a 4.6% scaled half-span model of the Flying V. The wind tunnel experiments are evaluated using force and moment data and flow visualization using tufts. The application of trip strips results in an increase in pitching moment coefficient up to a lift coefficient of CL = 0.65 and introduces the unstable pitch break at CL = 0.80 compared to CL = 0.95 for the clean wing. Flow visualizations showed an improvement in the flow over the outboard wing when the trip strips were applied. Combining both observations, it is recommended to apply the trip strips on the outboard wing of the Flying V scaled flight testing model only. Vortilons have shown to have no effect on the unstable pitch break. The combination of a vortilon and the trip strips could decrease the pitching moment coefficient of the flying V up to a lift coefficient of CL = 0.70, depending on the spanwise location of the vortilon. Placing a fence could result in a favorable pitching moment coefficient characteristic, depending on its spanwise location and size. A fence placed at the spanwise location of the leading edge kink results in a decrease of pitching moment coefficient between a lift coefficient of CL = 0.30 and 1.1. Furthermore, a fence located at the leading edge kink and spanning the entire suction surface chord postponed the unstable pitch break experienced by the Flying V. Therefore, it is recommended to install that fence on the Flying V scaled flight testing model.","Flying V; vortilons; fences; pitch break; flying wing; Flow visualization; Wind tunnel testing; half model testing; Low speed; add-ons; Aerodynamics; Vortex generators; vortex; pitching moment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Bottlenecks limit the capacity of these terminals and should therefore be detected and alleviated. However, there is no structured approach available in literature to mitigate the effects of bottlenecks at MCTs. Therefore, this research introduces a holistic approach called the bottleneck mitigation cycle (BMC) which consists of three steps: bottleneck classification, bottleneck detection, and bottleneck alleviation. This research provides a proof of concept of the BMC. Scientific value is added by proposing a contemporary and comprehensive classification structure of bottlenecks at MCTs which consists of infrastructural, operational, and managerial bottlenecks. Infrastructural and operational bottlenecks are the focus of this research. Furthermore, while literature often only focuses on alleviation of a single bottleneck and skips bottleneck detection, this research uses the shifting bottleneck method and thereby considers a variety of possible infrastructural and operational bottlenecks. The shifting bottleneck method originates in production networks and is adapted such that it can be applied to detect both momentary and average bottlenecks at MCTs. An empirical approach is adopted to find the cause of the detected bottleneck and to suggest suitable alleviation measures. Application of the BMC to a simulation model of the Fergusson Container Terminal in the Port of Auckland results in productivity improvements of 2-6%. Due to its generic formulation, the BMC is potentially successful in improving performance of MCTs in general which could be confirmed by future research. To make the BMC even more effective and efficient, future research directions are to improve the empirical approach used for bottleneck alleviation and to apply the BMC in real-time.","bottleneck alleviation; bottleneck classification; bottleneck detection; maritime container terminals; terminal efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","double degree: Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering | Transport Engineering and Logistics and Master of Science in Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

Current road capacity limitations will lead to a significant decrease of traffic flow accompanied by a serious increase in global fuel consumption and air pollution. Ever-expanding road infrastructure is not expected to be a sustainable and long-term solution, thus other solutions are sought. Amongst these solutions is the concept letting AVs drive closer together, cooperatively. A flock of vehicles that coordinates collective movement while maintaining short inter-vehicle distances is defined as platooning. Evidently, in order to achieve safe platooning, a thorough understanding of both longitudinal and lateral behavior of the platoon system and its dynamics is required. The longitudinal aspect of platooning concerned with the design of spacing policies (i.e., distance keeping) has been broadly researched in the past decades. As a consequence, numerous valid applications exist. Whereas for the lateral aspect, the subject has not been researched as extensive. Hence a considerable amount of knowledge on this side is still needed to meet strict conditions and requirements for platooning applications. One of the major bottlenecks obstructing robust lateral platoon control is the ability to assure the lateral string stability for the complete platoon. String stability implies that errors propagating in an upstream direction of inter-connected vehicles forming the vehicular platoon, do not amplify. Specifically, lateral string stability implies that initially bounded lateral errors will remain bounded between ever pair of consecutive vehicles along the string of vehicles. Propagating errors are therefore attenuated during, e.g. the execution of a lane change. Henceforth, when Lateral String Stability for a platoon can be guaranteed, so is the reassurance that a platoon can safely perform certain manoeuvres such as a collective lane change. This thesis endeavours to develop a string stable, lateral controller for a homogeneous platoon of vehicles using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach. In the process two different control strategies tightly linked with the information flow topology, being centralized and distributed, are designed and compared in terms of reference tracking performance, noise- and disturbance rejection and practical implementation. Lastly, the developed controllers are simulated and validated using Siemens' Simcenter Prescan software, after which the results are thoroughly discussed. Results have indicated that for the application discussed in this work, the centralized controller outperformed its competitor in the field of tracking performance and noise rejection, but not by a great margin. Furthermore, the novel developed definition of Practical Lateral String Stability (PLSS) guarantees stability for a platoon of n=5 vehicles while using both controllers. To this end, the distributed controller is seen as worthy competitor and more workable solution due to the centralized controller's issue of practical implementation. As part of anticipated future work, we plan testing the proposed approach with field experiments to validate the proposed method in real life.","Lateral control; Platooning; MPC; String stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

We illustrate our models for a quiet and a busy day at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The models successfully give concrete guidelines on the required ET vehicle fleet size and infrastructure needed for the implementation of ET. The number of required ET vehicles can be decreased by tactically distributing battery charging over the entire day.

One who has serious burn injuries, can be literally scarred for life due to the complications developed post wounding. Wound contracture is one of the symptoms that is characteristic for burn injuries and it can yield many complications. At the location of the wound, an unusual large number of fibroblasts accumulates. This is a type of skin cells that exert forces on their direct neighbourhood. Normally, skin is elastic and if forces are removed, the skin recovers to its original shape again. However, in the case of burn injuries, the forces can be so strong, that the skin, like other elastic materials, deforms permanently. Hence, contractures, excessive and pathological contractions are developed. Investigating the healing of burn injuries is necessary to obtain more insights and to know which factors can influence wound contraction and scar formation. This could be helpful in order to give a treatment that is better in tune to avoid complications asmuch as possible.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Computational Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Aleo, Ignazio (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Introduction: Clinical gait analysis is used to assess patients' impairments, improve treatment decision-making and monitor patients’ progress. Motion capture of markers placed on the skin is the gold standard technique for gait analysis. Markers referenced to the underlying bones are used to define a biomechanical model, i.e. an anatomical frame for each body segment. Several biomechanical models have been proposed, and none can be considered as ground truth. The outcomes from different biomechanical models provide non comparable data, this hampers data sharing and impedes the full potential of clinical interpretation and treatment recommendation. Objectives: This study explores the differences in biomechanical models’ definitions used for gait analysis and evaluates four harmonisation techniques with the aim to improve kinematic data comparability. Methods: Nine healthy participants performed a walking task. A merged markerset was developed by including three widely adopted biomechanical models: CGM, CAST and LAMB. The harmonisation processes involved three coordinate transformations between anatomical frames based on the calibration trial, the mean of the task trial and the frame-by-frame of the task trial. The fourth harmonisation consisted in inverse kinematics fitting based on the same underlying model (OpenSim). Differences before and after each harmonisation approach were analysed by considering joint kinematics. Results: The differences between the native biomechanical models' definitions reach 23.2° of rotation and 41mm of translation. A systematic difference between models was found, which was higher than between subjects, and varied across the gait cycle with a nonlinear pattern. All harmonisation processes improved kinematic data comparability. No statistically significant difference between the curves was found when results were harmonised with frame-by-frame coordinate transformation. Harmonisation based on inverse kinematics provides comparable results, with the exception of ankle parameters on sagittal plane. Discussion: The nonlinear and gait cycle-dependent systematic difference between biomechanical models is suggested to be due to the soft tissue artefact. As soft tissue artefact varies across the gait cycle and between subjects, it is reasonable that a frame-by-frame harmonisation provides more comparable results, as the dynamic transformation takes into account the nonlinear soft tissue behavior. However, it remains specific for gait. Conclusion: This study provides promising methodologies for kinematic data harmonisation and allows to easily switch between biomechanical models without gaining consensus on which biomechanical model should be mostly used. However, further investigation of soft tissue artefact effects on biomechanical models’ definitions and consequent joint kinematics is still required to approximate the ground truth.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Welding is a joining method for thermoplastic composites (TPCs) that offers multiple advantages over the more traditional methods of mechanical fastening and adhesive bonding. A particularly promising welding technique is ultrasonic welding, which features very short process times as a result of the high heating rates that can be achieved. This spot welding technique is hypothesized to have potential for improved damage tolerance compared to more commonly used continuous welding techniques: in a multi-spot welded joint, evolving damage will need to re-initiate in subsequent spots. The fact that damage initiation will need to occur multiple times might delay overall damage evolution through the joint compared to a continuous welded joint, where damage initiation needs to occur only once. This work is a first exploratory step into the domain of fatigue of multi-spot welded joints in TPCs. Existing research on the fatigue behavior of four-spot welded steel joints in various layouts served as the main reference throughout this research: its methodology was transferred to four-spot welded joints in TPCs. By comparing fatigue behavior across both materials, it was evaluated to what extent existing knowledge and design rules for steel could potentially be transferred to TPCs. Differences were observed in the results obtained for TPC and steel joints. Most notably, in steel joints the dominant failure mode was seen to change from spot fracture to sheet fracture at higher fatigue lives. In TPCs, joints consistently showed spot fracture across all load levels. A different interrelation between layout performances was seen in the steel and thermoplastic composite joints, assumed to be a result of localized material strengthening in the steel joints from interference of adjacent heat-affected zones. These results indicate that existing knowledge on multi-spot welded joints in steel cannot be readily transferred to TPCs, as failure modes and material mechanisms may differ. It was discovered that, when one spot failed prematurely as a result of existing damage in the joint, the remaining layout no longer seemed to have an effect on fatigue life performance. This was attributed to asymmetry in the remaining joint layout, meaning one spot would always become a preferred location for damage initiation and subsequent evolution. Therefore, subsequent damage evolution would only be restricted by a single spot up to the point where the shear strength of the joint was exceeded.","Thermoplastic composites; Ultrasonic welding; Fatigue; Joining; Multi-spot welding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

A design for the PA, which also includes a parallel-combining transformer (PCT), was proposed, taped and tested in the QUBiC Gen8 technology of NXP Semiconductors. The measured results yield a peak output power of 27dBm, power efficiency of 20%, and an adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) of -33.05dBc. In the other concept, the DDRM drives a power mixer (PMIX) which up-converts the DDRM signal to mm-wave frequencies. For the PMIX-based front-end, multiple linearity enhancement techniques were proposed and evaluated using simulations. For both current-mode front-end concepts, an extensive analysis on the theoretical output power and power efficiency limit was performed. Although current-mode operation has a high linearity potential, fully reaching this potential turns out not to be trivial, due to various device non-idealities and imperfect impedance matching.","Mixer; power amplifier; SiGe BiCMOS; intermodulation; balun; pct; Efficiency; linearity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By exposing a photoreactive mixture to a strong UV-pulse, a hydrogel is formed. The shape of this hydrogel is controlled by masking part of the light beam. This process takes place while the Hele-Shaw channel is placed on the stage of a microscope, which allows these hydrogel particles to be viewed and tracked. Improvements were made to increase the accuracy and precision of the experimental set-up. No- tably, the initially present mismatch of intra-pair particle thickness was greatly reduced by changing the method of particle pair production. By tracking these pairs of particles, information is obtained regarding their motions and velocity relative to one another. Experiments were performed for a selection of particle shapes and compared to numerical simulations of identical geometries. Simulations predicted that attractive and repulsive velocities should be noticed depending on the separation distance and shape of the particles. Qualitatively, the experiments agree to a certain extent with the simulations. It was demonstrated that the pairwise interactions are indeed dependent on their shape. Furthermore, the magnitude of these interactions qualitatively matched with the experimental data. Quantitatively, the experimental data did not agree with the simulations, but strong evidence was presented to indicate that the UV-light hitting the sample was not uniformly distributed. This results in a discrepancy in particle thickness between the pair, which skews the experimental data. Novel insights were gained on the applicability of the current literature model on hydrogel particle propagation. In contrast to the current model, it was experimentally demonstrated that the shape and (in-plane) size of the particle affects its thickness.","Stokes flow; Particle pair; Hydrodynamics; Hele-Shaw cell; confined Stokes flow; Hydrodynamic interaction; Stop-flow lithography; SFL; PEG-DA; Fluid scattering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some routing algorithms even use predicted traffic lights states to optimize these routes and to improve the expected travel time. But all these methods optimize the expected travel time and do not take reliability into account. Reliability is a major service indicator and with non-flexible departure or arrival constraints, the value of reliability can increase up to three times the value of time (Markovich, Concas, &amp; Kolpakov, 2009). To use a measure of reliability, not the expected travel time, but the travel time distribution should be known. Since reliability is not uniquely defined, an algorithm is designed with an individual cost function, that gives users the freedom to use their own definition of reliability. Since knowing the traffic light states at intersections could improve the travel time and reliability, this should be used in the algorithm as well. Therefore the main goal of this research is: Designing an urban routing algorithm, that incorporates predicted traffic light states, where the routing is based on the probability distribution of the travel time and an individual cost function that expresses the tradeoff between travel time and reliability. For this research only urban areas with traffic lights are considered, other intersections in this network are not taken into account. The traffic lights are assumed to be traffic lights with a changing cycle time. If this algorithmworks for these traffic lights it will also work for fixed time traffic lights and most other type of traffic lights, since these have less degrees of freedom.","Routing; Traffic light prediction; Reliability; Cost function","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to transplant pancreatic islets, they first need to be separated from the rest of the pancreatic tissue through pancreatic islet isolation procedure. Researchers from the Leiden University medical Center (LUMC) are working on a system, called PancReatic Islet Separation Method (PRISM), that automates large parts of this isolation procedure. During validation studies of the prototype device, PRISM 1.0, two main areas have been identified that can be further improved upon during the development of a version two PRISM device. One of these areas is the need for the ability to identify pancreatic islets from exocrine tissue in a label free, non-destructive an in- or on-line manner, as an alternative for the use of Dithizone (DTZ), a cytotoxic zinc chelating agent which stains the pancreatic islets red. The other area for improvement is to find a solution for the crowding effects, resulting in a disturbed density gradient, from a large volume of tissue in the limited size Latham bowl. In an effort to explore alternative options to identify pancreatic islets from exocrine tissue, a research has been conducted in which optical and electrical properties of both tissues were investigated. To this end, experiments have been performed in which the optical absorption and electrical impedance spectra have been investigated. While some differences between pancreatic islets and exocrine tissue have been measured, the results are within the margin of error, and, therefore, no definitive conclusion has been reached on the usability of these methods for pancreatic islet identification. To overcome the difficulties of a large volume of tissue in the continuous flow centrifuge bowl during the pancreatic islet isolation procedure, research has been done into the optimization of the controllable variables during the creation of sequential and simultaneous density gradients. This research showed that the used tubing could gain more control after applying a treatment protocol and that the developed pump system is linearly progressive and accurate. These findings were then used to re-visit the simultaneous density gradient process, and evaluate the accuracy and repeatability of this process. Ultimately, this process proved to be a robust and reliable method to create simultaneous density gradients, and would, therefore, be able to solve the Latham bowl size limitations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-01","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

It is synthesized through the Haber-Bosch (HB) process, which involves nitrogen and hydrogen reacting at high temperature and pressure and consumes approximately 2% of the global energy supply. An alternative to this energy intensive process is the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). The main challenge of this approach is the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that consumes most of the applied electricity, making the ammonia production inefficient. Based on the Sabatier principle, an ideal catalyst for the NRR would bind nitrogen and ammonia optimally, while hydrogen would be bound too strongly or too weakly, suppressing the HER. So far, no such catalyst has been found. A strategy that could lead to the discovery of a suitable catalyst is alloying, since materials with new adsorption properties can be created this way. The main goal of this project is to design an electrochemical cell that can be used for the screening of large numbers of bimetallic catalysts, increasing the chance of finding a suitable NRR catalyst. For this so-called high-throughput approach an electrochemical cell was designed that allows the screening of up to 16 catalysts in parallel.

The prosthesis was designed to produce sufficient pinch force to be competitive with comparable devices (30 N), and weigh less than a human hand (&lt;0.43 kg). The actuator should function at a high operating pressure (&gt;1.4 MPa) and be compact, such that it fits within the mechanism of the hand. Method: The prosthesis was designed according to a modified V-model design methodology. A prototype was made that embodies the index finger, thumb, and part of the palm. The structural parts were printed using FDM. The actuators were printed in a single step using SLA, requiring only cleaning and curing. To evaluate the performance of the actuators, a set of measurements was carried out, measuring geometrical accuracy, static pressure, and friction in the cylinder. The prototype was tested on pinch force, closing time and weight. Results: Cylinders that are printed at an angle of 90 degrees with respect to the build plate, have a higher roundness that cylinders that are printed at 45 degrees. The actuators were tested at pressures of up to 4.5 MPa, showing no signs of plastic deformation, and have a theoretical maximum pressure of up to 5.9 MPa. While lifting a mass of 6.49 kg, a cylinder friction force of 25.7 N was measured, which is higher than expected. The prototype could reliably deliver a pinch force of 30 N, with a maximum measured value of 41 N. When operating at high pressures, leakage through the piston O-ring seal was not prevented. Conclusion: This study presents the first hydraulic actuation system that is fabricated entirely with 3D printing. A prototype was built to demonstrate that the prosthetic hand that is designed, is able to produce a pinch force of &gt;40 N, showing that it can compete with similar devices. Its mass (0.35 kg without pump and battery) is less than that of a human hand. Controlling friction and leakage remains a serious concern due to the geometrical accuracy of 3D printing.

There are many different ways of UTES installation, however there are two which are widely used in the Netherlands: 1) Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (open systems) which are based on heat-transfer by convection and 2) Borehole Heat Exchangers (closed systems) which are based on heat-transfer by conduction. While the way of transferring heat differs, they both need vertically drilled boreholes to reach a certain storage depth. These boreholes are drilled close to, or underneath, pile-founded buildings. The drilling of boreholes influence in-situ soil stresses around them, which might influence the bearing capacity of the piles. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the influence of installing UTES systems on the bearing capacity of piles. This is done by: 1) investigating the stress changes in sand due to the drilling of boreholes (stress analysis) and 2) the influence of these stress changes on the bearing capacity of piles (bearing capacity analysis). All of the modelling was done in PLAXIS, by using the 2D-axisymmetric model for the first part and the 3D plane strain model for the second part. An advanced soil model for sand was used, with soil mechanical behavior according to the Hardening Soil small strain model. The stress analysis consists out of a parameter sensitivity analysis, including the key parameters: back-fill grout shrinkage and expansion, Over-Consolidation Ratio and Relative Density. After this, the influence of the borehole fluid pressure and borehole diameter on the stress states were investigated. As not all boreholes are drilled perfectly, the last part of the stress-analysis takes into account drilling complications. The bearing capacity analysis includes simulations of static pile load tests of non-displacement piles. Load-displacements curves are produced for several scenario's: 1) perfectly drilled boreholes, 2) boreholes with drilling complications, 3) influence of a soft soil layer and 4) displacement piles and the influence of a varying installation phasing. The results indicate no large effects of perfectly drilled boreholes on bearing capacity of piles located outside a zone of 1.5 times the borehole diameter. For boreholes with drilling complications, the bearing capacity is influenced for piles located in a zone of influence of only several meters (2-6m), depending on the severity of the complication. At last, loaded piles of existing buildings are extremely sensitive for stress changes due to the drilling process, which will cause severe loss of bearing capacity.","bearing capacity; (non-)displacement piles; UTES; boreholes; ATES; BHE; BTES; drilling complications","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

(mentor); van Kessel, Thijs (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The North Sea is a heavily used area, with wind parks, shipping routes, fishing, sand mining, and many future constructions planned. The Dutch Coastal Zone, the area of the North Sea containing the Dutch coast, is home to several natural areas, alongside extensive human-built flood defenses. Maintaining balance between these areas requires that we understand the complex dynamics of the system. This way, we can efficiently build what is required, while preserving the natural areas and their ecosystems. The Dutch Coastal Zone is about 70km wide, running parallel to the Dutch coast. It is relatively shallow and periodically stratified between the Rhine outflow at Rotterdam and IJmuiden. Its seabed mostly consists of sand (median grain size ~ 300 μm), with a fraction of fine sediment (median grain size &lt; 63 μm) varying in space and time. The fine sediment fraction is important for the ecological functioning of the area, as turbidity strongly increases when it is suspended in the water column which hinders light penetration. Fine sediments are also responsible for the siltation of approach channels to important ports in the area. The yearly climate can be divided into a summer and a winter period, where the winter period has higher waves and wind speeds than the summer period. Previous research has shown that there is a higher concentration of fine sediment in the water column in winter, which is likely caused by the more frequent occurrence of storms and/or patterns in biological activity. However, the exact dynamics of fine sediments during these storms are still incompletely understood. It is also unclear how sediment stirred up by human interference behaves, and how it is transported through the system. This project sets out to analyze the behavior of fine sediments in the water column due to storms in the Dutch Coastal Zone, using a combination of field data and modeling. To interpret this data, we conceptualize the seabed using the two-layer model concept of van Kessel et al (2011). In this model, a thin top layer, consisting purely of fines, resides on top of a thicker lower layer, which is composed of a mixture of sand and fines. This expresses the heterogeneity in the vertical sediment distribution, caused by the mixture of sediment sizes. In this model, we assume that the top layer, called the ‘fluff layer’, is resuspended at every tide and deposited again during slack when conditions are calmest. The lower layer, called the ‘buffer layer’, is much more stable, eroding only during very energetic conditions such as storms. With existing knowledge of fine sediment dynamics, we created a theoretical model of the response of the seabed. Initially, both the fluff and buffer layer contain fine sediment. During the storm, the fluff and part of the buffer are eroded. When the sediment settles, the sand settles first followed by the fine sediment. The resulting bed is stratified by settling velocity, and the fines which were stored in the portion of the buffer layer that was eroded are now in the fluff layer. Gradually by some process, the portion of fines eroded from the buffer layer during the storm is re-entrained into the buffer layer. We assume that for each tidal cycle following the storm, the maximum suspended sediment measured is representative of what is available in the fluff layer. This suspended amount decreases over time, and through this value we can follow the recovery of the system. We quantify reaction to storms and subsequent recovery from our theoretical model using data gathered off the coast of Egmond aan Zee over 2 years in 10.5 m water depth, using a frame equipped with sensors in the bottom 2 m. Storms are defined in this project as energetic events (wave heights &gt; 1 m at 1 km offshore), with clear peaks. We analyze individual events, and briefly touch on the effects of storms occurring in succession. We observe in the field data that individual storm events have corresponding peaks in suspended sediment near the bottom. Over several tidal cycles following the storm, the sediment concentrations gradually decrease until prestorm conditions are reached. This decrease per tide can be described with an exponential decay function, with a decay constant of around 0.1 per half tidal cycle, which appears to fluctuate seasonally by ± 0.03. A computational model, delwaq and Delft-3D, was used to determine the impact of advection on the reaction and recovery from the storm. We use a closed cell 1 dimensional model, with realistic boundary conditions, to determine the impact of advection which plays a role in the recovery of the storm. From the model we also determine that a varying floc size may be responsible for the reaction of SPM to storm conditions observed in the field data.","fine sediment; storms; dutch coastal zone; Egmond aan zee; fine sediment dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Nowadays environmental issues like the depletion of the natural resources and the pollution of the environment have led many researchers to make new projects about the reuse of waste from construction and demolition again in concrete industry. Among available solutions are the partial replacement of cement with recycled ultrafine particles (RUP) and the reuse of recycled sand (RS) as substitute of natural sand in mortar/concrete mixtures. The aim of the present research is to investigate if the new mortar with recycled ultrafine particles can substitute the reference mortar made of virgin materials and to investigate the possible accompanying ecological and economic benefits. This will be demonstrated in terms of technical feasibility, ecology and economy of the new mortars. For the investigation of the main target of this MSc thesis, it was important three different experiments to be conducted. The 1st and 2nd experiment included the partial substitution of cement with RUP in 5%,10% and 15% respectively. The only difference was the size of RUP. In the 1st experiment were used only RUP below 125 microns and in the 2nd experiment only milled RUP below 45 microns. The 3rd experiment was more complicated with the simultaneous presence of RUP below 125 microns and the total replacement of natural sand with recycled sand. The w/b ratio was constant for the first two experiments at 0,5, but the w/c was increased as the replacement ratio of RUP also increased for all the experiments. The results were excellent about the fresh workability of the mortars in all the experiments with higher values of slump in contrast to the reference one from virgin materials. But there were some problems about the mechanical properties and especially the compressive strengths of the new mortars. The usage of smaller RUP below 45 microns improve the mechanical properties of the mortars with the highlight of the higher values for all the mortars in the test of flexural strength in the measurement after 14 days. Generally, it seems that as the replacement ratio of RUP was increased, the compressive strength of the mortars was decreased. For the 3rd experiment, the results regarding the mechanical properties were not very satisfactory despite the compensation with extra water. The quantity of this water has a crucial role for future researches and additionally lower replacement ratio than 100% is suggested for recycled sand.The next step was to reveal the possible ecological advantages from usage of this new mortar with recycled cement paste. For this investigation, an ecological analysis was conducted. This ecological analysis included in the first part a simulation in the lab experiments and in the second part a simulation in a conceptual recycling plant. The results are pleasant for the both cases regarding the GHG emissions and especially CO2. Initially, in the lab experiments, 5 % substitution with RUP instead of cement particles leads to 5,1% reduction of CO2 emissions, 10% substitution with RUP leads to 10,2% reduction of CO2 emissions and 15 % substitution with RUP leads to 14,8% reduction of CO2 emissions. Moreover, for the simulation of a conceptual recycling plant, the reuse of RUP in the mortar/concrete industry can lead to significant reduction of CO2 and less air pollution. Especially for the scenario in this MSc thesis, there is a potential environmental gain with total CO2 offset of 70,75 ton/day from this conceptual recycling plant. Up-to-day, the calcination of limestone to produce cement contributes to the emission of carbon dioxide. But the usage of recycled cement paste can reduce this bad consequence. The last step the investigation for the potential economic benefits from the reuse of the recycled materials and especially RUP in mortar/concrete industry. For this business case, an integration of Cost-Benefit Analysis with Cash-Flows was conducted for the previous conceptual recycling plant. According to this economic analysis, there are benefits from the creation of market for RUP, recycled sand and coarse aggregate like gravel and their demand as well as from the compensation by the European Union due to the reduction in CO2 emissions in this innovative conceptual recycling plant. The results revealed that the NPV was 5.955.631€ &gt;0 for forecast of 18 year-operation. This can lead to a great payback period of the investment of about 33 months without the calculation of the taxation inside and with the conceptual discount rate at 10%. It has great perspectives for circular economy, with less waste, reuse of materials, less consumption of natural resources and less carbon emissions.In conclusion, although some technical drawbacks, the usage of RUP in new mortars instead of cement seems very satisfactory, and especially smaller RUP have beneficial effect to the mechanical properties of the mortar. Recycled sand is a material that needs more investigation about the appropriate parameters. The reuse of recycled materials and especially RUP contribute to some ecological advantages regarding the CO2 emissions. Also, there are possibilities for economic benefits for recycling plants with RUP as targeted material in products leading to the potential model of circular economy. Finally, RUP and other recycled materials can be the basis for sustainable and green development. Hence, recycled cement paste has as an impact the development of sustainable mortar in this industry.","Mortar; recycling; concrete; recycled ultrafine particles; recycled sand; Sustainabilty; Cement; CO2 Emissions; Economic analysis; green development; ecological effects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

These two consecutive events are different in nature and sometimes ask for counter-productive policy interventions: where the epidemic can be contained by ensuring social distancing practices, reducing the number of contacts, and offering hygienic conditions, the response to a natural hazard requires evacuation, which often leads to overcrowded shelters with a questionable hygiene. An exploratory agent-based model is constructed where the dynamics of these socio-technical systems are integrated to find high-level emergent behaviour over time during the response phase of a sudden-onset disaster. The study describes a stylistic agent-based model that combines three socio-technical systems, their interactions and system behaviour to find general trends and interdependencies. The three sub systems comprise of a COVID-19 component, based on the SEIR approach, a livelihood component, which mimics a microeconomic marketing mechanism and accounts for among others difference in occupation, and a hazard component, which is responsible for the evacuation process. The following research question is answered: What robust policy interventions can be identified that balance livelihood of rural communities and their exposure to COVID-19 during the response to a sudden-onset disaster in developing countries? The goal is to find robust policy interventions that can be executed by either local governments or humanitarian organizations and are suitable for poor rural communities in developing countries. Four policy interventions were compared: cash transfers, an awareness campaign, increasing the number of shelters, and varying the moment of imposing a lockdown. With the use of Exploratory Modelling and Analysis, an experimental design was constructed to identify uncertainties and model behaviour. Results show that using direct and unconditional cash transfers in combination with increased awareness have most beneficial effects for the average livelihood and also positively influence the COVID-19 trajectory. Increasing awareness shows best results for containing COVID-19, but is dependent on context factors such as regular testing and implementation before the the virus spirals out of control. Awareness also negatively influences the average livelihood. This research is a first step in modelling compound risk of COVID-19 and sudden-onset disasters. The modular way of building makes this research useful not only for searching trade-offs in developing countries, but can be used in other contexts as well.","Agent-Based Modeling; Deep uncertainty; Exploratory Modelling and Analysis; Covid-19; Livelihood; disaster response","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Derako faces the challenge of high production of waste, over 50% of their bought wood ends up as waste, additionally over 6500 kilograms of plastic waste is being produced. In their industry, Derako is not alone. The construction industry is considered a highly polluting industry, responsible for 50% of all raw material usage and 35% of the CO2 generated in the Netherlands. The industry is reacting by slowly adopting ways to improve their sustainable performace. One of the main topics is the Circular Economy. This thesis will provide an answer to the research question at hand, namely, how can Derako become a more sustainable business in the future? It will aim to do so by closely collaborating with Derako employees, to ensure a good fit. In order to fully understand the industry Derako is operating in, a thorough analysis has been conducted. Several stakeholders in their process, such as architects, contractors and installers have been interviewed, alongside several employees of Derako. The sales process of Derako proves to be complex, several of the aforementioned stakeholders influence the decision making, while their interests vary greatly. As the construction industry is developing, several trends are showing. An analysis of these trends has uncovered potentially interesting directions for Derako to pursue. The Circular Economy would be the foundation of this development, as it shows to be a highly relevant and promising topic in the industry, providing many options for product development. Together with Derako, through the means of co-creations session, the trend directions were discussed. The direction of flexible and modular buildings was deemed most relevant to develop into a vision. During this co-creation, participants set out to develop a vision which would be guiding for the strategy and roadmap. During the development of the strategy, the vision would be split in two parts. One part focussing on waste reduction, the other focussing on a circular product line. The waste reduction plan has been developed as a method to provide tangible handles for waste reduction. The current waste streams, mainly wood and plastic waste have been mapped roughly. Tests have been designed to collect more detailed information on those waste streams. The waste reduction plan sets specific goals in three horizons with the final horizon ending in 2030. For the non-renewable waste, a reduction of 50% has been set, as for wood waste a reduction of 90% has been set. In these goals, finding high value applications for the wood waste is also considered a reduction. The circular product roadmap describes the development of a circular product line, in which a standardized product is central. This product minimizes variation on materials, sizes and finished, therefore creating a product that facilitates easy reuse. Alongside the circular product line, a return shipping method has been developed. This has been treated facilitate wasteless shipping of Derako product, drastically reducing the amount of plastic and wood waste. Combined, the waste reduction plan and circular product roadmap provide Derako with practical handles to drastically increase sustainable performance.","Sustainability; Roadmapping; Strategy; Wood; Co-creation; Construction Industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Integrating social acceptance into the long-term planning of energy projects is necessary to lower the risks. However, it is hard to assess the future acceptance of energy consumers in different sustainable energy options. Also, different stakeholders always have different opinions and concerns on the public accepted solutions, which causes conflicts in negotiation in the planning and decision-making phases. This research employed a participatory modelling approach to forecast the possible future developments in the district heating network in Amsterdam Southeast concerning the value changes.

Looking back into the history of hand prosthetics many body powered prosthetic hands housed a couple of innovative design choices to increase the functionality. Some examples of this are the Pringle-Kirk arm and the Despinasse hand. As a counter reaction to this movement, a new body powered prosthetic hand is designed. The new prosthetic hand will be based on the innovative solutions of the past and will bring back more functionalities to the body powered prosthetics. The new design housed fingers made out of cylindrical springs, in combination with leaf springs. This is all actuated via a dependency mechanism in the hand palm, this combination allows for very flexible fingers that can grab complexly shaped objects and still offer a multi finger grip. The first tests revealed that the leaf springs limited the motion of the fingers and further testing without the leaf springs showed a setup with only cylindrical springs was a better solution. The second test was focused on pinch force, although the maximum acquired pinch force was not high, a sturdy grip should be possible based on literature, this does need further testing to validate. For the continuing of the prototyping testing of the dependency mechanism was done, initial testing at a larger scale showed promising results, little to no loss of force. The conclusion that can be drawn based on these tests is that there are certainly parts of prosthetic hands of the past that are worth taking a closer look at.","prosthesis design; body powered; hand","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The system currently implemented in the finishing mill is called STORM (Smart Temperature Optimization on the Run out table for Mechanical property control) and was created and fully implemented this year. This control system computes one setup based on the estimated maximum speed and properties of the head of the slab at the time of entering the finishing mill and is based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA). To accommodate for variations over the length of a steel slab, manual action is required. In order to automate this process, the aim is to further develop the system to enable computation of setups for multiple samples over the length of the slab within the limited time available between a slab entering the finishing mill and the start of the cooling process. For this purpose, this thesis introduces three precomputation extensions that incorporate the concept of a warm start with different methods to incorporate knowledge of the problem: STORM-Trained on a Single Model, STORM-Trained on Multiple Models and STORM-Trained on Multiple Objectives. The baseline is taken to be STORM-Uninformed, that uses no prior knowledge to compute multiple setups. The new methods are compared based on four different product recipes with respect to the fitness of the optimal setup found by the solver and the number of iterations required to obtain a useful setup. A setup is assumed to be useful when it is at most 1.2 times the known optimum of a problem instance. The experiments conducted to compare the three mentioned extensions show that when optimizing for samples over the length of the run-out table STORM-TMM outperforms both other methods, though for problem instances with two domains a population size of 200 is required for precomputation and even then not always a useful setup is found within the iteration limit. For optimization for different sets of objectives there is an even greater distinction in the results for problem instances with one and two domains. For the former, the multi-objective algorithm STORM-TMO most definitely performs best, where for the latter STORM-TSM performs best. Again when computing a setup for two domains, a useful setup is not always found. In conclusion, the multi-objective methods STORM-TMM and STORM-TMO can be used for sample setup computation for problems with one domain after some final checks. For problems with multiple domains, additional research is required.","Genetic Algorithm - GA; Optimisation Algorithms; Control systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-13","","","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Heineken Company, known as Heineken, is a global and family-owned brewing company of Dutch heritage. With more than 300 different high quality beers and ciders and 167 breweries around the world, consumers are enjoying their products in more than 190 countries. Heineken Netherlands Supply (HNS) is a regional Operating Company (OPCO) and with three breweries in the Netherlands, HNS supplies Heineken products to their customers, including Heineken Germany (HGER). The supply chain between HNS and HGER is used as a case study for this thesis. <br/><br/>This supply chain is a Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) in which Returnable Packaging Materials (RPM) such as crates, are circulating through the supply chain. Heineken, including HNS and HGER, aspires to continuously eliminate inefficiencies and charge future growth through strategic investments and initiatives. <br/><br/>Nowadays, production volumes for the German market are growing increasingly and supply chains are under pressure since they are required to be faster, more flexible, more efficient and consumers have high expectations regarding product availability. Hence, strategic decisions regarding supply chains have become more important and featuring reliable data to measure Key Performance Indicators is essential. Therefore, Heineken is planning on introducing Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) gateways to measure actual crate cycle times, since they are currently based on assumptions. <br/><br/>Scope<br/>The HKR Cluster crate will be the first RPM Stock-Keeping-Unit (SKU) which is going to be tracked through the supply chain, since the largest beer volume of the total volume for the German market (33%) are kept in this SKU. The initial idea is to install the RFID gateways and at 3 main locations: <br/><br/>• Brewery in Den Bosch (Netherlands)<br/>• LCDB: Logistic center in Den Bosch (Netherlands)<br/>• Warehouse in Werne (Germany)<br/> <br/>For the purpose of this master thesis a scope and system boundaries have to be defined. A figure is presents the CLSC between HNS and HGER. The scope is limited to the three main locations in the Reverse Logistics (RL) flow of the CLSC. Since the HKR Cluster crate is considered to be the first RPM SKU to be tracked, this research will focus on this type of RPM. <br/><br/>Objective and Method<br/>From the initiative to implement RFID gateways, it can be concluded that there is not enough RPM visibility and information transparency in the supply chain, which results in lack of integral RPM flow control. Improvement in this area can make the supply chain intelligent and more efficient. In literature, digital twins are found to be explored as a means of improving performance of physical entities. A digital twin is a virtual representation of a real entity and the concept has gained much interest over the years. The world of supply chain and logistics is lagging behind when it comes to adapting digital possibilities to current conditions. Therefore, the objective of this master thesis is to enable supply chain control of RPM flows using data provided by the RFID gateways, from a Digital Twin design perspective. The research is driven by the ambition and visions for digital transformation in supply chains.<br/><br/>To obtain the research objective the following main research question is defined: How can real-time control in the reversed supply chain be enabled, with use of RFID data?. To answer the main research question multiple sub research questions are defined and are used as guidance through the thesis. A current state analysis will help to understand how the supply chain currently operates and performs. Based on this analysis a Digital Supply Chain Twin (D-SC-T) framework for the current supply chain is proposed. Then, a mathematical model for control is proposed and simulations are done in MATLAB. The impact of control will be assessed and evaluated by comparison of financial Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) in the current state (no control) with the future state financial KPI's (control).<br/><br/>Current state analysis<br/>Before systems are modelled or designed, a current system states analysis is performed to determine how the current supply chain operates. The analysis confirms the earlier found inefficiencies in the current state. The cycle times are based on assumptions and approximate to be 25 weeks, which is considered to be high. This is because the average time spent at the locations is high due to large inventories. There are large safety stocks to avoid out of stock situations, while there is limited storage capacity. It is very common that at the inventory locations, LCDB and warehouse, the storage space is at full capacity and an external storage location has to be rented. Furthermore, the planning for production at the brewery is made a relatively long time in advance and therefore lacks flexibility. It can be concluded that there is little RPM visibility throughout the supply chain and data availability for planning departments. Change in demand, weather and events can cause inaccurate forecasting. In conclusion, there is no centralized control of inventory levels in the current supply chain.<br/><br/>Heineken’s reversed supply chain, driven by returnable packaging, is defined to be a push-based supply chain. Crates are pushed through the channel from the location where it is returned by the customer up to the brewery. Every supply chain agent has its own priorities and inventory management preferences. This can lead to unnecessary inventory costs. <br/><br/>Design<br/>Digital twins are found to be explored by means of improving performance of physical entities by using models combined with various data to interpret and to predict the behavior of a real system. Therefore, digital twins have the potential to increase the intelligence of a specific environment. This leads to the motivation of digital twins of supply chains. First steps towards D-SC-T creation are done by proposing a framework according to its functions and requirements. <br/><br/>The prediction function includes analysis of the behaviour of the supply chain before actual run-time. Planned crate flow processes are simulated prior to the actual transportation decisions in the supply chain system (pro-active planning). Consequently, supply chain parameters can be tested, while potential impacts on the supply chain performance can be evaluated. The monitoring function enables optimization when models are enriched with real-time data from physical sources, such as RFID. Therefore, the RFID gateways allow tracking and supervision of the current states of crate flow and inventory at the main locations. The RFID data, including live positional data from the crates, can be fed into the digital twin. If the current state measurements deviate from the preferred state, transportation decisions in the supply chain system can be calculated (re-active planning). Supply chain performance and behaviour diagnosis is usually enabled after an event and is done by data analysis. <br/><br/>Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a control strategy, by means of controlling a process based on some form of model. Literature shows that the digital twin and MPC have similarities in the way they capture and interpret the current state of the physical system and being able to use that current state to change the future state. Therefore, MPC seems a very suitable option for control of the inventory levels of the supply chain within the digital twin framework. A centralized MPC control model for the control of inventory levels and crate flows within Heineken's reversed supply chain is proposed. <br/><br/>The described MPC control model has the objective to optimize the supply chain performance by reducing Operating Expenditures (OPEX) and Capital Expenditures (CAPEX). The controller will accurately keep track of where crates are located in the supply chain and calculate the related OPEX and CAPEX, while meeting the requirements.<br/><br/>Results<br/>Simulation experiments are done to be able to quantify the impact of control on the supply chain in OPEX and CAPEX. In the experiments, the controller reacts to disturbances and unforeseen events, while optimizing inventory levels and meeting demand. This is demonstrated by 3 scenarios. <br/><br/>• Scenario 1: Current supply chain with actual events LCDB: Logistic center in Den Bosch (Netherlands)<br/>• Scenario 2: Current supply chain with disturbance: peak in demand<br/>• Scenario 3: Supply chain with additional RFID gateway location with disturbance: capacity limitation<br/><br/>A Table presents the simulation results for all scenarios and are presented including the results for the same scenarios with no control. When comparing the results of current supply chain with actual events, the most remarkable result is the difference in the location where inventory is allocated. In the base case scenario, the crate inventory levels are much higher at the LCDB, while with MPC control, the results show higher inventory levels at the warehouse. These more detailed results are shown in Chapter \ref{chap:Simulation and Results}. In the second scenario the simulated event is an unforeseen high beer demand due to weather changes. The controller reacts to the occurring event and meets the demand at the brewery in time. In the third scenario the effect of having more supply chain information by including one additional RFID gateway location is determined. More detailed results and explanations on how the controller reacts to various events are provided in Chapter \ref{chap:Simulation and Results}.<br/><br/><br/>Conclusion, Discussion and Recommendations<br/>This thesis has created insights on what a digital supply chain is and what the effect of control can be on the supply chain performance. The controllability of the crate flows in Heineken’s reversed supply chain driven by returnable packaging can be improved, using a centralized MPC control model within the proposed digital twin framework, combined with RFID data from the proposed gateways. These gateways measure crate positions and quantities per time. The controller uses this data to interpret and predict the supply chain behaviour. The RFID data of the current supply chain states are fed into the model. The controller interprets the states and calculates which actions lead to less CAPEX and OPEX, while meeting the modeling requirements. Due to the RFID measurements, data is visible and transparent for planning departments and other stakeholders and better coordination along supply chain agents can be made possible. <br/><br/>For this research MPC is the chosen control method for the control part within the digital twin. Therefore it only covers a small part of the wide variety of different control methods which could have been investigated and tested. Other control methods are still to be investigated.<br/><br/>This thesis offers a theoretical digital twin solution for the problems they have at Heineken’s CLSC. But only a solution for the measure and control part has been brought forward. A digital twin also carries out big data analytics and machine learning possibilities. How these growing technologies fit into the digital twin concept could be interesting for further research.<br","Digital Twin; Real Time Control; Supply Chain; Radio Frequency Identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In recent years, quantum computers have become increasingly popular, with high-profile companies in-vesting more and more resources into the development of quantum-computing prototypes. Such interest is motivated by the exponential increase in the computing power that quantum computers offer over classical computers, which may be used in several practical applications, such as producing faster and more accurate solutions to machine learning algorithms, the quantum simulations of molecules for drug and material synthesis, techniques that combat cybersecurity threats, and more. Quantum processors are typically placed in a dilution refrigerator, which cools down the processor to near absolute zero to make use of their quantum behavior. These fridges are large in scale and require multiple long wires from the processor to the readout/control equipment, which mostly resides at room temperature. However, although this approach is suitable for currently available systems with few quantum bits (qubits), it is unpractical for future quantum computers, with thousands or millions of qubits, due to the interconnect bottleneck. One solution isto move the readout/control circuits closer to the processor to avoid the need for bulky unreliable interconnects. However, this has proven to be difficult due to the limited cooling power of the fridges, which is below a few Watts at 4 K and below a few mW at temperatures below 100 mK. These limitations stress the need for low power readout/control circuitry of the processor as the number of qubits in a single processor increases. This thesis focuses on an ultra-low-power cryogenic amplifier design for the readout of spin qubits.Only recently, the cryogenic performance of Silicon-Germanium Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors (SiGe HBT) has been demonstrated to be specifically suited for the cryogenic readout of spin qubits, because of their ultra-low-power and their high sensitivity. This thesis focuses on the standard SiGe HBT available in the IHP 0.13μm SG13G2 BiCMOS process and on an optimized variant with modified doping profiles for enhanced current gain. As a first step, a comprehensive cryogenic (4 K or 15 K) DC characterization of the SiGe HBTs, CMOS transistors, and resistors is performed. This data proves the suitability of such technology for cryogenic application and will enable the future integration of a complete qubit readout, including SiGe front-end amplification and CMOS back-end post-processing. The measurement results of the SiGe HBT characterization show outstanding cryogenic performance for low power applications, with an attain-able current gain in the standard HBT of 100, 500, and 1000 at a power dissipation of 61nW, 2μW and 30μW,respectively, and, for the modified HBT, of 100, 500 and 1000 at a power dissipation of 5.5nW, 90nW, and140nW, respectively. To mimic the spin qubit readout, a discrete amplifier employing a SiGe HBT produced in the IHP SG13G2process has been built and used to characterize a single-electron transistor (SET), with both the SET and the amplifier operating at 4 K. By comparing the charge-stability diagram measured with room-temperature equipment, the proper operation of the proposed amplifier is demonstrated. Furthermore, the amplifier characterization showed a gain &gt; 40 dB with an 113 kHz -3-dB bandwidth, and Signal-Noise Ratio (SNR)above 10 dB for a total measurement time of t&lt;10μs, thus demonstrating performance compatible with the requirements for single-shot readout in state-of-the-art spin-qubit computers. Overall, the results show the capabilities of the SiGe HBT in low power cryogenic applications as well as the capabilities of the 0.13μmBiCMOS technology for the future full integration of qubit readout schemes.","SiGe BiCMOS; Spin Qubits; Cryogenic; Characterisation; Quantum Computing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-01-12","","","","","",""

This thesis report studies the practical implementation of employing three autonomous vehicles to navigate towards a signal emitting source in an unknown environment. The group of autonomous vehicles is assigned to drive towards the source in a coordinated formation shape whilst avoiding an obstacle. Therefore, a control algorithm is developed that is required to be suitable for a non-holonomic unicycle. As an experimental platform for the algorithm, the Husarion ROSbot is used. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, simulations are run in a Gazebo simulator environment. To achieve the stated research objective, the problem is broken down into three sub-objectives: source seeking, obstacle avoidance, and formation control. First, two types of source seeking approaches for unicycles are implemented to investigate how each approach affects the source seeking performance. Thereafter, an obstacle avoidance algorithm is developed to combine with both source seeking approaches. [19] is used as a framework to create a hybrid adaptive feedback (HAF) law to avoid an obstacle, with the location and orientation of the obstacle w.r.t. the source is not assumed to be known a priori. Subsequently, two follower vehicles are introduced to study how to enable a group of vehicles to drive in a coordinated formation to the source while avoiding an obstacle. Finally, the algorithm developed in this thesis is empirically shown in simulations not to suffer from convergence to a detrimental line M that would occur with an artificial potential function approach, as described by [24]. The follower vehicles employ a decentralized leader-follower strategy to maintain formation shape and successfully avoid an obstacle.","Non-holonomic mobile robots; Source seeking; Hybrid adaptive feedback; Formation control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

For the flood defence system of the Netherlands, an important consequence of climate change is the sea level rise. Marine locks are large, rigid, and intricate structures, with a required lifespan of at least 100 years, for which often design decisions have to be made for many decades, which is not made easy by the uncertainty of sea level rise. In this thesis, it is first analysed by means of a probabilistic model how sea level rise alters the failure probability of a marine lock, and at what degree of sea level rise the safety norm is reached. This analysis also results in knowledge on the critical lock characteristics which are required to be improved once the safety norm is reached. Once the safety norm of a lock has been reached, the lock can either be adapted, or completely replaced. Adaptation concepts were developed to improve the critical lock characteristics. To compare these adaptations to the lock replacement, an adaptive pathways map was drafted, which visualises the implementation of adaptations and replacement in regard to the sea level rise development. It was found that the application of a minor adaptation is always preferable over a replacement, but that the benefits of a drastic adaptation depends on the functional and structural state of a lock. When a lock eventually has to be replaced, because of sea level rise or any other reason, the question still remains how to implement the uncertainty of sea level rise into the design. Instead of designing for a conservative sea level rise scenario, one can create an adaptive design. This is a structure which can be adapted over time, meaning costs are saved in case of a mild sea level rise scenario, but the lock can still be made sufficient in case of a severe scenario. Again, an adaptive pathways map was drafted to compare the application of a conservative lock to several adaptive lock alternatives. Unfortunately, no general recommendation can be made for adaptive lock designs, as the advantages and disadvantages of the alternatives depend on the specifics of a lock.","Marine locks; Sea level rise; Probabilistic analysis; Adaptive design; Adaptive pathways map","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

While it can be due to both shallow and deep subsurface processes, the shallow subsidence is mainly a result from compaction, oxidation and/or groundwater drainage. Moreover, for grasslands on organic soils, in particular pastures on drained peat soils, the vertical position of the ground level is subject to significant temporal variability. Temporal scales of the vertical motion are expected to vary between days and centuries, and spatial scales between millimeters and kilometers. Unfortunately, performing precise, reliable, and representative geodetic measurements of shallow subsidence processes is very difficult for soils, as fixed benchmarks do not exist. Here we propose an insitu measurement procedure for grass-covered soils using laser scanning, both terrestrial and airborne, using a vertically fixed reference platform. We show that for terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) it is possible to detect changes in the vertical position of soils with a systematic error of up to 2.6 mm and a standard deviation of 0.4 mm. Given a predefined level of significance of 훼 =0.05 (confidence level of 95%) and a detectability power of 훾 =90%, we achieve a minimal detectable vertical deformation (MDD) of 21.1 mm in our study area. We show that the results are influenced by the grass density and length, the incidence angle of the laser beam, as well as other settings of the laser scanner. We find that the parameter settings of the method for estimating soil surface, and subsequently the subsidence, has an influence on the results and related statistics. For airborne laser scanning (ALS), using a precisely leveled reference platform, we find that the quality of elevation estimates is still limited, requiring further considerations on the design of data acquisition surveys and the reference platforms. Our results demonstrate the ability of laser scanning technology for investigating shallow subsurface motion of grass-covered soils relative to a benchmark on a local scale. Based on the quality assessment, the detection of vertical ground level change is better understood in terms of time and probability. In future research, the factors affecting terrestrial laser scanning technology to accurately identify soils affected by vegetation, environment, and device condition, should be further studied.","Subsidence; Laser scanning technology; IGRS; peat soils","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The high range of lime applications generates many limitations based on the content criteria set by the consumers and varies according to the requirement and further use of the lime. According to the European lime association (2017), one of the highest lime uses is on steel production; 40% of the total world production is sold to the steel industry each year. The quality requirements for the lime to be used to produce steel are strict, setting the target for the obtention of lime with a high concentration of CaO and low presence of prejudicial impurities such as phosphorus or sulfur. Calgov lime production plant is located in the south of Spain. It supplies local and national consumers of lime and has been operating for approximately 35 years. The steel manufacturing industry is one of the major clients of the plant consuming about 50% of the total installed capacity. This industry's quality requirements are a significant concern for the plant, and the obtention of limestone with low phosphorus content one of the primary targets for the company's future. Currently, the plant is under high pressure to find and extract limestone with low content of P2O5, below 0.039%, which is the limit set by the client. Seeking to comply with quality and quantity, the plant has performed exploratory work in the southern area of the deposit in which resources of limestone that meet this target are found. In this work, a mine design and scheduling options for the extraction of the south area of Calgov deposit extraction is presented based on the composition requirements set for the limestone. Furthermore, a techno-economic analysis of the extraction scenarios is developed exploring different alternatives to deal with the lack of information about some areas of the deposit and alternatives to ensure a constant feed of lime to the plant, avoid over costs and increase the possible economic return.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Background: Accessing targets through complex trajectories with multiple curves in series, remains challenging today in many application fields, like surgery, the Fukushima disaster, maintenance of complex tube networks, mining and space operations. Current steerable devices require control of an extensive amount of segments, while moving as a whole through the environment. In contrast, growth-from-the-tip devices move only at the tip by creating a solidified support structure, allowing for active curvature creation at any point of the trajectory with limited effect on the environment. However, reversible and accurate growth remain challenging for these type of devices.Method: Competitive design requirements are setup and quantified. Subsequently, a broad concept generation is performed, based on the ACRREX (i.e. Abstracting, Categorizing, Reflecting, Reformulating and Extending ) method. After selection of one working principle, a proof-of-principle is designed, prototyped and evaluated. Based on the outcome, a second prototype is created and evaluated again. Evaluation of both prototypes comprise accuracy measurements, based on the ratio of path deviation from a kinematic model and insertion length. Moreover, load bearing capacity of the support structure, forces acting on the environment and overall performance are assessed.Results: The selected concept is based on everting chains, driven by torque at the tip and consisting of two chains with lockable sliding hinged joints. Both prototypes successfully show reversible and steerable growth-from-the-tip, by the fact that counter rotation of the tip gears resulted in a translation of the tip, while differential rotation of the gears resulted in curvature creation. Prototype I (PI) had an accuracy of 4.5% for pure translations and 6.2% to 8.1% for the formation of two sequential (90 degrees) curvatures. Prototype II (PII), which was not fully operational, had a deviation per insertion length of 2.9% for a single curvature and to 10.7% to 19.1% for a combination of translations and curvatures in series. Even though the shape-locks of Prototype I had 3 degrees play per joint and a limiting amount of locking positions, the average orthogonal load bearing capacity was high (49N) with an accompanied deformation of maximally 8 degrees. In contrast, the friction-locked drum brakes of Prototype II rotated up to 70 degrees, by both deformation (22%) and slippage (78%) at a load of 20N. A rotation of 25 degrees was reached at an average load of 7.3N. Normal forces acting on the environment during movement were only measured for Prototype I, resulting in direct distortions (78%) of &lt;4N and indirect distortions (22%) of &lt;0.36N. Moreover, both prototypes had comparable elongation rates (PI: 92.9mm/min, PII: 156mm/min), extension rates (PI: 2.6mm/mm, PII: 0.9mm/mm) and widths (PI: 268mm, PII: 270mm). Lastly, a minimal inner curvature of zero and a minimal outer curvature equal to the device’s width were realized, due to the presence of sliding hinged joints.Conclusion and discussion: Both prototypes performed reversible growth-from-the-tip based on the everting chains principle. Accordingly, the generated kinematic model that links gear rotations to tip rotations and translations seems to be an accurate simplification of the experimental data.In addition, the normal forces acting on the environment were much lower than the load bearing capacity of Prototype I, confirming sufficient support and limited deflection and deformation by the built structure. The everting chain principle has many advantages. First, multiple curves in series can be formed in a reversible manner. Moreover, high load bearing capacity of locked chains results in high accuracy of the system’s movement. Furthermore, the system has limited interaction with the environment and no additional system is required to create curvature. Lastly, sliding hinged joints allow for movement along sharp edges. The next generation of everting chain robots should incorporate improved power and load tuning, size reduction and chains that allow for fully selfsupporting movements in 3D space.","Path Following; Curvature; Complex trajectory; Growth-from-the-tip; Reversible; Eversion; Mechanical; Active steering; Mechanism Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GstrTG8yVGs Visualization of prototype II","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","BITE Group","52.000929,4.372711"

Even the Operating Room (OR) reduced their surgeries to acute care. It is, however, hard to define how much the OR should downscale. Also, there are no national plans on how hospitals should downscale and prioritize their waiting lists. On top of that, the COVID-19 situation can change suddenly, leaving only a little time to change the OR schedule. Making a new OR schedule with only a little time and lots of additional COVID-19 related variables can be challenging. A planning model can help the planning department with making an OR planning. To find out what planning would work best for the Reinier de Graaf hospital, multiple things are done: the OR planning during the first COVID-19 wave is analyzed with the help of data analysis and interviews, existing OR planning models were analyzed, feasibility was checked by interviews, and a proof of concept was made. Using an OR planning model can be helpful for the RdGG to assist their planning process. The model can help plan patients based on their priority while keeping the outflow below the threshold and leveled, and while keeping a high utilization of the OR. This will give the planning staff more time to plan patients further ahead and give them a better overview of how many ORs to open if the maximum outflow is reached, and on the usage of appliances.","Corona; COVID-19; Covid-19; Covid-19 pandemic; Operating room; operating room scheduling; Operating room scheduling; Hospital; Surgery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

However, previous research has often combined conformal with non-conformal elements in such displays, potentially leading to visual clutter. In this paper, two purely conformal displays are proposed, and their effectiveness is compared with a baseline condition in good visibility depicting the ADS-33 hover course. The first display contains a grid ground texture and a box indicating the hover target position; the second bears close resemblance to the ADS-33 course. Two pilots participated in a simulator experiment in which the effects of display configuration and vehicle dynamics on hover performance, control activity, pilot workload and situation awareness were examined. Results show that performance similar to that in good visibility can be achieved with the grid display, although workload and situation awareness deteriorated. Performance with the second display was worse, likely due to lack of available optic flow. Linear vehicle dynamics led to lower workload than a non-linear model, but not to better performance. For future research, it is recommended to improve availability of longitudinal positioning cues in the grid display, and to investigate the usefulness of that display also in good visibility.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The specific objective is to use modularity to help support the development of zero-emission propulsion methods for a ferry. The objective is fulfilled by answering the main question of this research: “How can the energy carrier and conversion system of a ferry be made environmentally friendly and modular and how does the inclusion of low emission and modularity objectives impact the power supply and total design of the ferry?”<br/>In the approach a Systems Engineering approach is used, including the V-cycle or the RFLP approach. In this approach the design is approached by the elaboration of the Requirements, Functionalities, Logical design and the Physical design.

This algorithm extends on existing methods by allowing the ambiguity-free fusion of existing single-sensor policy behavior using an active and interactive querying of the human expert. The ambiguous situations investigated in this work are due the possible perspective mismatch of each sensor: LIRA-SPF aims to detect these situations and save the correct solution in a new fused policy. As a consequence, we provide an alternative to training a new behavior again from scratch, leveraging the knowledge of existing expert behaviors and reducing the required teacher’s effort. The algorithm is tested with different supervised and unsupervised disambiguation strategies thanks to its modular implementation. This paper summarizes multiple simulated and real robot tests, showing the advantages of the proposed disambiguation module on state of the art approaches.

However, with the increase in distributed networking, security problems arise in distributed processes. Injection of malicious data, for example, must be dealt with by using the tools provided by detection theory. The detection probability pd can be taken as the performance metric that we aim to optimize. In order to achieve this, one must first define a hypothesis testing problem and derive an optimization problem for pd that is dependent on which nodes are assumed to be compromised by these malicious agents that inject data.<br/><br/>For the injected data, there are three different models taken into consideration for the change in values over time and nodes. For every model, we assume that the outlier data can be injected with two different attack modes. These attack modes enforce different network topology related constraints on the set of compromised nodes due to different motivations. Furthermore, additional constraints are assumed due to the limited resources of the agents.<br/>Additionally, with the given framework, we can also derive an optimization problem that can be solved with the help of the well-known linear regression method, i.e., Lasso. The problem that arise with this method is the difficulty of implementing the network topology related constraints into this optimization problem.<br/><br/>In order to solve these optimization problems, several methods are combined for the relaxation and solution of the optimization problems.<br/><br/>From numerical evaluation, it can be observed that our empirical performance is non-negligibly lower than the theoretical performance for all three models and both attacking modes. This can be linked to the dependence of the empirical distribution to the derived subset of compromised nodes, these subsets are chosen such that the cost function is optimized. Hence, we observe that the empirical values are much higher than it is theoretically assumed, in case that the network is 'clean'.<br/>A second factor for performance evaluation is the number of wrongly indexed nodes, it can be observed how this factor is dependent on the distribution of the energy of the outlier data over the nodes and time.<br/><br/>Overall, this study shows that the provided framework shows an increasing performance for an increasing outlier-to-noise energy ratio. For an energy ratio higher than 0.5, the empirical and theoretical ROC-curves are nearly perfectly saturated for all models. The number of wrongly indexed nodes for our methods is generally speaking lower compared with the Lasso-method.","Outlier Detection; Detection of anomalies; Distributed networking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Signals and Systems","",""

A prediction model of OMP breakthrough curves in zeolite packed columns was established and evaluated.<br/>It was found that the adsorption of OMPs by zeolite granules in batch and column experiments was influenced by OMP species, water matrices and operational parameters (e.g., superficial velocity and contact time). Positively charged OMPs were better adsorbed by zeolite granules than neutral and negatively charged OMPs. In most cases, the adsorption capacity and kinetics of OMPs were reduced in WW matrix, which led to an earlier breakthrough in columns. On the contrary, WW matrix enhanced the adsorption capacity and kinetics of a few negatively charged OMPs, such as diclofenac and clofibric acid.<br/>Higher zeolite dosage resulted in faster OMP adsorption kinetics. <br/>Column experiments showed that 12 of the 18 target OMPs could be effectively removed at the EBCT of 12 min, achieving removal efficiencies of 50% over 10 days.

This is especially the case for a full scale unchlorinated DWDS in a metropolitan area. Therefore, this research aimed to explore the spatial and temporal relation between drinking water temperature and microbial indicating parameters Aeromonas and Heterotrophic Plate count (HPC). 11 Years of sample data from the DWDS in the metropole of Amsterdam was explored, with the objective to possibly draw conclusions beyond this DWDS. This DWDS consists of two interconnected subsystems. Each subsystem is fed by its own treatment facility. Areas with repetitive exceedance of threshold temperature (14 oC) for accelerating Aeromonas growth, were not inextricably tied to repetitive exceedance of the Aeromonas standard for safe drinking water. Areas with repetitive exceedance of the Aeromonas standard were often linked to prolonged residence time. For regions on the outskirt of observed DWDS it was suggested that the influence of residence time was more important than the absolute water temperature to explain Aeromonas concentrations.","drinking water distribution system; anthropogenic heating; Hotspots; microbial indicating parameters; Aeromonas; Heterotrophic Plate count; HPC; spatial; temporal; residence time; treatment; reservoir; profile plot; Amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

To create these structures industry uses a variety of manufacturing methods. There is a gap in manufacturing methods that can produce a microstructure at a high resolution and use multiple materials at individual locations. Inkjet printing can fill this research gap because multiple materials can be printed at individual points in structures by using multiple ink reservoirs. The goal of the research is to develop a method to produce overhanging microstructures using inkjet printing. <br/><br/>Using inkjet printing structures are produced bottom-up therefore a (sacrificial) support material is needed to support building material during the production. This material is later removed resulting in an overhanging structure. To allow removal of the sacrificial material both materials must cure differently. After considering different candidate materials, one building material (mr¬UVCur26SF) and one sacrificial material (KL5315) were used during the manufacturing process. The sacrificial material is a positive photoresist and can be removed in a NaOH (1w%) solution after UV curing as opposed to the building material that solidifies after UV curing. <br/><br/>Two methods were used to increase the height of inkjet-printed structures. The first method is to print multiple layers of material on top of each other while curing the material between each layer, this is used to print the building material. This first method led to poor alignment between layers of sacrificial support material, therefore a new method is proposed to print the sacrificial material. Using the second method multiple lines of sacrificial material are printed next to each other without intermediate curing using a high cross-scan resolution of 4800[dpi] increasing the height of the structure. <br/><br/>Printing both materials close to each other to create an overhanging structure led to a loss of shape because the materials were attracted to each other. To solve this issue a new method is proposed using sacrificial dikes to prevent the building material from losing its shape. The first step of this method is to print and cure a grid of sacrificial support material. After that, the building material is printed in the free space between and on top of the dikes resulting in a microbridge once the sacrificial support material is removed. Using this method a microbridge with an overhanging part of approximately 50 micrometers is created.<br/><br","Inkjet printing; overhanging microstructures; sacrificial material","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

Because the scan data is available only on the boundary of the system, it is challenging to determine from which location a measured photon originated. In this research PDE-constrained optimization methods are used to determine the source reconstruction, incorporating the complete photon transport physics. A cost function is introduced such that the minimum of the cost function, constrained by the photon transport equation, yields the source reconstruction. To lift degeneracy and penalize erratic behaviour a regularization term is added to the cost function. An interior-point method is incorporated to impose a positivity constraint and a comparison is made between the reconstructions with and without this constraint. A proof of principle is presented for a two-dimensional model problem, indicating that the methods are a viable option to perform the source reconstruction, although the quality of the reconstruction is shown to vary significantly depending on the system parameters and the original source distribution. Because the linear system that is to be solved becomes too large to be solved directly, iterative solvers are used to obtain the solution, where the main focus is on the MINRES algorithm. Additionally, a number of preconditioners are introduced to reduce the computational cost of the iterative solver. Two preconditioners show to be promising when the problem is not constrained to yield only positive values, but they do no longer function properly when the positivity constraint is introduced.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-01-08","","","","","",""

The current workflow from cultured cells to final image is however very time-consuming, labor-intensive, expensive, and has a low yield. Moreover, many of the steps in this workflow require practice. Even after practice, experienced users often lose samples during the cumbersome cryo-ET workflow. <br/>Clipping of the Autogrid is one of the manual steps in the current procedure that is known to have a low yield. During this procedure, the fragile 20 µm thick sample carriers (TEM-grids) can get damaged or contaminated causing the loss of valuable samples. After clipping, the Autogrid increases the stiffness of the sample carrier, enabling automatic handling of the samples. Clipping of the Autogrid can therefore be considered as one of the missing links for full automation of the cryo-ET workflow. This thesis was aimed at automating the clipping procedure, thereby improving the yield, reducing the time required for practice, and reducing the amount of manual handling steps of the current procedure.<br/>A problem analysis on the current procedure for clipping the Autogrid was performed, based on which multiple solutions were designed and tested experimentally. Designed gripper fingers were used with a six-axis industrial robot arm to automatically handle sample carriers and Autogrids. Such procedures are done manually using tweezers in the current procedure. Damage induced on the sample carriers during automatic handling was quantified experimentally.<br/>Automating the clipping procedure allows for adjusting the orientation of sample carriers during the procedure, which is currently (almost) impossible. For this purpose, a machine learning-based marker detection algorithm was used to automatically detect markers that are present at the bottom of an Autogrid. This detection algorithm was used with a stepper motor and a designed mechanism to automatically obtain a specified orientation of the Autogrid.

Hence, crop and drought monitoring will become increasingly important in the future. Synthetic Aperture Radars (SAR) are able to penetrate clouds and thus reliably provide data. Despite the extensive literature that can be found on the use of high spatio-temporal resolution SAR data, a study investigating the influence of drought on Sentinel-1 data over agricultural crops has yet to be conducted. This research aims to bridge this knowledge gap by utilizing Sentinel-1 data. The Sentinel-1 data is acquired and processed in Google Earth Engine and afterwards, data analysis is performed using Python. This results in parcel level SAR (VV, VH and VH/VV) data. This research is focused on maize, sugar beet, potato, onion and barley parcels in study areas in the Netherlands during the 2017, 2018 and 2019 agricultural summer season, of which 2018 and 2019 were impacted heavily by drought. <br/>This research demonstrates that phenological changes are reflected in Sentinel-1 data with increasing backscatter intensities during leaf development and stem elongation phases. Subsequently, saturation occurs which halts the rapid increase of backscatter. During harvest, the VH/VV ratio decreases rapidly. Time series of barley behave differently due to its unique vertical structure.The results show that VV and VH backscatter values are 2.5, 2 and 1 dB lower during the 2018 drought compared to 2017 for maize, sugar beet and potato parcels, respectively. Furthermore, the seasonal VH/VV ratio cycle for maize, onion and barley is shorter in a drought year and shortest in 2018. The VH/VV ratio cycle in 2018 was 30, 10 and 20 days shorter compared to 2017 for maize, onion and barley, respectively. Lastly, significantly lower VH/VV ratio values are observed during the vegetative stages in 2019. The percentage of individual parcels that show responses similar to aggregated responses ranges from 68% to 100%. Moreover, the results show that the overpass time has a large influence on drought response. Morning passes show significant increase in the magnitude of the VV and VH backscatter drop during the drought periods, especially for sugar beet and potato.The regional variability was assessed by comparing parcel backscatter from the northern part of the Vechtstromen water board, the Scheldestromen water board and the Flevopolder. Generally, drought impact is found to be most extreme in Vechtstromen. However, onions in 2018 were impacted most in Scheldestromen according to yield data. This clearly translated into lower VH backscatter and VH/VV ratio values during and after the drought period. Also, regional differences in maize time series caused by irrigation are observed. The results show that areas in which irrigation was allowed with ground and open water had a longer VH/VV ratio cycle in 2018, compared to areas in which irrigation was allowed only with groundwater.Overall, the usage of Sentinel-1 data for drought monitoring purposes shows tremendous potential. This gives a promising outlook on the use of dense C-band SAR data for the detection of crop drought stress.<br","SAR; Sentinel-1; agriculture; drought; monitoring; backscatter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","","","","Water Management","",""

(mentor); den Besten, J.H. (graduation committee); Seidel, Marc (graduation committee); Remijn, Joris (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Fatigue is one of the driving limit states in the design of wind turbines, as they are subject to varying loadsfrom winds, waves and gusts. One such governing area is the butt-welded connection from the shell to thering flange. To optimize the tower design and to help focus future research, more insight on the influence ofmaterial properties and geometrical features on the fatigue life of these butt welds is needed. Due to thecosts associated with testing, SGRE stated the need for a model that could assess the total fatigue life of buttwelds subject to Mode I cracking in a rather quick way. After literature study, it was proposed to use theUniGrow model.The UniGrow method is a total fatigue life model in which the material is considered to consist of elementaryblocks. Fatigue is modelled as a process of continuous crack initiation of the elementary block ahead of thecrack tip. In this model, the plastic compressive residual stress ahead of the crack tip plays an importantrole in the determination of the crack growth speed. These plastic compressive residual stresses ahead ofthe crack tip can either be determined analytically (analytical UniGrow) or by using numerical methodssuch as FEA (numerical UniGrow). The plastic compressive residual stresses ahead of the crack tip areconverted into a plastic residual SIF that is used to reduce the applied residual stress intensity factor (i.e.plasticity decreases crack growth speed). Due to the application of a number of methods such as theCreager-Paris equations, the current UniGrow implementation is solely valid for pure Mode I crack growth.Validation of the UniGrow method in the crack propagation range has been performed with results fromexperiments on CT specimens made of S355 steel. Good correspondence between the experimental resultsand predicted crack growth rates were found for all stress ratios except R = 0.25. Both Analytical andNumerical Unigrow methods have been analysed. Based upon the results of the validation it wasrecommended to use a numerical method (elastoplastic FEA) to determine the plastic residual stressesahead of the crack tip as this provides more physically accurate results. The analytical method can be usedto obtain an initial guess of the elementary block size, as it is a much faster method. Furthermore, using theMorrow method for the determination of the fatigue life of the elementary block ahead of the crack tip wasfound to provide more accurate results than the SWT damage parameter. This is due to the fact that in theelementary block ahead of the crack tip, cyclic stress relaxation occurs and, therefore, mean stress effectsneed not be accounted for. For short cracks, the fatigue life of the elementary block is usually outside theLCF range (Nf &gt; 5*104 cycles). Here, the use of the Morrow method without considering residual stresses isnot recommended since cyclic stress relaxation does not occur due to limited plasticity.The performance of the UniGrow method as total fatigue life was studied using literature research and acomparison to another total fatigue life model: Two-Stage-Model. In the studied literature, researchers tendto use the weight function method to determine the SIF in welded geometries. Analysis comparing theweight function method to FEA results showed that the WF method generally overpredicts the SIFscompared to FEA. For a flat plate, the difference was found to be a maximum of 3.5%, whereas for the weldedgeometry, the difference was up to 12%.From the literature and the comparison of the UniGrow model to the Two-Stage-Model, it was concludedthat the UniGrow model is incapable of predicting proper fatigue crack initiation lives as it is unable tocapture the complexity of short crack growth. The model provides satisfactory results for cracks wherecrack propagation is a dominant part of the fatigue life (such as welded geometries and notched specimensin the LCF regime). It was proposed to use the UniGrow model to determine fatigue lives of notchedspecimens up to 105 cycles. It was found that this limit also depends on the SCF present in the specimen.For welded geometries, available results in literature showed good correspondence. However, the weldsused by SGRE are of better quality (lower SCF) than the ones used in UniGrow research. This means thatrelatively more of the fatigue life will be spent in fatigue crack initiation. More research is therefore neededto examine whether this affects the functioning of the UniGrow method for welds.The UniGrow method was lastly used to determine which of the parameters controlling the geometry of theweld excess (the weld flank angle, weld toe radius and weld excess height) is of greatest influence on thefatigue performance of a butt weld. From this analysis it was concluded that changing the weld excessheight, followed by the weld flank angle has the most beneficial effect on the fatigue life. The results fromthis parametric study should be used with great care: the usage of the UniGrow method combined withneglecting the residual stresses could lead to incorrect predictions of fatigue crack initiation life.Simplifications of the material and crack type could also have had an influence on the results.","fatigue; UniGrow; Butt weld","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An incision placed in the wrong direction causes unnecessary skin tension on the wound, pulling the wound edges apart. In order to close the wound, increased collagen disposition is needed. Currently, skin tension lines are used for incision planning. However, these lines are not universal and are a static representation of the skin tension that is in fact under influence of muscle action. By designing a new skin tension measurement device the authors intend to make quantitative skin tension measurement in the operation room possible. The device applies a known force to the skin in standardized directions and measures the displacement of the skin in order to derive the skin tension and the optimal incision line on a location. The device has an accuracy of 96% and a sensitivity of &lt; 0.01 mm. In a clinical study, the influence of changes in anatomical position on skin tension is studied with the goal to optimize surgical planning. Measurements were done on 30 subjects, at four locations and in two anatomical positions per location. It was shown that not only the amount of skin tension changes after taking another anatomical position, but in most situations also the optimal direction of incision changes. These findings, together with the fact that interindividual differences are significant, show that the current methods of surgical planning are suboptimal and that surgical techniques should be adapted to dynamic and individual characteristics of skin tension.","skin tension; scarring; surgery; device","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-01-01","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In the future, fossil fuels will be replaced by renewable sources. Hydrogen seems to be a promising energy carrier (fuel). A lot of research has been conducted on the combustion of hydrogen, but the effect of the high diffusivity of hydrogen compared to other species (differential diffusion) was often not included in simulations of turbulent flames because turbulent mixing is expected to suppress strong influence of differential diffusion. Nevertheless effects of differential diffusion have been reported in experiments. The main purpose of this thesis is to include the effect of differential diffusion in a CFD model of turbulent non-premixed hydrogen flames and to validate the models with available experimental data. The validation data set used in this study is a non-premixed turbulent jet flame of hydrogen diluted with nitrogen on 50/50 volume ratio. This flame is interesting because the role of differential diffusion in this flame has been a matter of discussion in the literature.<br/><br/>A review is given of previous work on turbulent non-premixed hydrogen flames and effects of differential diffusion. It is concluded that the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) model and the Transported Probability Density Function (PDF) model are both promising turbulent combustion models for these flames. Next, a new comparative study is made of several turbulence and combustion models using Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes simulations in Ansys Fluent, and focusing on FGM as turbulent combustion model. It is concluded that the standard k-e with a correction as suggested by Pope is the best choice for the turbulence model. The ANSYS Fluent implementation of FGM does not have the option to include differential diffusion. Therefore it is added in a separate way. To do this, flamelets are created with the help of CHEM1D, a tool developed by TU Eindhoven. These flamelets are combined to an FGM table also including the effect of turbulence via a PDF and this table is imported into Fluent with the help of a user-defined function overwriting the default Fluent FGM table.<br/><br/>In order to clearly see the effects of differential diffusion, simulations with and without differential diffusion are made. Good agreement is obtained between experimental results and the numerical simulation for the models without differential diffusion. This confirms that turbulence can suppress strong influence of differential diffusion. In experiments effects of differential diffusion have been observed at the base of the flame, close to the burner nozzle. The model simulations with differential diffusion included, provide a slightly more accurate prediction of the mean temperature close to the nozzle but still large discrepancies remain.<br","CFD; Combustion; Hydrogen; Differential Diffusion; Flamelet Generated Manifold","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing EEG-based machinelearning models are more reliable but lack interpretationof temporal characteristics of EEG. Long-short-term-memory networks (LSTMs) do take advantage of suchtemporal characteristics. Therefore, I hypothesized thatan LSTM would outperform time-insensitive models.Methods: Patients’ neurological outcome at six monthsafter CA was classified as good (no/mild neurologicaldamage) or poor (severe neurological damage/vegetativestate/death). Twelve quantitative EEG features wereextracted from five-minute EEG epochs recorded 12(n=78) or 24 (n=176) hours after CA. A time-insensitivebaseline logistic regression model (LR) and an LSTMwere developed and trained. The performance was eval-uated using the area under the receiver operator curve(AUC) and the sensitivity at 100% specificity (SeSp100)for poor outcome prediction. The LSTM was comparedto the current LR and previously published models.Results and conclusion: The LSTM predicted pooroutcome with AUC=0.90 and SeSp100=0.66, meaningit did not significantly improve performance over LR(AUC=0.89, SeSp100=0.67). However, the LSTM andLR outperformed almost all previously reported mod-els, likely due to the features’ high prognostic power.The SeSp100 was even higher for the LSTM (0.79) andLR (0.78) when using only epochs at 12 hours after CA,suggesting that earlier EEG might further improve prog-nostication.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In transport planning, travel time is one of the most widely used and significant parameters in the design of transport systems. However, people's ability to estimate travel time and time, in general, is limited. The aim of this thesis is to broaden the knowledge on the perception of travel time of active modes. More specifically, this thesis's objective is to provide insight into the deviation of perceived travel time to the actual trip duration of cycling and walking trips and to identify the factors that influence it. Individual characteristics and emotional state, trip characteristics, and external conditions such as the weather are considered. To reach the research aim, data are collected on the subjective and objective travel time and on the possible determinants. A mobile application is developed to serve as the single data collection tool. The app incorporates a location (GPS) data source and multiple surveys. The trip duration, which is reported by the survey respondents right after the completion of a trip, is considered as the subjective travel time. Data are collected for two weeks in the Netherlands in June 2020. An analysis is performed on the obtained dataset in terms of descriptive statistics and regression analysis. The former reveals that, on average, people underestimate the duration of trips conducted by bike or on feet. Via linear and logistic regression models, the decisive factors of travel time misperception are pointed out. Disappointing weather, high physical effort demand, and compulsory trip purposes prolong the perceived trip duration. On the contrary, the usage of an information source for planning a trip leads to a shorter subjective travel time. The overall underestimation of travel time by active modes indicates that the perceived disutility due to travelling could also be lower than the objectively measured one when travelling by these modes. The findings of the study are discussed in regards to recommendations to practice and future research. Furthermore, the thesis provides suggestions for further usages of mobile applications for the collection of data on travel time distortion and on travel experience, in general.","Active modes; Cycling; Walking; Travel time; Perception; Mobile application; Umo Research app","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

The flood prone areas not protected by flood defenses at the Island of Dordrecht are directly influenced by the increase of these high-water levels, leading to an increase in the future flood risk. To lower this risk, the Delta21 project has been proposed. By pumping water from the Haringvliet, the high-water levels in the delta are lowered. It is unclear if an optimal operation of Delta21 for the flood prone areas of Dordrecht exists and if the reliability of the project impacts this high-water level reduction.<br/><br/>The main objective of this report is to determine if the inclusion of Delta21 to the flood protection system of the Rhine-Meuse delta can provide a significant reduction of the flood risk of the flood prone areas at Dordrecht. Furthermore, it should be determined if an optimal operational scheme is possible in which the flood protection system with Delta21 can comply with all the flood requirements of the flood prone areas at Dordrecht and limitations to the Europoort barrier and Delta21 project while considering the reliability of the Delta21 project and the climate scenarios of the year 2100.<br/><br/>It was determined that the present flood risk at the flood prone areas at the Island of Dordrecht is equal to €110,000 per year. For the minimum, medium and maximum scenario for the year 2100 this risk increases to €390,000, €1,300,000 and €8,100,000 per year respectively. The implementation of the optimal operation of Delta21 reduces this risk with 23, 15 and 64 %. To obtain a flood risk reduction of 64 % for the maximum scenario, the closure frequency of the Europoort barrier, which may not be larger than three times per year, is equal to ten times per year. Furthermore, the flood risk as a percentage of the average annual income per household at the flood prone areas may not exceed 1 %, but for the medium onward this limit is exceeded at the historical harbor (city center). The maximum allowable probability of failure per pump of the pumping station and per siphon of the spillway of Delta21 is about 0.5 if the correlation between the components of both these systems is smaller than 0.9. <br/><br/>The inclusion of Delta21 in the current flood protection system with the present Europoort closure level can provide a significant reduction of the future flood risk of the flood prone areas at Dordrecht. However, it is not possible to create an optimal operational scheme for all scenarios of the year 2100 in which the flood protection system with Delta21 complies with the flood requirements of the flood prone areas and the limitations of the Europoort barrier. Finally, the reliability of the new Delta21 components is non-decisive for the flood risk assessments that have been made as long as the components are not fully dependent.<br","flood risk; dordrecht; delta21; flood prone areas not protected by flood defenses; buitendijks; europoort; reliability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","DELTA21","51.81709820850698, 4.66314891290983"

To be able to reason about given predictions, a local surrogate model can be used to approximate the local decision boundary of the black box.

However, this does assume that the generated data reflects the characteristics of the classification problem and that the simplified representation is able to capture these. In this work, the LIME local sampling procedure and interpretable representations are investigated for highly dimensional and highly correlated feature sets, in this case hyperspectral images. Based on the Pavia University dataset, it is illustrated that the sampling strategy currently used is not suitable for hyperspectral data. With the help of Principal Components (PC), a new sampling strategy is given, which improves local data generation for highly dimensional and correlated data. Furthermore, PC-LIME is proposed, which uses these PCs as the interpretable representation in LIME.

These Dynamic-Positioning (DP) vessels are known for their large and dynamic power plants and have to limit their NOx emissions in order to comply with IMO Tier III regulation. The research objective has been to assess the cost-effectiveness of a methanol hybrid power plant solution to reduce CO2 emissions of new-build OWVs relative to other alternative fuel options. As alternative fuels, both bio-diesel and ammonia have been selected as benchmark options. Two models have been developed to find the cost-effectiveness of the methanol and benchmark power plant solutions to reduce CO2 emissions. These models are a power plant model (PPM) and a cost assessment model (CAM). The PPM consists of an engine model, a battery model and a power management model. For a specific engine type, the engine model determines the fuel consumption and emissions performance by using available engine data. Next, based on the principle of equal energy consumption and relative fuel characteristics, these fuel consumption and emission performance are adapted in order to represent methanol or one of the benchmark fuels in the selected engine type. The battery model is established in line with DP hybrid power plant requirements and the power management model acts as a connecting link to bring the engine model and battery model together on a power level. The CAM uses the PPM output to find the relationship between costs and CO2 reduction for each power plant solution. This is done by comparing the annualized Total Costs of Ownership (TCO) and the Life-Cycle (LCA) CO2 emissions of each solution with a diesel-based configuration. In this comparison, the annualized TCO consists of the yearly operational costs and annualized investments costs of each solution. The life-cycle emissions account for both well-to-tank (WTT) and tank-to-propeller (TTP) emissions of each fuel type. A case study considering the Bravenes, a flexible fallpipe vessel within the fleet of Van Oord, has been carried out to bring the developed models into practice and to provide a solution to the research objective. The technical details of this vessel have been used to create the methanol and benchmark power plant solutions which comply with both IMO Tier III and DP regulations. Next, a representative load profile of the vessel has been applied to simulate the performance of the different power plant solution for a duration of one year. Based on these simulation results, it has been found that the methanol solution has a CO2 reduction potential up to 99% and a CO2 price of 78 euro per ton CO2 reduction. This means that methanol is most cost-effective in comparison to both the bio-diesel and ammonia power plant solutions. Relative to methanol, the battery has a similar CO2 price of 79 [euro/ton CO2], but has a CO2 reduction potential of 8.5% only. To motivate Van Oord to invest in a methanol hybrid power plant solution for new-build OWVs, external or internal incentives are required to bridge the CO2 price gap between the methanol hybrid solution and a diesel-based configuration. As external incentives, the expected CO2 tax and / or subsidy for the use of advanced fuels are particularly interesting to consider for new-build investment decision in 2021 and beyond.<br","Methanol; Bio-diesel; Ammonia; Hybrid; Power plant simulation; CO2 reduction; Cost-effectiveness; Offshore working vessels","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Punchiná reservoir is part of the San Carlos Hydroelectric Power Plant, situated in the Guatapé watershed. The Guatapé river is an affluent of the Samaná Norte river, which in turn is an affluent of the Magdalena river. San Carlos Hydroelectric Project uses the waters from the rivers San Carlos and Guatapé and discharges the turbined flow directly into the Samaná Norte river by a tunnel. Currently, there is flow downstream of the Punchiná dam only on the days where the spillway operates, significantly impacting the riverine ecosystem. Additionally, claims have been made about how hydropeaking causes floods in villages downstream, particularly in La Pesca village. This town is located in the confluence of Samaná Norte and Magdalena river, on the left bank of Samaná Norte river mouth. The present report deals with the multi-objective optimization of the Punchiná reservoir of San Carlos Hydroelectric Project in Colombia by considering the objectives of maximizing hydropower revenues, maximizing the ecological discharge at Guatapé river, downstream of the dam, and reducing the flood risk at La Pesca village. Four numerical methods were coded in Python to solve the reservoir routing. To solve the multi-objective optimization, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) using the Pymoo framework in Python was set up, along with the use of an Explicit Euler numerical method for modelling the river routing. The simulation was performed for 3 periods (high, average and low flow conditions) within the years 2010-2017. After multiple optimization scenarios, it can be concluded that the hydropower and environmental flows are competing objectives, i.e., allocating water for environmental flow purposes from the Punchiná reservoir will always result in a reduction of the hydropower revenues. Hence, it is recommended that an incentive system is developed so that the ecosystemic services are compensated to persuade the generating companies into including ecological objectives into their optimal operation curves. In addition, suggestions on considering a bypass tunnel to let the discharge flow into Guatapé river dry trajectory while adding a turbine to take advantage of this flow are also given. The results also show that the flood mitigation objective does not result in a competing objective against the hydropower and environmental flow objectives when there are average flow conditions in the Magdalena river. Floods commonly occur during extreme weather periods whereas the optimization of the Punchiná reservoir is performed for monthly average flow conditions at Magdalena river. Thus, to assess the hydropeaking effect in the water levels at La Pesca site, it is recommended that the reservoir optimization should also include extreme flow conditions at Magdalena river when experienced.","Multi-Objective Optimization; Reservoir Simulation; Genetic Algorithm - GA; Hydropower; Environmental flows; Flood Risk","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

In addition to nutrition, it is also closely related to emotions, social interactions, environment, and culture.

In recent years, the phenomenon of Chinese young people migrating to big cities has become more widespread. It is inevitable that many people have moved to new cities, but find that they are facing a completely different eating environment. Some people have trouble deal with the situation and lead to an imbalanced diet. Imbalance in diet can cause many negative effects on people's lives, such as lacked nutrition and obesity. In order to help young Chinese migrants adapt to the local diet, how should they be encouraged to try new foods? In this project, through literature research and user research, a deep insight into the life status and needs of the target group was gained. After that, through multiple iterations, a mobile application developed for them was tested and evaluated. This project aims to provide a relaxing and fun way to explore new foods for young migrants.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","River bars are large-scale bedforms formed by the local deposition of sediments, the length of which scales with the channel width and the height with the water depth. They create suitable habitats for aquatic fauna and riparian vegetation, making them useful in river restoration projects. Understanding the dynamics of river bar development is required for a proper design of the restoration project and for developing a sustainable management scheme. The channel half-width-to-depth ratio is the key controlling parameter for the formation of alternate bars. Existing stability analyses define a resonance point and critical width-to-depth ratio, marking the transition between the bar regimes. Seasonal variations in the river discharge and the propagation of flood waves make the half-width-to-depth ratio a time-dependent parameter, varying over periods of days to months. This research aims to create a better understanding of the development of alternate bars in varying discharge conditions. For that, insight into the timescale of development of the bars is necessary to link this with the timescales associated with natural discharge variability. A straight river channel is modelled in Delft3D, with non-erodible banks to which a fixed perturbation is added, to trigger the formation of free bars and to which hybrid bars become fixed. In the first set of simulations, the upstream boundary condition is a constant discharge, with magnitudes between 50 and 1250 m$^3$/s, corresponding to a half-width-to-depth ratio between 77 and 8. The different types of alternate bars and the time to develop the bars are analysed from this constant-discharge analysis. The damping length and wavelength of the hybrid bars showed good agreement with the values determined from the theory of Struiksma et al. (1985). Free bars became suppressed when a hybrid bar pattern developed, showing that hybrid and free bars do not coexist locally. The resonance point is clearly obtained and assigned to a half-width-to-depth ratio of 37-38. Contrary to existing stability analyses, the critical half-width-to-depth ratio is marked by a gradual transition at half-width-to-depth ratios from 11 to 20 instead of a single value. In this transition, free bars develop with intervals of a few months. A clear difference in the development of hybrid bars and free bars results in a shorter timescale of development for free bars than for hybrid bars, which is in line with laboratory experiments (Fujita and Muramoto 1985; Crosato et al 2010). Also, in the mathematical derivations for describing the two types of bars, the distinction between an initial response (free bars, Colombini, Seminara, and Tubino (1987)) and a final stable bed (hybrid bars, Struiksma et al. (1985)) is considered. The numerical results show that free bars develop fastly when the bed becomes unstable, in the case of a relatively flat bed. The associated timescale shows little variation over the different simulations and stays around 20 days, which is in the same order of magnitude as the timescale related to seasonal variation. A pattern of hybrid bars develops in downstream direction, starting at the fixed perturbation. Based on the definition of the damping length by Struiksma et al. (1985), a theoretical expression is defined, which gives a good fit to the time at which a pattern of hybrid bars has developed. The transition of alternate bars around resonant conditions is modelled using a steadily increasing and decreasing discharge. The distinction between the timescales of hybrid and free bars results in a different response of the bars to a varying discharge. The first response of the bed in the transition from subresonant to superresonant conditions is the adaptation of free bars towards the new bar regime. A pattern of hybrid bars follows, developing in downstream direction. The reversed transition is governed by a migration of the hybrid bar pattern, making room for the damped bar pattern. The difference in the transitions between rising and falling discharge in combination with a bed adaptation after a temporal in- or decreased discharge led to a type of hysteresis in the transition around the riverbed's resonance point, which was not earlier detected. Hysteresis is ascribed to the increased bed stability when a hybrid bar pattern has developed, suppressing the formation of free bars in the transition from superresonant to subresonant conditions and to the time-lags associated with lower discharge conditions. This thesis assesses the timescales of alternate bars and the transition around the resonance point. The numerical model is able to assess both free and hybrid bars and therefore gives valuable information in the difference of their development. The difference is linked to the (linear) theories describing the bars and applied for answering the research question, showing the development of free bars should be largely influenced by discharge variation due to seasonal variation. The varying discharge simulations provided insights into the response and transition of alternate bars around resonance conditions, leading to a type of hysteresis which was not detected earlier. Recommendations are made towards increasing the river geometry complexity and discharge variation and the assessment of the transition around critical conditions to verify analyses around critical conditions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Vallery, H. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Some above the knee amputees take a smaller step with their prosthetic leg. A momentum exchange device (MED) can increase the step length by exchanging angular momentum between the device and the leg. However, there are no controllers for MEDs during regular gait. The goal of this study is to build a model predictive controller (MPC) that controls an MED to help the amputees achieve a certain step length. The MPC uses a model of an unimpaired walking human to predict its movement. Two different models are evaluated, a compass-gait biped (CGB) model and a neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) model. The parameters of the CGB model are estimated with a grey-box estimation method. An NMS model of an unimpaired human is used to simulate the controllers as well. For control, both linear and nonlinear hybrid model predictive control methods are used. By evaluating the behaviour of the controllers, insights are gained in whether the chosen models and control methods are suitable to achieve the goal. It is concluded that the prediction of the CGB model is insufficient for the control algorithm used. The model is capable of approximating the swing of the leg, but it is unable to accurately predict the future states. The NMS model may be more accurate, but is at this moment in time not practical for control. The model is computationally expensive, observing all its states is difficult and the model can currently not be initiated in any desired state, which is required for control. The results indicate that the chosen combinations of models and control methods are not well suitable to achieve the goal. Control with an unimpaired human model unfolded many difficulties and control of an impaired human is even more difficult. A control method that does not rely on an accurate step length prediction might be more suitable. However, the identified CGB model and the control methods contribute to further research on the subject or other applications within the field.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","Degree of Master of Science in Systems and Control and BioMechanical Design at Delft University of Technology Github repository corresponding to the thesis: https://github.com/JesperKreuk/MPC_MED","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

This research proposes a new controller for the complete range of penetration rates of AVs, in which the controller aims to shorten the yellow and red phase. The information of the AVs is used to identify the scenario at the intersection and apply control actions based on predictions.

(graduation committee); de Vet, P.L.M. (graduation committee); de Schipper, M.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","An increasing amount of the worlds coastal regions suffer from structural erosion due to anthropogenic influences. A prime example for this phenomenon is the Oosterschelde, Netherlands, where the partial closure of an estuary lead to a decline of the local intertidal flats, threatening the valuable functions they provide as an ecosystem and for shore protection. A sustainable measure to slow down the decline, is the usage of wave disrupting oyster reefs, which reduce the wave energy on the flat, thus reducing erosion. As of now, the conditionality and extend of the wave attenuation effect of such reefs is still widely unknown. This is thwarting a more extensive usage of oyster reefs for erosion management, since the actual effects of such a reef are highly uncertain prior to construction. This thesis was designed to investigate and quantify wave attenuation capabilities of an artificial oyster reef in a macrotidal environment, improving the understanding of the impact of such structures on their physical environment. A wave analysis was carried out on a reef using field data, allowing for the quantification of attenuation, the identification of processes, a parameterization of the results and an insight on the predictability of attenuation. Extensive field data was acquired on seven locations on a transect over the investigated reef, including pressure and velocity data. The reef was built using shell filled wire gabions and is orientated perpendicular to the main wind direction. It has dimensions of approximately 120 m length, 8 m width and 0.8 m height. The reef crest is located 0.5 m above mean low water level and 2.3 m below mean high water level, being emerged approximately 30 % of the time. Incoming waves are characterized by maximum significant wave heights of 0.8 m and maximum mean periods of 3 seconds. Wave attenuation was quantified by comparing the energy flux in front of (seaward) and behind (shoreward) the reef under different hydrodynamic conditions. The conditionality of attenuation was found to be best represented by the relative submergence ds /Hm0,i , which represents the ratio of the freeboard on top of the reef and the incoming wave height. Attenuation was found until a ds /Hm0,i ratio of approximately 4. Compared to the bare tidal flat in front of the reef, the reef attenuated energy up to 40 times more effectively per distance. The spatial footprint of the reef was found to vary strongly with different ds /Hm0,i ratios, but being roughly of the same order of magnitude as the reef length. Reflection, overtopping, wave breaking and friction were identified as the main mechanisms behind energy attenuation. An attempt to parameterize these was done using dimensionless numbers, which can be used to predict attenuation by using incoming wave, and reef characteristics. The determined processes were best represented by the parameters ds /Hm0,i and L01 /ds. Three empirical relations describing wave attenuation over breakwaters were used to investigate whether existing formulas can predict wave attenuation over the observed oyster reef. The measured and calculated results show a strong correlation of R ~ 0.9 but need to be tuned to reach reasonable root mean square errors. This implies that such existing formulas can be adjusted to represent oyster reefs, making them a possible tool to predict oyster reef performance in the future. The findings show that the present oyster reef is effective in attenuating waves and contribute to the overall understanding of how oyster reefs can reduce erosion. A better insight on the quantity of attenuation and the spatial footprint of the reef's effects was achieved. The footprint of the reef's effect is hereby limited to an area close to it, meaning that the reefs impact on erosion should not be overestimated. Such a reef should thus rather be seen as a complementary measure against erosion, stabilising the local area. As a next step, setting up a numerical model is recommended, where the wave attenuation can be linked to actual erosion quantities. Quantitative research on additional oyster gabions can further be used to refine existing empirical relations, creating some predictability of transmission values over oyster reefs.","Oyster reefs; Wave Attenuation; tidal flat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","51°36’38.64""N, 4° 1’26.44""E"

When we talk about “contemporary art” museums, people immediately think about paintings, photographs and sculptures: visual arts. Monet’s, Van Gogh’s and Picasso’s paintings, photographs of William Klein, sculptures by Richard Serra or Woody Allen’s movie. All these artworks are experienced by observing them with your eyes. Visiting those visual artworks in museums, possibilities to reflect on the social and political situations of today, are offered. However, for a great number of people the world of experiencing visual artworks is not accessible. They do not know how paintings can provoke imagination. Non-visually handicapped people can visit any “visual” art museums, and experience artworks with all their senses. A visually handicapped person, has less museum possibilities to go to and experience contemporary art. Art museums should be more accessible for visually handicapped people but also for people with other disabilities such as hearing impairment or people living in a wheelchair. Synesthetic art is a form of art where more than one sense contributes to the experience of an art work. There are art genres using other senses than only the visual sense. Sound, smell, taste, we can include them. Take music as an example, music has just as many opportunities to provoke imagination as a visual artwork.<br/>A second problem we are facing today is gentrification. The process of upgrading neglected urban neighborhoods, in which the current, less wealthy residents and initial small entrepreneurs and pubs, have to move out of the way for the middle class and their catering industries and companies. Through the experience of synesthetic art, the new museum aims to stimulate and include current residents, offers appropriate daily-life activities, which are accessible for everyone, and where visually handicapped people are no longer excluded. A node of multiple scales (urban and social) will be created in my design.  To respond to the lack of synesthetic art museums and the problem gentrification, the definitions and experiences of aesthetics and synaesthetics will be explained and discussed. It is fundamental to have knowledge about the relation between architecture and the human sense. The main question of this research plan therefor will be: What architectural means are essential to provoke and reinforce our imagination while experiencing synesthetic art? In order to answer the Research Question of this study, literature about synaesthesia, synesthetic art and gentrification are necessary. The “Van Abbe Museum” in Eindhoven has established to create a “multi-sensory museum”. This museum project is used as a case study to understand what people with impairments need and miss in current contemporary art museums. During a visit to the museum called “MuZIEum” in Nijmegen, the visual sense has been taken away, an experience of being visually handicapped leads to the awareness about the kind of art that can be experienced without seeing.  The aim of my graduation project is to re-wire Tarwewijk, Rotterdam-Zuid, through an art museum. A museum that is able to contribute to an improvement of social conditions in a neighbourhood.

Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is the most prominent serverless model. The FaaS model allows cloud users to write simple functions, and the cloud provider takes care of the deployment, main- tenance, and scalability of those functions. However, FaaS can be improved upon significantly. Existing FaaS services do not solve some significant and challenging cloud computing problems regarding state and communication, such as function- to-function calls and transactions. Work has been done to improve this early it- eration of serverless computing by incorporating state in the equation; leading to Stateful Function-as-a-Service (SFaaS). However, transactions on SFaaS remain an open problem, even though they are crucial to allow more use cases to operate using SFaaS. This thesis examines existing SFaaS systems and their data correctness guaran- tees.

Small UAVs, named Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs), even fly in areas like sewage pipes. These areas introduce new difficulties such as aerodynamic effects caused by the ground and/or ceiling. In this paper two main contributions are presented that deal with the aerodynamic effects caused by the ceiling: 1) an adaptive model describing the ceiling effect using onboard measurements, which can be altered to describe other aerodynamic effects that occur when flying in constrained spaces, 2) incorporating the adaptive model into an Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) controller. The controller is implemented and tested onto a MAV (Crazyflie). The results have shown stability improvements for close ceiling flight. Moreover the minimal distance the MAV can fly from the ceiling is decreased using the new controller.","INDI; Quadcopter; Ceiling effect; aerodynamic disturbance; Controller; Crazyflie; parameter estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The increasing digital storage flows, such as data, knowledge, and information, play a vital role in determining the physical parameters in cities. Ideas, as the collective term for knowledge and information, can be stored in the digital medium. This paper addresses the topic of storage of ideas as the collective form of knowledge and information. The development of digital and dynamic storage generates new typologies, while challenging other existing typologies to transform their scope and services. In particular, the public library, traditionally devoted to storing ideas in the form of passive knowledge, is now confronted with a completely new way of producing knowledge available to people.<br/><br/>The personal contribution is to conceptualize a future library as a modern panopticon, particularly, the visibility in panopticon as the metaphor of efficient knowledge sharing creation activities. To achieve this, the research question is “How to translate the concept of storage of ideas into a collective building of knowledge and information?”<br/><br/>The answers to the research questions are derived from the relevant building typologies research, which includes cultural institutions: libraries,community centres; storage facilities: datacenter, distribution center; disciplinary institutions: panopticon.<br/><br/>South of Rotterdam as the testbed offers the challenges and opportunities for the project of storage of ideas. A future library’s specific design brief is constructed by analyzing three aspects, including the creative city strategy, the lack of cultural institutions, and the existing bottom-up creative industries.","Permeability; Centrality; Visibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Projects","Maas library",""

Over the past decades, ongoing erosion has been observed along the shores of Burrard Inlet and the TWN reserve specifically. This leads to loss of land for the TWN community, damage to infrastructure, and exposure of historic sites with cultural value. Currently, there is insufficient knowledge concerning both the governing processes for sediment transport and transport pathways into, within, and out of Burrard Inlet. This knowledge is needed to propose and evaluate effective measures to prevent further erosion. This study aims to investigate the transport pathways in Burrard Inlet and give more insight into the mechanisms governing sediment transport in this inlet. <br/><br/>For this purpose, a Delft3D FM model of the area is set up and calibrated. This model is used to analyze sediment transport in the inlet under various forcing conditions. Transport pathways are visualized using SedTRAILS. <br/><br/>The model shows that flows and sediment transport in Burrard Inlet are tide-dominated and governed by the topography. Flows are strongly accelerated in constricted areas (First Narrows and Second Narrows), which leads to large velocity differences. Following the velocity field, sediment transport patterns are correspondingly dominated by these topographical restrictions. In the wider basins, flows slow down and form eddies. The model results suggest that these eddies act as sediment sinks. Additionally, sediment is lost into Indian Arm, a deep fjord with low flow velocities at the eastern end of Burrard Inlet. The possible pathways for sediment originating from the eroding shorelines at the TWN reserve are visualized. As soon as sediment from these banks is mobilized, it tends to move away from the shore with a final destination either in one of the eddies or in Indian Arm. The impact of wind and waves on the sediment transport patterns is limited.<br/><br/>Since first European contact in 1792, the shoreline of Burrard Inlet has changed significantly due to dredging activities, land developments, and industrial development as the city of Vancouver was built. Reconstructed historic shorelines are implemented in the model to assess the consequences of these shoreline changes on the sediment transport. Model results show that the tidal prism and the velocities in the Narrows have decreased since 1792, while the tidal range has increased. Moreover, sediment mobilized along the eroding shorelines showed greater potential for deposition along these same shores in 1792, compared to the present-day situation.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","","49.307764, -122.996059"

Given the popularity in palm oil output over the years, the massive amount of POME causes growing concern. The enforcement of wastewater discharge standards and laws, as well as energy recycling of sustainability goals have facilitated the development of POME treatment processes. Several lab-scale studies have looked into the treatment of industrial wastewater using anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) which has received considerable research interest due to its demonstrated potential for POME treatment. In this study, the synthetic POME was treated by a lab-scale crossflow anaerobic membrane bioreactor system. This study tested the feasibility of thermophilic PVDF-AnMBR systems for synthetic POME treatment, and meanwhile evaluated the biological and filtration performance of AnMBR treating lipid-rich wastewater at different sludge retention times (SRTs = 60 days, 90 days, and 140 days). AnMBR showed an adequate biological performance during the stabilizing state. The synthetic POME could be treated with over 98% of COD removal efficiency in all operational conditions. Plus, better digestion efficiency could be achieved at higher SRT (140 days). However, this study stresses that even though the membrane ensures biomass retention, the AnMBR process is still dodged by long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) accumulation and inhibition problems, especially at short SRT (60 days). The continuous reduction of biomass concentration during the stabilizing process of SRT at 60 days eventually resulted in the decreased methane production and system instability. Under all operational conditions, sufficient filtration performance and net permeate fluxes between 8 and 11 LMH were achieved. The trans-membrane pressure (TMP) was under 200 mbar throughout operating process. No membrane cleaning was needed. The results showed that better sludge filterability could be achieved at SRT of 90 days. The sludge filterability was compared as per the standard methods, including specific resistance to filtration and capillary suction time, which did not show a linear relationship with SRTs. Meanwhile, the physical-chemical characteristics of the sludge during the operational phases, including TSS concentrations and SMP, have a close correlation with sludge filterability parameters, such as capillary suction time and supernatant filterability.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-31","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The fact that it remains illegal means a great wasted potential of inhabitants’ creativity and will to participate in creating public spaces. While street art may mark places that are neglected or struggling with some socio-spatial issues, it points also those where locally there is a lack of space for individuals’ self-expression. Being informal and spontaneous rearrangement of urban scape, it is a manifestation of tension between public and private in the street. It might be perceived as an argument in claiming for more democratic public spaces. The goal of the research is to learn how the socio-philosophical space is being produced and what position in the process of creating and rearranging urban places street art takes. To achieve that there were analysis conducted to gained knowledge about street art – to find places where it appears, to determine crucial material and immaterial parts of public spaces that are essential for the phenomenon, to establish relations between artworks and with other elements of the street, and finally, to recognise what are the features and individual characteristics of street art. The conclusions made during the research would be a backbone for the process of designing the architectural space in the spirit of street art. Having developed transposition of the gained knowledge into the code of architecture, there would be a proper site chosen and an architectural programme developed to fully exploit social potential represented by street art. The design might initiate re-defining the term of gentrification and make a contribution in the process of democratisation public space.","Street art; creativity; space production; democratisation; street materiality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Architectural Design Crossovers","Codes Of Street Art In Urban Space","51.4633, -0.1163"

(mentor); Neto, A. (graduation committee); Freni, Angelo (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Phased arrays have emerged as a key solution for 5G base stations, to provide higher capacity by means of directive and electronically steerable beams. However, the implementation of workable low-cost antenna arrays for base stations is very challenging, because of the requirements on the total frequency and angular coverage of 5G systems. When many frequency bands are used for different services, having a single narrowband antenna for each sub-band becomes unfeasible for cost and space occupation. For this reason wideband arrays that can cover simultaneously multiple bands are gaining interest. Moreover, a large field of view is required, i.e. scanning at least from -60° to +60°, so that only a few array panels can cover the entire azimuthal angle of 360°. This thesis work has been performed in the framework of a collaboration between Terahertz Sensing Group and HUAWEI, aiming at the development of a wideband phased array for base station. Two array designs are targeted, one covering 6-8 GHz and another for 2-8 GHz. Both designs are required to achieve wide scanning capability up to 60° in all azimuth planes. This thesis focuses on the design of the feeding structure of the array unit cell and the corporate feeding networks. The unit cell feeding structure is based on integrated coaxial lines connected to microstrips or striplines. The performance is analysed first for the stand-alone transition and then for the same feed together with the connected slot element. The entire unit cell including the feed has comparable matching performance with the ideal one without feeding structure. An alternative feed design is also presented, where the input is realized with a coaxial SMP connector. The design of a corporate feeding network for the array is introduced. This consists of two designs of 1-to-32 power dividers, one implemented with microstrip transmission lines and the other with striplines. Such dividers are meant to feed in phase an entire row or column of the array. The highlights of this design is wide bandwidth, which covers two octaves by means of wideband multi-section and tapered impedance transformers, and the compactness, since the entire divider has to fit in an area of 480 mm × 15 mm. Moreover a novel feeding strategy is proposed to simplify the complexity and the costs of the unit cell. The new approach is based on replacing the coaxial lines with integrated parallel plate waveguides (PPW). Two examples of unit cell design are presented: one consists in a single-polarized array of connected slot, covering the band from 70 GHz to 140 GHz, for automotive radars; another example is referring to a dual-polarized connected slot array covering the same 2-8 GHz range, for wideband base stations. The design procedure of a PPW and cavity is easier than that of the integrated coaxial, as the feed and the radiating slot design are better decoupled. The number of layers of the ADL is also reduced with respect to the integrate coaxial, because part of the impedance transformation is implemented in the PPW.","Connected Arrays; Aritificial Dielectric Layers; PPW","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-28","","","","","",""
