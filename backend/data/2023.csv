(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The demand in global trade of goods is thriving in the recent post-COVID times and is forecast to increase to the highest levels of the past decade. This calls for global transportation companies to implement increasingly efficient and highly optimized transportation processes to fulfill both demand and their need for economic and environmental sustainable solutions. This paper presents a combined route construction algorithm (RCA) and a set-partitioning model (SPM) formulation to solve the air express transportation problem (AETP). An optimal set of routes is selected to transport a set of shipments from origin to destination whilst minimizing the total transportation time for all shipments included. The set of shipments and a set of movements is gathered from a global air express courier. The combined model finds an improvement on the historical implementation by the courier for 24.9% of the shipments for which at least one feasible route is constructed. Four alternative approaches that match real-life strategies of an air express company are implemented. The number of shipments for which the model finds a feasible solution is increased by 9.9% by allowing late delivery of a shipment. The preference of air express companies to select historically implemented paths for specific origin destination pairs (od-pairs) is also implemented. Compared to the general implementation, the number of shipments following a historically implemented path increases by 12.3% using this adapted formulation. The degree of this real-life preference of historically implemented paths by air express companies can be varied using a bi-objective formulation of the SPM. Finally, a chance constrained formulation is included to assume the upper bound of the movement capacity based on the strategy of an air express company in terms of level of risk.","shipment; transportation; optimization; express courier","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Air Transport and Operations","",""

Sommalife has been successful at this to a small extent and has set the stage for an impactful act in West Africa. Sommalife currently does this with their own profits as the shea supply chain does not pay for impact at the moment. Without this support Sommalife will struggle to scale and improve its impact.

(mentor); Ragni, D. (graduation committee); Avallone, F. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Desert sand acoustic emissions are produced when a “sonic sand” is sheared locally or by a natural dune slipface avalanche, resulting in a brassy sound between 50 and 400 Hz. This type of sediment exhibits particular granulometric, shape and surface characteristics, due to the grains’ erosion and transport history, and emits sounds when the sheared grain layer vibrates in a synchronized manner, much like the membrane of a speaker. Recording such sand acoustic emissions on Mars (and perhaps other planetary environments) using rover microphones could thus become a new form of observable for scientists to estimate the surface sediment’s characteristics and history from a distance, but also the granular flow dynamics taking place. To determine whether this approach could be viable in the future, it is essential to evaluate how the Martian environment may affect sand acoustic emissions differently than on Earth. After showing that the muted Martian soundscape would likely allow rovers to detect such signals from a few tens of meters, the present thesis studies the impact of the interstitial air pressure within the sand bed on the sound emission mechanism of such sonic desert sands.<br/><br/>In this project, silent and sonic desert sand shear flows are induced under a range of pressure levels, from terrestrial ambient pressure to Mars-like pressure, within two separate, manually operated vacuum chamber setups: a smaller chamber shaken to create the sounds, and another longer chamber that better replicates avalanche-like sand flows. The motion applied and sound produced are measured using an accelerometer and a microphone inside the chamber. Metrics in the time and frequency domains are defined to analyse the changes in sound energy, amplitude, and frequency components produced at different pressure levels. Firstly, the silent sand tests are used to establish how the air pressure level within the experimental setup affects the regular sound of sheared sand (i.e. grains impacting one another) and more generally the sound emission of “normal” sounds, whose emission mechanisms do not depend on grain packing and synchronized motion. Then, a simplified theoretical model of how the sound pressure level (SPL) of a sound evolves with decreasing acoustic impedance, is derived and validated using the silent sand measurements performed. Finally, the sonic sand measurements are compared to the SPL model and silent sand measurement results, which are used as a baseline for nominal sound production behavior, to evaluate how the interstitial air pressure affects the amplitude and signal energy of the sheared sonic sand emissions. Furthermore, differences in the sand acoustic emissions’ frequency spectra and time duration across pressure levels provide information about the possible physical changes occurring in the granular flow dynamics of the sheared sonic sand.<br/><br/>In both experiments, the dominant frequency very closely follows the trend of the motion metrics used, as described in the literature, and remains very consistent across pressure levels. This suggests that the maximum sheared sonic sand layer thickness is independent of the interstitial air pressure. Then, the sonic sand emissions see an increase in the sound amplitude and signal energy related metrics from ambient pressure to 413.25 mbar, unlike the gradual decrease predicted by the SPL model and the trend of silent sand measurements with decreasing pressure. Below 413.25 mbar, the results suggest a stabilized behavior, with the acoustic metrics of the emissions following the model. Furthermore, in the avalanche-like emissions, a new frequency component slightly higher than the dominant frequency emerges as the chamber pressure decreases. These observations are evidenced in the time-domain, where the sand acoustic emissions seem to initiate earlier in the granular flow at 413.25 mbar and below, resulting in greater acoustic pressure levels being produced, compared to those at terrestrial pressure. It is hypothesized that more sheared sonic sand grains synchronize at 413.25 mbar and below (compared to terrestrial air pressure), and thus increase the amplitude of the sound wave produced. For avalanche-like flows, the new frequency component that appears with decreasing pressure level seems to suggest that the minimum sheared layer thickness threshold required to produce an emission is lowered at lower pressure, which leads to a higher frequency produced initially until the full layer forms, ultimately decreasing the frequency. Further research is required to confirm these preliminary findings and theories.","sand acoustic emissions; Mars; Planetary acoustics; sediment characterisation; booming dunes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Researchers have discovered a new attack technique that can be used for launching large DDoS attacks, which involves TCP reflective amplification by abusing middleboxes and IoT devices. In order to assist Internet Service Providers (ISP's) in mitigating this vulnerability present at their customers, a deeper understanding of this novel attack technique is needed. <br/> The thesis primarily focuses on exploring vulnerable devices and their end-users within the consumer network of a Dutch ISP, KPN. The ultimate goal is to gather more information on the types of vulnerable devices and actors involved to eventually assist an ISP in making informed decisions to remediate the vulnerability in their network.<br/>The study found that the problem can be described in two different issues: vulnerable middleboxes and vulnerable consumer IoT devices with broken TCP protocols. The problem of vulnerable middleboxes has been solved in the network of the Dutch ISP as manufacturers have released updates remediating the vulnerability. This is not the case for vulnerable consumer IoT, as updating consumer IoT devices does not necessarily address the vulnerability present in the devices that have been identified. However, vulnerability notifications can potentially be useful for end-users to encourage them to update their vulnerable devices.<br/>The study highlights the presence of vulnerable devices in the ISP network that cannot be remediated by updating the device due to the unavailability of a fix. This calls for the exploration of alternative notification methods like walled garden notifications for ISP's to address the issue as mail notifications seem not feasible at the moment of writing. While updating devices is a suggested solution, it may not be feasible for end-users with vulnerable consumer IoT devices, making it crucial for manufacturers to ensure their products have secure TCP protocols. While end-users are motivated and capable to keep their vulnerable devices up to date, whether or not they receive a vulnerability notification from their ISP, this action alone will not fully address the vulnerability as long as manufacturers remain unaware of the issue or fail to provide updates to remedy it.<br","IoT; DDoS; Computer security; End-user behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(graduation committee); Dekens, Bart (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Rapid discharge of excess water has always been the core of Dutch water management. Due to climate change, a change in strategy is required. A future-proof drainage strategy consists of three steps: 1) retention, 2) storage, and 3) controlled removal. This thesis comprises the design and evaluation of an algorithm for groundwater-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) of water table control systems in polder areas. The objective is to maximize retention of precipitation, thereby contributing to the first component of the new drainage strategy. The control algorithm is developed for water table control on a single plot surrounded by a ditch, and three variants of water table control systems are considered: 1) water table control without drains, 2) water table control with submerged drains, controlled by ditch water level, and 3) water table control with submerged drains, controlled by sump water level. As a first approach, a relatively high, fixed setpoint is applied to maximize retention of precipitation. The controller adjusts the crest level of a weir that manages the ditch or sump water level. The algorithm performance is assessed through model simulations for two case study areas with distinct geohydrological response times within the management area of Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland: 1) Polder Het Langeveld, a sandy polder located in the Flower Bulb Region, and 2) Polder Vierambacht, a clayey polder located in the Green Heart. Groundwater-based MPC anticipates precipitation events. Since the forecast horizon for which accurate precipitation forecasts are available is restricted, the feasibility of groundwater-based MPC is dependent on the response time of the groundwater system. Systems with a fast groundwater response are not suitable for water retention, while proper groundwater table control is possible. Control of systems with long system response times is hard, but these systems are applicable for water storage. A trade-off between controllability and water storage should thus be made. For the applied weir settings and objective function, a system response time lower than 10 days is required for proper control. Direct control of groundwater levels could induce a certain groundwater storage or water retention, depending on the applied setpoint.","Model Predictive Control; Water table control; Groundwater modelling; Optimal control; Water Resources Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Space debris fragments smaller than 10 cm cannot be tracked from Earth and are generally neglected in conjunction and risk analyses because of this. However, these fragments pose a great threat, as they can lead to collisions. Currently, the threat that space debris poses on the space environment is getting larger, so methods to mitigate said debris need to be explored. The technique that was studied here, consisted of a passive spacecraft with a circular cross-sectional surface of a material, such as aerogel or foam, with the ability to decelerate and catch the debris fragments encountered. Given this choice, a capture analysis was carried out for such a potential technique. It was concluded, that the most favorable orbital settings for such a method, would be in the case of an explosion of an active or defunct spacecraft, as a direct reaction device. This scenario was then simulated using the orbital parameters of the Kosmos 1408 anti-satellite missile test. The results showed that for a spacecraft with a collector radius of 20 meters, 2 to 3% of the newly created fragments were caught, whereas, for a larger spacecraft with a radius of 100 meters, that number increased to up to 12%. The ideal deployment time for a spacecraft of 20 meters radius was found to be 12 hours after the fragmentation, whereas for 100 meters it was 6 hours. It was found that the capability of such a method is highly dependent on the catcher size, whereas deployment time has a smaller impact. Moreover, it was concluded that the performance of this technique is very sensitive to injection inaccuracies, as the number of fragments caught would be close to zero.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Furthermore, the parameters σ1 and σ2 allow for extra degrees of freedom when compared to the models mentioned earlier, which yields a new exponent for poly-logarithmic distances and a generalised constant for doubly logarithmic distances. Our second contribution lies in the techniques used to prove these results. In particular, we show that with probability tending to 1 there is a subset of vertices that behaves pseudo-randomly with regards to the expected amount of vertices with a given weight in any radius. The presence of this subset, which we call a net, allows for the avoidance of the use of FKG-like inequalities in proofs. Primarily, it allows us to reveal all relevant weights in advance, which allows us to disregard many correlations that we would otherwise need to take into account during construction of paths.","Random Graph; Spatial random graphs; Small-world phenomenon; Ultrasmall-world phenomenon; Long-range percolation; Scale-free percolation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

During the day, when traffic density is higher, vector-based operations are used. The Dutch Air Traffic Control aims to implement fixed approach trajectories when traffic density is high. This shift from the current vector-based operations will allow aircraft to perform a continuous descent and fly around inhabited areas, reducing the emissions and noise. To improve the capacity of the landing runway in strong headwind conditions, time-based separation is envisioned. Separating aircraft on time will result in a constant runway capacity in all wind conditions. However, to make these changes possible, additional decision support tools are required to assist controllers and reduce their workload. This paper discusses the use of a new toolset, centered around a time-space diagram which shows the expected arrival time and distance-to-go to a selected reference waypoint. Results of an experiment with eight professional air traffic controllers show that the added tools allowed future conflicts to be solved sooner and with fewer instructions. Aircraft followed the fixed approach trajectories better in the latter stages of the approach when compared to current vector-based operations. Although a slight increase in runway capacity was observed with the new toolset, it was not statistically significant. The workload of the controllers did not show a difference when using the new toolset. In conclusion, the added tools enabled the controllers to combine fixed approach trajectories with time-based separation. However, to reduce perceived workload, future designs should aim to integrate the time-space diagram on the main radar screen such that controllers do not need to switch attention between screens.","Air Traffic Management; Time-Based Separation; Fixed Approach Trajectories; Air Traffic Control; Decision Support Tool; Time-Space Diagram","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-04-13","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Schrijer, F.F.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Turbulent drag reduction (DR) is a crucial research area, as this can contribute to significant energy and emission reductions in various industrial and transportation applications. One such technique is the active flow control method of spanwise forcing. Spanwise forcing introduces a spatio-temporal spanwise wall oscillation as a boundary contrition. Consequently, a phase-varying spanwise velocity profile is generated, that poses useful interaction with the near-wall turbulence resulting in a drag-reduced flow state. DR values of over 40% have been found in both numerical and experimental realisations.<br/><br/>The objective of this thesis is twofold. Firstly, the idea is proposed that spanwise forcing can be realised passively by geometric surface modifications to create a spatially varying spanwise velocity profile. Secondly, supporting the first objective is the idea of investigating active flow control, in this case spatial spanwise forcing, which can aid in the development of passive techniques. The underlying philosophy is gaining understanding of the key factors and mechanisms that contribute to DR by studying active techniques. Subsequently, these leanings can be applied to advance the development of passive techniques. This research rationale is combined with a new pathway for turbulent DR. By actuating the outer-scaled low-frequency turbulent structures in the logarithmic layer, instead of the conventional approach targeted at high-frequency inner-scaled structures. Unlike the decreasing trend observed in inner-scaled actuation (ISA), outer-scaled actuation (OSA) exhibits a positive correlation between DR and Re<sub>τ</sub>, making it particularly useful for practical applications that operate under high Reynolds number conditions, such as long-distance pipelines or aviation.<br/><br/>The first part of the thesis investigates the DR and OSA potential of passive techniques. Three techniques are considered: dimples, sinusoidal undulations and oblique wavy walls. Eight test plates are realised for direct force measurements and a detailed investigation into the scale-specific streamwise turbulence kinetic energy using hot-wire anemometry (HWA). From the direct force measurements, the DR trends with Re<sub>τ</sub> are inconclusive due to uncertainties originating from a correction term and the results falling within the 95% confidence interval. A slight reduction of outer-scaled energy is observed for the sinusoidal undulations, hinting at effective OSA. Furthermore, one of the oblique wavy walls shows a broadband energy reduction in the wall-normal region 10 ≤ y<sup>+</sup> ≤ 100.<br/><br/>The second part of the thesis is focused on active flow control, specifically, the method of spatial spanwise forcing. A research gap was identified for spatial forcing, with no experimental realisations to date and only a number of numerical studies. Furthermore spatial forcing is of interest since it shows the closest analogy to a passive counterpart. An experimental setup is proposed, titled the steady spanwise excitation setup (SSES). The experimental setup realises spatial forcing using a series of spanwise running belts that run in alternating spanwise directions so as to generate a spatial square wave forcing. The thesis presents a proof of concept of the aerodynamic working using a prototype setup with four belts. Stereo particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements showt hat a significant flow control effect can be realised with this type of forcing, with a maximum DR value over 39%. Accordingly, the turbulent stresses are significantly reduced. The spanwise velocity profiles are in qualitative agreement with the model based on the laminar solution, with an almost exact match at y<sup>+</sup> ≤10.<br","Turbulent drag reduction; Spanwise forcing; Outer-scaled actuation; Experimental study; Flow control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-04-13","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However, in a re-entry flight scenario, standard waverider designs face challenges such as stability, controllability, heat load management, and performance at off-design conditions. In this research, a baseline waverider design is established and then modified to feature blunt leading edges, aerodynamic surfaces for trim and control, and fins for lateral-directional stability. Shape variations are then introduced using central-composite designs, and the re-entry trajectories of all generated vehicles are optimised numerically in a constrained multi-objective framework. Performance indices (cross-range, heat load, pitch stability, lateral-directional stability and aileron controllability) are computed for each optimal trajectory, and response surfaces relating them with the shape variables are constructed and optimised independently using an interior point method. From this process, desirable, irrelevant and conflicting shape features for the various performance indices are identified. A novel local surface inclination method blending the tangent-wedge and modified Newtonian models was introduced to compute the aerodynamic force and moment coefficients of the waveriders. Finally, an existing program to compute the convective heat flux on the surface of blunt-nosed vehicles at hypersonic speeds was computationally optimised, and then extended to support waverider-like geometries with leading edges and stagnation lines.","Hypersonic; Re-entry vehicle; Optimisatiom; response surface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-04-11","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The thesis objective is the design and testing of a novel predictive climate controller, for tomato greenhouses agriculture, able to conclude on the optimal yield-energy consumption ratio with limited intervention by the human factor. The main novelty introduced by this algorithm is the use of crop variables in the decision-making process according to the Speaking Plant Approach (SPA). However, no straightforward recipe indicates which crop signals could be used. In the context of this study, it is explored how crop variables, measurable by thermal imaging, can be used for the formulation of a SPA-based objective function. Specifically, the research focuses on stomatal conductance, the canopy, and the mean canopy temperature, for the SPA-based objective function formulation. The cost function generation entails the definition of the necessary state constraints. Except for the objective function definitions and the determination of constraints, a predictive controller requires a system representation that acts as a predictor. Nevertheless, the complex and non-linear nature of the climate-crop system complicates the system identification process. Concurrently, data science is blooming and new data-driven system representation techniques are breaching. Data-Enabled Predictive Control is a novel control policy based on systems behavioral theory which uses a non-parametric system representation enabling the omission of the system identification process. This approach has not been tested for the description of highly complex climate-crop systems. Therefore, another target of this project is to examine the capabilities of this data-driven predictor for the representation of the climate-crop model and evaluate if and how can be used as a predictor in a climate control regime.","stomatal conductance; Speaking Plant Approach; climate control; greenhouse; agriculture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-04-11","","","","Embedded Systems","",""

Our responsibility is to ensure the rights and duties of other legitimate uses by completely removing the ageing monopile from the seabed to continuously redeveloping offshore wind farms within the same location. The growing number of past, present, and future monopile installations opens up the challenges and opportunities to be responsible and lead the decommissioning market. With the goal of complete removal, a novel GDP technique can be the win-win solution for offshore wind operators and contractors to extract the monopiles completely from the seabed using torsional and axial vibration<br/>This thesis seeks to understand the torque and normal force to safely clamp a monopile during a torsional vibration so that the monopile continuously slips over the soil. Gradual soil failure along the pile-soil interface's full depth due to the monopile's torsional motion is a possible theory to explain the failure mechanism. When an upper part of the pile successfully moves relative to the soil, kinetic friction occurs until the soil resistance is larger than the shearing at one point. If more shearing is added by adding more torque, more layers below will be broken while the upper part keeps sliding due to lower friction than static friction. While the linear elastic theory of solid and thin shell bodies is used within a 3D FE modelling in Ansys to couple the soil and pile, the clamping force due to the GDP shaker is decoupled from the analysis. Failure criterion is defined outside the simulation so that the gradual soil failure is done through several simulations assuming discrete soil layers.<br/>The FE model is constructed and verified by analytical calculation through the semi-infinite cavity-pile-soil, wave reflection, and finite cavity-pile-soil-spring-dashpot problems. Several cases of gradual soil failure are simulated and show that the torque amplitudes form a distribution. Firstly, a probabilistic sense is proposed to interpret the torque amplitude and search for the optimum depth of the soil failure. Secondly, a convergence check is made with the help of an analytical shell-spring by considering more soil elements by virtue of good correlation of the shear stress between the analytical and FE model. It eventually suggests that a convergence of the torque amplitude can be achieved, which reinforces the theory of gradual soil failure. The interpretation suggests that the current GDP shaker is one step closer for a monopile extraction test with typical monopile dimensions that correspond to a typical 1 m diameter. A first approximation of the required torque and clamping force is then proposed to benefit the analytical model for larger diameters up to 6 m.","Forced torsional vibration; Monopile extraction; Ansys mechanical; Dynamics; Wave propagation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering | Bottom Founded Structures, Arctic and Wind","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The central question for this thesis project was how you can design outfits and garments that deliberately influence or induce moods. The focus of this project was on both a cheerful mood, as well as on a relaxed mood. It became apparent that the relation between moods and fashion is constructed of many facets. There are materialistic properties of garments that are specific to a mood, such as the use of materials or fit of an outfit. Next to that, moods have an influence on how one feels the need to interact with the people around them, in which clothes can support that need: using an outfit as a shield to hide a mood from the people around them. Lastly, personal meaning towards an outfit has an influence on how it affects one’s mood. When, for example, one wore an outfit in a period in which they felt most cheerful, that outfit carries these memories and meaning with it, transferring it to one’s current affective state.<br/><br/>Intertwined, all of these facets play a role in the way clothes can influence and induce moods. As a designer, it was the task to unravel these aspects and find a way to translate them into design principles for the Fashion Design process. To do so, meaning and experiences that are associated with either a relaxed or cheerful mood were gathered and translated into design principles <br/><br/>What was found is that clothes provide hints of impact on the wearer’s moods. Small changes in their perception, energy level or focus hint towards an indication that a change in their mood had occurred. These changes can include a more productive attitude due to an active sitting posture triggered by an outfit, an optimistic feeling when seeing yellow patches the moment the wearer let his head hang, or a relaxed feeling when you feel hugged by the touch of fabric on your skin. Whilst moods are often longer lasting drivers of behaviour and perceptions, these hints of impact relate to relatively short periods of time in which the outfit is actually worn.<br/><br/>When designing outfits that induce a cheerful mood, it is important to pay attention to increasing the level of confidence of the wearer, making them feel confident and empowered. This results in the implementation of high quality fabrics and finishing of the garments, as well as an outfit that flatters and highlights areas of the body the wearer wants. When inducing a relaxed mood, it is important that the wearer is not conscious about their outfit. Resulting in simple, and neutral outfits that do not give much stimulus to the wearer. What connects these moods with consciousness and confidence is the personal style of the wearer, which is crucial in the process to achieve the wanted effect. When the outfit is not in-line with the personal style of the wearer, they feel conscious about this difference, and feel less confident whilst wearing it since it does not reflect their personality.<br","Fashion design; design for mood; Mood regulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Coelen, J. (mentor); Koudijs, Joris (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The purpose of this graduation thesis is to design for Tiler’s long- term strategy, based on research into mobility. As a hardware startup that produces a wireless charging solution for light electric vehicles, Tiler sought guidance on its next steps to grow into a thriving business in the future. The company finds itself in the tumultuous mobility industry, which changes fast as the world tries to decarbonise transport. The mobility transition requires collaboration between different stakeholders such as municipalities, mobility providers and other parties that help to enable the changes society wants to see. Forging a future of sustainable transport in cities results in boosts of innovation and regulatory responses as we try to define what we want urban mobility to be like.<br/>After conducting in-depth research into the mobility context during the exploration phase, this project describes the design process of creating a dynamic roadmap for Tiler as a strategic tool for the future. This concept was crafted based on trend research, knowledge of the stakeholder system and technologies that could drive the product evolution. The designed roadmap distinguishes itself from the common format as it integrates the uncertainties of the mobility context through use of scenarios. To evaluate the content, the concept was tested with experts. To discover the value for Tiler, the concept was evaluated with the team in the form of a workshop. In this session, I facilitated a walk-through of the concept which triggered discussions about the impact of alternative future scenarios.<br/>Based on this evaluation, the team has gained insights on which markets to approach, which stakeholders to manage closely and the importance of continuing the conversation about the company’s future strategy on a weekly basis. The dynamic roadmap concept shows the potential to be adopted by the company. Furthermore, to extends its application, additional research and design activities could focus on making it suitable for other target groups and adding additional visual elements to bring the future to life even more.","urban mobility; micromobility; wireless charging; dynamic roadmapping; scenarios; mobility transition; start up; strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Kroon, C.P.J.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Dementia is a part of our society. One in five people, and for women even one in three, will develop dementia. Dementia has a significant impact on the lives of those affected, as well as their loved ones. This design project focuses on the impact of dementia on the adult children of a parent with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>Once a parent is diagnosed with dementia, a complex situation occurs that forces the adult child to adapt to - and cope with - this new situation. A situation in which three processes can be distinguished: dementia and its effects, the social connection(s) between them or others and the grieving processes. These three processes create a complex reality as each of them are unpredictable, unique to the individual, and influences and intertwines with the other processes. To understand and to design for this complex world; several research and design activities have been conducted to map this context that the child and parent with dementia are in. These activities aimed at involving the perspective and experience of both experience and dementia experts. <br/><br/>Due to Alzheimer's, the brain cells of the parent are damaged, affecting their behavior, thinking, and emotions. There are three stages, in which the parent first mentally and later physically deteriorates. The dementia in the parent's brain brings many changes and losses, especially of great impact on the adult child in the long term.<br/><br/>It is noteworthy that there are many formal caregivers involved in the care of the parent with dementia. The experience of support provided by these formal caregivers to the adult child depends on the individual characteristics and approach of the caregiver. There is a clear need from the perspective of formal care for tools and strategies to better understand and support the loved ones of the patient. Within the informal social circles of the adult child, differences in coping mechanisms can sometimes manifest themselves in not experiencing the desired support.<br/><br/>Because grief is often associated with loss through death, anticipatory grief that accompanies dementia does not always receive the attention it deserves. Anticipatory grief for the adult child is unique to the individual, unpredictable, and ambiguous. Providing space for this form of grief is crucial because it can lead to a healthier and less intense grieving process after the parent's death. Talking to others, sharing experiences, acquiring knowledge, and having social support are all important factors in creating this space.<br/><br/>The exploration of these three processes through various research activities has led to the discovery of a phenomenon: the ""period of acknowledgement"". This period is characterized by the realization of the adult child that dementia is a progressive disease that cannot be avoided. They also come to understand that it is the disease that is changing their parent, and not the parent themselves. Acquiring knowledge about dementia and grief, and reflecting on their personal experiences, is essential in developing this period of acknowledgement.<br/><br/>The design goal for this project is based on this period of acknowledgement: “to enable the adult child whose parent is dealing with dementia to discover the impact of the dementia on themselves with the help of knowledge about dementia and grief, thereby increasing the awareness and creating more room to grieve over time.”<br/><br/>Various ideas were generated in brainstorming sessions, translated into physical prototypes to be tested with adult children, and further developed in co-creation. These design activities resulted in the development of a tangible reflection tool called ""grip"", which aims to provide space for adult children to explore and share their personal experiences and emotions related to the impact of dementia on their lives.<br/><br/>The grip tool facilitates conversations between the adult child and a conversation companion with tangible words to visually represent experiences, emotions, and losses related to dementia. It allows for the exploration of coping strategies and the development of new ways of coping, and it aims to provide social support and space for the adult child to share their grief. Overall, the grip tool aims to enable the adult child to better understand the impact of dementia on their lives and increase their awareness, creating more room to grieve over time.<br/><br/>However, further research will be needed to test and improve the impact of grip. Design recommendations for improving the tool have been given, such as simplifying the design, improving usability, testing with people in the avoidance phase, testing the effect on the long term, and creating a more inclusive design. In addition, suggestions have been made for implementing grip in the future.<br","social design; dementia; anticipatory grief; co-creation; generetive session; reflection tool; Conversation tool; Alzheimer; grief; User Experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Panders, Jeroen (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","In recent years, we have become increasingly aware of the vast impact of the fast fashion and textile industry. Over the years the fashion industry has been abundantly criticised over its limited consideration of social and environmental issues and the widespread impact that these have. By now, textile creation itself has a larger carbon footprint than all international flights and maritime shipping combined. The biggest change can be made within the creation of these textiles. This is where Byborre and the Window of Textile opportunities (WoTO) come into play. <br/>This project is executed in collaboration with Byborre: a frontrunner in creating transparent and responsible textiles and trying to change the way the textile industry operates. As part of their mission they launched WoTO: a platform and exposition that connects Byborre’s transparent textile supply-chain in order to collaboratively solve the industry’s sustainability challenges and aims to educate on responsible textile creation and use. This raised the following question that served as the kick-off for the project:<br/>“How can WoTO educate, inspire and connect textile users, academic and industry professionals in order to drive collaborative, transparent and responsible textile innovation and creation?” <br/>In order to find out, the project took a user-centred approach: the user’s perspective is leading in order to gain insight. User research consisting out of qualitative interviews, user-journeys and persona’s along with literature research on open and networked innovations was performed. The analysis of this research phase shows the complexity of interdisciplinary collaboration and the problems that users experience within WoTO: <br/>The concept of WoTO lacks clarity, resulting in different interpretations and expectations of the platform. The network partners experience a lack of guidance, facilitation and moderation which makes it hard to keep overview and manage expectations. Due to a lack of, - or unsuitable collaborative systems and tools it becomes challenging for the partners to stay involved, connected and aligned. This consequently results in an unclear narrative for the visitors. <br/>Based on ideation, co-creation and evaluation with stakeholders a service design vision for WoTO is created to alleviate this problem:<br/>The service design offers WoTO partners an accessible way to engage with the Window of Textile Opportunities and stimulates and facilitates interdisciplinary working and communication within, and outside of the WoTO network. Decreasing the gap between the textile supply-chain and brands/consumers. By doing so aiming to strengthen WoTO’s primary functions: to forge interdisciplinary connections &amp; educate on responsible creation and transparency. <br/>It does so by offering guidance, orchestration and structure through various touch-points that support the the newly constructed collaborative model and user flow. These touch-points can be attributed to four themes: <br/><br/>Stimulate engagement<br/>Create uniformity in collaboration<br/>Guide towards alignment and change<br/>Decrease the gap between the supply-chain and brands/consumers<br/><br/>To implement the service successfully a roadmap is given to help prioritise activities for the short term implementation. In order to make this possible it is recommended to further develop and test the service and keep the partners involved in this process. <br/>Ultimately, active partner orchestration and community management is essential to WoTO’s operations and interdisciplinary work. If not performed, partners can’t align and the service won’t be able facilitate its purpose.","Textile and clothing industry; innovation; Collaboration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

This so-called pseudo force has great potential to guide human movement. Previous research has exclusively focused on the effect of pseudo forces in open-loop environments, in which the user’s joint angular velocity cannot be corrected. As the latter is essential for providing movement guidance, this paper proposes the first closed-loop system in the field of pseudo forces, using amplitude-modulated pseudo forces as haptic feedback. With this feedback, the user was assisted in moving towards a specific target angular velocity. In a human factors experiment, the amplitude-modulated stimuli were compared to constant-amplitude stimuli. The results showed that amplitude-modulated pseudo forces significantly decreased the error between the user’s and the target angular velocity when continuous movement in the desired direction was achieved. Therefore, the study demonstrated that amplitude-modulated pseudo forces can effectively guide human movement, representing an essential step towards developing a wearable movement guidance device.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Price, R.A. (mentor); Veenhoff, James (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The production of denim harms the environment, and given the industry’s size, the negative impact is significant. Therefore, denim must be produced more sustainably. In order to bring about change in the industry, an increase in demand for eco-friendly jeans is necessary to incentivise investments in sustainable production methods. Here, low-cost clothing brands and retailers can play a crucial role. With their substantial share in the denim industry and their connection to consumers, they have the ability to grow demand through effective Sustainability Communication. Unfortunately, their efforts currently overwhelm and confuse consumers, consequently damaging consumers’ green buying intentions. Therefore, this thesis, in collaboration with House of Denim, a non-profit striving for a more sustainable denim industry, investigates how low-cost brands and retailers can adapt their Sustainability Communication to ultimately increase the popularity of sustainable jeans.<br/><br/>To find a solution, this thesis examines the inter-organisational relations in the current system for SC, the brand's and retailers’ experience of the system and future notions by means of interviews and a literature study.<br/><br/>The investigation of the current system uncovered the multifaceted complexity that causes the SC shortcomings of low-budget brands and retailers. The inter-organisational challenges that contribute to this complexity are the indefinite and incomplete means of authorities that fall short in offering the industry constructive guidance. In addition, internal challenges from brands and retailers contribute to the complexity as their commercial strategy is in conflict with sustainability efforts; they operate individually and end up discouraged. On top of that, the competitive nature of the fashion industry, driven by seasonality, and fast-changing trends on low price points makes it challenging for low-cost brands and retailers to prioritise sustainable efforts. <br/>Nevertheless, upcoming European legislation and showcasing eco-efforts to consumers are the predominant motivators for these businesses to invest in sustainable practices.<br/><br/>To overcome the complexity, brands and retailers must collaborate to level the playing field for SC towards consumers. Therefore, the final design is a proposal for a Dutch Denim Coalition. It presents the vision in a storytelling poster, suggests a strategy to build the coalition and offers dialogue starters. The coalition unites brands and retailers and connects them with knowledge and experts. The goal is to encourage managers from brands and retailers to adopt the same principles for sustainable denim and collectively work on improving the current system for SC. <br/><br/>This thesis highlights the fundamental issues that hinder the change of these low-cost clothing brands and retailers. It emphasises the significance of involving non-sustainable brands and retailers in sustainability discussions, as they represent a large part of the denim market and cannot be ignored. Hence, the design suggests a new direction for House of Denim which revives and enlarges the impact of their resources with a more inclusive view of the denim industry. Ultimately, it brings them one step closer to their vision; a Brighter Blue. <br","Denim; Sustainability; Communication; Transition design; System-Thinking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The goal was to incorporate these elements into a lighting system concept that is manifested in a working prototype.<br/>• Bright – Many nursing homes are too dark for the elderly to perform tasks. Vertical illumination may improve the perception of brightness and spaciousness.<br/>• Natural – From the perspective of biophilic design and healing environments, nursing homes could benefit from natural light, shapes, and materials to improve the space’s restorative affordances.<br/>• Lively – From the standpoint of lighting design, nursing homes could benefit from lively elements such as patterns and brilliance to balance the visual aesthetics.<br/>• Pleasant – The aesthetics and light effect should not be annoying because several residents will glance at it daily.<br/><br/>The project started with literature research on lighting and biophilic design, visiting fairs on lighting and 3D printing, and meeting stakeholders from Signify and nursing homes. Prototypes were created iteratively and with increasing fidelity with light sources, cardboard, and 3D printing throughout the project to explore and evaluate ideas. Image-generating AI tools served as inspiration, and parametric design was used to model complex designs. The product experience design was guided by Nine Moments of Product Aesthetics, and the theory of Unity and Variety guided the product experience design in the detailing of the concept.<br/><br/>Livy, the final concept, consists of 3D wall panels and spotlights that together create a nature-inspired light effect. The lighting system increases the perceived brightness of the room by vertical illumination and reflecting diffuse light into the space from vertical wall panels. The light also improves the liveliness and brilliance of the lighting atmosphere by creating dynamic shadows and caustics. Natural materials are introduced through the wooden panels and filaments in a natural shape and pattern. The light is warm white and indirect for a pleasant feel.<br/>A formal validation was conducted with elderly residents (<i>N = 13</i>) in a nursing home. Ratings of brightness, naturalness, liveliness, and pleasantness were rated on a four-point scale. The judgments revealed that the majority of these goal elements were judged positively. The prototype appeared bright (<i>Mean = 3</i>), lively (<i>Mean = 3.2</i>), and pleasant (<i>Mean = 3.5</i>) with the luminaires switched on. Several participants perceived the concept as natural (<i>Mean = 2.4</i>) and referred to natural metaphors. As expected, the brightness was rated significantly higher compared to the luminaires switched off, which was not true for the other ratings.<br/>The project offers valuable insights and a practical example of how digital manufacturing can be used in lighting design within Signify. There is potential for designing illuminated surfaces that combine natural patterns and materials with lighting to create visually appealing spaces. This digital approach also demonstrates opportunities for Signify to develop products that cater to aesthetic preferences and, in particular, lighting needs in a context. Additionally, it identifies opportunities for further steps to make products better reusable or recyclable. <br","lighting design; digital manufacturing; nursing home","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The elastoplastic method is performed with the program D-Sheet Piling and the program Plaxis is used as a finite element method. Measurements on a quay wall in Eemshaven Groningen are used to analyze which design method results in the best approximation of the real deformation. <br/><br/>The D-Sheet model, after some adaptations in the calibration, gives a relative good approximation of the deformations, except for the deformations at the top. This deviation can be up to 113%.The calculation with Plaxis results in a better approximation of the deformation with a deviation from the measurement of only several mm. Comparing the results of both methods shows a large difference in top deformation. Two possible explanations for this large difference are investigated. The first explanation is that the modelling limitations of D-Sheet lead to different results. A simplified Plaxis model simulating these limitations results in a top displacement of 17 mm. Secondly, the difference in the input of the soil stiffness between both models is investigated by linking both stiffness parameters E and kh to each other using the relation of Ménard. A D-Sheet model with adjusted values for kh results in only a small change in the top deformation. The remaining differences in results are attributed to the difference in calculation method.<br/><br/>Several variations are performed in a sensitivity analysis to investigate to which extent different input parameters would have led to different results.

To evaluate the performance of the simulator controller torque data of 4 different test subjects was collected and used as the input signal for the controller to theoretically assess its simulation performance. <br/>The simulator controller simulations, of 7 different slope angles for both seated and standing cycling, resulted in minimal longitudinal motion of the simulated trainer setup during low-resistance cycling situations and maximal motion during high-resistance cycling situations. During the simulations, the simulated cycling trainer setup stayed well within the maximal allowable ± 20 cm from its initial position. The intra-pedal stroke range of motion of the simulations was similar to the intra-pedal stroke range of motion measured on a cycling treadmill through a motion capture study. <br/>This thesis concludes that it is possible to translate outdoor longitudinal cycling dynamics to an indoor cycling simulator with torque as the only input. The theoretical assessment of the simulator controller shows that the metrics meet the requirements and are similar to real-world cycling.<br","Indoor Cycling; Cycling Dynamics; Longitudinal Dynamics; Simulator; Controller; Simulink","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Neuromusculoskeletal Biomechanics","",""

Current model implementations of intrinsic muscle properties are highly simplified, limiting their accuracy in replicating experimental short-range stiffness (SRS) behaviour, which appears to be important for stabilisation tasks. The Hill model, often used in musculoskeletal simulations, cannot account for SRS, while the Huxley model, which can account for non-linear muscle phenomena such as SRS , has a higher computational burden. The study compares a simplified Huxley-type model to two Hill-type models and determines the effect of intrinsic SRS on the control parameters of stabilizing 1- and 2-Degree of Freedom musculoskeletal models over various positive and negative stiffness positions in the force-length curve. Furthermore, the effect of the intrinsic muscle stiffness on the robustness of the feedback parameters of simple individual muscle feedback systems is determined in reaching experiments similar to classic experiments. <br/><br/>The study finds that the Huxley model shows positive SRS in the negative flank of the force-length curve, achieves stabilisation through only co-contraction using a lower level of required muscle excitation than both Hill-type models and stabilises both musculoskeletal systems at a larger muscle range than the Hill-type models, including in the negative stiffness flank. The feedback parameters dominantly responsible for muscle activation patterns are also more robust to change in the Huxley model. These findings suggest that intrinsic muscle stiffness impacts neural control parameters in stabilisation and reaching tasks, and further musculoskeletal modelling should consider using more complex muscle stiffness calculations for improved accuracy.","Huxley; Hill; Short-range stiffness; Muscle stiffness; Stabilisation; Reaching; Force-length; negative stiffness; negative flank; cross-bridge; Huxley-type; Hill-type; CE; PE; SE; force-velocity; self-stabilising; stabilising; self-stabilisation; neuromechanics; biomechanics; biomechanical; Intrinsic feedback; Intrinsic stiffness; Intrinsic muscle stiffness; muscle viscocity; reflex; reflex pathway; intrinsic pathway; intrinsic feedback pathway","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-24","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Neuromusculoskeletal Biomechanics","","52.00107845708114, 4.371212070976078"

An efficient manufacturing procedure is developed which uses a combination of stencil printing and inkjet printing to manufacture P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) actuators. The influence of layer thicknesses is studied theoretically and experimentally, in order to optimize the actuation output. The effect of the fabrication process on the EAP breakdown strength is studied as well. Unimorph cantilever actuators were successfully produced on both Novele and PEN substrates. Layer thickness of the EAP<br/>layer was controlled by changing the stencil thickness, producing layers ranging from 5 - 24 µm. A maximum quasistatic tip deflection of 760 µm was achieved for an 18 mm cantilever actuator at 560 V. Operating at the resonance frequency of 52 Hz, a 5.59 mm displacement was attained. Subsequently, a robotic fish with a length of 60 mm was designed with an integrated EAP actuator in the tail. In addition to the actuator manufacturing procedure, the fish was coated with silicone and attached to a floating device in order to perform experiments in water. The fish tail showed clear deflection underwater, especially when operating at the resonance frequency. However due to limitations related to the underwater operations and a large resisting force of the floating device and connected wires, propulsion power was insufficient to propel the robotic fish.","Electroactive polymer; robotic fish; actuator; smart materials; stencil printing; inkjet printing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-04-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

It addresses the practical problem of executives of the companies who miss information about the effects of the license change on the health of their community. From a scientific perspective, there is no existing research about cloud protection licenses. The thesis presents the required background information, including software licenses and commercial open source software. It considers community activity and community structure as indicators of community health and presents corresponding research. Five propositions about the impact of the license change are presented and examined using data from projects of MongoDB, Elasticsearch and Redis by creating visualizations using CHAOSS and Python scripts. First, we expect that changing the licensing terms from an open source license to a cloud protection license leads to reduced community activity. We evaluated both major types of community activity, technical activity and social activity, and could not find support for the proposition but contradicting developments in all projects. Second, we expect less individuals joining the community. Here, the decomposed time series data indicates contradicting developments in the projects of MongoDB and Redis. Third, we expect more community members leaving the community. When assessing this proposition, we found that the decomposed time series data is congruent with the proposition in the project of MongoDB. However, the data of the projects of Elasticsearch and Redis indicates no support for it. Fourth, we expect increased knowledge concentration among individuals in the community. To evaluate the knowledge concentration among community members, the onion model is applied which associates each member with a role for each quarter. The development of the shares of the onion roles within the community is analyzed, and the results contradict the proposition. Fifth, we expect increased knowledge concentration considering organizations in the community. To examine the last proposition, the proportion of contributions authored by employees of the respective company is determined for each month and the development evaluated. There is no contradicting evidence in the data and the developments in the projects are congruent with the proposition. In summary, the data indicates that the impact of a license change to a cloud protection license on community health is rather small and constrained to the concentration of knowledge in respect to organizations. Therefore, we can recommend executives to adopt a cloud protection license if it addresses the strategic needs of their companies. This thesis continued the research on the impact of choice and change of software licenses on open source communities by including cloud protection licenses and previously disregarded aspects of community structure. It relates to the Management of Technology study program by taking the perspective of companies to analyze the effects of their strategic choices on their open innovation processes. By studying the effects of a license change, it examines a problem that is located at the intersection of technology, organizations, and strategy.","Open source; Software Licenses; Community","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The study shows that requiring reservations has a significant impact on spreading out the pattern of arrivals, with gains seen at about 70% reservation percentages. The biggest improvements are observed at the throughput times of trolleys to cooled storage, with maximum throughput times decreasing up to 18%.

To assist in these tasks, haptic teleoperation systems provide the human operator with the sense of touch of the telerobot. One way to provide this sense of touch is through high-frequency vibration feedback. State-of-the-art solutions generally rely on integrated hardware, which limits their application to specific telerobots and master devices.<br/>The aim of this study is to develop a deployable high-frequency vibration feedback method through an add-on setup. In the presented system, both the vibration recording device and vibration feedback display run on a single microcontroller. Furthermore, all components are small in size and portable by the robotic or human hand.<br/>Spectral analysis of the replicated vibrations shows that the presented system is capable of mimicking textures. To evaluate the effectiveness of the texture imitations, a human factors experiment is conducted. Twenty participants executed a texture identification task for two conditions: a manual condition with direct tactile feedback and a teleoperated condition with tactile feedback displayed by the presented system.<br/>Results show that 75-85% of the textures were correctly identified in the teleoperated condition. These correctness rates are close to the results of the manual condition (96% correct) and outperform the chances of random guessing by a factor three.

In order to maintain absolute security of the networks and thus the society, one would need to separate everything, but this is not feasible. Consequently, sharing of resources is inevitable. There are security products that rely on an FPGA to create domain separation. The domain separation is required to prevent leakage of confidential information and manipulating of critical processes. A modern FPGA has enough resources to have multiple soft-cores initiated on it- each of them working in a different domain. However, due to the limited amount of IO pins on an FPGA, using multiple DRAM chips is not an option. Therefore a single DRAM is shared between multiple soft-cores, threatening the domain separation. The main threats when using a shared DRAM are communication channels due to latency deviations, data corruption due to rowhammering and direct access to unauthorized data due to the data being available on shared addresses. Research has been done to determine what causes the latency deviation and how to mitigate it. The results of the research are that the only fundamental solution to mitigate the latency deviation is to have a fixed latency when accessing the DRAM. A fixed time arbiter is designed and tested. The fixed time arbiter is using a deterministic delay after each DRAM access in order to mitigate the latency deviation. Before mitigating the rowhammer vulnerability it is shown that rowhammering causes bitflips not only in the adjacent rows, but also in non-adjacent rows. To mitigate the rowhammer vulnerability for adjacent rows, a row refresher is created that tracks the rows that are accessed and refreshes the adjacent rows when accessed more than the bitflip threshold. To mitigate the vulnerability for non adjacent rows a test is created to give an overview of all non adjacent rows that contain bitflips so that those rows can be be dedicated as unused guard rows. The last part that is implemented is an address mapper to be sure that no soft-core can access the addresses of another soft-core. The fixed time arbiter, row refresher and address mapper are combined into the memory domain protector. The consequence on the bandwidth of the DRAM is that the bandwidth is halved compared to the benchmark design. The memory domain protector also uses 23× more logic than a standard arbiter. ","dram; cyber security; Rowhammer Attacks; rowbuffer attacks; DRAM attacks; DRAM vulnerabilities; sharing dram","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

A popular way to reduce the computational cost and enable fast iteration cycles is to use surrogate models that are trained to predict simulation results from historical simulation data. While most traditional methods are parametric, ANNs are able to process geometries directly and are thus agnostic to the parametrization of the geometric models, which makes them appealing when working on multiple design campaigns. However, ANNs may fail to transfer the learned knowledge when used on new design campaigns that are significantly different from those used to train the model or when the size of the training data set is too small. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to increase the reliability of ANN-based surrogate models on new design campaigns and on small datasets. One main direction to achieve this goal is to incorporate prior physical knowledge into the learning process. Methods to supplement training data with a simplified solution, meaningful physical scaling, and governing equation-based losses were used. The data set used for this study was based on a real-life-inspired complex 3D parametrized geometry of an automotive HVAC system. <br/><br/>The methods were tested in generalization, transfer learning, and single-campaign inference tasks. Moreover, physics-informed losses were tested in an ill-posed setting as a prediction outlier correction tool. While the initial findings suggest that incorporating prior physical knowledge may improve model performance, especially in low-data regimes, further investigation is needed to draw any definitive conclusions. Additionally, the preliminary results related to the use of physics-informed losses as a correction method are inconclusive and require further experimentation in the future. Therefore, more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these approaches.","Machine Learning; Surrogate Modeling; HVAC; Automotive Applications; Neural Network; Graph neural networks; CFD; Physics informed; Physics Informed Neural Networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-04-04","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","","46.517737, 6.562798"

Recycling concrete material can directly contribute to the reduction of $CO_{2}$ emissions. This process is costly and time-consuming.

This thesis intends to prove that this technique can differentiate concrete with various chemical composition.<br/><br/>Fourteen concrete cubes of fourteen different chemical compositions were analysed to fulfil this objective. The fourteen compositions reflect the concrete design used in the Netherlands. Experimental programs conducted on the concrete revealed the impact of different factors on the results obtained from the handheld-XRF. These factors include measurement time, moisture, surface carbonation, and matrix effect. Each factor impacts various oxides in different proportions, leading to distinct patterns. After investigating their impacts, a protocol was written to test all the mixes. Finally, the reproducibility of the protocol was assessed, and the mixes were tested using the protocol.<br/><br/>The primary outcome of this thesis is proof that twelve of the fourteen mixes were differentiated based on their alumina content. This oxide proved to be less impacted by moisture and surface carbonation than the other oxides. The influence of the different factors on measurements was identified and quantified. These studies also revealed that twenty measurements were sufficient to identify the mixes. The protocol improved the control of the factors but also appeared limited by the concrete matrix.<br/><br/>A possible approach to circumvent this problem would be considering oxides content as thresholds rather than numbers.

Due to budget cuts, the Ministry of Defence decided to gradually leave the Marineterrein in 2011 and return the territory to the city of Amsterdam. The Marineterrein has been undergoing area development since 2013, gradually opening to the public and business activity since 2015. In recent years, an important focus has been on weaving the area into the urban fabric of Amsterdam. <br/>The Marineterrein now offers values to many different target groups, as more and more Amsterdam residents are finding their way there for recreation, sport, and business. I believe that the Marineterrein’s values of inclusiveness is the most important values, given that these core values of the city of Amsterdam and have been eroding in recent years.<br/><br/>However, exactly this value is under pressure due to the decision to turn the Marineterrein into an innovation district. An innovation district is a city area designed to bring together innovative companies, start ups, and knowledge institutions to stimulate innovation and economic growth. While the decision to convert the Marineterrein into an innovation district is well-founded given its history, research indicates that such districts tend to rapidly gentrify both economically and socio-culturally. The emergence of an incomprehensible monoculture, as innovative companies mainly attract the “knowledge class,” deters many other target groups and results in innovation districts becoming enclaves. <br/><br/>Citizens engagement might be the solution to maintain inclusiveness in the innovation district Marineterrein. By involving citizens a sense of ownership and affection can be stimulated. Collaboration and understanding of diverse perspectives are crucial for mutual tolerance and social cohesion. Within the context of the Marineterrein, a opportunity lays in involving citizens in “open innovation.” Open innovation is a participatory method of innovation. At the Marineterrein, the primary issue for involving citizens in open innovation the lack of effective communication interfaces between citizens and companies. Companies tend to operate behind closed doors, leaving citizens with no space to provide feedback or engage in a dialogue about innovation. The undesirable scenario of the Marineterrein drifting away from the rest of the city seems to become a reality. Therefore, the design goal of this project is to develop an interface that demystifies the innovative character of the district and stimulates citizens to engage in open innovation.<br/><br/>My.I.D. is a design concept that might be a first step to engage citizens in open innovation. Visitors can choose from eleven innovations routes to explore the innovative nature of the Marineterrein.

However, the main challenge has been on-chip integration of diamond color centers with high scalability and high yield. Many diamond integration methods have been researched, such as heterogeneous wafer bonding of diamond-on-insulator photonics. While this method offers high scalability and wafer level fabrication, optical performance is not guaranteed due to the non-ideal processing which results in lower yield. Another integration method is pick and place, which demonstrated high yield as the diamond color centers can be pre-selected before integration, and thus resulting in higher yield. Here, pick and place integration of diamond nano-photonic structures is presented. For that purpose, an adiabatic coupler is designed, with simulation results showing 0.36 dB insertion loss and 3dB misalignment tolerance of 180 nm and 5 um in x and z directions respectively. A mechanical support structure is designed such that optical losses at that interface are minimized. The simulated loss is reduced from 33 % to only 4 % and the cross-talk is -11 dB. Further optical measurement is needed to determine the achieved transmission of the integrated diamond chiplets. Finally, pick and place is performed with 6 different supporting structure designs. The yield is 25 % with minimum misalignment of 50 nm which is mainly dominated by random motion of the diamond chiplet as it gets closer to the receptor chip. This random motion is attributed to the surface roughness of the receptor chip and and lower surface of the diamond chiplet. In addition, residual charges in both chips results in Coulomb forces acting on the diamond chiplet and thus contributing to the misalignment. It is expected that the magnitude of the random motion, and consequently, the misalignment, will be improved by treating the receptor chip surface with HMDS and de-ionizing both the diamond chiplet and the receptor chip.","diamond color centers; diamond defects; quantum integration; nanophotonics; photonic integrated chip; Photonic integration; pick and place","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-04-04","","","","","",""

Graphene, being only an atom thin and one of the strongest known materials, offers promising potential for further miniaturization of MEMS microphones. However, the mass loading effect on the graphene membrane can impact the device’s resonance frequency and bandwidth.To address this issue, this study analyzes the dynamic response of the graphene membrane under different pressures and membrane parameters, such as diameter and thickness. The membranes are fabricated by using chemical vapour deposition, after which the membranes are transferred over a cavity. The measuring setup uses a laser Doppler vibrometer to measure the deflection of the membranes and investigate their dynamic response. Pressure-dependent experiments are performed to measure the resonance frequency of the membrane’s response, and the relationship between the radius, thickness, and resonance frequency is explored. By doing these measurements we explore the effect of air loading to investigate the ultimate performance limits of graphene membranes for microphone application.<br/>The experimental results show a clear presence of the air loading effect and align with earlier models of the resonance frequency with mass loading effects.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","With an increased demand for renewable energy wind farms, their efficiency receives growing attention from both the industry and academics. Mitigating wake interaction effects in wind farms is one of the ways wind farms could increase their efficiency. Control techniques to increase wake reenergizing are currently under development, however, are being held back by a lack of available medium-fidelity wake modeling methods. To sufficiently support developments in the wind industry, the wake model should yield an axial wind profile that can be used for load calculations for the downstream wind turbine and assess its energy production. Moreover, for the model to be useful in the research effort the method must either show an increase in accuracy or a decrease in time-cost. Finally, the model is desired to include the effects of wake control techniques in later iterations outside the scope of this research. This thesis investigates medium-fidelity models for wind turbine wake control techniques, with an exploratory study into applying a semi-infinite spectral method with an adjusted Laguerre basis to wind turbine wake modeling. The wake model used in this research is an altered version of the Ainslie wake model. To model the wake model a spectral method with Laguerre functions for the basis is employed in the radial direction and a marching scheme with a piecewise linear basis for the basis in the downstream direction. The potential benefits of spectral methods are lower rank systems and spectral convergence. The adjusted Laguerre functions used for this research naturally fit the boundary conditions for the wake model. At the start of the domain, a Dirichlet boundary condition is applied with fitted Laguerre functions to the result of a blade element simulation. The results did not account for wake expansion and diffused the wake much sooner than physical. The implementation of the explicit formulation for the triple product integral hindered higher-order simulations, disabling research into simulations for domains much higher than 11 radial modes. The errors for the different conservated quantities are significantly higher than they should be. From the verification efforts, a relation can be observed between the number of radial modes in the domain with respect to the number of radial modes used for the inflow, which suggests that the model should use much higher numbers of radial modes than this implementation allowed. i","Wind Energy; CFD; Spectral Methods","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics","",""

This study aims to address the problem of the weak interlayer bond by implementing the phenomenon of 'topological interlocking' to increase the mechanical interlocking between the layers. The study performed scale model printing in the form of mould-casting and caulk-gun extrusion to produce specimens to analyze the effect of grooving on interlayer bond strength.

The present research attempts to assess the unitised curtain walls seismic performance by identifying the occurring damage mechanisms based on full-scale testing and finite element modelling.<br/>The study initiates with a state-of-the-art discussing in detail the relevant research areas. Additionally, an introduction to the curtain wall numerical modelling field is provided. This literature review originates both from full-scale experimental testing and findings of academically developed finite element models. The case study of an experimental procedure is also described accompanied by the curtain wall response to the inter-storey drift implementation. <br/>The modelling approach is introduced by presenting the mechanisms and the recreated curtain wall behaviour. Additionally, the process of identifying the properties of the curtain wall the boundary and loading conditions is displayed. The various modelling phases, the initial numerical development, its improvement through the calibration with the experimental results and the calibrated version, are also included. <br/>The accomplishment of the first global curtain wall numerical model using DIANA FEA is a main research objective. The novelty consists in the exploration of the software possibilities and limitations which, although widely used for numerous applications, it hasn’t been utilised for façade numerical modelling. In general, the numerical representation of façade systems aims to provide a better insight of the curtain wall behaviour that will be eventually accurate to the extent that experimental tests won’t be needed for their validation. <br/>Another interesting area is the correlation of the numerical behaviour to the experimental results measured on the curtain wall mock-ups while undergoing seismic loading. The model calibration intends for a realistic representation of the actual performance as recorded during the full-scale testing. Additionally, the contribution of structural silicone sealants in the system post-earthquake behaviour through the comparative performance of façade samples with dry gasket and systems with structural silicone is assessed. This evaluation aims to reinforce the knowledge regarding the strengths and weaknesses of wet and dry configurations and to indicate their appropriate application. <br/>The research attempts to contribute to the seismic risk assessment of unitised curtain walls by identifying the governing failure mechanisms. This evaluation is performed with regards to the silicone sealant, simulating both dry and wet configurations. Thus, a sensitivity analysis varying over the structural silicone bite is developed with respect to the façade ultimate failure. The curtain wall overall response is addressed by evaluating several parameters (displacements, distortion, rotation and maximum stress per component). Moreover, the detection of the largest stress values occurring per element is used for the utilisation factors determination. This occurs by comparing the maximum stresses with the respective design values. The different outcomes provide the constructive context for further research of the façade response under seismic action. The study finalises with conclusions, considerations as well as suggestions for further research. Various challenges encountered are also introduced, aspiring to provide helpful information for future modellers.","building envelope; glazed unitised curtain wall; non-structural elements seismic verification; seismic response; earthquake engineering; seismic verification; performance-based design; finite element modelling; DIANA FEA numerical modelling; result extrapolation; governing failure mechanisms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering | Building Physics and Technology","",""

(mentor); Goto, L. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","As remote work becomes increasingly popular, many people are working or studying at their dinner table while seated in a chair that does not adequately support them or is not appropriately sized, leading to various physical complaints. Traditional office chairs are often big and bulky, and their design does not complement home environments. Additionally, adjusting these chairs correctly can be challenging since users often lack knowledge on how to do this and how to maintain a healthy posture.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to design a parametric chair that is both simple and beautiful, using customer body characteristics to create a mass-customizable 3D printed chair. This chair should fit seamlessly into the user‘s home environment while being personalized to their body. It is essential to obtain a thorough understanding of the home office worker‘s context and the definition of a healthy posture. This ergonomic knowledge is used to convert body measurements into a bucket chair design that provides the user with support in various postures while maintaining a comfortable and healthy posture.<br/><br/>The first step of the project involves analyzing the context of the home office worker. This includes studying the basis of chair design, conducting market research, and studying literature and expert interviews to understand what constitutes a healthy posture and what user characteristics must be considered. The findings from this analysis are then validated through a questionnaire to gain a better understanding of the user‘s context. A chair prototype is also developed to perform various user tests and to develop the backrest shape of the chair using a variety of different back shape measuring methods. Once all the important chair parameters are identified along with their corresponding body measurements, an algorithm is developed to create a personalized bucker chair shape. The resulting chair shape is 3D printed and user-tested.<br/><br/>It is crucial for a chair to allow for posture variation and provide support and comfort in forward, upright, and slouching postures while maintaining a natural spine curve to promote healthy posture. Due to time constraints, the backrest and support have been prioritized in development as they are crucial factors in achieving this goal. By positioning the lumbar support at the top of the pelvis, reducing the height to the underside of the shoulder blades, and limiting the width of the chair to not extend beyond the arms, users have enough freedom of movement of the upper body while rotating the pelvis forward to maintain a natural spine shape. The backrest angle and lumbar support are crucial in achieving balance while sitting, which is also a fundamental factor for healthy posture and sitting comfortably.<br/><br/>The algorithm generates a functional 3D-printed prototype with all elements personalized to the body dimensions of the intended user. Future research and testing should focus on validating the backrest design, improving the body measuring method, developing the seat pan and buttock bowl, addressing the comfort aspect of the chair, and creating a customer journey for ordering the chair.<br","Mass-customized; Ultra-Personalization; 3D printing; Home office desk chair; Integrated Product Design; Anthropology; Ergonomics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The first question was posed by Livework, a service design agency, which wanted to learn how systemic design principles can be applied in projects aimed at organisational sustainability transformations. The second client, Juvenile Company, a company that designs and manufactures strollers and other juvenile products, wanted to figure out what their relationship with customers and business partners should look like to reach their sustainability goals by 2035.<br/>Through a series of analyses and co-creative design activities, I discovered two key factors that might serve as an opportunity or barrier in Juvenile Company’s transition towards a more sustainable future: the relationship between parent and stroller in the current system and Juvenile Company’s culture of product innovation through design.<br/>Using context mapping, insight into the value exchanges between parent and stroller over time were captured. This led to identifying three distinct phases of value creation tied to a child’s developmental stages. It was found that the value implicitly delivered by the stroller over these developmental stages is the core value proposition of Juvenile Company.<br/>It was found that Juvenile Company’s current strategy of revenue growth through product innovation is at odds with its sustainability goals. To achieve its sustainability goals, Juvenile Company must rely on qualitative innovation, rather than quantitative, to drive revenue growth.<br/>Using the input from all research, a vision statement was formulated that describes the possibility space of Juvenile Company’s future innovation. “Juvenile Company empowers parents and their children to explore the world by providing value beyond products that adapts to parents’ changing needs without compromising the future needs of their children.”<br/>A design strategy concept was created to describe what a circular Juvenile Company will need to look like to be fully circular. The concept consists of four elements that build on one another. At the deepest layer sits a new mental model: a culture of innovation through qualitative value creation. To create qualitative value, on the next layer up we find a reframed version of the core value proposition discovered through the context mapping research. Juvenile Company focuses on developing value explicitly for the three developmental stages identified. To guide the development of this value, three core vision principles were developed: Value beyond products, Adapting to changing needs and Dependable guide. To further illustrate these vision principles, thirteen key propositions were designed that help shape what the relationship between parents and Juvenile Company could look like in the future.<br/>This strategy was conceptualised through two deliverables: a parent-Juvenile Company relationship journey map that describes how the key elements to the relationship interlink, and a children’s book that describes the story of how one family’s relationship with Juvenile Company develops over time.<br/>Through constant reflection over the course of this process, key insight was created into how Livework designers can implement systemic design principles in organisational sustainability transformation projects. A knowledge gap was identified, consisting of three layers that each describe a different type of knowledge Livework designers must acquire. Additionally, it was found that a major difficulty in applying systemic design principles will be adopting an ecosystemic design lens that focuses equally on human and non-human participants of a system. Further implications and opportunities were identified that might shape how Livework approaches design projects.","Systemic Design; Sustainability; Service Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Poliotti, M. (mentor); Ye, G. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Geopolymer concrete, a relatively new building material has been suggested as an alternative to Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) based concretes for within the building sector, due to it having a relatively low CO2 emission during production. An issue with geopolymer concrete however, is that high amounts of early age creep, shrinkage and decrease in elastic modulus over time has been observed which in conjunction with the existing research on geopolymer concrete having been predominantly conducted in laboratory settings, leads to questions about the applicability of these findings and thus the use of geopolymer concrete as a replacement for OPC based concretes in concrete structures. To address this issue, this study makes use of Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) fiber optic sensors, placing them within reinforced steel which in turn are placed inside geopolymer concrete to obtain data that is more applicable to real world settings compared to prior findings observed within laboratory settings.<br/>Four precast prestressed geopolymer concrete girders are produced and rebars containing FBG fiber optic sensors are placed prior to casting. Measurements before and after the release of prestressing are analysed to determine the apparent transmission length of the prestressing strands and compared to methods defined by Eurocode EN 1992-1-1. The applicability of these guidelines is evaluated, as these are intended for use with conventional concretes. The changes in strain over time, and elastic modulus changes during curing of the precast girder is monitored and analysed, focusing on the effect of time dependent changes of the concrete to the effectiveness of the prestressing forces. The girders are combined with a geopolymer concrete topping to form two beams and one slab. The beams are subject to a flexural test and a shear test respectively. The slab undergoes a cyclic loading test before being tested in two critical point load locations in two separate tests. The FBG measurements gained during the tests are evaluated using analytical methods.<br/>The results show that the FBG fiber optic sensors integrated into steel rebar can deliver strain measurements in locations conventional strain sensors cannot be applied. The FBG data suggests that conventional concrete transmission length guidelines are applicable to this geopolymer concrete mixture. As the FBG-integrated rebars were all placed in the same location in the precast girder cross section, the strains measured by these FBGs are only representative of concrete near the core of the girder, where the concrete is not exposed to drying conditions. And because this geopolymer concrete is susceptible to drying, the difference between measurements and expected values such as the elastic modulus and the drying shrinkage can be explained by the low amount of drying that the concrete in the core of the girder experiences. Due to the positioning of rebar in the cross section of the precast girder in this study, crack initiation during the flexural test was not detected. The occurrence of cracks is detected in the measured strains as it diverged from the linear elastic model during the crack propagation phase. This shows that the cross sectional position of the sensors is important for the desired function and role of concrete in-situ FBG monitoring.<br/>Overall, the data that the (rebar-integrated) FBG strain sensors can provide can be of great use towards the larger task of bringing geopolymer concrete structures to a real life application. In-situ FBG strain data of the precast prestressed girders provide additional information into the application of this SCGC mixture in larger scale structural elements. This data is a useful addition to the data gained through conventional methods, and results from lab testing. FBG monitoring can provide strain data from the core of structural elements, giving an insight of the behaviour during curing and (destructive) testing that is otherwise difficult to obtain.","Fiber optic sensor; Geopolymer concrete; Prestressed concrete; Material Properties; FBG","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

Socially vulnerable populations are highly dependent on yet often more likely to have less access to transport services and experience lower accessibility. This creates and reinforces social and spatial inequalities by trapping people in disconnected neighborhoods and segregated areas that continue to be deprived of access to opportunities. This research aims to develop a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) to explore how re-purposing existing streets for walking and biking could influence the accessibility of vulnerable neighborhoods to support decision-making in enhancing equity of accessibility. <br/><br/>In the SDSS, equity of accessibility is formulated as a generative design (GD) problem, named the Street Allocation Decision Problem (SADP), a single-objective optimization problem that searches for generated designs with the maximum weighted improvement in accessibility per unit of its cost. A GD model is built to solve SADP. Lastly, an operational framework is developed to guide prospective users in tuning and operating the SDSS for their specific context, problem, and objective. <br/><br/>The SDSS is tested on a toy problem, a 0.09km2 area in The Hague, The Netherlands. The toy problem is small in scale, easy and fast to implement and useful for initial testing of the model. Preliminary results have demonstrated the feasibility of the model. This is the first and humble attempt at developing an SDSS for enhancing equity of accessibility with a GD model. However, there are shortcomings in methodology and result quality, which compromise the practicality of the model and the interpretability of results. Although, only a proof of concept at the moment, the SDSS is a valuable starting point due to its advantages, such as transparency, modularity, humane-ness, and flexibility. This SDSS is built to involve decision-makers in the design process, which could serve as a useful learning experience for questioning and understanding what is the problem, what is considered equitable, and what are possible solutions. The SDSS has the potential to facilitate learning during transport decision-making in experimental settings or as explorative aids in early design stages.","Equity; Accessibility; Generative design; Spatial decision support system; Network design problem; Network optimization; Street allocation decision problem; Just city","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

The research combines a review of existing literature, a case study analysis of a selected semiconductor company, and a policy analysis of the EU’s CBAM to provide insights into the ability of the CBAM to promote the use of sustainable materials in the semiconductor industry. <br/>The literature review highlighted the significance of life cycle assessment (LCA) as a carbon accounting tool and its potential to assess the relevant embedded emissions for the CBAM. The review showed indeed that LCA could be useful to assess the first phases of the production of the raw materials. Additionally, the review showed that it is less useful as a decision-making tool due to the fact that decision-making regarding the CBAM requires the consideration of other parameters as well, not only the environmental ones. Additionally, the review revealed the novelty of the EU’s CBAM regarding the carbon accounting tools and the CBAM’s design. At the same time, it highlighted the relevance of this research project.<br/>The statistical sensitivity analysis (SSA) conducted as an element of the case study showed that there exists a significant variation in the total embedded emissions of the semiconductor machine depending on the kind of steel and aluminium used. This highlighted the opportunity for improvements in the embedded emissions caused by the semiconductor machines. The SSA is also used to evaluate the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of the implementation of green steel and aluminium in semiconductor machines. The CBA showed that a high reduction in embedded emissions is required to achieve a break-even level with the costs of sustainable steel and aluminium. However, this reduction also depends on the design and implementation of the CBAM. The stakeholder analysis highlighted the actors, transactions, frictions, and games caused by the implementation of the CBAM. A concluding policy analysis was conducted to present possible implementations of the CBAM. The analysis showed that under the current circumstances for the CBAM to be successful in promoting sustainable changes in the semiconductor machine, while considering the uncertainty in the carbon reporting process, an unrealistically<br/>high carbon price is needed to break even. The analysis, however, indicated a bright spot; if global electricity production becomes less carbonintensive, the CBAM may work very well in promoting sustainable materials. Thus, this thesis concludes that for this case study the EU’s CBAM is not effective in promoting sustainable adjustments in semiconductor machines. However, this conclusion is obtained for this specific case with its specific extreme policy scenarios. Therefore, further research could be conducted in assessing other policy scenarios or carbon accounting tools and test how they evaluate the CBAM on its potential to promote the use of sustainable materials in other industries as well.","Policy analysis; CBAM; statistical analysis; cost-benefit analysis; Stakeholder analysis; European Union; Sustainable procurement; LCA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

One of the problems that needs to be tackled within the agricultural sector is having the leaves of crops removed. <br/>Rijk Zwaan has created a new variety of broccoli and to make this commercially viable, a harvest machine is required. One of the aspects of this harvesting process is removing the leaves. This has to be achieved in one continuous session, with at least a ground speed of 1 km/h, while the broccoli's are still in the field. With a focus on the best performance for the least destructive working principle. After listing all the requirements, ideas are structured in a morphological overview. A weighted criteria table will be used to select three ideas, which will be made into prototypes.<br/>Results from the initial testing period will reveal the best concept, which will be optimised. This was the Metal Wire design, which exist of multiple stainless steel wires attached perpendicular to a rotating shaft. An important aspect that boosted the performance was the unravelled ends of these wires. These rotating shaft had the wires removing the leaves, while beating the leaves down from both sides. <br/>After optimization, the current prototype could ensure a 60% of the top section and 80% of the middle section with 20% of the broccoli’s destroyed. Which was not enough to satisfy the goal, however the promising results could be improved with an upgraded machine. A clear trade-off was found between the performance and destruction. Significant improvements in results could be achieved by incorporating additional features such as a funnel and designing a more robust structure with fewer obstructions, controllable ground/rotational speed, and better alignment with the beds.

The healthcare problems of the future ask for doctors who can deal with complex challenges, connect to their patients, support societal health, have skills for lifelong learning, and take care of themselves (Lemmens et al., 2019; Nooteboom et al., 2020; World Health Organization, 2022). Both international researchers and national institutions explain that supporting medical students in their process of Professional Identity Formation (PIF) prepares them for this future (Cruess et al., 2014; Jarvis-Selinger et al., 2012; van De Pol et al., 2020). PIF is a process of finding the right balance between the internalization of the values, norms and behaviours of the profession (professional side), and the development of a personal style and purpose (personal side). While the professional side is already part of many medical curricula, including the curriculum of University Medical Centre Utrecht (UMCU), attention to the personal side is lacking. Therefore, this project aims to support medical students in exploring their personal side of PIF. <br/> An iterative approach with extensive involvement of students, teachers, medical professionals and educational experts, has led to the creation of the educational module AIO (Arts In Ontwikkeling/Doctor In Development). AIO is divided into four phases: hook the students for PIF education, create a safe atmosphere to open up, allow students to explore themselves, and support them in evaluating what their self-insights mean for their role as residents/medical professionals. These phases form the basis of the three-year course and are repeated within the exploration phase as well. The exploration phase consists of seven cycles of start workshop – challenge – end workshop. In the start workshop students are hooked and explore together by sharing stories, a variety of challenges to choose from enables them to further reflect on themselves, the end workshop allows sharing of the insights and supports them in using the self-insights to formulate a concrete takeaway. Most workshops are facilitated by older students instead of teachers, since they create a safe atmosphere to open up and can provide practical tips based on their experiences. <br/> A pilot study showed that peer facilitators indeed play a key role in the education. Furthermore, the active and creative exercises were seen as extremely supportive in the exploration and sharing of experiences. Besides being desired by students, AIO addresses several requirements for medical education and is thereby viable for UMCU. The fact that AIO is a modular course, requires a limited amount of teachers, and has been designed for the organizational structure of UMCU makes it also feasible.<br/> Besides supporting UMCU in integrating PIF into their new curriculum, the research and design of this graduation project can be used as inspiration for other (inter)national medical universities. Future research could investigate the long-term effects of the design as PIF is a longitudinal process. Still, the pilot showed that the designed education already addresses unmet needs, supports the resilience of residents and allows students to discuss the challenges the future of healthcare brings.<br","Mental health; Medicine; Design; Co-creation; Education Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

However, depending on the perspective of the policymaker as well as the evaluator, successful policies outcomes may be different for varying stakeholders. This can then potentially lead to conflict during the decision-making process for future policies, on which metrics were deemed successful. Through case studies, in which the advocacy coalition framework will be applied, the role of CBAs and EIAs is explored on the decision-making process for public policy. How the procedural policy tools affected advocacy coalitions’ beliefs and strategies for/against policies is analysed. The ex-ante evaluations without legislative support for incorporation for policymaking seemed to have little effect on policy- or core belief-changes of stakeholders, even when confronted with negative outcomes. With enough opportunities created by coalitions to discredit outcomes not in line with their beliefs. Furthermore, the multi-level decision-making seems to be dominated by the national level government, who hold and maintain formal authority while preventing opportunities for intervention without legislative support. Instead, procedural policy tools that have more legislative support, have more influence on the policy implementation and decision-making process. Procedural policy tools seem to be more informative and symbolic, with outcomes more used for debates without nuances rather than to explore and improve new policy options. Hence, limiting the formal role of the policy tools to explore policy alternatives. The late timing of tools’ use in the decision-making process and exclusion of regional stakeholders in the appraisals exacerbated negative experiences for regional stakeholders. Leading to increased distrust between advocacy coalitions, preventing compromises from being found while creating more conflict among stakeholders. Furthermore, procedural policy tools were very resource dependent, limiting regional actors’ ability to perform analyses due to limited resources. Making them highly dependent national governments, fuelling the distrust and conflict based on the earlier mentioned exclusion and lacking transparency. Creating information (and resource) inequalities which can be exploited during the decision-making process. Suggestions for improvement and conflict reduction are the introduction of formal third-party supervisory committees for procedural policy tools and mandatory (regional) stakeholder-inclusion and methodology’ transparency measures.","Cost-Benefit Analysis; Environmental Impact Assessment; decision-making process; Policy adoption; Advocacy coalitions; infrastructure; Netherlands; Policy conflict","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Haex, Thomas (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Offshore wind turbines have seen a significant increase in size over the past decades. A critical consequence of this increase in size is a substantial increase in the torque transferred from the wind turbine rotor. This leads to the necessity of larger and heavier drivetrains to adhere to structural failure requirements and subsequently to larger and heavier tower and support structures increasing the total mass and cost of the turbine. Hence, reducing the mass-to-torque ratio of the drivetrain has become a key design challenge. <br/><br/>The company Delft Offshore Turbines (DOT) proposes to replace the conventional drivetrain in the top of the turbine with a hydraulic drivetrain, which has a lower mass-to-torque ratio. Although this concept shows promise, finding a low mass design that fulfils the infinite fatigue life requirement can be challenging. Using topology optimization to minimize mass while constraining the structural requirements could, therefore, be instrumental in the realization of this concept.<br/><br/>The design case by DOT can be classified as rotating machinery. In general rotating machinery is<br/>commonly subjected to periodic loading that varies non-proportionally in time. This results in fluctuating stresses causing material fatigue. A consequence of the non-proportionality of loading is that the time response needs to be computed to evaluate for fatigue, which adds additional computation cost. However, another common aspect found in rotating machinery is that parts are cyclic symmetric, which allows for a potential reduction in computation cost. <br/><br/>In this thesis a method is presented to implement infinite fatigue life constraints into density based topology optimization for structures subjected to non-proportional loading, while cyclic symmetric properties are exploited to reduce computation cost. It was found that when the load case on a cyclic symmetric part adheres to certain conditions, a single static FE-analysis can provide multiple time steps for a quasi-static analysis. Decreasing the computational burden roughly proportional to the unique number of time steps obtained. The largest local variations in stress are estimated using a smooth min/max function and aggregated into a global constraint.<br/><br/>The method was tested on several numerical problems as well as applied to the DOT design case. The results showed that the method was able to properly constrain a global fatigue constraint while minimizing mass, achieving final designs that might not be trivial to find by hand.<br","Topology optimization; Cyclic symmetry; Fatigue; Non-proportional loading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-03-30","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Precision and Microsystems Engineering","",""

In comparison to other parts of Kenya and the rest of the globe, it is a remote and rural area where residents do not have the same access to contemporary educational materials. The Kenya Red Cross Society’s IOMe005 Innovation Hub attempts to combat these disparities by providing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) toolkits to the Lamu children. Generally speaking, STEM fields are frequently associated with stigmas and preconceptions that steer girls away from these disciplines. This phenomena also exists in Lamu, which may make it difficult for girls to respond to STEM toolkits provided in schools.<br/><br/>The design goal of this project was therefore defined to design a serious board game which sparks the interest of the young girls of Lamu and help them feel confident when engaging in STEM education. The intervention should create positive interactions on which girls can fall back when facing stereotypes or other alike incidents. <br/><br/>The report first presents the IOMe as the client of this project and Lamu as the area of study. The assignment of developing both the game and the method to design this game is then clarified, along with the approach adopted to carry out this project.<br/><br/>The information needed to comprehend the design choices is provided by a review of the pertinent literature combined with observations and insights gathered from the research and design activities during the field trip. These insights concern the context of Lamu, the current situation regarding STEM education, the potential of playful learning, and especially serious games, for the solution space and finally existing methods for designing games. <br/><br/>These methods inspired the development of a canvas which consists of two tools that guide the designers at the IOMe in generating concepts for serious games and evaluating them, respectively. This canvas is regarded as the method which supported the elaboration of the final game concept for this project. <br/><br/>The findings of the field research also allowed to understand the needs and wishes of the end-users of the game, depict the current interactions they have with STEM and illustrate the desired situation to be achieved by this design intervention. Besides, they indicated the important requirements to be met by the final design. <br/><br/>Next, the chosen concept for this project is then revealed. It is a board game which mirrors the environment of Lamu. Players start “at home” and must arrive “at school”, by moving their pawn on a path on the board, but encounter challenges on their way. These challenges are embedded in cards with questions that the players must answer to win points. The game encourages the girls to observe their surroundings critically and from a scientific point of view. <br/><br/>A final prototype was tested with ten girls at a school of Lamu. The insights collected from the test enabled to make a preliminary evaluation of how well the final design performs with regards to the specified requirements. Furthermore, the design iterations which led to developing this final prototype are introduced.<br/><br/>To conclude, the outcomes of this project have shown that CHANUA is well designed to not only meet the end user’s needs but also contribute to amplifying the client’s exposure to the community and empower secondary stakeholders. The game fits well in the context as it brings innovation with a new energy to a low-resource setting. Besides, the canvas serves as the first example of brainstorming tool specifically developed for the IOMe to keep on developing serious games. Finally, recommendations for future work, such as involving the outer social circles of the end users in such a project, are listed.","girls; female empowerment; STEM education; serious gaming; Kenya; game design; Research through Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","","-2.1920573240405927, 40.81787525561683"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","A significant part of composite concrete viaducts was built in the 50s and 60s. This has led to an increasing need for the reassessment of the precast concrete beam bridges in the Netherlands. Many of those bridges are nowadays subjected to higher traffic loads and consequently, have a certain risk of not complying with the currently used design codes. As a result, there is a demand for the development of nonlinear finite element solution strategies, which would increase the reliability of the numerical methods in safety assessment. In this research, special consideration is given to the precast, prestressed beam bridges which were made continuous by applying cast-in-situ cross beams and a top layer above the supports. In such structures, the hogging bending moment introduces more complex stress conditions in the concrete parts and more specific at the interface between precast girders and the top slab, compared to simply supported beam bridges. <br/>Thus, one of the key aspects of the structural performance of composite bridges is the interfacial behaviour. The focus of this research is to study the stress conditions in the vicinity and at the interface and explore methods of numerical modelling of the interface in concrete-to-concrete connections between precast beams and top layers to initiate the development of modelling strategies for this type of interfaces. <br/>The literature review was focused on prefabricated beam bridges, the current state of knowledge on concrete-to-concrete interfaces, along with design recommendations and past experimental and numerical research. Moreover, available interface element types, material models and modelling guidelines were explored. Since DIANA FEA is used within the course of this research, the study of the available models was limited to the ones provided by this software. It was noted that the Linear Elasticity model is the simplest way of interface modelling, therefore it was utilised in the initial stage of the research. More advanced models, Coulomb Friction and Combined Cracking-Shearing-Crushing, were considered worth investigating owing to accounting for coupling between normal and tangential behaviour. The Nonlinear Elasticity material model was also recognized due to the introduction of nonlinear effects, yet being relatively simple to assemble. <br/>The initial phase of the research was a linear, phased analysis of the continuous, composite, concrete girder. Three models were tested within this part of the research – the model without interface elements, and two with linear elastic interface elements, one having high, penalty stiffness and the other having lower, more realistic value of shear stiffness. It was verified that the models without and with penalty stiffness interface performed almost equally. The decrease in stiffness and the deterioration of the composite action caused by this, resulted in an increase of stresses in the precast element. By the support, the extreme tension raised by a factor of 1.21 and under the point of load application the compressive stresses in the beams’ web elevated by 2.26. Based on the linear analysis, no significant tensile stresses perpendicular to the interface were detected. According to the analysis of interfacial stresses interaction and assumed failure envelopes, at four chosen points - above the support, at midspan of the main span, at the local shear extreme and under the point of load application - it was observed that the point above the support is not at risk of failure, whereas the point in the midspan might be. It was concluded that the combination of stresses is relevant not only because of a possible decrease in capacity due to tension but also increase under compression. As a result, models accounting for coupling between normal and shear tractions and relative displacements are worth investigating. It was also observed, that cracking in concrete elements by the support is expected, hence nonlinear analysis is required. <br/>The component-level experiments found in the literature were analysed in the following section to be able to perform verification study of Coulomb Friction (CF) and Combined Cracking-Shearing-Crushing (CCSC) interface material models. Based on single element FE tests it was concluded that both material models proved to be well-suited for capturing the shear-normal stresses coupling. With the same input parameters, but higher normal pressure, the shear capacity increased, representing well the reference data. The CCSC interface material model’s ability to capture both cohesion and friction softening, was also verified with the single element models. Moreover, tension softening based on mode I fracture energy can be accounted for in that material model, as well as the fracture energy’s and dilatancy’s dependency on confining stress. However, those parameters were not verified, due to, among others, limited experimental data. Element assembly with the CCSC material model for the interface, circular beam bond-slip reinforcement and nonlinear material properties of concrete, was used to analyse the specimens with rebars crossing the interface. This approach, was assumed to represent the force transfer mechanisms to the highest extent, since cohesion and friction, generated by both external pressure and reinforcing bars, along with their softening, as well as dowel action, can theoretically be represented by such model. It was observed that this type of strategy resulted in convergence issues, and due to large number of input parameters it is quite complex to analyse or further calibrate. However, the approach seemed promising since the peak loads were underestimated by only 7-15% with respect to the mean, experimentally obtained values. <br/>In the final Chapter the Combined Cracking-Shearing-Crushing (CCSC) interface material model, with bond-slip beam reinforcements was applied in the nonlinear analysis of the previously analysed composite girder. As an alternative, the model with the Nonlinear Elasticity(NE) interface material model was also constructed, based on the analogous input parameters, to be able to compare the modelling methods. In total four models were analysed, since two sets of input, one based on Eurocode 2 and the other on best guess stemming from literature findings, were studied. What was found to be promising is that the global behaviour, assessed on the basis of crack patterns, of the beams with corresponding input, was quite similar for the analyses with the CCSC and the NE material models. With the applied numerical setup, it was not possible to obtain the total load-displacement path of the composite beams using the CCSC material model for the interface, since the models diverged. The NE material model performed more stable and allowed for the analyses to continue, which is its main advantage. Another benefit is the ease of assembly, in comparison with the CCSC model. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that the NE might provide overestimated results due to not considering the interaction of tractions. It was highlighted that the models’ validation with experiments is needed to recommend one of the models or either of the input sets. It was recommended to simplify the approach with the CCSC material model, by for instance, simplifying the numerical setup of interface reinforcement. Moreover, according to the literature findings the scatter of cohesion and friction coefficients, as well as other input parameters, is still quite large, thus experimental research in the form of push-off tests focused on those, particular interfaces is recommended.","Concrete-to-concrete Interface; Precast concrete; Concrete Bridge; Finite Element Analysis; NLFEA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-08","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

This methane peak has been investigated in a non-biological context before. This study applies exoplanet research strategies and knowledge about biological methane production on Earth to investigate the biological context. Bayes formula is the foundation of the Bayesian framework approach as proposed by Walker et al. [53]. This Bayesian framework allows for separate investigation of biotic and abiotic methane production pathways to assess the likelihood that one of these pathways is responsible for the methane observation. Before probability is investigated, the viability of biotic methane production is gauged by Thermodynamic calculations. These calculations use the Gibbs free energy and show methanogenesis and sulfate reduction as viable catabolic reactions under Martian temperature and chemical soil and atmosphere compositions. Mars analogue Experiments were conducted into the kinetics of methane and hydrogen sulfide gas production under the influence of Martian Regolith analogue and Martian atmospheric analogue. The seed organisms were gathered from the Belgian Boom clay layer in the HADES lab because the Boom clay layer has strong mineralogical similarities to the Martian regolith. The experiments show that both methane and hydrogen sulfide gas production is not significantly affected by the introduction of modified Phylosilicate Martian Regolith Analog (P-MRA) and Martian Atmosphere Analog (MAA). Comparison with the ADM1 kinetic model shows that only methane gas production is comparable within one standard deviation between all experiments and the model. Biomass growth and sulfur gas production are inconsistent between experiments and the kinetic model. To quantify the probability of biotic methane production, a modified ADM1 model was used for Monte Carlo (MC) analysis of the correlation between the Martian observed methane peak and the kinetic model output for varying initial chemical conditions and virtual reactor volumes. Based on this, 78% of the simulations showed a significant correlation. Using Bayes formula, the posterior probability of the methane peak being biological in origin is higher than the prior probability of an anaerobic community being active around the Gale crater. However, this misses the crucial information on the chance of this methane peak occurring in abiotic conditions.","Mars; Habitability; Bayesian framework; Astrobiology; kinetics; Methane; Anaerobic Digestion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

More recently they are also being considered for the manufacturing of marine propellers. Since they have the potential to lower the weight, lower the maintenance costs, increase the efficiency at off-design conditions, improve cavitation inception speed and minimize acoustic signatures. Exploiting the full potential of composite propellers however requires that they need to be cost-effective and to do so it is required that the lifetime of the blade is sufficient. To determine the lifetime of the blade it is<br/>crucial to determine how the composite blade will respond to a wide variety of environmental and loading conditions that it will experience over its life. Basically one needs to determine what effects fatigue will have on the material properties of the blade. The main objective of this thesis is to estimate the fatigue lifetime of composite marine propellers subjected to a pressure distribution determined by a Fluid-Structure Interaction<br/>(FSI)model with the use of a progressive damage model integrated into a Finite<br/>Element Model (FEM). The fluid structure interaction model to determine the pressure distribution has already been created Maljaars (2019). Currently the mostly used and most reliable approach is to use an experimental approach in order to estimate the fatigue life. However, for custom designs such as marine propellers this is a long and costly process. Modelling fatigue the fatigue performance in an earlier stage of the design cycle will result in significant cost and time savings.<br/><br/> The expected fatigue lifetime of the composite marine propeller is concluded to be at least 1012 cycles under the considered loading condition. If the propeller would rotate at 600 rpm for 24 hours per day this would translate to over 3000 years. The reason behind this large number is that the combination of the applied pressure load and the strength of the carbon fiber propeller is such that the stresses in each ply are very low. These low stresses create almost no damage throughout the propeller blade even for ultra high cycles.","Fatigue; Composites; propeller; Degradation; Lifetime estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

When the Pearson correlation coefficients are negative, a non-variable energy generation capacity can be found leading to less intermittency in energy stock. These results are expanded to evaluate other locations in Europe, identifying the main contributing factors of a successful hybrid set-up. The case study location was Marseille based on pre-analysis of solar and wind availability.<br/><br/>Using resource correlation, energy output, and location data, the model developed to assess the location feasibility of HPPs found that most areas are not suited for annual generation situations, but are more successful on a quarterly basis. The HPP setup would allow the dependency on fossil fuels and storage options to decrease while having a flexible implementation option meaning it is a viable option for off-grid / remote locations and urban areas to help lighten the grid load.<br/><br/>The model created can be further developed into an HPP site map, to help further identify areas that would benefit from more renewable options without as many drawbacks. Overall, this research leads to a method for reaching 2050 climate goals by identifying HPP potential on a variable time basis.","Airborne wind energy; Hybrid power plants; Solar PV; wind energy; resource correlation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(graduation committee); de Bruijn, Janno (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Regular maintenance of civil engineering structures is essential for their safety. Current maintenance regimes involve periodic inspections at regular time intervals. In the time between inspections, there can be a critical development in the structural integrity of a structure, which can be expensive to repair or could even lead to structural failure. A more robust maintenance approach would involve continuous monitoring of the structure. This is the research area of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). Vibration-based monitoring, which is a subset of SHM, aims to provide new cost-effective maintenance solutions that provide long-term life-safety benefits. Vibration-based monitoring uses vibration measurements from sensors to assess the ""Health"" of a structure. Damage in a structure will alter the structure's stiffness, mass and damping characteristics, which in turn will change the dynamic properties of the system. This change can then be discovered in the vibration data. The growth of the field is partly due to the significant advances in data-driven science and engineering in recent decades. <br/><br/>One of the issues in vibration-based monitoring is the presence of operational and environmental variability in the vibration data. With this variability present, it is challenging to determine from vibration data the characteristics of the underlying dynamic system. The aim of this thesis is to use Robust Principal Component Analysis (rPCA) to reduce or eliminate the operational variability from the traffic to allow for environmental and damage detection. rPCA is a matrix factorisation method that decomposes a data matrix into a low-rank matrix L and a sparse matrix S. The reconstructed low-rank matrix L contains the main correlations in the data that are robust to outliers and corrupt data that are contained in the sparse matrix S. By applying rPCA to the frequency representation of the vibration data, it is hoped that the underlying coherent structure corresponding to the dynamic system can be recovered.<br/><br/><br/>The vibration data used for this thesis is from two measurement campaigns conducted on the Haringvlietbrug. The Haringvlietbrug is a steel box girder bridge in the Netherlands, and there are several fatigue cracks present in the bridge. This presented an opportunity for damage detection. The goal of the first measurement campaign is to conduct damage detection and discover if there is a difference between vibration data from a damaged area with fatigue cracks and a ""healthy"" reference area. In the second measurement campaign, the goal was to extract the underlying dynamics of the structure at different temperatures and see if it was possible to distinguish between the different structural states at different temperatures. After applying the rPCA on the vibration data, (regular) principal component analysis (PCA) is used to embed the data into the low-rank subspace of the PCs to distinguish between the different structural states. <br/><br/>The rPCA was successful in extracting the coherent structures in the vibration data corresponding to the underlying dynamic properties of the system. In the subsequent PCA, vibration data with underlying different structural states had different scores in the first three PCs. In other words, it was possible to distinguish between the different structural states based on the first three PCs, which correspond to the main correlation within the data. For the first measurement campaign, this meant it was possible to distinguish between vibration data in the damaged area and the ""healthy"" reference area and detect ""damage"". However, there was a difference in the structural configuration between the two areas, so it was not possible to conclude that the differences in vibration data were due to damage caused by the fatigue cracks. In the second measurement campaign, the dynamic system properties at different temperatures were recovered. With the low-rank vibration data from the rPCA, it was possible to distinguish between vibration data with a 1°C difference in the first three PCs from the (regular) PCA. This was not possible without lowering the regularisation parameter in the rPCA. Another method, the Sparse Sensor Placement for Optimisation (SSPOC), was used to determine the locations in the frequency spectrum that contained the largest differences between structural states. For both the first and second measurement campaigns, these locations were at specific natural frequencies of the system. <br","Structural Health Monitoring; Vibration-based monitoring; Robust Principal Component Analysis; Sparse Sensor Placement Optimisation for Classification; Sparsity; Compressed sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

By dynamically scaling the different operators of the system, resource consumption can be minimised while meeting the system service-level objectives. In the literature, many different auto-scaling techniques are proposed that make scaling decisions based on the current state of the system. However, these techniques are poorly evaluated and are rarely compared with each other. This makes it difficult to determine the state-of-the-art for auto-scaling techniques targeting SPEs, which slows down its development. In this paper, we design and implement a modular framework to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art auto-scalers targeting SPEs. We implement state-of-the-art auto-scalers Dhalion, DS2, and Varga et al., using Kubernetes horizontal pod auto-scaler as baseline. We perform an end-to-end experimental evaluation of the auto-scalers and investigate their performance when run on different queries and workload patterns. Furthermore, we investigate the convergence time of the auto-scalers and evaluate their scaling accuracy. The results emphasise the difficulty of capturing the complex relationships of different operators and the struggle to balance resource efficiency and the performance of the system. Moreover, it shows the inherent weakness of reactive auto-scalers to react slowly to changing workloads and reveals the importance of considering the current health of the system when issuing scaling actions.","Auto-scaling; Distributed Stream Processing; Cloud Computing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the DC isolation of the capacitor, a feedback resistor is needed to set the virtual ground of ACCA’s amplifier. However, an external feedback resistor raises system noise and transforms the ACCA into a high-pass filter, impacting the audio bandwidth signal (20- 20kHz). A GΩ resistor can shift the cut-off frequency outside the audio bandwidth while reducing noise. Various high-resistance resistor structures have been applied in biomedical readout integrated circuits (ICs), such as sequence detection, ECG, and EEG signal readout. However, the achieved signal-to-noise ratio and total harmonic distortion (THD) are unsuitable for audio applications. This thesis discusses different methods of making high-resistance resistors, such as duty-cycled resistors, switchedcapacitor resistors, and pseudo resistors, exploring their possibility in audio applications. This work proposes an active current reducer structure with an equivalent resistance of 200GΩ (± 20%) and an output RMS noise of 2.1μV for ACCA.

To achieve autonomous operation, UUVs must have the ability to self-adapt in such cases. To effectively handle component failures and unexpected events, self-adaptation must be applied to both the architecture and task plan of the UUV. This allows the UUV to modify its architecture to accommodate component failures and adjust its task plan in response to unforeseen events that may render the current plan infeasible. The mutual dependencies between architectural adaptation and task planning pose a significant challenge when determining how to apply adaptation. As a result, the task planner must take into account the implications of architectural adaptation when generating a plan. This paper proposes Metaplan, a modular ROS2-based framework for applying architectural and task plan co-adaptation in a reusable way. Metaplan extends Metacontrol, an architectural self-adaptation framework, with a task planner based on Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). The effectiveness of Metaplan is demonstrated by evaluating it on SUAVE, an exemplar for evaluating self-adaptation frameworks for UUVs. Metaplan is shown to outperform a baseline which only makes use of a task planner. Architecture and task plan co-adaptation is demonstrated by presenting the UUV with a sudden drop in battery level, requiring the UUV to adapt both its architecture and its task plan. Furthermore, the reusability of Metaplan is showcased by applying it to a mobile manipulator scenario.","self-adaptation; knowledge representation and reasoning; autonomous underwater vehicle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Cognitive Robotics","",""

Energy harvesters have been a new avenue to generate electrical power locally for remote applications. An energy harvester is a device that taps into aeroelastic phenomena to convert vibrational energy into electrical energy. Additional benefits of harvesters include being lower in complexity, ease of maintenance, and the resulting cost-effectiveness. <br/><br/>The splitter plate represents a wake control device that alters the wake to make the energy capture more efficient and practical when attached to a cylinder. However, the flow mechanisms under different conditions have not been fully understood. The motivation of the present work is to bridge this gap by characterizing the mechanisms and wake dynamics of a cylinder with a flexible splitter plate. This will help advance the understanding of the wake behavior of these devices to make safe and efficient devices. To characterize the behavior of the wake, measurements are made at different flow speeds. A preliminary analysis of the splitter plate motion showed that increasing the Reynolds number produced four distinct regimes to be studied further: crossover, baseline, reduced amplitude, and chaotic regimes. The initial analysis also revealed a condition named burst, defined as a period of resonant, two-dimensional, high amplitude oscillations of the splitter plate. All regimes are compared to a bare cylinder with no splitter plate to ascertain differences in wake behavior. <br/><br/>The use Helium Filled Soap Bubbles (HFSB) in flow diagnostic tools such as Particle Image Velocity (PIV) experiments has permitted large-scale measurements. A Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) experiment was performed in which the HFSB is tracked individually with the help of an algorithm. The present study employs Shake-The-Box (STB), a novel LPT tracking algorithm that uses time-resolved experimental data to predict future tracer particle locations. The benefit of such an algorithm includes reduced ghost particle detection and computational efficiency. The details of this experimental method have been covered extensively in this thesis. The raw experimental data was processed to perform statistical analysis, proper orthogonal decomposition, and spectral analysis to provide insights to meet the thesis objective.","Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV); Shake-The-Box (STB); Wake Dynamics; Flexible Splitter Plate; Proper Orthogonal Decomposition; Statistical Analysis; Power Spectral Density; Experimental Aeroelasticity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Pre-treatment is done to fragment lignin and hydrolyse the hemicellulose and cellulose fractions into simple sugars which is then converted into bioplastics. The pre-treatment generates a mix of sugar solutions, lignin breakdown products and inorganic ions. However, the inorganic ions act an inhibitor for fermentation and needs to be removed. Electrodialysis is investigated as an alternative process to ion-exchange to desalt the sugar solutions for downstream processes. While the sugars are neutral compounds, the other organics are negatively charged and can cause fouling on the positively charged anion-exchange membrane. <br/><br/>The process waters are C5C6 and C5 sugar streams and the main ions present are sodium and sulphate. A desalting target of 60% is set for these two ions and the experiments are done using a lab-scale electrodialysis set-up. Tests are run to check the desalting rate, effect of filtration, powdered activated carbon (PAC) and acidification, persistence of fouling and the effect of cleaning-in-place. The increase in average resistance and run time is used as an indicator of membrane fouling.<br/><br/>The raw C5C6 sugar solution could not reach the desalting target but once the solution is filtered, a desalting of 75.5% (Na+) and 66.5% (SO42-) is achieved. The average resistance also drops significantly. The fouling is removed by a CIP and is deemed to be ‘reversible’ in nature. On the other hand, the C5 sugar solution did not improve in performance after filtration. Although the desalting target could be achieved after filtration, the average resistance rose to 130 ohms. A CIP did not have any effect and increased run-time and drop in desalting efficiency was observed. The main reason for fouling in both cases is attributed to the presence of lignin degradation compounds. Lignin is more concentrated in the C5 sugar as compared to the C5C6 sugar solution due to its production process. In C5 sugar, the irreversible fouling pattern is hypothesized to be due to adsorption whereas in case of C5C6 sugar the reversible fouling pattern is cake fouling. PAC was dosed to remove the organic foulants in C5 sugar and improved the average resistance to 48 ohms and significantly reduced the run time. Desalting of 61.4% (Na+) and 87.2% (SO42-) was reached. Acidification protonated the feed and reduced the charged interactions, thereby both reducing run time and the average resistance. Desalting of 65.79% (Na+) and 68.02% (SO42-) was reached after acidification.<br/><br/>To conclude, the studied ED system could desalt the organic C5C6 and C5 sugar streams after a treatment step. Lignin degradation products were found to heavily foul the AEM membranes as its increased presence in C5 sugar stream led to a more severe fouling which could not be restored even with a chemical CIP. However, mitigation of the degradation products in the pre-treatment step could ensure that the solution was desalted by the ED unit. Thus, quantifying the composition of organic streams is imperative to predict the propensity of fouling in an ED unit.<br","organic fouling; Electrodialysis; Desalination","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-03-28","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

To provide better management of PICS, early recognition and intervention are required. Two LUMC intensivists are exploring methods to increase ICU involvement in follow-up care for ICU patients, and thereby improve outcome related to PICS. Home monitoring may provide a method feasible for the ICU. To better assess feasibility, a pilot study, called ""The ICU-Recover Box"", was conducted. Additionally, since patients admitted to the ICU vary widely, it is essential to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from increased ICU involvement in follow-up care. An attempt was made to determine whether measurements recorded during ICU admission contain valuable information to predict ICU mortality. When this data contains valuable information, it may also be used to predict which patients should receive the ICU-Recover Box.<br/><br/>Fifteen patients who were admitted to the ICU received a weight scale, blood pressure monitor and smartwatch at hospital discharge.

This approach not only offers alternate minima for assessing design feasibility but also highlights the importance of having a universally applicable method for existing optimization schemes. <br/><br/>The methodology herein proposed establishes a gradient-based optimization framework that is used to develop and test the developed deflation constraint. The novel deflation constraint can be integrated into any optimization method supporting constrained optimization, either gradient-based or heuristics-based. The developed deflation method is tested on various case studies related to composite structure optimization, showcasing its promising applications in the aerospace industry and beyond.","optimization; Deflation; composites; composite structure; structural optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-15","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Structures and Materials","",""

(mentor); Rozendaal, M.C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","This thesis investigates the behavior of an elastomer spherical structure compressed by a small object compared to the cross-section of the structure. The study is based on the situation in which a child catches a ball multiple times with two hands. This was simplified to a situation where a hemisphere was cyclically compressed by a small object. The elastomer chosen was the cured resin Elastic 50A, which is manufactured by Formlabs. Stereo lithography was used to print the investigated structures. Layer-by-layer printing introduced the ability to print the same structure with different layering. Elastomers and rubbers cannot be described by a linear material model. Therefore, the non-linear behavior of the elastomer was obtained experimentally. Material behavior was described by performing a uni-axial tensile test with dumbbell specimens printed in three different directions according to ASTM D412. The dumbbell specimens were printed in the x-, y- and z-directions, representing upright, lateral and supine positions. A comparison between the specimen force-deflection responses and the finite-element analysis(FEA) responses showed that different models performed best for different print directions. Ansys Mechanical was used to calibrate the hyper-elastic material models available to describe a material with a single uni-axial test. The curve fitting tool of Ansys was used to acquire the Arruda-Boyce, Gent and Yeoh model constants. The 2nd-order Yeoh model performed best for the x-direction printed specimen. The 1st-order Yeoh model performed best for the y- and z-direction printed specimen. These models were used in the finite-element analysis on the elastomer hemispheres. The hemispheres were printed in the y- and z- direction, representing the upright and lateral positions. The experimentally obtained peak forces for the z-direction printed hemisphere were 19.61 and 17.76 N for the velocities of 50 and 500mm/min, respectively. The peak forces for the y-direction printed hemisphere were 19.40 and 17.51 N for the velocities of 50 and 500mm/min, respectively. The prediction of the finite- element analysis showed a higher peak force at 50mm/min of 33.78, 29 and 36.27 N for the x-, y- and z-direction models used, respectively. The prediction of the finite-element analysis showed a higher peak force at 500 mm/min of 33.62, 28.91 and 36.1 N for the x-, y- and z-direction models used, respectively. The hysteresis found during the compression test did not match the hysteresis found in the FEA. The experimentally obtained hysteresis was larger than the hysteresis predicted by finite-element analysis. Both hemispheres were able to support the loads without damage for ten cycles.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Hall spars, a leading innovator in the composite mast-building industry with a long history of successful projects, provided a challenge which is the inspiration of this thesis. This thesis aims to contribute to the challenge: Joining techniques for the internal bonding of carbon fibre-reinforced polymer components into carbon fibre-reinforced polymer structures. ”Internal bonding” can also be called ”bonding.<br/><br/>Currently, the epoxy adhesive film is used for these types of joints. Adhesive co-bonding raises challenges due to the limited access to the mast. Challenges concerning surface preparation, low mechanical strength, reliability and labour intensity. Other techniques will be reviewed for the internally bonding limited access hollow tubes. The aim is that no new tooling is required, and the currently used materials and process parameters can be used. The thermoset resin used is an epoxy carbon fibre prepreg.<br/><br/>According to the literature study, potential joining techniques for this application are joining with partially cured thermosets and joining with fusion welding of thermoset composites. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements are performed to analyse the thermoset resin. Material characterisation is required to apply the joining methods with the currently used material and process parameters of Hall Spars. Process parameters for the curing model, and glass transition temperature model are derived. Using this material model allows creating the insight that partial cured joining with the thermoset resin of Hall Spars is not feasible. The structural integrity of the joined parts can not be guaranteed in the curing cycle.<br/><br/>Polyetherimide is used as thermoplastic material to apply the fusion welding technique on the thermoset. This thermoplastic film is co-cured with the thermoset and used as a coupling layer to join the two thermoset parts. Performing an interphase analysis with the scanning electron microscope indicates interphase formation at the PEI/epoxy interface. The higher the isothermal curing temperature, the thicker this interphase. Gelation causes the interphase formation to slow down. The interphase formation at the interface is not been observed as expected based on the literature review. This required a test if the interphase formation would have occurred at a smaller scale than the scanning electron microscopy could observe. This can be achieved by performing single-lap shear experiments. These joints are processed according to Hall Spars process parameters. Joints created with the fusion coupling technique with the PEI film show promising results. However, due to high void content, a lower ultimate lap shear strength is observed. Therefore it is advised to investigate a curing cycle with a second dwell phase. This changes the viscosity profile of the resin. Therefore allows the trapped air at the PEI/epoxy interface to leave the joint. This could potentially lead to more reliable joints.","composite joining; Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic; cure kinetics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

In the North Sea, one of the most important biogenic reef builders and ecosystem engineers is the European Flat Oyster. However, due to harmful fishing practices, habitat destruction and diseases, this once-abundant bivalve is now ecologically extinct and cannot provide crucial ecosystem services. If left without active intervention, oyster reefs have too few chances of regeneration, due to the current state of the seafloor in the North Sea and too few individuals in the environment. Therefore, active intervention is needed to bring back the shellfish reefs in The North Sea. Offshore windmill farms provide a refuge for marine ecosystems from fishing activities, which poses an important opportunity for biogenic reef restoration practices. <br/><br/>To understand the context of biogenic reef restoration better, multiple interviews with marine biology and ecology experts from ARK were conducted followed by a literature review and two field trips related to young oyster deployment to The North Sea. The gained insights were used to create a list of 12 design criteria grouped into four categories: Oyster survival, Scalability, Broader ecological success, Handling &amp; deployment. According to these criteria, most of the current practices underperform in scalability due to high manufacturing, and operational costs, or provide inefficient oyster protection which hampers the success of shellfish reef restorations. Therefore, the design challenge to improve scalability and oyster protection has been chosen as the priority.<br/><br/>Multiple design directions and ideas have been explored using Research by Design approach while employing Whole System Mapping and Biomimicry methods with Low- and high-fidelity prototypes. Using an iterative approach and evaluating the design ideas, the solution space has been narrowed down to a final design, the unit: two steel frame gabions are connected in a double-diamond position and placed between two display pallets with all assembly tightly secured with a cotton lashing. Multiple assemblies are connected in a row with a leading rope attached to an anchor. When the ship sails, the anchor is thrown out on the seafloor and eventually pulls all units down to the seafloor. The final design was evaluated according to the same 12 criteria. In comparison to previously discussed solutions, the final design is more scalable in terms of costs and time for larger marine restoration areas and focuses on finding balance throughout the design criteria instead of being only effective in certain aspects. In addition to introducing back the Flat Oysters, the new structures provide various microhabitats for a wide array of other benthic species to grow or shelter from the water currents, amplifying positive effects on the marine ecosystem. Several theoretical and structural integrity tests have been done to determine the effectiveness of the new design. Further research, such as offshore field studies, is needed to determine how this new design affects young oyster survival and other benthic species.<br","Design for biodiversity; Nature restoration; Shellfish reefs; Marine Biodiversity; Biogenic reefs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

One of the causes of such a deformity is an imbalance in muscle forces around the foot. In turn, the bony deformity can also alter muscle function, due to, for example, altered muscle moment arm lengths. In this study, the altered muscle function due to hindfoot varus deformities in children with CP was investigated using musculoskeletal models. The first aim of this study was to create personalized musculoskeletal models of the foot based on weight-bearing computed tomography (WBCT) data. Secondly, we applied the model to get insight in how joint axis orientations and muscle moment arms are altered in varus feet, and how this leads to differences in muscle function during gait.<br/>Models were created in OpenSim for seven children with a hindfoot varus deformity due to CP, and four adults with neutral feet. Each model was based on WBCT scans and included five degrees of freedom in the foot (talocrural, subtalar, Chopart, Lisfranc and metatarsophalangeal joints). The orientations of the foot joint axes and moment arms of the extrinsic foot muscles were calculated. Subsequently, the models were combined with motion capture and ground reaction force data to calculate muscle activations during gait.<br/>The joint axis orientations showed greater variability in the group of children with CP compared to the control group; in most subjects, changes in axis orientation were observed that may lead to a more rigid foot. Furthermore, the dorsiflexion moment arm of the tibialis anterior decreased, while the inversion moment arm increased; thus, the tibialis anterior became an even more effective invertor when a varus deformity of the foot was present. On the other hand, the eversion moment arms of the peroneal muscles tended to become smaller, meaning they would be less effective in resisting the varus deformity. Static Optimization results showed decreased activity in the tibialis muscles, and increased activity in the peroneal muscles. This increased activity might be necessary due to the smaller moment arms, and/or to stabilize the ankle.<br/>This is the first study in which a musculoskeletal foot model was developed based on personalized bone data of feet with bony deformities in weight-bearing conditions. Distinct changes were shown in muscle function when a varus deformity is present, which might lead to progression of the deformity. This contributes to a better understanding of the altered muscle function due to foot deformities, which may eventually contribute to improvement of treatment to prevent the progression of foot deformities.","Musculoskeletal model; Cerebral Palsy; Foot","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Consequently, the wake generated by the upstream turbines introduces interactions with downstream turbines that significantly affect power generation. However, it is common practice to control the individual turbines to operate at their optimal settings and neglect the wake effect. Turbines in a wake experience lower wind speeds and an increase in turbulence. This results in lower power generation and increased fatigue loads on the downstream turbine. Wind farm control aims to increase overall power generation and reduce fatigue loads by considering all turbines in the wind farm. <br/>Recently, numerous studies have been conducted to control the wake itself. The helix approach is one such strategy and seeks to initiate better mixing of the wake. For this, it uses IPC to create sinusoidal blade bending moments acting on the rotor disc. This in turn creates a helical structure in the velocity of the wind, allowing it to better mix with the surrounding energy-rich wind. As a result, the waked downstream turbine experiences an increase in power due to the reduced velocity deficit in the wake. An extensive load analysis of the helix method has shown that the rotational frequency of this helical wake can be measured in the bending moments of the waked downstream turbine. To further develop the field of dynamic wake mixing, this work investigated the initialization of the helix method in a downstream turbine by amplifying these signals through synchronization with the incoming helical wake. <br/>This method was tested in simulation environments with increasing levels of fidelity and number of turbines simulated. The results with low fidelity showed that synchronization could be achieved without loss of performance. In addition, less pitch actuation was required to generate large bending moments due to amplification. The final experiment was conducted for a three-turbine setup and was performed in a high-fidelity model using CFD methods. Here it was found that -90 degrees out-of-phase synchronization with the incoming helical wake resulted in a 9.8% increase in power generation in a turbine further downstream. These results demonstrate the clear potential of wake synchronization in a multi-turbine setting. This study, therefore, contributes to the field of dynamic wake mixing by introducing a novel field of wake synchronization.<br","Wind Energy; Wind Farm Control; Wake Mixing; The Helix Approach; Wake Synchronization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-03-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

To enable robots to understand the requirements of a task and the properties of an object, a novel grasp framework, called the Shape Primitive and Reasoning Grasping Engine (SPaRGE), is proposed in this thesis. SPaRGE combines a data-driven approach, a superquadric algorithm, and a logic-based approach to find task-specific object grasp poses from a partial point cloud. Multiple grasp poses are recovered using the data-driven approach, while objects are represented as multiple primitive shapes using the superquadric algorithm and logic-based approach. Logic rules are used to decide which primitive shape meets the criteria of a given task, resulting in a primitive shape indicating a grasp region. The data-driven approach then finds a grasp pose that meets the task requirements. Two versions of the logic-based approach are presented, differing in their design choices that affect the generalizability and scalability of the logic rules. The SPaRGE framework is evaluated on common household and retail store objects, demonstrating an average true positive rate of 81.2% and 86.0%, respectively, in enabling a robot to grasp objects at a desired region. Results show that the SPaRGE framework enables real-time object grasping without prior knowledge of the objects. Further experiments show that the SPaRGE framework can be adapted successfully for real-world object grasping scenarios. The proposed framework provides a significant contribution toward enabling robots to perform human-like grasping in real-world environments.","Symbolic reasoning; Object grasping; Affordances; Robotics; Manipulation; Primitive shapes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Cognitive Robotics","",""

In most cases, the cast becomes too loose as soft tissue swelling decreases over time and the cast no longer provides sufficient support to keep the fracture reduced. This issue could be addressed by introducing a smart memory cast, a cast that would employ soft polymer foam to relieve stress concentration while providing the required support stiffness to maintain the reduction throughout the whole cast treatment period. Soft polymer foams are characterised by a plateau phase in which the pressure does not increase as the material is compressed. The concept is tested by placing a soft polyurethane foam between an artificial arm that mimics soft tissue swelling and a synthetic cast. The pressure in the smart memory cast is measured by thin film pressure sensors. The average pressure in the smart memory cast was 15.4 mmHg and was reduced by 47.8% compared to the average pressure measured, 29.5 mmHg, in a traditional cast. The pressure in the smart memory cast remained under 25.0 mmHg which was set as a threshold value that could lead to a compartment syndrome. In contrast with the traditional cast where the pressure kept increasing above the threshold value as the artificial arm kept swelling, in the smart memory cast the pressure plateaued. The results from this study show that by introducing a filler material with non-linear elastic properties in a synthetic cast, the pressure concentration is reduced compared to a traditional cast and the pressure plateaus as soft tissue swelling increases.","cast treatment; distal radius fracture; forearm fracture; smart memory cast","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-03-24","","","","BioMedical Engineering","",""

To diagnose and treat CVDs, clinicians and cardiologists use multiple noninvasive imaging techniques. These scans are used to segment certain structures of the heart. Deep learning-based cardiac segmentation on short-axis cardiac magnetic resonance images (CMRI) has gained popularity over the past few years because of its generalisability and accuracy. This has exponentially reduced contouring times for clinicians. The development of such deep learning techniques has seen a common trend. In order to accommodate learning for larger cardiac datasets, the depth and size of segmentation networks have been increased. Unfortunately, the environmental impact of exploding such networks is not taken into account. One solution to mitigate having computationally expensive networks is to incorporate anatomical knowledge in the form of shape priors. The Gridnet and UNet with a shape prior are computationally efficient networks that are used to evaluate segmentation performance on a large and varied cardiac dataset (Combination of the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge - ACDC and Multi-Centre, Multi-Vendor and Multi-Disease Cardiac Segmentation challenge - M&amp;M datasets). On average, these networks segment CMRIs with an average dice score of 0.87 and a Hausdorff distance of 11.7mm. In parallel, one of the major issues in cardiac technology is the under-representation of women in cardiac datasets. Purposefully curated cardiac datasets such as ACDC and M&amp;M try and maintain equal representation. In real-world scenarios, this might not always be the case. Clinical trials to collect such data often report female representation as low as 25%. Evaluation of segmentation performance between a balanced and skewed dataset is conducted. This is to address if bias in such cardiac training datasets affects the performance of segmentation networks between male and female test patients.<br/><br","Cardiac bi-ventricle segmentation; Shape prior; Gridnet; UNet; Cardiac MRI; Computer vision","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The design allows for products to be shipped directly or to be consolidated and sorted at a depot. To assess the benefits of optimising both the forward and returning flows simultaneously in terms of network costs, the paper formulates an arc-based model and applies it to a real-life case. The results indicate that the network costs can be reduced by optimising simultaneously, as depots are built in the optimal locations and with the right capacity. This contrasts with the sequential method, which does not account for the return flows and can lead to suboptimal depot placement.","Service network design; Network optimisation; Forward and returning flows; Cost minimization; Time-space networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Of particular importance are the data storage systems, providing the means of storing and retrieving the vast amounts of data. One widely adopted storage technology, predicted to become the leading media for future data storage, is flash-based solid state drives (SSD). The complex architecture of flash SSD however introduces several challenges, such as necessary garbage collection, for managing the flash storage. To readily integrate flash SSD into storage systems, the flash management idiosyncrasies are hidden inside the storage device. The hiding of the flash management idiosyncrasies has however been identified to have significant performance implications. As a result, numerous efforts have pushed towards more open flash storage interfaces, with the most recent addition of Zoned Namespace (ZNS) flash SSD. ZNS SSD presents a unique opportunity for storage software and the flash SSD to coordinate the flash management responsibilities.<br/><br/>While the open flash storage interface of ZNS presents a plethora of opportunity in software optimization, current software support is in its early stages, leaving much of its potentials yet to be explored. In this work, we present msF2FS (multi-streamed F2FS), a file system with optimized ZNS integration, based on the de facto standard flash file system F2FS. msF2FS enhances the ZNS integration by leveraging the parallelism capabilities of ZNS SSD, and increasing the coordination between the file system and applications for data placement decision-making. The data placement coordination between file system and application reduces the sub-optimal data placement decisions made by the file system. Evaluations of msF2Fs show the benefit of the application and file system coordination, with the RocksDB application achieving up to 23.19% higher throughput as a result of optimized data placement.

(mentor); Goss, H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","With more than half of all food waste taking place at home, a transition in our consumer behaviour is needed if we want a future with less waste. While supermarkets and food producers have strong incentives and have the tools to reduce waste on their side, consumers seem to be less concerned about wasting food. However, they are also caught in a complex web of conflicting goals and desires that stand in the way of behaviour change. Food waste is a result of avoiding time and effort, being unaware of its consequences, and experiencing a moral obligation to be a 'good provider'. This desire to provide our partners, families or guests with good and enough food suppresses our moral intentions to reduce waste. Changing behaviour requires confidence in the ability to do so. For family providers, this means feeling confident in being a good provider, and in their ability to minimise overprovisioning. To bridge this vision and the design phase, an interaction vision was developed, stating that interacting with the design should feel like a safety net, discovering new things, and learning by doing. This translates into a design that is reliable, spontaneous, and intuitive. Building on the findings from literature, interviews, and other exploration methods, several design iterations were made based on the following principles: to facilitate creative meal planning and the use of leftovers, to elicit our aversion to wasting money, to provide space to express identity, and finally to align being a good provider with buying enough. The final design is a service in the online grocery store that enables family providers to put meals on the table that deliver the right amount of food without compromising their desire to provide well. It involves creating personalised meal plans tailored to the preferences of the family members, as well as suggestions for substituting larger products for smaller ones. The qualitative test suggests that the intervention can successfully help providers to buy less and achieve behaviour change in the long term, mainly by reconsidering the items in their shopping basket. Through this design, this project explored a sub-solution to the systemic problem of food waste, specifically aimed at online grocery shoppers and their good provider identities.","Food waste; Sustainability; User Experience; Digital design; Overprovisioning; Grocery shopping; Online groceries; Consumer behaviour; Behaviour change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

A common cause of quadcopter crashes is collisions. To validate recovery control algorithms on collisions, the quadcopter has to reach the post-collision state. <br/>For this, the principle of 'endpoint control' is introduced, bringing the quadcopter to a specific state with a specified position, velocity, attitude, and angular velocity. A differential flatness-based endpoint control trajectory planner is presented that guarantees feasible trajectories. The planner is based upon a novel quaternion-based differential flatness transformation without singularities using quaternion multiplication. To guarantee feasible trajectories, an iterative method is proposed to limit the angular acceleration by adding acceleration constraints to the differential flat trajectory. The planner is able to optimize over multiple variables: minimizing velocity and snap. A method is proposed to combine these position derivatives in a cost function, creating a tunable trajectory planner. To test the trajectory planner a large number of endpoints are given to the algorithm. It is verified by looking at the feasibility of the trajectories generated and validated by determining what endpoints the trajectory planner can reach.","Differential flatness transformation; Endpoint control; Aerobatic flight; Quadcopter; Quadratic Programming; trajectory planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-03-23","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

So far, the existing literature has emphasized on the concept’s application within companies at a wide range of different sectors with the benefits being overwhelming for both reverse mentoring participants and the organization as a whole. However, they do not examine it within the project context. Not only does the present work, places reverse mentoring into that unexplored area, but focuses specifically on construction projects since their growing complexity and their entrance into the fourth industrial revolution, increase the need of project managers to shift their focus from the traditional project management tools and techniques that drive only productivity, towards new practices that target human development and team performance improvement. Therefore, the main goal of the current research is to explore the model’s applicability in construction projects and gain understanding of the possible model’s contribution to the team members’ and the team leaders’ development and the overall project team effectiveness.<br/><br/>A qualitative research approach with the use of fifteen semi-structured interviews with team leaders and team members of different construction project teams was adopted in order to achieve the target goal of this study. Some of the main results are related to the way the model can be implemented in practice, suggesting important decisions and actions that need to be taken during the whole reverse mentoring process. Moreover, it has been identified that the reverse mentoring concept can positively influence the nine out of fifteen, recognized by literature, elements of highly effective construction project teams. These positively influenced factors are; communication, decision making, conflict solving, team leadership, quality relationships, team composition, soft skills, goals &amp; objectives as well as mutual trust, commitment &amp; shared values.<br/><br/>The fact that the added value of reverse mentoring to the overall project team effectiveness based on the conducted interviews concerns the nine out of fifteen elements of highly effective construction project teams, leads us to our main conclusion that reverse mentoring may not make a huge difference in overall project team effectiveness, requiring each project team to implement the idea, but at least it has a positive effect on the majority of team effectiveness factors. Therefore, it may be up to each project team to decide which factors need improvement and thus determine whether or not a reverse mentoring practice should be adopted. However, our suggestion in order to experience the maximum benefits of the model is to somewhat formalize a process that takes into account the implementation suggestions presented in the current study.","Reverse Mentoring; Construction Projects; Team Effectiveness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The study addresses the relation between hydrodynamics and ecology, and evaluates different definitions of connectivity. Graph theory provides a novel and promising approach to assess connectivity in aquatic environments. With increasing availability of data, more accurate and informative analyses can be carried out, resulting in more effective designs of restoration measures. The application of graph theory in such research has, as one of its main strengths, its visual accessibility to laypersons or others without expertise in interpreting numerical model results. Furthermore, graph theory can offer both a holistic system view of a water network by evaluating the system as a whole, as well as a local view which is possible by looking at the single nodes and edges in the graph. This enables investigation of the role of individual channels within the system and the identification of vulnerable spots within the network, limiting the availability of aquatic habitat.<br/><br/>Graph theory is applied in various fields of research. As numerous metrics exist to examine the properties of a graph, an introduction to the most important metrics is given in this study. Adequacy of metrics is dependent on the questions posed and parameters relevant for the specific topic to be investigated. It is shown that in aquatic habitat connectivity, metrics such as betweenness centrality and bridges are indicative to obtain a general view of the network. When temporal variations play a role, as is the case in a tidal area, metrics as the number of components (NOC), the order of the largest component and the length of connected pathways (LOCOP) of the largest component are suitable to determine the connectivity. Whereas these metrics show useful in studying aquatic habitat connectivity, they may be less appropriate in connectivity studies of the same water system aiming at other fields of application, e.g. sediment connectivity.<br/><br/>Results show that graph theory provides a useful instrument in analyzing the aquatic habitat connectivity of the Sliedrechtse Biesbosch, which is investigated in a case study. The ease at which key nodes and edges are identified offer great possibilities for the design of nature restoration measures. In the present layout of the study area, large variation of aquatic habitat connectivity occurs based on a flow velocity fragmentation threshold of 0.3 m/s, corresponding to the maximum tolerable flow velocity for the European flounder (Platichthys flesus). Due to tidal influences in the study area, flow velocities vary continuously and the threshold flow velocity is exceeded during part of the tidal cycle. Considering the available habitat of other species gives different results depending on the tolerable flow velocities of the specific species. As is shown in this research, a combination of graph theory and numerical modelling enables the design and simulation of different nature restoration measures and system layouts to improve the aquatic habitat connectivity of the area.<br/><br/>The method presented in this research can be particularly useful to ecologists investigating suitable habitats for specific fish species. Also for engineers and others involved in the design of nature restoration measures, the method can be helpful since the designs of restoration measures can be evaluated considering the effect on habitat availability. The research provides an informed basis for subsequent applications of graph theory and numerical modelling to aquatic habitat connectivity. By selecting the most suitable design parameters and improvements of the network schematization, a justified decision can be made on the most effective restoration measures concerning the improvement of available habitat. Especially considering a combination of habitat preferences, such as flow velocity, water depth and turbidity, can provide proper insight in the aquatic habitat connectivity of an area for specific species.","Connectivity; Graph Theory; Delft3D-FM; Aquatic habitat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","51.81010266291687, 4.803475778378241"

The printed scaffolds retained their structural integrity for three days in AdvDMEM/F12 medium. The stiffness of the scaffolds was comparable to healthy liver tissue based on compression tests. The ICOs viability was assessed in the formulated bioink, and the composition of the bioink was adjusted to improve its cytocompatibility.

Handling and transportation can easily damage these components. Conventional handling methods with mechanical contact can cause various damages to these delicate surfaces. Air bearings can provide a solution by enabling an almost frictionless support between two moving surfaces. With air bearings, a pressurised layer of air is present that eliminates mechanical contact. Textures on an air bearing surface can enhance the load capacity and stiffness of the system. In this report, an unconventional manufacturing method for a large, textured air bearing surface is proposed, which is nanoimprinting. Nanoimprinting is a manufacturing technique to pattern micro- and nanoscale textures with UV-curable resin. These textures can enhance the load capacity and stiffness of an air bearing. With nanoimprinting, a master (mould) is required, and from this master, copies are made. By creating a grid of these copies, a cost-effective upscaling step can be carried out.

For the second demonstrator, an up-scaling step was carried out. Feature depths of 14 μm were realised with nanoimprinting, with a roughness between 1 and 2 μm.

This thesis aims to develop a generic and efficient solver for multivariate expectation problems, with a focus on its application in the field of quantitative finance, specifically for the quantification of Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR). <br/><br/>The proposed COS-CPD method utilizes the COS method to recover the exposure distribution by its Fourier-cosine series expansion, from which measures such as the PFE and EE can be obtained. The key insight is that the corresponding Fourier coefficients are readily available from the characteristic function, which can be solved using numerical integration methods. However, the efficiency of standard quadrature rules is limited to only a few risk factors, as the dimension of integration is determined by the number of risk factors involved.<br/><br/>To address this limitation, the COS-CPD method reduces the dimension of integration of the characteristic function through two steps. Firstly, the joint density function of the risk factors in the characteristic function is replaced by a dimension-reduced Fourier-cosine series expansion, which is obtained through CPD. With CPD, the computational complexity of computing the Fourier coefficient tensor is reduced to a linear growth with respect to the number of dimensions. Secondly, the portfolio is divided into segments that share the same risk factors. These two steps reduces the evaluation of the characteristic function to the calculation of only one- and two-dimensional integrals, which are solved by the Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rule. As a result, the COS-CPD method is suitable for portfolios with more than three risk factors.<br/><br/>Numerical comparisons of the COS-CPD method and Monte Carlo (MC) method are made for netting-set PFE and EE profiles of multiple derivative portfolios up to five risk factors. For similar accuracy levels, the COS-CPD method greatly outperforms the Monte Carlo method in computation time. This difference increases for larger portfolios, which makes the COS-CPD method a much more efficient alternative for the MC method, especially for large portfolios. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the COS-CPD method is applied in the context of multi-asset option pricing. A six-dimensional basket option is considered, and the results are compared to a recently developed sparse grid method. The comparison shows that the COS-CPD method outperforms the sparse grid method in both accuracy and computation time. Moreover, the COS-CPD method allows the computation of the option value for multiple strike prices simultaneously, with no significant additional computational cost.","Multivariate Expectations; COS method; Monte Carlo simulation; Fourier-cosine series expansion; Canonical Polyadic Decomposition; Counterparty Credit Risk; Potential Future Exposure; Expected Exposure; Multi-asset option pricing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

However, the use of Steel Fiber Reinforced Concrete is gaining popularity due to its beneficial mechanical properties, improved sustainability, improved durability, and lowered costs compared to traditional Reinforced Concrete (RC). The amount of reinforcing steel can be reduced significantly, lowering the costs and carbon footprint of a project making it an appealing alternative. One application of SFRC is found in tunnels making use of precasted concrete segments, typically built with a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM). This type of tunnel is found in Amsterdam, namely the<br/>Noord/Zuidlijn: a metro line linking the north and south of the city. This project is used as a reference to perform a feasibility study on the use of SFRC and investigate its benefits.<br/><br/>The research involves a structural analysis of an SFRC design considering the loads and boundary conditions of the original Noord/Zuidlijn. The loads occur at different phases in the realization of the tunnel: transient, construction, and service phase. These loads can lead to various failure mechanisms, with the primary concern being tensile splitting of the concrete. Each phase is defined by a dominant component that governs its behaviour. During the transient stage, involving demoulding, stacking, and handling of the segments, the bending stresses inside the segment need to be checked. During the construction stage, the ring joints of the segments presents a weakness and need to be checked for<br/>spalling and/or splitting of the concrete. During the service stage, the longitudinal joint needs to be checked for splitting of the concrete and the global cross sectional stresses of the lining need to be examined.<br/><br/>Numerical models are created to assess SFRC’s performance in the governing parts of the tunnel during the three phases, with the addition of identical RC models as a basis for comparison. The general bending and shear stresses, as well as localised splitting and spalling stresses, are investigated in both the Serviceability Limit State and Ultimate Limit State. The structural behaviour of SFRC corresponded with the characteristics found in literature, with a higher initial cracking load than RC and a more stable crack propagation due to its residual tensile strength. The peak strength of SFRC is found to be lower, but still passes all the checks. The results show that an SFRC design with the<br/>minimum fiber content of 30 kg/m3 is sufficient for the transient and construction phases, but 40 kg/m3 is needed for the service phase. The benefits of implementing SFRC in the Noord/Zuidlijn can be quantified in a steel reduction of 60%, which would mean a decrease in steel consumption of 3050<br/>tons. The CO2 emissions would decrease with 5500 tons, equivalent to the amount absorbed by 220.000 trees over the course of one year.<br/><br/>The concluding results can be used as guidance when opting for SFRC in a new bored tunnel project. The performed design checks show a governing load situation in both the construction phase and the service phase. The sufficiency of SFRC for the ring joint check during construction is governed by the<br/>splitting force between the loading shoes of the TBM. The magnitude of this splitting force depends on the size of the TBM, the characteristics of the soil, and the depth of the tunnel. A large diameter tunnel, high-friction soil, or deep tunnel will decrease the likelihood of a design with solely fibers. The same unfavorable conditions cause large internal bending moments which could pose problems for the longitudinal joint and global cross section check. A small diameter tunnel and a tunnel constructed in stiffer soil will increase the feasibility of a design making use of solely fibers","Steel Fiber Reinforced Concrete; Bored tunnel; Tunnel lining","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

This industry has to reduce the GHG emissions due to future possible restricting regulations on GHG emissions. The dredging industry is shifting towards more environmentally friendly fuels, but designing new vessels which can run on these fuels will be a time consuming transformation. Though, the demand of dredging activities is growing, think of construction of offshore wind farms and creating flood defences against sea level rise. To minimize the costs due to the high GHG footprint in the short term, Van Oord should be able to estimate the energy consumption (GHG emissions) based on different dredging strategies.<br/><br/>Van Oord uses a model to estimate energy consumption that accurately describes the majority of dredging projects, based on the power installed, dredging time, and a power coefficient term. This power coefficient term is based on empirical data and may result in a less accurate estimation of more complex (new) projects such as offshore wind farms and cable dredging, which are the new opportunities arising for dredging companies. To better estimate energy consumption during these complex dredging operations, a physics-based and semi-empirical method is developed that can more accurately estimate energy consumption based on certain dredging strategies. Previous research already looked at the sailing phases of the dredging cycle, therefore the main objective of this thesis is:<br/><br/>To quantify the energy consumption of different TSHD dredging strategies based on physics for the loading phase.<br/><br/>To achieve this research objective, first a literature study is conducted to list the different physics-based methods available to estimate the energy consumption. The energy consumption of a TSHD is divided into five main energy consumers (propulsion system, dredge pumps, jet pumps, bow thrusters and board net) in which the energy of the individual components is described by a power and a time term. The time component is represented by the duration of the loading cycle, which in this study is limited to the filling process of the hopper until overflow. The power term of the jet- and dredge pumps have been estimated by the (adjusted) in-house physics-based methods of Van Oord. The board net and the bow thrusters have been estimated by data analysis of a case study. The goal of this research is to develop a method to estimate the required propulsion power and a tool to bring all methods together to simulate the total energy consumption during the loading phase based on different dredging strategies.<br/><br/>A model is developed to estimate the required propulsion power during loading. The model development is divided into three phases; The first phase describes the development of a semi-empirical physics based model. In this, the various resistance forces acting on the vessel, suction pipe, and draghead are calculated based on stationary parameters such as vessel dimensions, and project parameters. The project parameters, including water depth, trailing speed, and visor angle, are extracted by filtering the actual data from the case study. In this way the estimation model is set equal to a reference case. Finally, the output of the estimation model is calibrated by comparison with the actual data of the case study. This calibration phase is an iterative process in which the accuracy of the model is described and increased. <br/><br/>The model shows that it is possible to calculate the required propulsion power based on operational parameters, such as trailing speed. Furthermore, the model provides insight into the amount of resistance on the three components (draghead, suction pipe and vessel). The power curve follows a quadratic pattern for increasing trailing speed, which appears to be a reasonable estimate. When comparing the model to the actual data it can be seen that the model underestimates at lower trailing speed and over estimates at higher trailing speed. By finding correlations between visor angle and trailing speed the model is calibrated and seems to better fit the dataset, however the slope of the curve still has a large deviation compared to the regression line based on the actual dataset. Therefore, the model needs to be further developed before it can be included as an addition to the existing models within Van Oord. The static friction term is not included, which could compensate the underestimation of the model and the high cutting forces are the potential reason for the overestimation at high Van Oord Marine Ingenuity iii Delft University of Technology trailing speed. For now, the current developed model falls within the reference dataset for the trailing speed between 1.6 [kn] and 1.9 [kn], thus making it a reasonable first estimate of the required propulsion power.<br/><br/>The OpenCLSim python package, which can be used to simulate discrete events, is used to simulate the dredging processes of the loading phase. A plugin for this python package is developed to calculate the total energy consumption during these processes. The propulsion model is integrated (with the set limitations) in this plugin together with the four other power estimation methods (dredge pumps, jet pumps, bow thrusters and board net). The simulation tool runs based on four input characteristics: vessel parameters (TSHD), site characteristics, dredging strategy, and data describing the bow thrusters and board net. The output of the simulation includes required power, duration, and consumed energy. Additionally, the simulation estimates the fuel usage,<br/>emissions, and project costs associated with energy consumption.<br/><br/>The main ability of the simulation tool is that it can visualize the energy consumption (and emissions) based on dredging strategies and location. This enables the prediction and potential reduction of emissions in sensitive areas, such as fine dust emissions near cities. By using this simulation tool, a dredging plan can be created based on dredging strategies (trailing speed) to reduce emissions in these sensitive areas. To better demonstrate the other capabilities of the developed plugin within the OpenCLSim Python package, the simulation tool is applied to an imaginary project called Barachi. This project has strict regulations that prohibit overflow and apply emission taxes. Two dredging strategies are compared based on the limitations of the developed propulsion model: trailing speeds of 1.6 [kn] and 1.9 [kn]. The results show that, first of all, the project duration will decrease with an increasing trail speed. Secondly, the increase in power has a greater effect on energy consumption than the decrease in project duration, meaning that energy consumption will increase. Since fuel use and corresponding emissions are linked to energy consumption, they will also increase. However, the cost analysis provides a different view. In this case, because the ship’s operating costs are governing, faster trailing is the most cost-efficient, even if an emission tax of 200 euros/ton CO2e is applied.<br/><br/>To conclude, by creating a model to estimate the propulsion power and by integrating this model in a simulation tool, it is possible to quantify the energy consumption of different TSHD dredging strategies based on physics for the loading phase. Subsequently, the simulation also provides insight into the fuel usage, carbon emissions, and costs of the project. Further development and validation of the propulsion model is needed to give a more accurate estimation of the required power. Firstly, the static friction component should be included in the estimation model which could potentially solve the underestimation at lower trailing speed. Secondly, a maximum trail speed limit should be set based on the available propulsion power with respect to the total power distribution of the vessel. This limit should be included in the simulation tool, since it is linked to the other power consumers and the operational parameters. Thirdly, the propulsion model can only be used in saturated sand projects. Other cutting models based on cutting of silt, clay and rock should be added in the propulsion model to be able to apply the model in these soil conditions. Finally, the use of the tool is limited to dredging projects where overflow is not allowed. The suction production and the settling process within the hopper should be added to expand the capabilities of the tool to projects where overflow is possible.<br","TSHD; Energy estimation; Propulsion power; Emissions; OpenCLSim","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The required parameters for this assessment are typically obtained from conventional laboratory tests. These conventional tests are not performed under conditions found in the field. For example, a dike section resembles to plane strain conditions. Limited research is available for laboratory test under plane strain conditions, especially for organic clays. The plane strain biaxial apparatus presented by Allersma (1993) is used to perform tests on organic clay. The apparatus has not been used for several decades and it is described how the machine is refurbished. Preliminary tests and further improvements lead to familiarization with the apparatus. After this stage, laboratory tests on organic clay are performed and presented. The soil sample is loaded, leading to stress and pore pressure measurement. The measurements from laboratory tests are presented in chronological order. Several test set ups, most notably varying in their method to control the drainage conditions and to measure the pore pressure, are used. Assessment of the standard of these results in terms of accuracy, reliability and reproductivity is given. A notable challenge arising in the tests, is the uncontrolled drainage boundaries at the boundary between soil sample and soil sample enclosure: the biaxial cell. Conclusions are drawn from individual tests and consequentially improvements are made on the test set up. The test is re-created and numerically analysed in finite element programmes PLAXIS2D and PLAXIS3D. The numerical analysis and laboratory are compared and help to understand and predict the stress conditions found during tests in the laboratory. Remaining challenges are discussed on technical specifications and laboratory test set up. Concluded is that tests with this biaxial apparatus do not lead to results of a sufficiently high standard for further soil testing.","plane strain soil testing; biaxial apparatus","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-21","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

It results in artefacts and reduces image quality which can lead to wrong patient outcomes. A patient moves due to the long scanning times, discomfort, and restlessness. Motion correction techniques are developed to prevent or compensate for the movements. Prospective motion correction is one of the available options. The motion is corrected after the image is made. Optical motion tracking systems can be used to track patient motion. To determine the pose of a patient, tracking markers are used. Research is done in in-bore and out-of-bore camera systems. Here one or more cameras are used to track markers on a subject. In in-bore systems, the camera is placed more closely to the marker, whereas in out-of-bore systems, the cameras experience less distortion from the MR. Other options for optical tracking systems are the use of lasers or optical fibres. Almost all studies use tracking markers, whereas some investigated markerless tracking. Most research was not suitable for clinical implementation. In research, less is known about the effect of marker design on the accuracy of a camera system.<br/>This thesis investigates how marker design can help improve motion detection systems, specifically Philips’s VitalEye camera. This is done by developing a model that represents the VitalEye camera using rigid transformations, a Pinhole camera model and an image formation model called rasterization. The pinhole camera model uses the properties of similar triangles to establish an image point. The focal length, the number of pixels, and the pixel width and height can transform the image points into digital images. A cost function and the Jacobian are established. Using the Newton-Raphson method, the transformation matrix can be determined. The complete VitalEye model is validated. The marker placement by the model and in the image were in good agreement, and the resulting transformation vectors had only minor errors. Eight different shapes are investigated with different sizes and orientations. <br/>It was found that accuracy increases with an increase in marker size and a decrease in distance. Additionally, two-dimensional (2D) shapes showed lower accuracy than prism shapes. The best 2D shape was the 100x100 [mm] square (median:upper adjacent:maximum, z: 0.45:1.65:2.60 [mm]; &#x1d6fc;:0.75:2.56:3.99 [∘]).

PostNL is one of the biggest delivery companies in the Netherlands and one of their departments takes care of XL parcel delivery. This department is called Extra@Home. XL parcels can be seen as non-regular parcels, meaning odd sizes or weights. For Extra@Home, the XL parcel delivery comes with a delivery, installation and assemblage service. Products varying from wardrobes to washing machines can be delivered, assembled and installed in the customer's house. <br/><br/>Extra@Home proposed a graduation internship to analyse the current customer journey to search for possible service optimisations. Context analysis and literature research outline the graduation project's context. <br/><br/>The customer journey was composed with literature review and user research insights. User research was conducted by interviewing expert, experiencing a service delivery, interviewing Extra@Home's customers and experiencing the communication. From the customer journey negative and positive customer experiences were derived. Negative customer experiences were evaluated with the SERVQUAL model. The SERVQUAL model provided two different design directions: Extra@Home can be more customer-oriented and services of Extra@Home can be more user-centred. Several factors led to the decision to continue with the last direction. <br/><br/>This direction was the start of the designing process, with the outcome of Mechanics@Home (Figure 1). It is a service designed for Extra@Home that improves the current service. It is a user-centred service, that emphasises the core values and strengths of PostNL.<br/><br/>Customers and mechanics of Extra@Home are put at the centre of the service. The service is a personal approach to the current service. The customer gets the opportunity to get to know the mechanic before they come to their house to deliver and install a product.

The consequence could be the escalation of military buildups into arms races. With ongoing technological advancements, militaries around the world are expanding on autonomous capabilities that need less and less human control. In this research, I investigate under which conditions arms races for these systems between two fictitious nations may occur and how the nations can influence these. For this, I construct a system dynamics model based on literature and expert consultations and conduct experiments to generate a wide range of possible scenarios. The model results suggest that different types of arms races for autonomous military capabilities occur under specific conditions: the inferior nation lacks behind the superior nation and fills this initial gap not with a greater number of autonomous systems, but with higher quality autonomous systems, leading to an arms race in quality. Bilateral disarmament in the form of regulations on the level of autonomy seem not to be the answer for the superior nation: some of the arms racing is reduced, but the superior nation now loses both racing and non-racing scenarios. Restrict an opponent in their technological development is more effective for the superior nation. Still, the inferior nation is able to win in the specific case, where the superior nation requires ""too much"" human control. Generally, arms races can further be reduced when both nations avoid to be too ""reactive"" to each other's arming actions. This suggests, that a third party could step in and aim at relaxing the tensions between the two nations. Further, this third party could also aim at encouraging the inferior nation to raise its ethical standards. To conclude, the model can give insight into which decisions a nation or a third party can take with different goals in mind. These include, for the nations involved in a competition as a result from tensions, to either win the race towards autonomy or to prevent its opponent from winning it. A third party, interested in a peaceful world without having nations piling up autonomous military capabilities, might aim at preventing arms races whatsoever.","System Dynamics; Exploratory Modelling and Analysis; Arms Races; Geopolitics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

This study aimed to investigate the changes in electrogram characteristics and activation patterns caused by different (non)transmural and (dis)continuous ablation lesions in ex vivo perfused porcine hearts. <br/><br/>Methods: Donation after circulatory death porcine hearts ex vivo perfused in Langendorff mode were used to perform ablation experiments in a controlled setting. Three subsequent radiofrequency ablation lesions – with different degrees of transmurality and continuity - were created on the right ventricle using AtriCure’s Isolator Synergy Bipolar clamp. Electrograms of the lesion and surrounding tissue were recorded by unipolar high-resolution mapping. These measurements were executed during pacing perpendicular to the ablation lesion from two sides and during intrinsic cardiac rhythm. Electrograms were processed using custom-made software. The inter-electrode conduction time, potential voltage, potential slope, and R-to-S-amplitude ratio were analyzed.<br/><br/>Results: The first radiofrequency application significantly affected all parameters in the lesion area. Conduction times increased, the potential voltage and slope decreased, and there was a loss of S-wave amplitude. The increase in conduction time and the decrease in voltage were less steep when there was a conduction gap in the ablation line. However, conduction time was less sensitive to lesion transmurality because it remained stable even when the lesion became more transmural. The potential voltage on the other hand, became significantly lower in transmural lesions, showing an overall decrease of 84% from baseline to the third (complete) lesion. The potential slope showed similar trends as the voltage, although it was less discriminative for (non)transmurality and (dis)continuity. The loss of the S-wave became significantly more pronounced with more radiofrequency delivery.<br/><br/>Conclusions: Complete ablation lesions are characterized by a stable conduction time when applying subsequent ablation, a decrease in potential voltage of 84% on the lesion and its border zone, and loss of the contribution of S-wave amplitude. The combination of these parameters in one tool could help to detect incomplete surgical ablation lesions in the individual patient during Maze surgery. This could potentially reduce post-maze gap-related atrial tachyarrhythmias and thus improve long-term success rates. <br","Atrial fibrillation; Maze surgery; Surgical ablation; Ex vivo heart perfusion; High-resolution mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Presently, there exists no “off-the-shelf” option for power generation on the order of magnitude necessary for sustaining a long-term human presence on the surface of Mars. In this thesis work, an investigation was performed to determine the optimal design for a large-scale, static, autonomously deployable, lightweight Martian surface solar array. A principle aim of the design study was to articulate a concept whose stowage volume and mass performance is, at the very least, comparable to that of the Compact Telescoping Surface Array (CTSA) which was developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 2016 to address the same challenge. Divided into two main sections, the first portion of this research consisted of a conceptual design phase which resulted in the generation of numerous different deployable solar array concepts. Through detailed analysis as well as cross-comparison, the Stripped Array concept was determined to likely be the only concept that can outperform the CTSA. At a high level, the Stripped Array is a square shaped, monolithic deployable array whose solar array membrane subassembly is divided into strips of varying length. It deploys above a Martian lander and is supported at its center by additional payload on the vehicle’s payload deck as well as at its corners by four telescoping composite booms which are evenly spaced around the perimeter of the landing vehicle. A main reason for the Stripped Array’s improvement in volume and mass performance is based on the reduction in deployment length and in total number of telescoping supports. Furthermore, the stripped membrane configuration in conjunction with the quad slip wrapping stowage method results in low stowed volumes by comparison to the other concepts. The second portion of this research consisted of a number of preliminary sensitivity studies to further characterize the Stripped Array concept. Specifically, system response to changes in total array area, level of pretension, and sizing of various subcomponents of the solar array membrane was evaluated. Furthermore, a preliminary study was performed to understand the effect of solar array membrane pre-tension, level of gravitational loading, supporting architecture cross-sectional sizing, and assumed support conditions on assembly stresses, deflections, and natural frequencies.","Deployable Structures; Mars; Solar array","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

When flying in this regime, the wing of the aircraft tends to experience a phenomenon known as buffet, which is characterized by an oscillating shock wave. The surface pressure of a structure experiencing transonic flow is always changing; however, the average surface pressure can be computed. Pressure sensitive paint (PSP) is a flow measurement technique that determines the surface pressure and serves to compute its average. Using PSP, the average surface pressure of an ONERA OAT15A supercritical airfoil model can be determined in transonic conditions. This allows to study the effect of shock control bumps on the shock wave and surface pressure of the OAT15A model, as well as to determine the pressure coefficients of the airfoil.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Most current navigation methods handle external wind disturbances through real-time estimation and rejection algorithms in the control stage, but lack safety guarantees in strong winds. Recent robust methods provide safety guarantees but can be overly conservative. With the availability of more powerful computing devices, data-driven control algorithms are becoming increasingly feasible. Combining Gaussian Process models with Model Predictive Control has shown to enhance safety and performance in various control applications. Moreover, Model Predictive Control has been extended to solve more complex optimization algorithms that combine trajectory generation and tracking, preventing reference trajectories that are risky and challenging to control in the presence of disturbances. <br/><br/>This research aims to improve quadrotor navigation in windy environments by using Gaussian Processes to model wind disturbances. The Gaussian Process model is integrated with a Model Predictive Contouring Control formulation that combines trajectory generation and control into one optimization problem. A nominal model of the quadrotor is derived and the Gaussian Process disturbance model is trained with the quadrotor position as input and wind disturbance as output. The wind disturbance map, along with the nominal model, is implemented in the Model Predictive Contouring Controller to consider both the mean and uncertainty of the resulting probabilistic model. <br/><br/>This study validates the use of Gaussian Processes to model complex wind disturbances in quadrotor navigation. The wind disturbance map is trained from available state information, with data collected using an optimal exploration design to minimize uncertainty and reduce exploration times. The hyperparameters involved in training the Gaussian Process model are discussed and the implementation of sparse Gaussian Processes is outlined to make it real-time feasible for the Model Predictive Contouring Control formulation. Including the prediction model by incorporating chance constraints results in improved tracking and increased robustness in cluttered environments compared to the nominal Model Predictive Contouring Control formulation. The proposed algorithm is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods for safe quadrotor navigation in windy and cluttered environments, being able to handle more complex wind fields than existing methods while also being less conservative.","Gaussian Process; Optimal Control; MPC; Autonomous Control; Quadrotor; Data-Driven; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

A mismatch between ventilatory support and patient demand is referred to as patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA), and it is associated with a series of adverse clinical outcomes. Although the use of a reference signal for patient effort is critical in recognition of PVA, existing detection algorithms are frequently solely based on the ventilator’s airway pressure (Paw) and flow-time signals. The aim of this study was to develop an automated detection algorithm for PVA using the ventilator’s Paw, flow-time and esophageal pressure (Pes) signals.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Methods: We proposed a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2DCNN) to detect two types of PVA (reverse triggering (RT) and premature cycling) using a dataset of respiratory cycles recorded from 11 patients. Mechanical ventilation experts with access to the Pes signal annotated 12.337 respiratory cycles to create a gold standard dataset. Several techniques for a potential class imbalance problem, as well as several changes to the initial model architecture, were investigated. A leave-one-patient-out cross-validation technique was used to evaluate model performance. The proposed Pes-based 2DCNN (Pes_2DCNN) was compared to a similar model based solely on the ventilator Paw and flow-time signals (PF_2DCNN).</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Results: The proposed Pes_2DCNN exhibited superior performance in detecting RT as compared to PF_2DCNN in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) (0.80 ± 0.07 vs. 0.75 ± 0.13, respectively; p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, the results indicate that the class imbalance solutions did not improve the performance for detection of RT.

However, because this is a preliminary study, more research is required to further investigate the importance of the Pes signal in PVA detection.","Intensive Care; Mechanical ventilation; Patient-ventilator asynchrony; Machine Learning; Convolutional Neural Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine | Sensing and Stimulation","",""

(mentor); Medina Sanchez, Robinson (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The transition towards a more sustainable future has been more prevalent and necessary in recent years due to the increase of greenhouse gas emissions. With the increasing size of modern cities, major concern is risen in the transport sector, becoming one of the main contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. More specifically, road transport is the main contributor within this sector, causing as much as 70 % of the total emissions [3]. As a consequence, the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) has become more prevalent in various countries as a replacement of Internal Combustion Energy Vehicles (ICEVs), being the main cause of pollution within road transport.<br/>On the other hand, EVs are yet to be the perfect replacement due to 2 main bottlenecks, significantly slower charging times compared to refilling Internal Combustion Energy vehicle (ICEV), as well as Li-ion battery lifespan and deterioration over time, which is not an issue in ICEVs, thus a charging profile needs to be determined to mitigate these factors as much as possible. This brings the research proposal ""Finding a model-based real-time control charging strategy that mitigates charging times as well as degradation"".<br/>To explore this research topic before developing a model-based control charging strategy, a battery model as well as a degradation model are needed to be implemented, to capture physical states of the battery such as State Of Charge (SOC) and of degrdation mechanisms such as Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) and lithium plating. First of all, 3 electro-chemical Li-ion battery dynamical models have been implemented and/or simulated, the Pseudo 2-Dimensional (P2D) model, the Electrolyte Enhanced Single Particle Model (SPMe) and the Extended Single Particle Model (ESPM). The P2D model is considered a full order model, highly accurate for a wide range of charge/discharge currents, which is taken as the base for comparison. The SPMe is a simplified, less accurate model of the P2D, but faster in terms of computational time. Both models are computationally heavy, inapplicable for real time control applications, thus being infeasible for realtime control. The ESPM, a simplification of SPMe, has been developed to tackle the computational time issue, while still maintaining high accuracy performance. The P2D and SPMe are already available and simulation data was obtained using the Python library PyBamm, whereas ESPM was unavailable, thus implemented and simulated on MATLAB. Implementations of comparison between models on MATLAB showed that ESPM can be used for a current range of at least 2C, showing above 90 % similarity in all model variables compared. In order to include degradation effects in the control strategy, a detailed electro-chemical degradation model, incorporating the 2 main aging effects, SEI growth and lithium plating has been implemented and simulated on MATLAB where degradation parameters were adjusted to fit the capacity fade specifications for the LGM50 battery. Such degrdation effects were incorporated such that they could be minimized seperately in the charging strategy.<br/>Lastly, based on the models developed, an Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) control strategy has been developed with the aim to achieve a tradeoff between charging time, SEI growth and lithium plating as well as change of charge current with time while staying between the feasible model and cell constraints. A Health Conscious Fast charging strategy achieved a charging time of 34 minutes, while having a battery lifespan of approximately 800 charge/discharge cycles. This charging time matches typical DC Fast charging times, while saving approximately 100 cycles from the LGM50 battery lifespan","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Systems and Control","",""

However, installing traditional monopile or jacket structures in these deeper waters can be expensive. One potential solution is the Dogger Bank, a shallow sand bank located 275 km from the Dutch coast, which allows for inexpensive wind turbine installation and high capacity factors. For far offshore locations like the Dogger Bank, electricity transport can be costly, making hydrogen transport via the existing gas infrastructure a more efficient solution. This could enable hydrogen production far offshore and its use in the decarbonisation of hard-to-abate sectors.<br/><br/>This study focuses on the development of a stand-alone offshore hydrogen production system, incorporating battolyser technology, on the Dogger Bank. The battolyser, which combines a Ni-Fe battery and an alkaline electrolyser, is able to store energy and produce hydrogen efficiently and flexibly. However, as the battolyser is not yet commercially available, the proposed systems are analysed for the years 2030 and 2050. The study examines three system configurations: an electrolyser-battolyser, battolyser-only, and electrolyser-battery configuration. For the electrolysers, alkaline and PEM electrolysis is considered. For the battery a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB). <br/><br/>To ensure autonomous operation, the battolyser serves as a backup power source for supplying<br/>the system’s auxiliary energy demand. This demand is used to determine the system’s sizing, and a MATLAB/Simulink model is developed to calculate the hydrogen production based on future estimates of technical parameters. The hourly wind data from offshore platforms near the Dogger Bank is used as input for the model. To project future capital expenditures (CAPEX) for the model components, a learning curve method is employed, which assumes a specific cost reduction rate with every doubling of cumulative installed capacity. <br/><br/>This study demonstrates the feasibility of an offshore wind-hydrogen system with battolyser<br/>technology, both technically and economically. Battolyser CAPEX are used as an input variable to estimate a range of possible levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) values for different systems. The study findings indicate that LCOH values of less than 1.55 C/kg could be achieved by 2030, and by 2050, these values could drop to less than 1.18 C/kg.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

These systems utilize the existing lighting infrastructure, without needing dedicated LED transmitters. LCs modulate ambient light by controlling its polarization, thus encoding information. At the receiving end, a camera consisting of optical sensors captures and decodes these signals. However, single-pixel LC-to-Camera systems struggle to transmit data at high capacity. On the other hand, recent developments reveal that LCs can convert incoming light to polarized color sig- nals under certain conditions. This thesis work exploits these properties to design a method that employs colors as data symbols in order to tackle the throughput issue. Therefore, we propose a multi-symbol, multi-channel LC-to-Camera system. We develop a modulation-demodulation mechanism that helps to establish a robust link. Experiments demonstrate an 8-symbol scheme results in a three-time throughput increase at per-pixel level with distances up to 160 cm at minimal error.

The method aims to construct a robust and efficient alternative for the computationally expensive time domain fatigue calculations of mooring lines in the early design stage of a floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT). A robust way of modelling must be applicable and reliable in all possible sea states, including extreme wavelengths, nonlinear waves, and dynamic amplification caused by the resonance frequencies. The method’s reliability for different wave spectra is validated by comparing the proposed numerical lumped time-domain simulations with the original numerical time-domain simulations.<br/><br/>The lumping block method gives accurate damage results for narrow wave spectra. However, the model’s reliability decreases when the broadening of a wave spectrum causes damage-increasing conditions, like outliers in wave periods and nonlinear waves. The lumped broad wave spectrum simulations underestimate a mooring line’s structural damage, especially for wave periods above resonance. Moreover, the non-Gaussian wave-induced surge responses are the most critical parameter for reliable mooring line fatigue calculations. They must be considered for simplifying fatigue mooring line calculations in general. Furthermore, the non-Gaussian responses cause the underestimation of the proposed lumping block method for the broad wave spectra.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the proposed method yields accurate but slightly conservative damage results and is robust and efficient in fatigue calculations for sea states corresponding to a narrow spectrum. Hence the lumping block method is safe and usable for significant parts of the North Sea since only middle or narrow spectra occur.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

With the help of innovation and new technologies, the negative impacts on sustainability can be decreased. During the development of technologies, the concept of sustainability should be included at all times. This can be done with the help of sustainability assessment methods. However, companies (like the case company of this study) often only adopt one or a few sustainability assessment methods in their product development process. These methods might not necessarily be suitable for the technology under investigation. Furthermore, guidance on when to use which method can be identified as missing within the literature and in practice.<br/><br/>This thesis study aims to fill this gap by developing decision support for the selection of a sustainability assessment method during technology development. Coming from a comprehensive set of sustainability aspects (social, environmental and economic), during the thesis the focus was put on the environmental aspect exclusively. A literature study is used to identify a set of the possible sustainability assessment method. The identified methods are compared to a set of selection criteria based on the method's acceptance, type of assessment, and sustainability pillar covered. Four methods/method groups are identified as suitable for the defined criteria and the study scope. The selected methods are analyzed in more detail to gain a deeper understanding. Based on the knowledge acquired, a flow chart is developed to support selecting the most suitable sustainability assessment method. In order to be able to compare the selected assessment method with other available method, a ranking is developed. The ranking is based on a qualitative comparison and data obtained from the literature. The ranking is displayed in two ways, by a set of spiderweb diagrams and a ranking with numbers. A partial validation of the developed ranking is done by applying two methods to a use case and comparing the practical results with the theoretical ones. Here a mismatch between the ranking obtained from the theoretical data and the one from practical experience can be identified. <br/><br/>The result of the study is the development of decision support consisting of a flowchart and method ranking. Once both steps are followed, it should be possible to provide a fast and easy method selection for non-experts. Furthermore, the common practice of using only one sustainability assessment method (Life Cycle Assessment) is looked into. It can be seen that no sustainability assessment method is best in all criteria and application cases. Therefore, it is impossible to define one most suitable method in all cases. Choosing the right method depends on the scope (substance, product, or material) and the intended outcome. Thus, relying solely or predominantly on Life Cycle Assessment cannot be recommended. Alternative methods should be adopted and applied, also within the case company.<br","Sustainability; sustainability assessment framework; aviation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed overlay architecture, two novel node discovery protocols, FedKad and SovKad, were designed and implemented.

A demand for faster and smarter testing of high voltage components led to the development of an arbitrary waveform generator. It is possible to generate voltage waveforms with varying magnitudes and frequencies using a modular multilevel converter (MMC). Based on the voltage withstand capacity of semiconductor switches and the control complexity of MMCs, the number of levels and maximum voltage at each level in MMC are determined. The commercially available semiconductor switches are capable of withstanding 1.7kV (SiC-MOSFET) and 6.5kV (Si-IGBT). The low current and fast switching requirements of high-voltage (HV) tests argue in favor of SiC MOSFETs.<br/><br/>With the ability to connect commercially available and mature but lower breakdown voltage semiconductor transistors in series, medium-voltage (MV) and high-voltage (HV) converters can be built with a significant reduction in costs. Using the proposed technique, a modular multilevel converter (MMC) can be equipped with a HV switching module. When semiconductor switches are connected in series, the key challenge is to ensure equal voltage sharing in both static and dynamic switching states. There is a clear connection between the asynchronous gate driving signals and the voltage imbalance. Different types of intrinsic and extrinsic capacitive couplings also affect the voltage shared among series-connected SiC MOSFETs. The factors responsible for voltage imbalance are listed below from a dominant influence to a subservient one.<br/>1. Gate delay introduced by the gate driver circuit and associated power supply.<br/>2. Resistance and capacitance to ground introduced by the measurement probes.<br/>3. External capacitance to ground introduced by the heatsink.<br/>4. Parasitic inductance introduced by the interconnects between series-connected devices.<br/>5. Process variation in intrinsic parasitic capacitances.<br/><br/>Stacks of SiC MOSFETs can be controlled synchronously and isolated from the gate driving circuit using a pulse transformer. A common primary winding is made of a HV insulated cable passing through ’N’ toroidal cores carrying ’N’ secondary windings for respective gate terminals of the series-connected SiC MOSFETs.<br/>By resolving the frequency dependency between pulse transformer and stack duty cycle, the proposed technique achieves arbitrary switching function for the series-stack. There are two sets of such pulse transformer arrangements that ensure the fail-safe switching transitions for series-connected SiC MOSFETs. An experimental verification of the proposed technique is performed with a 6kV prototype of five 1.2kV SiC MOSFETs in series. During differential probe measurements across drain-source terminals of the individual series-connected SiC MOSFETs, a significant challenge has been encountered. It is demonstrated that external resistive and capacitive couplings induced by the measurement probes can affect switching function.<br/><br/>The objective of the thesis is partially met, and a low-cost approach to achieve high voltage switching modules with commercially available devices in series connection is proposed. With the conducted research it is possible to build high-voltage isolation between gate driving circuit and series-connected SiC MOSFETs.<br/>The proposed method is an open loop voltage balancing technique which significantly reduces the required number of components by eliminating the need for feedback and its isolation challenge. Furthermore it achieves synchronous switching with the ability to set the duty cycle for the series-connected switch.","Series-connected; SiC MOSFETs; Gate driver; High voltage isolation; Voltage balancing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-03-31","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

The selection for the design of a backpack for female hikers was chosen because current backpacks on the market are designed with men in mind therefore, female users experience more issues with misfit and discomfort. This project works closely with a company that is known as a producer of sporting equipment and sportswear who would like to expand their portfolio with products that aims to improve the fit and comfort of their customers.<br/>Before entering the design phase, it is important to understand the aspects of backpack design, challenges with products on market, and gender differences of the upper body in order formulate design requirements. It was revealed from user research that female hiker faced high levels of discomfort on their neck/shoulders, chest area, and lower back due to the misfit of backpack size and unoptimized placement and shape of the shoulder/hip straps. With these identified issues, this was prioritized during the ideation and concept generation to explore solutions that reduced shoulder and chest discomfort while improve overall fit. <br/>To create an appropriate fit of the backpack, anthropometric data was gathered from the DINED and ANSUR II database for formulate an anthropometric guideline. However, each database has its limitations such as data from DINED reflects students from the ages 17 - 27 and not all Dutch adults while data from ANSUR II reflects data of female soldiers and not civilian populations. The main design goals gathered from the research is to establish parameters that are relevant for backpack design asides from stature. Concluding dimensions of the backpack are based off the two databases and aims to fit women within the 5th and 95th percentile of the proposed body parameters. <br/>After that, ideas and concepts were generated based on the identified issues, anthropometric research, and design requirements. Inspirations were drawn from existing products such as posture braces, women’s body armor/military vests, and baby swaddles/3D knitted shoes to create three concept direction. <br/>The final concept design being a strapless system that replaces conventional shoulder straps with stiff, bendable shoulder hooks allowing for ultimate freedom shoulders, chest, and arms while pack load will be fully distributed onto the hips. Physical prototypes were made of the winning concept to validate the carrying system and tested with users regarding fit, comfort, and mobility. <br/>From the testing results and observations, the strapless system proves to be a potential design that could improve the overall fit and comfort for women, because it allows for freedom of the upper body without the complications sternum and shoulder straps while maintaining the usability and functionality of a conventional hiking backpack. However, further development is needed to fully validate the design for a fast-hiking context.

Both query and reference images are described using a feature extractor, and the query descriptor is matched to its closest reference descriptor in the feature space. Within VPR there are many different VPR techniques that have been proposed throughout the years with many different types of architecture and trained on different datasets. With the many test datasets available, there exists no VPR technique that is able to reach state-of-the-art performance on all these datasets. For this reason, existing work has argued it can be beneficial to utilize an ensemble-based method to combine multiple VPR techniques and achieve better VPR performance. Some of these Ensemble-based methods have already been proposed. These ensemble-methods combine individual VPR techniques and weigh their predictions using these same predictions to give an indication of their confidence. This calculation, however, is strictly based on predictions obtained from applying the VPR techniques on test data at inference time. Generally within VPR research, the dataset that was used to train the VPR technique is often different from the dataset it is tested on. This means there is a domain shift between the training and test data. This domain shift is not taken into account when weighting the predictions of VPR techniques in an ensemble using these existing methods. In this work, we analyze how this degree of domain shift between train and test data, which can be observed by looking at the relative location of descriptors in the feature space, impacts downstream VPR performance. Intuitively, one would expect better VPR performance in a situation where the degree of train-test domain shift is minimal. Our analysis shows that this is indeed the case. We propose two different methods that utilize this degree of domain shift to calculate the weights given to the VPR techniques in an ensemble. First, we propose a generative method. Here weights are given to the VPR techniques based on the likelihood that the query sample originated from the same distribution as the training dataset of the technique and is in distribution. This way each individual technique is given a weight. Secondly, we propose a discriminative method. Here weights are given to the training datasets used to train the techniques in the ensemble. These training datasets are given weights based on relative proximity to a query sample in the feature space, an indicator for the degree of domain-shift between the training dataset and the query sample. all VPR techniques are given the weight corresponding to their training dataset. We compare these proposed approaches to other ensemble-based baselines and individual VPR techniques. The quantitative results show that our proposed methods generally outperform the ensemblebased baselines and the individual VPR techniques. We also propose further future work. One of the generative methods still delivers lower performance than could be possible, caused by applying this method to high-dimensionality descriptors. A solution for this issue should lead to higher VPR performance using this method. Additionally, we suggest future work to expand on the datasets used in this research, to strengthen the claims made, and verify that results and trends found to hold up when testing and training using other datasets.","VPR; Visual; Place; Recognition; ensemble; domain-shift","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

Risks are inherent to all construction projects, however, the high uncertainties of the international EPC markets, and the complex EPC processes, create for abundant risks which often make it unfeasible for EPC contractors to manage the risks by relying solely on their own capabilities [Wang et al., 2016]. These projects are often of large scale, financially and technically, in<br/>a competitive environment where subcontractors have tight margins and even unrealistic budgeting [Yeo and Ning, 2002]. Furthermore, the concept of risk management is a widely discussed topic in construction literature. However, the effective allocation of these risks to certain parties down the supply chain is<br/>not a popular subject. EPC project environments are known for their adversarial relationships between stakeholders, where subcontractors have demonstrated a certain feeling of distrust within the supply chains [Dainty et al., 2001]. The status quo of these large and complex EPC projects is that the number of subcontractors willing and able to take on the risks of EPC projects is shrinking. There is a need for a more effective risk allocation within the supply chain.<br/><br/>To address this problem statement, this research focuses on analyzing how the risk allocation within the supply chain can improve, in order to improve the project performance for all parties involved. This problem statement is answered through the viewpoint of the contracting strategy used in EPC projects since the contracting strategy is a tool for allocating risks. The final output of this research is a Network Risk Allocation model and recommendations for both EPC contractors and subcontractors. This is attained by conducting exploratory research, consisting of quantitative data gathering, in order<br/>to answer the main research question:<br/><br/>How can risks within EPC projects effectively be allocated among the EPC contractor and subcontractors, to improve project performance through strategic contracting?<br/><br/>This research is divided into three phases. The first phase includes the theoretical background, including a literature review, document review, and exploratory interviews. Phase one dives into the theory around risk allocation, risks in EPC projects, and the supply chain network. Here it is concluded that an effective risk allocation for EPC projects is in the form of a network risk allocation. Phase 2 continues by conducting empirical research in the form of a Case Study analysis. Two projects are analyzed on the basis of their risk allocation. This led to recommendations for effective risk allocation. Phase 3 dives into the development of the solution model: the network risk allocation model. It is found that collaboration in the network is an important element to effective risk allocation, amongst other factors.","EPC; Risk allocation; Risk management; Subcontractors; Contracting strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-04-01","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The amount of active competitors, combined with the required time and effort to launch a new sensor-based product, makes it difficult to enter the market and slows innovation. WeAreReasonablePeople (WARP), a Rotterdam-based digital design agency, is trying to broaden its impact by starting a venture under the name SensorBloxx. This venture is building a universally implementable base to simplify the launch of new sensor-based products. WARP will design the first ‘flagship’ product build on SensorBloxx to test this universally implementable base and start encouraging other companies. <br/><br/>In order to catch the attention of fellow innovators the product needs to stand out from the competition. A projection of the metaphorical competitive analysis on the Dutch market provides a better understanding of which businesses should be targeted to increase the flagship’s viability. Although it initially seemed that the viable audiences were already being targeted, a change of perspective has shown the potential of small-sized businesses in five sectors based in office environments. <br/><br/>Various rounds of qualitative research with stakeholders in the targeted audience indicate the flagship’s ability to treat these sectors identically. Desk research brings to light potential motives for business owners to start generating indoor environment data. However, business owners are explicitly devoted to use the data to optimise the work experience of their employees. <br/><br/>A concept is created based on the findings of the explorative qualitative research. This concept is presented to existing and new participants within the target audience. These concept validation sessions provided a better understanding of how the flagship should optimise the employees’ work experience. The results of the concept evaluation sparked an iterative digital prototyping process that led to a new concept embodiment. This concept embodiment and its functioning have been once more validated to confirm the flagship’s desirability. <br/><br/>A final design arose, a flagship called ‘DROP’, a non-intrusive sensor-based product that optimises work experience. This flagship involves employees in realising an optimal work environment together. DROP combines a non-intrusive calm display and a supportive mobile interface for employees. DROP can function as a flagship since it genuinely fulfils the needs of a target audience that competitors are barely targeting in the smart building market. <br","Indoor environment data; Sensor proposition; Non-intrusive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Erasmus MC (degree granting institution)","2023","b>Background:</b> Atherosclerosis is a progressive arterial disease that gives rise to plaque. Rupture thereof is a main cause of myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke. A plaque can have a fibrotic layer between its lipid pool and the arterial lumen, which is termed a fibrous cap (FC). Rupture of this FC can expose thrombogenic plaque content to the bloodstream. From a mechanical viewpoint, the FC is hypothesized to rupture when its strength is exceeded by the structural stresses imposed thereupon. Stresses in the FC can not be measured and are generally approximated by using digital analogs such as finite element models. Such models require among other things a definition of the FC its in-vivo composition. However, this is still poorly understood as it can presently not be measured in-vivo. To investigate the relations between a FC its composition and its mechanical properties, bio-engineered FCs (BE-FC) have been developed by researchers. These BE-FCs are reported to bear resemblance to human FCs in terms of bulk mechanical properties. This study aims to aid in the comprehension of the biomechanical behaviour of these BE-FCs.<br/><b>Methods:</b> A finite element modeling pipeline has been developed for BE-FCs. Following the pipeline provides a 2D BE-FC model and a total of 16 BE-FCs were modeled. Material behaviour is defined using the Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden model. The BE-FC models their geometry and material parameters are acquired using geometry and collagen images in combination with self-developed and data-scaleable scripts. Model simulation results provide an approximation of the BE-FC its biomechanical behaviour. This study includes an investigation of the BE-FC models their global biomechanical behaviour as well as their stress and strain peak values, peak value locations, and distributions. In addition a parametric study has been performed; 1260 idealised BE-FC models were created. These models differ in geometry and composition, allowing a more in-depth investigation of the BE-FC models their stress and strain peak values and distributions.<b>Results: </b>The global biomechanical behaviour of the BE-FC models satisfyingly approximates that of their respective BE-FC. Peak stresses and strains in the BE-FC models are considerably higher than those found in the literature for ex-vivo uni-axially tensile tested FCs as well as compared to FC sections of finite element models. To the same extent the locations of the peak stresses and strains in the BE-FC models could not be co-localized to the rupture initiation locations of the BE-FCs. The stress and strain distributions are thoroughly examined using the simulation results of the idealised models. Depending on the specific stress and strain metric, each is contingent on different model characteristics and/or behaviours. In general however the most crucial of these are the collagen fibre dispersion \(\kappa\), the collagen fibre mean angle \(\Theta\), the degree of model compaction, and the model its soft inclusion shape and size.<b>Conclusion: </b>With this study, a novel modeling pipeline has been developed for 2D BE-FC finite element models. Results from simulations therewith give insight into the biomechanical behaviour of BE-FCs. In addition a parametric study has been performed, resulting in numerous idealised BE-FC models. The simulation results of these models aid considerably in the understanding of the BE-FCs their biomechanical behaviour. Taking everything in consideration, a contribution has been made to the comprehension of BE-FCs and along with that it therefore assists current research invested in answering how, why and when a FC ruptures. ","Atherosclerosis; Plaque; Plaque rupture; Fibrous cap; Stress analysis; Finite element","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Estimates of long-term sediment fluxes in the Rhine at the German-Dutch border are required to understand the morphological evolution of the Dutch Rhine Delta. Especially information about the long-term flux of bed material load is of interest because this flux is morphologically relevant. Bed material load interacts continuously with the river bed and it influences the bed surface texture and river slope and width. <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to gain more insight in the amount of bed material load at Lobith (at the German-Dutch border) and in the free-flowing Rhine, the region upstream from the border. To accomplish this, a literature study on the definitions of wash load and bed material load is carried out and different methods to make a distinction between the two are discussed. <br/><br/>This study shows that the wash load cut-off size – the sediment grain size that marks the boundary between wash load and bed material load – is a dynamic variable that depends on the local flow and/or bed characteristics. Therefore, the wash load cut-off size is different for every river and can also change within a river system. It is suggested to set the cut-off size for a specific location equal to the diameter for which 1% of the river bed grains at that location are smaller (D1). <br/><br/>D1 as a cut-off size and sediment transport data based on direct measurements (Frings et al., 2014a,b) give an average annual flux of bed material load of 0.5 Mt/a or 200,000 m³/a at Lobith for the period 1991-2010. It should be noted that there are large uncertainties in these numbers. First of all there are large uncertainties in the used sediment data. Second, multiple assumptions have been made in the process of distinguishing between wash load and bed material load. <br/><br/>The last part of this research contains a comparison between the results of this study and the sediment transport determined by three existing computer models. The model results did not differ that much from the results of this study. The results of this study were especially close to the results of the model for which the input was almost identical to the conditions under which the measurements – on which the results of this study are based - took place. It can be concluded that at least the order of magnitude of the bed material load estimated at the German-Dutch border is probably correct. <br","bed material load; wash load; Rhine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","51.861895,6.1185933"

One of the possible configurations for producing green hydrogen is by means of a central offshore hydrogen production platform powered by offshore wind energy. Producing hydrogen offshore facilitates the possibility to eliminate parts of the expensive electrical infrastructure present in conventional offshore wind farms and could result in lower losses. <br/><br/>In collaboration with Vattenfall, this study provides a thorough examination of centralised offshore hydrogen production. The study addresses both the techno-economic feasibility of the centralised configuration and the effects of aggregating the power supplied by individual offshore wind turbines. <br/><br/>In Part 2, the study presents a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of different electrolysis technologies, the optimal hydrogen production unit capacity, and compressor output pressure. The outcomes reveal that an optimal levelised cost of hydrogen can be achieved by reducing the hydrogen production unit capacity compared to the offshore wind farm capacity. Moreover, increasing the hydrogen pressure above the minimum pressure required to overcome the pipeline pressure drop, reduces the levelised cost of hydrogen further. The study reveals a small preference for hydrogen production based on proton exchange membrane electrolysis, in comparison to hydrogen production based on alkaline electrolysis.<br/><br/>In Part 2, the focus is shifted towards hydrogen production solely, influenced by power fluctuations. By using historical offshore wind turbine power output data, it was found that aggregating the power output significantly reduces the normalised power output fluctuations, compared to a decentralised offshore configuration. However, the reduced power fluctuations did not result in a higher hydrogen yield, attributed to the inter-array cable losses of the centralised configuration. Nevertheless, a significant reduction in the number of switches of operational mode and the number of turn-offs of the stacks was observed. Reducing the number of switches and turn-offs will reduce the process of stack degradation.<br/><br/>The study concludes that centralised offshore hydrogen production facilitates the possibility to produce hydrogen at a competitive levelised cost of hydrogen. Furthermore, the reduction of the power fluctuations will benefit this configuration due to the deceleration of the stack's degradation process. <br","Hydrogen; Offshore; Centralised","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-03-16","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","In the energy sector, a transition is made from fossil fuels to sustainable energies. Due to an irregular supply of these sustainable energies, it often occurs that there is a mismatch between supply and demand. Energy storage is a promising technique to overcome this. In this thesis, the aim is to store gravitational energy in concrete spheres which are placed on the seabed. <br/><br/>Therefore, this thesis aims to answer whether the most optimal construction method uses 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP) and if so, what the optimal construction method will be using 3DCP. Based on a specific case, five main construction methods are qualitative investigated, from which two are with 3DCP. From an evaluation, it followed that a combination of 3DCP and conventional casting is the most promising method and is therefore selected for more in-depth research. In this construction method, the formwork is made with 3DCP and concrete is cast in the formwork. A prefab bottom and top part are required, because the maximum inclination (nowadays) for printing is limited to 45°. <br/><br/>Based on the selected construction method, three different 3DCP-variants are investigated: construction in the dry (1), submerged construction (2) and construction on a pontoon (3). The two main topics that are investigated are the use of 3DCP for the formwork and the suitability of unreinforced concrete for the sphere itself. The possible use of 3DCP is verified based on two failure mechanisms: plastic collapse (results in minimal free height of the formwork) and elastic collapse (results in maximum free height of the formwork). The suitability of unreinforced concrete is verified based on strength requirements.<br/><br/>Both in case of construction in the dry and construction on a pontoon, h1 is 0.20 m and h2 is 0.65 m. In case of submerged construction, h1 is 0.25 m and h2 is 0.72 m. The unreinforced wall thickness should not exceed 2.5 m because it is required that the sphere is buoyant. For this wall thickness, a concrete strength class of C60/75 is required for construction in the dry, submerged construction and construction on a pontoon. An evaluation based on feasibility and reliability, combined with the results above, shows that construction in the dry is the most promising method. <br/><br/>An adiabatic calculation is made of the temperature increase of the concrete, based on five different cement compositions. It followed that unreinforced concrete will crack. However, in reality, the temperature increase is semi-adiabatic, resulting in lower tensile stresses. It is therefore highly recommended to further investigate this temperature increase in order to verify the suitability of unreinforced concrete. Measures that could be taken to lower the temperature differences are: addition of liquid nitrogen or addition of ice instead of water for the concrete mix. Besides that, it is recommended to investigate the possible use of fibre-reinforced concrete, which could significantly increase the tensile strength of concrete. <br","Energy storage; Offshore; unreinforced; concrete","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-03-15","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

A hybrid controller benefit by the unrequired need for accurate system identification. Simultaneously, the learning effort is reduced by the preliminary work of the model-based component. In this project, a model-based feedforward controller is pro- posed and compared with a hybrid controller consisting of the same model-based controller enhanced with a Gaussian process to reduce the end-point error in the bending angle. The controllers are tested using a crafted 2-segment pneumatic silicone soft robot, following a circular trajectory with different radii. The results of this new control strategy highlights the poten- tial benefits of adding a learning approach to a model-based controller to reduce model errors.

In response to the growing concern about climate change, new methods are being developed to reduce these emissions. Building with timber is one such approach, as it can be CO2 neutral if reforestation is practiced. Timber is a lightweight and flexible material compared to traditional construction materials like steel and concrete, which can result in high accelerations and deflections, negatively affecting user comfort. Engineered wood products such as CLT and GLT make it possible to construct larger panel sizes and spans, which can lead to more efficient building design. Many buildings utilize core systems to provide lateral stability and facilitate vertical transportation of goods and people. Therefore, replacing a conventional concrete core with a CLT core could be a viable solution to reduce the building’s environmental impact. Timber, being a flexible material, often lacks the necessary stability to meet user requirements for deflection and acceleration in high-rise buildings. An outrigger, similar to those used in concrete and steel structures, can provide the solution to enhance user comfort. The outrigger transfers bending moments from the core to the columns, reducing forces in the core and increasing overall stiffness. However it is unclear what the influence of the addition of a timber outrigger on a CLT core building is and how such a system can be improved. Therefore the purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the impact of a timber outrigger on a CLT core building, and provide guidance for structural engineers on how to improve the structural behaviour of such a system. The impact of adding an outrigger is evaluated through the comparison of different numerical case studies with and without timber outriggers. Additionally a sensitivity analysis is performed in which the influence of core joint design and the impact of outrigger design parameters is evaluated. By introducing a timber outrigger to a CLT core building bending moments are transferred from the core to the column, partially restricting rotation of the core. This will have the following effects on the behaviour of the structure. Firstly, the deflections due to lateral wind loading are reduced due to the increased global stiffness. Secondly, the increased stiffness of the structure will result in a reduction of peak lateral acceleration. Thirdly, by transferring loads from the core to the columns the strength requirements on the connections of the core are reduced. Finally, by introducing a timber outrigger system to a CLT core building horizontal forces are generated in the core at outrigger level, which should be accounted for in the design phase of the vertical core joints. Increasing the stiffness of the outrigger will further reduce deflections, peak lateral acceleration and strength requirements on the core joint, however strength requirements on the vertical core joints at outrigger level will further increase. An exponential relationship has been derived between the lateral deflections and the ratio between the effective bending stiffness of the outrigger and the effective bending stiffness of the core, a similar exponential relationship has been derived for the peak lateral accelerations Additionally it was investigated what the critical design parameters are and how the performance of a CLT core building with timber outriggers can be improved. For the design of a CLT core the connection between the core and foundation showed to be critical, having large effects on the lateral deformation. While increasing the stiffness of the vertical connections showed to have little influence on the interaction between core walls due to their respective high interaction factors. In the design of the outrigger it was shown that a two storey outrigger is able to more than double the reduction in deflections compared to a single storey outrigger, further increasing the overall effectiveness of the system. Finally the effectiveness of the system was found to be significantly influenced by the configuration of the outrigger truss, demonstrating a greater impact than increasing member size or connection stiffness.","timber structures; CLT core; Timber outrigger; wind-induced dynamic behaviour; Wind-induced Deformations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Steel and Timber Construction","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Nowadays, Rijkswaterstaat reassesses many older concrete bridges to guarantee their structural safety under the influence of increased traffic loads and stricter standards. Many of these concrete bridges contain open straight-legged stirrups, which are not allowed to take into account for the calculations of the shear resistance according to current standards. This often results in theoretical insufficient shear capacity and critical damage to structures, but this is not observed in reality. This indicates that the open straight-legged stirrups probably do contribute to the shear resistance, where an accurate assessment of this contribution could prevent unnecessary and costly structural safety measures. However, very few shear tests with relevant cross-sectional dimensions are performed and documented in literature, especially tests containing open straight-legged stirrups.<br/><br/>The application of Nonlinear Finite Element Analysis (NLFEA) is a useful tool to evaluate and understand the behaviour of structures, but provisions for the implementation of open straight-legged stirrups in concrete structures are lacking. Thus, the goal of this research is to provide a finite element modelling strategy that is able to accurately describe the behaviour of concrete beams with open straight-legged stirrups subjected to shear. The research focusses on describing the behaviour of rectangular concrete beams with open and closed straight-legged stirrups with finite element models using DIANA 10.5 [1]. <br/><br/>Schramm [2] has performed multiple shear tests on prestressed concrete beams with several no longer permitted stirrups, including open straight-legged stirrups. He found that open straight-legged stirrups can significantly contribute to the transfer of shear forces [2]. The relevance of the rectangular test beams for comparison with box-girders is validated in this thesis, where the stress distributions in a linear elastic rectangular and box-girder cross-section due to axial forces, bending moments, shear forces and torsion are compared. <br/><br/>In the interest of providing a suitable solution strategy, Schramm’s test beams with closed and open straight-legged stirrups are reproduced with 3-dimensional nonlinear finite element models based on the recommendations of the RTD1016-1 [3], where the influence of various modelling considerations is investigated. The concrete is modelled with a smeared total strain-based crack model with the Hordijk tensioning and parabolic compression relations, including confinement and lateral cracking effects. Reinforcements are modelled as embedded truss elements with the Von-Mises plasticity model. To describe the accurate anchorage behaviour of the open straight-legged stirrups, the interaction between the surrounding concrete and the stirrups is described with the Shima bond-slip relation. The finite element model is first calibrated with a beam with closed stirrups, where modelling clamped restraints with supports on both sides of the beam result in a too-stiff response. By allowing a little rotational freedom in the form of boundary springs, the stiffness of the beam is manipulated without changing the overall load-bearing behaviour...<br/><br","Shear Failure; NLFEA; Concrete beams; DIANA; Stirrups","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

The hypothesis of increasing aniline biodegradability by making it chemically react with nitrite was experimentally tested. In addition, data analysis of the full scale of this study was performed in order to create analytical models to represent its biological processes. It was found that the correlation between oxygen concentrations and nitrification was non-linear and differs from what is observed in the literature due to the significant influence of different boundary conditions. The unavailability of carbon sources during the nitratation process was the cause of nitrite accumulation, which crucially affects nitrification. The chemical reaction between aniline and nitrite (most likely polymerization) resulted in a compound that did not limit nitrification and had more biodegradable potential. Furthermore, an aerobic model was developed but the promising results were most likely caused by the mathematical optimization, which was done in order to bypass the lack of data. Nevertheless, respirometry was used to build an empirical model to detect nitrite accumulation in the effluent of the full scale, which showed promising results.

Efficient resource management is crucial in the construction industry to achieve project goals despite challenges such as complex projects, tight budgets, and supply chain issues.<br/>The aim of this study is to develop a proof-of-concept for managing resources between construction projects using digital connections between resource data.

Green hydrogen is used as a case study where topic modelling is used to find values in scientific literature on this subject. Green hydrogen is envisioned to play a more important role in the context of decarbonisation. Such a transition has a major influence on society engaging business and households alike. Three different value sets are used reflecting different perspectives. These perspectives focus on corporate values, public values and the context in which hydrogen is discussed respectively. It was found that using topic modelling to identify values is highly constrained by its given inputs and processed outputs however. A methodological framework is therefore proposed. It suggests how topic modelling can be conducted for the purpose of identifying values playing a role in a certain domain. This framework consists of five components which are value definition, corpus selection, language processing, topic modelling and result interpretation. Utilising this framework helps with structuring the topic modelling procedure and identify bottlenecks in result quality.","Topic Modeling; Topic Modelling; Value; Values; Policy; Policy making; Policy maker; Stakeholder; Framework; Machine learning; Policy analysis; Governance; Contenious governance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); van Binsbergen, A.J. (mentor); Annema, J.A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The Flemish government is in pursuit of reaching their mobility and environment goals for 2040 and onwards. Therefore, the Flemish government sees building pipeline infrastructure as an option for transport of liquid bulk goods in the Antwerp – Ruhr trajectory. Pipeline transport is considered as an environmental friendly transport mode, which also offers opportunities to relief the stress on the Flemish transport infrastructure. At present, several pipeline systems operate in this region, though (chemical) companies in Flanders and the Ruhr region request for additional pipelines and capacity. As of 2016 the Flemish government is researching the need and opportunities for additional pipeline infrastructure. <br/>This research contains a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) for assessing the potential gains of new pipeline infrastructure for liquid bulk goods in Flanders. Two types of CBAs are carried out, a social cost-benefit analysis (SCBA) and a financial cost-benefit analysis (FCBA). In the SCBA effects of the project are estimated that have an influence on society, this includes climate change costs, air pollution, but also safety and the loss of space due to the potential pipeline infrastructure. The FCBA addresses the financial viability of the pipeline project, including the investments costs of the project and operational costs among other project effects.<br/>In order to estimate several effects, such as the external effects of transport, the research developed an aggregate mode choice model with limited transport data. Mode choice models can be a tool to support substantiation of the estimated effects in the cost-benefit analysis. The objective is to develop a mode choice model that provides sufficient accuracy to estimate the effects of a cost-benefit analysis, with the limited amount of data and information at hand. <br/>The conducted SCBA concluded that pipeline transport can offer considerable reductions in terms of external effects of transport, which is beneficial for society. Still, there is an important social trade-off between the gains in terms of the reductions in external effects of transport and the effect of the pipeline infrastructure on nature and people. Furthermore, the FCBA shows multiple scenarios in which a competitive transport tariff can be offered to persuade a shift towards to pipeline transport.<br/>However, there is uncertainty to what extent a modal shift to pipeline transport will take place. The followed approach to estimate a mode choice model with limited aggregate data and even missing data can be suitable for exploratory research, still the required assumptions and missing data make the results of the mode choice model prone to under or overestimation of the modal shift. Therefore the main conclusion is that pipeline transport is a potential alternative, however more information and data is required to conclude that the pipeline infrastructure is a cost-efficient option, which is also the foremost recommendation.","cost-benefit analysis; aggregate mode choice model; pipeline transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Quantifying the carbon dioxide emission inefficiencies of flights versus transit is beneficial to understand the potential savings of a modal shift. In this paper, we analyze the emissions in Europe from multi-stop flights using flight data from March 2019. The excess emissions are quantified by comparing each multi-stop flight with an intermodal journey that does not exceed 60 minutes of extra travel time. We find that on average, transfer passengers using intermodality can reduce their journey’s total<br/>(segment) well-to-wheel and life-cycle assessment emissions by 33% (80%) and 30% (72%), respectively. 840 thousand (19 % of total) transfer passengers starting or ending their journey in Europe can skip the feeder flight while saving an average of 28 minutes of door-to-door travel time. For air travellers taking intra-European multi-stop flights, 157 thousand transfer passengers (10% of the total) do not have to even enter an airport. Further insights regarding the European mobility vision are made, with recommendations for various stakeholders.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Therefore, it will be increasingly challenging to provide sufficient RF resources. A novel alternative to RF communications is Visible Light Communication (VLC). VLC is a communication technology that uses visible light as an information carrier. The use of VLC for indoor applications has been rapidly growing during the last years – Light Fidelity (LiFi) technology is an example of VLC application – with photodiodes being the most widely used receiving devices. However, looking at both indoor and outdoor communication, photovoltaic (PV) cells represent a relevant alternative for detecting the information. One of the advantages of using a PV cell as receiver is the huge sensitive area for detection of the information that simplifies alignment between transmitter and receiver.<br/><br/>Different light sources can be used in VLC. Typically, either LEDs or LASERs are considered, depending on the characteristics of the link (such as distance, type of receiver, indoor/outdoor application). These light sources differ in terms of spectrum, directionality, optical power density and bandwidth. The performance of the whole VLC link strongly depends on the characteristics of the light source, since it affects the ability of the receiver, such as a PV-device, to detect the information when it overlaps with the ambient light, that can reach very high values, especially in outdoor applications where the ambient light is the sunlight. Therefore, the modelling and analysis of the performance of different light sources in a PV-based VLC link will pave the way towards the realisation of a PV-based communication system of the future; and it is the focus of this thesis project.<br/><br/>The project goals were achieved by first reviewing the characteristics of light sources, to understand their advantages and drawbacks in (PV-based) VLC. This was followed by the development of models of the VLC data-link, with a focus on the light source, which took into account various factors such as the type of light source, its location relative to the receiver, and its dynamic behaviour. This was followed by the realisation of a test setup, to characterise different light sources, and the models were then used to simulate the light distribution from the actual light sources. Finally, the framework was used to simulate a LED-based solar simulator and an outdoor VLC data-link.","Visible light communication; VLC; LED; PV Receiver","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-03-13","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

To increase the immersion and realism of these environments, several devices have been developed capable of rendering a wide range of haptic sensations. As humans mainly interact with objects using their hands, the main focus of research has been on developing devices capable of providing feedback to the hand and fingers. Currently, most of these devices only provide one form of feedback, either kinesthetic feedback to finger posture or tactile sensations in the form of pressing or skin stretching. These devices seldom provide more than one kind of feedback while remaining compact enough to be wearable with a natural range of motion of the hand. In this work, we present a device that combines an existing kinesthetic feedback glove with a novel tactile fingertip display. The haptic display consists of a cable-driven platform, powered by a stand-alone actuation module. It has been designed to be compact enough for a near-natural range of motion, with the possibility of multi-finger applications in mind. To validate the design, we conducted an experiment with 16 healthy young par- ticipants who were asked to reproduce virtual shapes with their index fingers after exploring those shapes under two different conditions: 1) with purely kinesthetic feedback, and 2) with kinesthetic feedback and tactile feedback. The outcome metrics were the exploration time, reproduction time, and reproduction error. For each testing condition, the workload and motivation of the participants were also evaluated. We found that participants had a lower reproduction error and used more time to reproduce the shapes with the novel haptic display enabled compared to purely kinesthetic feedback. We did not find significant differences in exploration time, workload, or motivation between testing conditions. Thus, the combined feedback provided by our novel device leads to better performance in shape reproduction compared to only kinesthetic feedback. Further, our device is lightweight and compact, potentially enabling multi-finger use which may lead to even greater performance and immersion in virtual object manipulation tasks.","Haptic; Tactile display","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-03-13","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Hybrid RANS-LES methods have become a popular numerical approach for a wide variety of flows. This is due to dissatisfaction with the RANS modelling paradigm in separated flows along with the prohibitive computational cost of pure LES, especially in wall-bounded flows at high Reynolds numbers. However, these methods are susceptible to the grey area problem, where the modeling approach is neither RANS nor LES: rather it is a region with an ambiguous modeling approach. In zonal approaches that function as embedded wall-modeled LES (WMLES), the transition from RANS to LES can be accelerated by improving the synthetic turbulence and its injection into the flow. In this work, a systemic assessment of the two aspects of zonal grey area mitigation methods was carried out. The synthetic turbulence was generated by the synthetic turbulence generator (STG) and injected into the flow using two different forcing terms. To ensure accurate second-order statistics of synthetic turbulence, a priori estimations of the bias error associated with a specific realization of a random number set were implemented and used. This resulted in smaller deviations between the statistics of the synthetic turbulence and the target Reynolds stresses. Furthermore, a modified synthetic turbulence forcing that ensures more accurate estimation of the total shear stress in close proximity to the RANS-LES interface was proposed. Moreover, a dynamic forcing that selectively enhances the production of underestimated Reynolds stresses was implemented and evaluated. These aspects resulted in a faster transition from RANS to LES in terms of both skin friction coefficients and Reynolds stresses. In addition, the WMLES capabilities of the subgrid length scale Δ˜&#x1d714; together with the subgrid-scale &#x1d70e;-model were explored. This work revealed that this combination is troublesome when used as embedded WMLES with synthetic turbulence, especially in stable flows. This is due to excessively decreased levels of eddy viscosity in the near-wall RANS region.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-04-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The hospital wants to provide their patients with more detailed information about when a patient is approximately scheduled to have a surgery. The first step is to create a model which optimises the operation room (OR) schedule and indicates when different kinds of surgeries are planned. This information, combined with the waiting list, provides insight in when a surgery of a specific patient is scheduled.<br/><br/>In a hospital, different departments work together to treat the patient as good and efficient as possible. If a patient needs a surgery, not only an OR is needed, but also a bed at a ward which matches the patient's needs. The goal of this thesis is to use the different resources of the hospital as efficiently as possible. This is done by not only optimising the utilisation of the OR, but at the same time levelling the bed occupancy of the different wards. The levelling of the bed occupancy is done by minimising the maximum number of used beds at each ward. Because, if we minimise the maximum, we force that the patients are spread out more evenly over the day.<br/><br/>For each specialty, the patients are divided into patient groups based on historical data using a constrained $k$-means clustering algorithm. For each patient group, information is gathered about the length of stay (LoS) and the surgery duration of patients in this patient group. Next to that, the number of patients in a patient group indicates how often a patient group needs to be scheduled at least.<br/><br/>The probability distribution of the surgery duration is taken into account when deciding at which day, at what time, and in which OR a surgery is planned. A patient group can only be scheduled during OR shifts assigned to the corresponding specialty. At the same time, the levelling of the bed occupancy is taken into account. <br/><br/>After some constraints are linearised, this model can be formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). However, the model has a large number of variables. Therefore, column generation is used to split the model into smaller subproblems per specialty. Some of the pricing subproblems take a lot of time to optimise. For that reason, we set some time limits both on the runtime of the pricing subproblems and the runtime of the entire algorithm. Column generation does not guarantee an optimal solution of our MILP. However, the objective value of our MILP improves over time, when new columns are added to the set of available columns. This indicates that column generation can be used to optimise our model.<br/><br/>In this thesis, several versions of the model are presented. For example, the schedule is different if the bed occupancy is calculated every hour or of every fifteen minutes. Next to that, the model can either be more focussed on maximising the OR utilisation or on levelling the bed occupancy.","Optimisation; Optimisation in healthcare; Column Generation; OR planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Electrification of the propulsion system is believed to offer promising avenues in achieving this reduction. Additionally, airlines operating these aircraft have to adapt their operations and network to optimally utilize these aircraft. This research presents a methodology for the coupled design of a hybrid-electric aircraft fleet with strategic airline planning to optimally serve a specific network. The objective is to maximize the airline profit and minimize the network CO2 emissions. Aircraft design trade-offs in payload, range and runway length will guide the creation of new aircraft until the optimal aircraft fleet is determined. The methodology is tested in a case study for the regional airline network of SATA Air Acores. The study investigates the impact of introducing new hybrid-electric aircraft designs in the fleet on the creation of new aircraft, the aircraft allocation and the network performance. By directly integrating hybrid-electric aircraft design (having a parallel hybrid architecture) with strategic airline planning, it is possible to reduce the network CO2emissions by -11% at the cost of an airline profit decrease of -13%. When including a climate optimization, an additional reduction of network CO2 emissions is achieved of -27% with a small additional decrease in profit of -1%. Network profitability and climate impact are mainly dictated by the fleet diversity and the assumed technology level of the batteries employed in the aircraft. This research highlights the importance of including climate optimization in the design of new aircraft and the need for more advanced hybrid-electric propulsion architectures (such as distributed propulsion systems) to further contribute to climate impact reduction.","Hybrid aircraft; Strategic Airline Planning; Climate Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Nowadays, Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) have been widely used in railway, with integrated Inertial Navigation System (INS)/Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) system as the common approach. For environments where GNSS signals become unavailable, additional aiding sources need to be considered to preserve the quality of measurement. Typically, in most applications, a Distance Measurement Indicator (DMI) is combined with the INS/GNSS system to ensure the desired accuracy. Nevertheless, as this approach is physically less feasible for railway, alternative solutions would be preferred. To bridge this gap, we investigate the applicability of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) integration with INS/GNSS for the case of a railway MMS. In particular, we aim to propose a solution for adapting a Monocular Visual (Inertial) SLAM method for railway application and further evaluate our solution using real-world data based on the RILA system (Fugro’s rail MMS). Accordingly, this dissertation consists of the following three research activities. <br/>Firstly, we have conducted a literature review on the existing monocular Visual Inertial SLAM methods to identify the technique which fulfils the key requirements of the rail application. Considering the results of the study, we selected the ORB-SLAM3 method and proposed an end-to-end pipeline that covers all the phases to adapt it for RILA system.<br/>Secondly, the impact of adapting ORB-SLAM3 technique on performance of the trajectory estimation has been evaluated using two criteria: Absolute Position Error (APE) and Relative Position Error (RPE). Accordingly, a case study using RILA dataset was developed for the experimental evaluations. In this case study, we have simulated a scenario in which the train entered the station, stayed there stationary for 1 minute, and then left the station slowly and manually inserted GNSS blockages before and after the station. Furthermore, a ground-truth trajectory was generated to evaluate the quality of the estimated SLAM-based trajectory. The results revealed that both APE and RPE increases with significant fluctuations in the first 15 seconds due to the lack of SLAM initialization time. Therefore, we introduced an strategy for fine-tuning the accuracy by allocating sufficient time for SLAM initialization phase. The APE and RPE were significantly reduced after fine-tuning and the expected estimated error at each time was equal to 4.3% of the travelled path length.<br/>Finally, we presented the effect of using Zero Velocity Update (ZUPT) signals as aiding information on the accuracy of the estimated trajectory in the areas with poor GNSS coverage. Consequently, we manually inserted the extracted ZUPT signals to the INS/GNSS integration process and then compared the positional accuracy of the generated trajectories with and without this information. The results show that the estimated positional accuracy was improved by 30% with only 51 seconds of stationary condition in our case study.<br/>Overall, based on the obtained results from the evaluations, it is possible to claim that our proposed ORB-SLAM3 technique has great potential to improve the estimated positional accuracy and in particular can be used as a standalone ZUPT detector in railway application.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Surgery may be required in patients with acute or chronic AR, aortic root disease or ascending aortic dissection. A viable alternative to traditional aortic valve replacement that offers encouraging clinical outcomes is aortic valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR). However, reoperation due to recurrent or residual AR has a high incidence. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the gold standard for intraoperatively evaluating residual AR. Evaluation is performed after aortic declamping; therefore, a longer bypass time is inevitable when additional repair is required. Furthermore, quantification of AR with TEE can be challenging. Therefore, the need for an early and quantitative assessment method rises. The main objective of this study was to identify the relationship between the intraoperative and quantitative assessment of the repaired aortic valve and the post-declamping echocardiographic assessment after VSRR. Echocardiographic parameters were studied to find the optimal parameter to identify this relationship. Furthermore, variables that influence the amount of leakage in the quantitative and intraoperative assessment of the repaired valve were identified. Two in vitro experiments were performed to investigate the contribution of these variables to the leakage of sufficient and insufficient aortic valves.<br/><br/><b>Experiment 1 </b>The effective regurgitant orifice area was the optimal parameter to obtain the relationship between echocardiographic and quantitative assessment. It was implemented in an experimental setup as the orifice area. In addition to this parameter, the contribution of the orifice shape, pressure and fluid viscosity to the leakage was examined using a custom representation of the ascending aorta and the aortic valve. The orifice area was shown to have the most significant contribution to the amount of leakage, followed by the pressure and shape of the orifice. These three variables will be assessed in a second experiment. The viscosity of the fluid did not influence the leakage. <br/><br/><b>Experiment 2 </b>In a second experiment, the contribution of different variables to sufficient and insufficient aortic valves was evaluated at different pressures. The experiment was carried out in three cardiac tissues, in which first the contributions to the baseline leakage of a sufficient valve were evaluated. Two methods were used to create insufficiency. The first involved a punch and the second applied a more physiological approach of leaflet manipulation. The graft water permeability and the anastomosis leakage determined the leakage in a sufficient aortic valve state. The leakage of an insufficient aortic valve was almost completely determined by the size of the insufficiency. Graft permeability and anastomosis leakage could be neglected in the insufficient valve state. The leakage of the punched valve was comparable to the expected regurgitant volume based on the echocardiographic guidelines for that area. Leaflet manipulation resulted in less leakage than expected.<br/><br/><b>Conclusion </b>The contribution of several variables to the leakage of sufficient and insufficient aortic valves was investigated in two in vitro experiments. The results of this study show that the contributions of each of these variables could be quantified. As a result, the leakage of an insufficient aortic valve could be quantified in a static, pressurised in vitro setting. This is the first step in obtaining the relationship between the quantitative amount of leakage and echocardiography, to improve intraoperative assessment of the repaired aortic valve after VSRR.","Aortic regurgitation; Quantification; Intraoperative; Valve-sparing root replacement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine","",""

Four technology types are examined: face-to-face, online, hybrid or blended, and video learning. Policy makers who wish to weigh user preferences and acceptance of educational technology types will find they may better address, for example, the transition from school to hybrid work, as well as mitigate the shortage of teaching hours within The Netherlands. Acceptance is operationalized as ‘behavioral intention’ to use a technology type. However, models of acceptance cannot determine whether students and schools would successfully adopt these forms of learning (or technology types) after implementation, regardless of their reliability in measuring factors like BI/ATT, PE, or PEOU. Limited research has been conducted locally and nationally; literature case studies typically measure one or two learning forms. Moreover, theory suggests that, if a (learning) technology is accepted, then successful adoption is likely. Therefore, I aim to explore “To what extent do Dutch students of middle and higher education, ages 16-25, prefer and will theoretically accept different educational technology types?” This study employs a quantitative survey to rank learning preferences and assess its acceptance via a modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). This study intends to propose an emergence preference model (EPM) composed of a modified technology acceptance model (mTAM) to challenge the theoretical concept of preference as a robust measure to supply statistical information in support of acceptance studies. The model was validated with PLS-SEM, and the results were delimited by the modified TAM. The results showed secondary school students prefer Face-to-face learning while university students’ preference is well distributed. The reasons for these technological preferences were comprehensive and well explained by chosen acceptance factors. The preference of student’s technology for each acceptance factor was key to showing this relation. Therefore, user preference and user acceptance indeed provide comprehensive knowledge to decision makers who consider weighing acceptance.","Dutch high school students; Dutch secondary students; education; Technology Acceptance Model (TAM); technology types; user acceptance; user preference","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-30","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

When you arrive you try to spot them in a room filled with people, but your view is blurred which disables you from recognizing your friends. How would this make you feel? People that are blind or have low vision (PBLV) are all around us and can be found in any context of life. Just like sighted people, they feel the need to attend to social situations. However, socially navigating themselves, meaning finding and navigating toward familiar people around them, can be more challenging for them due to missing sight. <br/><br/>Literature describes that having a visual impairment can greatly impact your social life (Brunes et al., 2019; Desrosiers et al., 2009; Grow et al., 2015; OehlerGiarratana &amp; Fitzgerald, 1980). This was confirmed by PBLV, during interviews that were executed in advance of the project. There seems to be a gap in exploring how design could help PBLV with the challenges they experience in their social life. With a participatory approach, this project attempts to contribute to filling this gap. During the project, the goal was to ‘develop a supporting device that makes PBLV feel more at ease in social situations’.<br/><br/>Interviews and shadowing sessions with PBLV, and a literature study resulted in the definition of eight areas where PBLV experience challenges in their social life. Together with studying the technological developments in the field of social life of PBLV, resulted in composing the design goal to: ‘Design a tool that allows PBLV to improve personal social navigation. Helping them to find and identify familiar people around them in social settings.’<br/><br/>With this design goal and the conducted research in mind, the conceptualization phase followed. During this phase several concepts were generated, (rapid) prototypes were created, and additional tests and studies were executed. Knowledge gathered from this phase resulted in the design of the final concept called ‘Sofi’.<br/><br/>‘Sofi’, the social finder, is an application and add-on for the Apple Watch which supports PBLV in their social navigation. It does so via communicating the identity, and location of familiar others nearby through vibrations. In addition, it helps PBLV to navigate towards these familiar others when desired.<br/><br/>Based on prototyping and testing elements of the final concept, and gathering feedback from PBLV, ‘Sofi’ seems to be a promising concept that could have potential for further development. The findings of this project, in particular, the research on social challenge areas for PBLV, and the design exploration can contribute to the knowledge of using design to help PBLV tackle the challenges they experience in their social life.","Inclusive Design; Blind; Low Vision; Social Navigation; Social Life","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double degree in: Design for Interaction | Medisign and Integrated Product Design | Medisign","","","","","","Design for Interaction | Medisign","",""

A publication from CBS found that 41% of the asylum holders who came to the Netherlands in 2014 had a job after five and a half years. In addition, newcomers, more than non-newcomers, have a temporary contract or work part-time (2021b). Although there is a shortage in the labour market (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek, 2022a), newcomers do not always seem to profit there. <br/><br/>OpenEmbassy, the client for this thesis, researched the subject in Rotterdam and found several insights contributing to the problem. For instance, newcomers perceive informal work as more accessible than formal work (2021). Moreover, a significant driver is the minimal financial difference between a formal job and the social assistance benefit (OpenEmbassy, 2021). <br/><br/>The problem of the non-accessible labour market for newcomers can be described as complex (Snowden &amp; Boone, 2007). This project explores the complexity of the labour and integration system while focussing on the individual needs of newcomers and municipal civil servants. The approach is a combination of the double diamond approach (Design Council, 2019), combined with elements of Vision in Design (Hekkert &amp; van Dijk, 2011), the use of an interaction vision (Pasman et al., 2011) and various mapping explorations.<br/><br/>The research consists of OpenEmbassy’s analysis, including insights from twelve interviews. Furthermore, additional literature research, seven in-depth interviews and thirteen street interviews contributed to the insights. A deeper analysis resulted in journey maps and thirteen driving forces from clustering interview quotes, supported by the literature research and synthesised in three frames or design directions. Directly discussing informal work with someone from the municipality can cause trouble. The newcomer may get a fine or be seen as a fraudster, or the municipal officer is summoned because of not reporting it and not thus not following the legislation. <br/><br/>Thus, the design direction resulted in the following design statement:<br/><br/>The design intervention wants to make talking about the underlying reasons for informal work more accessible by creating a more symmetrical and trusted relationship between municipal officers and newcomers. <br/><br/>The design statement resulted in Werkkaart, a card set municipal officers can use with newcomers. The intervention has as its primary goal to make the conversation more symmetrical and to create shared ownership, starting from the game’s main rule. Both players choose cards to shape the conversation, during meetings at the municipality. Werkkaart does not tackle informal work directly but purposely indirectly. The design consists of 45 cards, categorised into eight themes, an appointment booklet with an opportunity card, a manual and a gameboard. The cards’ content comes from different inputs, of which the framework of OpenEmbassy (2019) based on Strang et al. (2019) forms the base. Fifteen participants evaluated Werkkaart and noted, among other insights, that the physicality of the cards supports ownership in the conversation.","Integration; Newcomers; Cardset; Informal work; Policy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In Amsterdam, the number and intensity of surveillance cameras in public spaces, such as streets, parks, and plazas, have reportedly increased, even in locations where they were already well-established. In addition to the growing number of cameras, they are now appearing in new contexts, such as billboards, and in new forms, such as those equipped with ANPR technology. As a result, individuals in urban areas are likely to have their images captured multiple times daily as they engage in routine activities in public spaces. While the installation of these cameras is purported to serve various purposes, such as deterring crime, prosecuting criminals retroactively, and making people feel safer, significant concerns have been raised about the potential for their irresponsible use, including concerns about the violation of individuals’ privacy, potential threat to civil liberties, and unjustified purpose of using cameras. <br/><br/>The current master's graduation project aims to comprehensively understand the responsible use of surveillance cameras through three phases of empirical investigations. The first phase seeks a deeper comprehension of the broader socio-technical context within which surveillance cameras are situated. Through expert interviews, two theoretical mapping representations of the context have been generated. Next, the second phase aims to comprehend the responsible use of surveillance cameras by understanding the values of key stakeholders, in which a set of value similarities and tensions among key stakeholders have been identified through a stakeholder survey study. Finally, the last phase of this project aims to develop a comprehensive set of evaluation criteria for the assessment of a broad spectrum of design concepts that pertain to the responsible use of surveillance cameras in urban public spaces.","surveillance camera; responsible use; public space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In partially automated order picking systems, such challenges and opportunities exist regarding human factors implementation in the job-shop scheduling problem, an optimisation problem essential in operations. Workplace fatigue is a human factor often overlooked in scheduling research and application, despite hurting employees’ well-being and costing U.S. employers up to €127 billion annually. With the opportunities that automation offers, cobotic order picking systems could actively consider human fatigue development, mitigating its negative effects in operation.<br/>This thesis investigates the possibility and potential benefits of fatigue consideration in the job-shop scheduling problem for a partially automated order picking system. We present a new bi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming problem formulation to represent system constraints and a predictive fatigue model while considering worker fatigue and productivity during schedule optimisation. To put the results of simulated optimisation in perspective, we experimentally validate the fatigue model predictions and fatigue mitigation capabilities of the scheduling approach using heart rate measurements and qualitative fatigue ratings. These experiments occur with employees in a real-life partially automated order picking system.<br/>Our mathematical model can find solutions that the conventional single-objective optimisation approach cannot, allowing fractional energy expenditure distribution improvements more than 4x larger than the decrease in productivity they require in 53% of the considered virtual cases. This is a promising result for fatigue mitigation in operations only by altering operational decision-making. However, the validation experiments show that our predictive fatigue model has an average RMSE of 2.20 kcal/min in estimating energy expenditure rates compared to heart rate measurements while also showing a low correlation. When assessing 10 minute intervals, a time span that fits a scheduling scope, the estimations improve slightly (avg. deviation of -1.85 kcal/min, avg. correlation of 0.17) but still underestimate the measured values. The experiments also show no significant differences in experienced fatigue between existing schedules and those with fatigue mitigation measures applied.<br/>We conclude that the current scheduling formulation is not yet fit for application with a predictive fatigue model. However, real-life operations can benefit from energy expenditure estimation via heart rate measurements and a different approach for implementation is proposed. Research opportunities lie in further fatigue model development and validation, extension to indirect fatigue effects and other human factors, and further development of the mathematical formulation.","Order picking; Job-shop scheduling problem; Human factors; Mixed Integer Non Linear Programming; Occupational fatigue; Cobotic order picking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Global warming has caused an increasing demand for renewable energy. Currently, 50% of the renewable energy is provided by wind and solar combined. However, these renewable energy sources are highly volatile. Wave energy converters can provide a stable renewable energy source. Previous research has contributed to understanding various combined effects of length, aspect ratio, hydro-elasticity and PTO damping on the optimisation of peak power absorption for regular waves. However, research on optimising the combined effects on annual energy production and especially power stability is missing. This thesis aims to better understand these effects by answering the following research question: ""How can the combined effects of total length, aspect ratio, raft stiffness and PTO damping influence yearly energy conversion and energy stability of a pitching raftWEC""<br/><br/>To do this, a novel formulation for a monolithic finite element model containing Timoshenko beam theory and Linear potential flow is developed. This FEM consists of a two-dimensional domain, where the water is excited by linear irregular waves. The wave energy converter is modelled as two floating Timoshenko beams connected by a damped joint. The model is verified by proving that the solution converges according to the polynomial order +1 for decreasingmesh size. Additionally, it is proven that energy is conserved which shows that there is no wave reflection resulting from the domain boundaries. Finally, the model is validated by comparing the results of the structure with and without joint to previous research. <br/><br/>Two experiments are developed to understand the combined effects. Initially, an eigenmode analysis of the undamped structure is performed. This gives insight into the influence of individual parameters on the eigenfrequencies and shapes. Moreover, the real eigenmodes are used to decompose the real part of the complex resonance shapes of the relative rotation response amplitude operator (RAO). This provides a coupling between the performance according to the relative rotation RAO and the eigenmodes and frequencies. A limitation of this method is that phase differences cannot be considered. <br/>The second experiment maximises the annual energy conversion and energy stability of thewave energy converter with three sets of variable parameters: (total length, aspect ratio, damping parameter), (total length, symmetrical raft stiffness, damping parameter) and (stiffness fore-aft, stiffness aft-raft, damping parameter). This is done in three steps. First, the RAO for the relative rotation at the joint is constructed. This is converted to a power spectrum. Secondly, the power spectrum is scaled by the JONSWAP energy density spectra. These<br/>spectra are constructed using the annual wave conditions, significant wave heights and peak periods from a wave scatter diagram. Subsequently, the results per spectrum are scaled by the number of occurrences of the wave conditions to obtain the annual energy conversion. Third, The optimum damping parameter per configuration is determined by calculating the annual energy conversion for a set of damping parameters. These results are interpolated to select the damping parameter that maximises annual energy conversion.<br/>Finally, the performance of each configuration with their respective optimum damping parameter is assessed on annual energy conversion and capture width per peak wave period to give insight into the energy conversion and stability. The optimisation results are clarified with the results of the eigenmode analysis.<br/>It was found that the optimal total length, considering raft stiffness, aspect ratio and PTO damping can be determined by matching the dimensionless wavelength corresponding to the third mode, and the annual significant wavelength.<br/><br/>Furthermore, It is proven that an aspect ratio of 0.2 to 0.3 increases the performance in high-frequency waves without compromising on low-frequency waves. The capture width is more evenly distributed over peak wave periods, indicating a higher energy stability. This results in an increase of annual energy conversion of 31% with respect to an aspect ratio of 0.5. Besides the aspect ratio, it was found that an asymmetrical raft stiffness, with a moderately flexible fore raft and a rigid aft-raft increase energy stability without compromising annual energy conversion.","Wave energy converters; WEC; Optimisation energy; Hydro elasticity; hydro-elasticity; Eigenvalue analysis; eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition; Annual energy conversion; Energy stability; FEM; Finite element model; Gridap; energy conversion; Irregular waves; Annual optimisation; Frequency domain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Tsouvalas, A. (mentor); Sánchez Gómez, S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The demand for wind energy has led to the need for larger offshore wind turbines, which require larger monopiles for support. Vibratory pile driving is a common technique for installing these monopiles, but current engineering models are designed for smaller diameter monopiles and may not be applicable to larger ones. Additionally, the vibratory action produced by counter-rotating eccentric masses in the hammer can cause unintended bending motions in the pile if there is a slight misalignment. This study aimed to investigate the effects of gear misalignment on the response of monopiles under vibratory action, including these imperfections.<br/><br/>To achieve this, a hammer model was created and coupled with a pile model and a simplified soil reaction. A parametric study was conducted to evaluate the pile response to the modeled vibratory hammer with imperfections over a range of specified variables. The transfer of force from the hammer to the pile and the range of driving frequencies that activate the isolation springs in the vibratory hammer were examined, as well as the effect of misalignments on the power consumption of the vibratory hammer and the bending displacements caused by these misalignments.<br/><br/>The study found that there was no significant impact on axial vibrations as a result of misalignment of rotating masses. <br/><br/>The force transfer ratio from hammer to pile is 0.5 to 0.7 for smaller diameter piles, and it is important to include force transfer ratios in simple engineering models during the initial design phase of pile drivability prediction models when the decision is made not to model the hammer.<br/><br/>The study also showed that modeling the hammer-pile-soil system with shell elements instead of 1D rod elements yields similar trends in the responses, but the absolute response values of large diameter piles with simple 1D rod elements leads to an underestimation of the response in the lower driving frequency range and an overestimation in the higher driving frequency range.<br/><br/>Even if as much as 50% of the eccentric masses are misaligned, the impact of bending vibrations on the power consumption of the vibratory hammer is insignificant. However, bending displacement can become substantial when 6% of the eccentric masses are misaligned. Smaller diameter piles are more susceptible to vibrations at lower frequency ranges, while larger diameters are impacted in higher frequency ranges. <br/><br/>Only large diameter monopiles are susceptible to axial vibrations near their natural frequencies, while all diameter piles are affected by bending vibrations near their natural frequencies.<br/><br/>Isolator springs are effectively activated in the region of higher driving frequencies (&gt; 28 Hz) for large diameter monopiles. In the case of small diameter piles (&lt; 3 m), the relative motion between suppressor housing and pile head remained above unity for all driving frequencies, meaning poor activation of the isolator springs.<br","offshore monopiles; vibratory pile driving; dynamic response; gear misalignment; engineering models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","",""

(mentor); de Vries, G. (graduation committee); Jeurink, Prescilla (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The livestock sector accounts for 14-15% of the global greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the current meat consumption patterns are associated with multiple health risks and are unsustainable in the long term. Therefore, the shift to a more plant-based diet and reduced animal-source intake is desired from a societal perspective. One attempt to fuel this evolution is the new wave of meat alternatives that are designed to successfully replace meat in everyday meals. However, the current market share of meat alternatives in the Netherlands remains around 4.5%. Section 1 demonstrates that in-depth knowledge about the heterogeneity of Dutch consumer preferences regarding meat alternatives is currently lacking. This thesis contributes to identifying the sources of consumer heterogeneity regarding meat alternatives, focusing on both product-related attributes and person-related characteristics. In addition, this thesis explores and proposes strategies for the manufacturers of meat alternatives with the knowledge of consumer heterogeneity in the Netherlands. The main research question defined for this thesis is: What are the consumer profiles of the sub-segments within the potential meat alternative adopter segment, and what trade-offs do those segments make when choosing between meat and meat alternatives? As explained in Section 2, A Latent Class Choice Model (LCCM) is estimated to examine the trade-offs made when choosing between meat alternatives and conventional meat by individuals from the different consumer segments of Dutch society. Sociodemographics and psychographics are included in this model to identify the consumer profiles of these segments. The LCCM is estimated using data derived from an online stated choice experiment. In this experiment, respondents were asked to choose between two vegetarian mince options that varied in Eco-score, Nutri-score, price, taste, texture, appearance and animal-welfare label. These attributes were identified through a literature review presented in Section 3 and validated by means of a focus group. To examine the trade-offs that are made when choosing between conventional mince and vegetarian mince, one base alternative was added to each choice set that represented the average conventional mince. The person-related characteristics were selected based on the literature review of Section 3 and measured using 5-Point Likert-scales. The product-related attributes were combined to present unique alternatives based on an experimental design, as demonstrated in Section 4. The choice situations were designed to be as real as possible by presenting them as online shopping experiences. Filter questions were added to ensure that the sample population consisted of only potential adopters of meat alternatives. In total 260 complete valid responses were collected as demonstrated in Section 5. The psychographics were aggregated into 9 factors through explanatory factor analysis. The 9 resulting factors are pro-meat attitude, foodneophilia, pro-meat-alternative attitude, sustainable behaviour, foodneophobia, health consciousness, environmental concern, pro-animal attitude and preparation skills. By comparing the LCCM estimation with a multinomial logit model that completely ignores consumer heterogeneity as shown in Section 6, there can be concluded that heterogeneity exists in meat alternative preferences. Heterogeneity was best captured by estimating a three-class LCCM. The resulting classes presented in Section 7 are Price Sensitive Consumers, Health and Environment Lovers and Taste Driven Consumers. The Price Sensitive Consumers segment is unique due to the high relative importance of the price and the non-linear relationships of utility with both the Eco-score and the Nutri-score. The individuals from this segment are generally meat avoiders, students and do not have a pro-animal attitude. The preferences of the Health and Environment Lovers segment stand out because of the high importance of the Eco-score and the Nutri-score, and the low importance of taste. Individuals from this segment tend to be meat avoiders or reducers, have a university Master’s or PhD background, have a pro-animal attitude, have high objective knowledge and score low on foodneophobia. The last segment is the Taste Driven Consumers segment, this segment is only sensitive to the taste and appearance of an alternative. This segment consists predominantly of omnivores with lower educational backgrounds, individuals with low objective knowledge, foodneophobic individuals and individuals who disagree with a pro-animal attitude. In Section 8, product alteration strategies and marketing advice is proposed. In addition, a threefold of foreseeable futures are explored with expected market shares, revenues and environmental impact. If the Price Sensitive Consumers segment is chosen as the target segment, it is advised to keep the selling prices low, keep the Nutri-score above C and the Eco-score above D. In addition, it is advised to produce products that qualify for a future animal-welfare label. Marketing experts should focus on tailoring their marketing to reach the student population and aim marketing at improving objective knowledge. When targeting the Health and Environment Lovers, it is advised to optimize both the Eco-score and the Nutri-score. In addition, it is advised to keep the price low. Marketing strategies should aim at highlighting what makes a certain alternative unique as compared to other alternatives. Furthermore, it is advised to frame the alternatives as exciting and new and accentuate the animal-friendly benefits of the product. When deciding on the Taste Driven Consumers segment, it is advised to focus on producing alternatives that taste and look similar to meat. As for marketing strategies, it is advised to take the foodneophobic character of this segment into account and aim at familiarizing the individuals with meat alternatives. To conclude, there are three segments within the Dutch potential adopters of meat alternative segment. All three segments have different preferences when it comes to meat alternatives. Therefore, manufacturers of meat alternatives should decide on which of the three segments they want to target and alter their products and marketing strategies accordingly. Further research recommendations based on the current study are 1) further investigating the influence of psychographic characteristics on consumer heterogeneity regarding meat alternatives, 2) identifying the potential adopters of meat alternatives segment in the Netherlands 3) determining the generalizability of these findings to other meat alternatives and 4) developing detailed marketing strategies based on the finding of this research.","Choice Modelling; Latent Class Choice Model (LCCM); Meat alternatives; Consumer segmentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Here, we conduct a local field experiment comparing two plots in a maize field, one treated plot with added sheep excrement and one untreated plot as control plot. Results show twice as large grain yield for the treated plot, while observed soil moisture levels are not significantly different between the two plots. The behaviour of water in the maize field is analysed with a water balance model, which reproduces the overall dynamics of soil water storage, but overestimates peaks in response to precipitation events. The model confirms that soil water levels remain well above the wilting point in both plots during the growing season. The measured soil moisture is also used to calibrate an AquaCrop model, which is an FAO crop model giving yield outputs. The crop output of the AquaCrop model shows no difference between a field with and without manure, indicating again that soil moisture in this case is not the determining factor for yield differences found in the field experiments. A possible explanation for the difference in yield is the release of nutrients from the manure throughout the season, which were not yet captured in the soil sampling. Besides that, no dry spells occurred during the growing season, so the effects on a real dry soil could not be measured. A multi-criteria analysis is used to assess the suitability of rainwater harvesting solutions that are suitable for smallholder farmers in northern Ghana. It is found that multiple in-situ and micro-scale rainwater harvesting technologies are suitable, like deep tillage, adding manure and conservation agriculture. It should be noted that having the required knowledge to apply these rainwater harvesting technologies successfully is essential.<br","Rainwater harvesting; Smallholder farmers; northern Ghana","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Resources Engineering","","9.400710, -1.002100"

This work explores the integration of such manufacturing in automated secondary robotic food packaging solutions that transfer food products into containers using pick-and-place robots. A major problem in these solutions is varying product supply caused by prior machinery. As a result productivity drops drastically when conveyor belt speeds are not optimally controlled. Conventional heuristic-based engineered approaches are used to address this issue but are inadequate, leading to noncompliance with industry's requirements. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, has the potential of solving this problem by learning quick and predictive decision-making behavior based on experience. However, the lack of research in reinforcement learning for complex industrial robotic problems, limits its adoption in industry. Therefore, this work aims to investigate the feasibility of reinforcement learning in the robotic packaging industry. We propose a reinforcement learning framework, with policy inference in a highly complex control scheme, designed to optimize the conveyor belt speed of the secondary robotic packaging solution using real-world product supply data. The framework exceeds the 99.8 percent performance requirement and maintains quality at the required 100 percent when tested on real-world data. Compared to the current heuristic-based solution, our proposed framework improves productivity, has smoother control and reduces code execution time.","Reinforcement Learning; Intelligent Control; Intelligent Manufacturing; Food Packaging Industry; Conveyor Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-03-02","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

Due to public opinion and political pressure, the airport is challenged to improve its sustainability. Since the airport relies heavily on hub-connected flights and has public transport nearby, integrating the buses and trains can help enhance the hub-and-spoke model of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. <br/><br/>The client is investigated to understand the direction of the outcome. Internal analysis of the company revealed that the airport aims to be the most high-quality airport in the world (Schiphol Group, 2021). To achieve this, the company offers commodities that are (related to) infrastructure and facilities that support this infrastructure. With this, the company mainly relies on digitally supported services. This report concludes that facilitating what is within the transfer is the responsibility of RSG as per their current expertise. Additionally, the company's collaborations show they are committed to knowledge exchange and new business insights, including politics, proving they are ""business creators."" As a result, this project is shaped around these skills.<br/><br/>To understand how to create seamless passenger transfers, the problem is investigated. The literature review revealed that factors influence passengers' transfer experience: information and signage, distance, ticketing services, safety and security, special services, cleanliness and maintenance, commercial services, baggage services, and environment. To achieve high quality, the passenger has to perceive these as high quality. The research revealed that the less cognitive effort a passenger needs with the factor, the more seamless the travel is. With this in mind, the status quo of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is understood via an explorative research approach. This graduation zoomed into the bi-modal product offered by KLM and Thalys. <br/><br/>The information and ticketing services must be improved for quality improvement within the current product. By looking at the offer at three comparable airport hubs, insights into the factors influencing the passenger experience have been gained. After an iteration of these ideas, evaluation sessions are held with internal stakeholders to make the ideas impactful and feasible. A session with KLM is held to evaluate the ideas. The evaluation sessions are analyzed to get a deeper understanding of the ideas. The ideas are put on three horizons, each based on priority. As for implementation, the airport depends on the airlines and train operators; the strategy for success is to create a clear, quick and easily implementable plan. To achieve this, the plan describes responsible parties. The ideas are put on three horizons, each based on priority:<br/>1. Improvements to the current system.<br/>2. Seizing the full potential of the current systems.<br/>3. Changing the system<br/>The ideas are: creating an online boarding pass, putting the departure terminal on the boarding pass, and creating a video to explain the transfer. Integrating the applications will be done, and digital wayfinding will be more feasible later. <br/>The implementation roadmap explains the steps to create more seamless bi-modal passenger transfers. There are two strategies: either waiting for adoption or promoting adoption.<br/><br/>This thesis describes the process for improving the bi-modal journey at AMS and concludes with an implementation roadmap, a conclusion, discussion, limitations, and recommendations.","intermodal; interchanges; hub; transit; air-rail","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); de Jong, W. (graduation committee); Cutz, L. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The global temperature rise has pushed governments more into finding ways to reduce CO2 emissions, by increasing the use of renewable fuels. Lignocellulosic biomass (wood, forest residues, agricultural residues) is a renewable fuel that has still not been utilized to its full potential. That is because it lacks properties such as homogeneity, high volumetric energy density and low moisture that its main fossil fuel competitor -coal- has. Therefore, a type of pre-treatment is needed for these disadvantages. Torrefaction, a process of heating biomass (200-300 oC) in an inert environment (no combustion), provides a product with improved physicochemical properties: reduced hydrophobicity, easier grindability, homogeneity, reduced microbial activity and increased calorific value. However, it is not enough to torrefy the biomass, as it needs to be densified in order to be utilized. With the process of pelletizing, a type of densification, torrefied biomass becomes compact and can be considered as bio-coal. While pelletizing is influenced by many parameters (moisture content, die pressure, torrefaction temperature etc), herbaceous types of biomass such as wheat straw, hay, reeds and grass, still cannot produce quality pellets without the addition of a binder. Typical organic binders such as starch, lignin and sawdust can either be expensive or biologically degrade in storage conditions. That is why addition of plastic binder should be considered. The aim of this report was to investigate how quality torrefied pellets from herbaceous biomass can be produced with the addition of plastic binder in a commercial capacity. Wheat straw and woodchips were used as feedstock, while polyethylene resin was the plastic binder. The biomasses were torrefied at 240 oC and 270 oC on the Torrgreen facilities, via a pilot-scale packed bed reactor, which recycles the volatiles from torrefaction for inertization and pelletized with a 100 kg/h pellet mill. For the torrefied wheat straw, a design of experiments was formed, to investigate how 4 parameters for pelletizing (torrefaction temperature, moisture content, plastic binder addition and pellet diameter) improved mechanical durability. Results indicated that 5% of plastic improved durability and pellet formation in total, while higher torrefaction temperature weakens the pellets and aggravates pellet formation. The highest durability achieved was 90.3%. Torrefied wood chips were pelletized for reference and showed low durability, mostly due to inability of the pelletizer. Water immersion tests on the straw pellets showed that higher torrefaction temperature increased hydrophobicity a lot, while plastics also had a positive effect. Comparison of the straw pellets produced with conventional wood pellets revealed that the former lack in mechanical durability and are high in ash content, making them incompliant with current standards. Overall, inclusion of plastics in pelletizing of torrefied herbaceous biomass, demonstrated very positive results and improved their quality, while making the operation smoother, but for scaling up and keeping the whole process sustainable a polyethylene (or other plastic) waste stream should be utilized.","Torrefaction; herbaceous biomass; Pellets; plastic binder; torrefied pellets","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While many engineering problems still need to be solved for such a mission to succeed, research has shown that futuristic, theoretical photon-sail configurations can reach the Alpha Centauri system within 75-80 years while also getting captured in a bound orbit about one of the binary stars. This paper investigates trajectories from the binary star system towards planet Proxima b. A mission to Proxima b is scientifically grounded since measurements or pictures could help us better comprehend the evolution of rocky planets and potential life-formation in our Universe. The classical Lagrange points in the binary system (AC-A/AC-B) and the system Proxima Centauri-Proxima b (AC-C/Proxima b) are used to find possible trajectories towards Proxima b. The transfer is divided into a departure phase from AC-A/AC-B and an arrival phase to AC-C/Proxima b. Heteroclinic connections are then exploited using a patched restricted three-body problem method to connect the two phases. A grid search is applied on the optimization parameters to explore the design space, after which a genetic algorithm is applied to further optimize the link, focusing on minimization of the position, velocity, and time error at linkage. Futuristic sail configurations are used, including double-sided reflective sails and lightness numbers up to ß = 1779. The design space exploration shows that a double-sided sail provides little improvement over a one-sided sail, mainly due to the constant sail attitude along the trajectories. Results from the genetic algorithm show that a transfer from the L2-point in the AC-A/AC-B system to the L1-point in the AC-C/Proxima b can be accomplished with a transfer time of 235 years for the one-sided graphene-based sail with a surface of 315x315 m^2 carrying a payload of 10 grams. A transfer from the L2-point in the AC-A/AC-B system to the L3-point in the AC-C/Proxima b, with a smaller one-sided graphene-based sail (75x75 m^2, carrying a payload of 10 grams), results in a transfer time of 1025 years. For both sail configurations, the position error at linkage is kept below 1% of the total travel distance, the velocity error below 1% of the velocity at linkage, and the time error below 1% of the total transfer time.","Photon sailing; Alpha Centauri; Heteroclinic connections; Interstellar travel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The library's functionalities cover model implementation, trim and linearization, model reductions, identification of the modal parameters, and finally, the evaluation of the requirements. The library takes a semi 'black-box' approach toward the model structure, relying on defining it through a set of functions instead of parameters. With that, it can accommodate various sources and formulations of the model. The library was successfully validated on two different aircraft models. Part of the validation was replicating some of the previous Flying-V handling qualities research data.

In recent years, turbidity has increased here with 0.5 to 3% per year between 1990 and 2010, corresponding to a doubling of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) within 24 years for the upper bound of 3%. This trend is mainly attributed to a decrease in the amount of sediment sinks. The Ems-Dollart 2050 program aims to address this issue by exploring various solutions, aiming to extract one million tons of dry matter from the estuary per year. This study investigates the potential of creating additional sediment sinks by scaling up managed realignment polders. The aim of the research is:<br/><br/>To investigate the important factors of influence for sediment capturing efficiency in a managed realignment polder, to make the mud extraction from a turbid estuary as efficient as possible while creating new natural and agricultural value.<br/><br/>Using the Delft3D FM numerical model, the study focuses on two key factors that influence sediment capturing, namely the effects of the surface area and the effect of the tidal prism (i.e. the volume of water that flows into an area during a tidal cycle), with the goal of making sediment extraction from the turbid estuary as efficient as possible. The study finds that the general concept of using a managed realignment polder to extract sediment is viable. However, the calibration process using Polder Breebaart revealed that the model struggled to accurately replicate some of the accumulation patterns in the low-dynamic system in this polder. While the model seems more appropriate for the project area, significant uncertainty remains due to the sensitivity of the results to sediment properties and calibration parameters.<br/><br/>The study's results suggest that a smaller tidal range can result in a more uniform sediment distribution across the area. This can be achieved by implementing a submerged weir behind the open entrance to the area. An even distribution of sediment could enhance the natural values in the intertidal area, which is a key goal of the Ems-Dollart 2050 program. In addition, wind-generated waves appear to have a major influence on the distribution of sediment over the area. Due to the extra shear stresses, waves provide more resuspension, which transports the sediment further.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the study observes a significant accumulation of sediment in a side-basin near the entrance. The high sediment accumulation in this area, compared to adjacent areas without accumulation, may be attributed to local low energetic conditions. This finding has potential implications for raising agricultural land using transitional polders.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this study provides insights into the effectiveness of using managed realignment as a method for extracting sediment from a turbid estuary. While it highlights some important aspects and influences, it also underscores the need for further research to confirm the findings and reduce the uncertainty in the results. Nevertheless, the potential benefits for both natural and agricultural values make this an intriguing avenue for future exploration.","Managed realignment; Polder Breebaart; Eems Dollard; Morphodynamics; Sediment transport; Morphodynamic modelling; Delft3D FM; Suspended Sediment Concentration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","RestCoast","53.303093, 7.016838"

These hospital visits are frequently accompanied by feelings of anxiety and fear, which can have a detrimental impact on a child’s life. In collaboration with the Hospital Hero Foundation and the Willem-Alexander Children’s Hospital, the aim of this project was to design an intervention that reduces children’s feelings (aged four to ten) of fear and anxiety during outpatient visits to the paediatric cardiology department.<br/><br/>Employed Methods<br/>Throughout the project, the following methodologies were employed:<br/>1. Literature research exploring the background of paediatric hospital-related anxiety and fear, and existing anxiety-and-fear-reducing strategies. <br/>2. Interviews with children (with and without CHD), parents, and paediatric healthcare workers to map the current situation.<br/>3.

The facilitation of creative sessions to generate ideas and concepts, ultimately resulting in the final design. <br/><br/>Home-Based Preparation<br/>Home-based preparation was chosen as the leading fear-and-anxiety-reducing strategy. This strategy focuses on providing paediatric patients with information prior to their hospital visit. Due to the developmental and cognitive levels of the defined age group, the responsibility of home-based preparation lies with the caregivers/guardians of the patients. The following main research question was defined: How can design support children (between the ages of four and seven) and their parents in the home-based preparation process of an outpatient visit to the paediatric cardiology department?<br/><br/>Research Outcomes<br/>Exploring the current preparation touchpoints, practised preparation methods, and the hospital experience from the child’s perspective resulted in the following summarised research outcomes: <br/>• Every paediatric patient and their situation is unique. As a result, every child experiences an outpatient visit differently. Therefore, customised preparation is required. <br/>• Parents encounter barriers during the home-based preparation of their children. Existing preparation touchpoints, including the Hospital Hero application, do not accommodate these barriers. <br/>• Preparation of children should contain context-specific details and focus on sensory stimuli. <br/><br/>Intervention <br/>Based on the research outcomes, a home-based preparation approach was defined. Context-specific triggers of fear and comforting elements were mapped and selected as preparation content. This resulted in the design of an online module that can empower children with CHD and their parents with home-based preparation. The online module was evaluated with parents and healthcare workers and shows promising results.

(mentor); Lathouwers, D. (graduation committee); de Kruijff, R.M. (graduation committee); Habraken, Steven (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The goal of radiotherapy is to maximize the dose to the target while minimizing the dose to normal tissue. Treatment plans are optimized for this goal and dose delivery is improved in accuracy and precision. The optimization is based on the delineations of the volumes of interest on the medical images of the patient. The problem is that these delineations contain uncertainties and the effect of these uncertainties become more pronounced as the accuracy and precision of dose delivery improves. The delineation uncertainties are caused by various factors such as knowledge and experience of the observers, guidelines, and image quality and modality. The goal of this thesis is to research the effects of delineation uncertainties. Uncertainties are characterized using a rolling ball algorithm (RBA) to modify the delineation. The radius of the ball represents the uncertainty and ranges from -5 mm to 5 mm for the clinical target volume (CTV) and -2 mm to 2 mm for the brain stem. The effect of these uncertainties will be researched for both fixed and re-optimized dose distributions. These are then used as input to create a model that will simulate the dose distributions for different uncertainties using Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE). PCE will be used to model dose volume histograms (DVH) of the CTV and the brain stem. The dosimetric effect will be determined by setting confidence intervals in D98% of the CTV and D2% of the brain stem. The widths of the confidence intervals in these two metrics represent the dose uncertainty. This thesis uses three sets of patient data. Each patient had a CTV close to the brain stem. Dose uncertainty in the two metrics was found to increase as the uncertainty of CTV and brain stem delineation increases. For a fixed dose distribution, a delineation uncertainty of 0.75 mm to 1.25 mm in the CTV would lead to a dose uncertainty of 2 Gy in the D98% of the CTV. A delineation uncertainty of 0.25 mm to 0.5 mm in the brain stem would lead to the same dose uncertainty in D2% of the brain stem. For a re-optimized dose distribution, a combined delineation uncertainty of 1.25 mm for two patients and 4.5 mm for one patient would lead to a dose uncertainty of 2 Gy in D98% of the CTV. For the same dose uncertainty in the D2% of the brain stem, there would be a combined delineation uncertainty between 1.0 mm and 4.5 mm. For all three patients, the dose uncertainty in the D2% was more sensitive to delineation uncertainties in the brain stem. The effects of these uncertainties will depend on the nominal situation. For all patients a 2 Gy dose uncertainty corresponds to 2.85% of the prescribed dose to the CTV and 3.33% of the maximum dose constraint of the brain stem. One patient was on the boundary of underdosing the CTV in the nominal situation and a 2 Gy uncertainty would be sufficient to underdose the CTV. The nominal D2% for all three patients was sufficiently low that it is unlikely it would exceed the maximum dose constraint.","Radiotherapy; Delineation uncertainties; Polynomial Chaos Expansion; Contouring uncertainties","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

(mentor); Schulte, F. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The distribution chain of two-dose vaccines by an air carrier (KLM cargo) with its practical features is modelled to study the influence of supply uncertainty. First the goal is to find an efficient solution approach for the model which gives good quality solutions in reasonable computation time. Secondly with the developed solution method the supply uncertainty is taken into account using robust optimization. Solving the model using an exact solution method leads to a too large increase of computation time with increase of the model size for the purpose of robust analysis. Nevertheless, given the high reliability of the model the results of this commercial model are used as a reference. To circumvent the high computation time, two alternative solution methods are developed and implemented. Respectively the genetic algorithm and the rolling horizon method. A basic implementation of the genetic algorithm does not provide adequate results and gets trapped in a local optimum. An analysis shows that measures are needed to increase the flexibility and stimulate the algorithm to find so called “transaction-less” events. To achieve this, a toolbox is developed. The toolbox consists of analysis tools (measurement of convergence rate, sparsity and a diversity measurement) and tools intended to improve the convergence and accuracy of the solution. These latter are an adapted mutation operator that stimulates the number of transaction-less events (sparsity) and an approach for directed mutation. Each measure by itself has a positive effect on the initial convergence rate, but the algorithm still gets trapped at a somewhat improved local optimum at a level of approximately 10% above the optimum solution. A strong improvement is found by combining these measures of the toolbox resulting in solutions that approach the optimal solution within less than 5% for a single destination at a very high convergence rate. The best found combination of measures are implemented to solve a multi-destination problem. The results prove to be not as good as the result for the single destination: the gap to the optimal solution is roughly 10% and the convergence rate is somewhat slower. Probably this is due to the fact that the boundary conditions impose a reduction of flexibility for the multi-destination setting. On the other hand this finding might provide a base for worthwhile future work. Since this is solver is not (yet) suitable to be used in the robustness analysis. Three different implementations of the rolling horizon method were made: (i) the straight forward (myopic) approach, (ii) extending the time window with relaxed periods and (iii) a shifting rolling horizon. The straight forward approach is significantly improved by using the relaxed and shifting methods...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

The study examines the roles of actors in the energy market, the characteristics of the EV charging infrastructure, and the information provided by TenneT regarding the imbalance market. Using historical charging data and information provided by TenneT regarding the imbalance market, an optimization problem is formulated and a method for coordinating EV charging is proposed. Our sensitivity analysis of the weight parameters and reduction factor shows their significant impact on the performance of the controller. In this study, we evaluate the performance of the proposed co-regulation controller by tuning the weight parameters to find the optimal balance between financial benefits and customer satisfaction. Our sensitivity analysis of the weight parameters demonstrates that changing them can have a significant impact on the performance of the controller. We also consider the impact of the reduction factor on the performance of the controller and find that increasing it enhances financial benefits but reduces customer satisfaction. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed co-regulation controller can effectively balance financial benefits and customer satisfaction by using appropriate weight parameters. We estimate a yearly profit of e266.45 per EV user, which is equivalent to 13.2% reduction in cost. In conclusion, our research demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using co-regulation to manage the charging demand of electric vehicles in a cost-effective and sustainable way. Our findings provide valuable insight for the development of smart charging strategies that balance the needs of the EV driver, the grid, and other stakeholders, and have important implications for the energy market. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed solution under varying degrees of uncertainty in the input data. Our proposed solution provides a practical and scalable method for managing the charging demand of electric vehicles and has the potential to contribute significantly to global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.","Electric vehicles (EVs); Co-regulation; Energy market; Setpoint tracking; Flexibility; Optimization; Clustering; Customer satisfaction; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Blom, C.B.M. (graduation committee); Ramler, J.P.G. (graduation committee); Tuls, Johan (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","In the construction of subsoil structures, a common challenge is the presence of a high groundwater level in combination with the absence of a naturally impermeable layer or an environment susceptible to settlements due to lowering the groundwater level. To overcome this issue, a building pit with an underwater concrete floor (UCF) can be constructed. The UCF ensures structural rigidity and allows for the building pit to be drained such that a dry and safe subsoil construction site is obtained.<br/><br/>The objective of this thesis is to investigate how design efficiency of underwater concrete floors can be improved. In an effort to reduce material usage and achieve cost-effective structures, the following research question was stated:<br/><br/>“What is the influence of design parameters and how can parameters be adjusted to improve design efficiency of an underwater concrete floor, and to what extent can the addition of fibre reinforcement contribute to this optimization?”<br/><br/>A parametric model was developed to provide insight to the sensitivity of parameters and their impact on design resistance. Furthermore, the model was utilized to examine under what circumstances potential material savings can be obtained by implementing fibre reinforced concrete in UCF’s. This was accomplished through the evaluation and comparison of the minimum required thickness based on bending moment resistance in various scenarios, for both UCF’s and steel fibre reinforced UCF’s (SFUCF).<br/><br/>Results obtained with the parametric model established that, in order to enhance the bending moment resistance of an uncracked UCF, increasing the nominal thickness becomes relatively more effective compared to increasing the concrete strength class for higher normal forces. When utilizing a compression arch to obtain bending moment resistance, the implementation of ribbed tensile elements or an increase in nominal thickness are found to be the most suitable methods for increasing resistance. For enhanced shear force resistance, increasing the nominal thickness over the concrete class provides relatively more additional resistance for slender UCF’s. The results found that through the application of ribbed piles, most punching shear force resistance can be obtained.<br/><br/>Three use cases for a SFUCF were identified using the parametric model. When centre to centre (c.t.c.) distances larger than 4.4m are applied in combination with a substantial normal force, significant material savings of up to 0.3m thickness are possible, which equates to a reduction of material usage by 30%. For situations where the effective height of the compression arch is small, it was also found that material usage could be reduced by 30%. Perhaps the most significant use case for a SFUCF is when the normal force is close to zero, and additional normal force cannot be obtained through membrane action. In these situations, the application of a SFUCF can make an otherwise near impossible project feasible.<br/><br/>As a new design approach, a cost-based optimization tool was developed using the parametric model. An already executed UCF was evaluated using the tool, it was determined that a more cost-effective design could have been achieved, with potential savings of up to 30% in costs.<br","Underwater concrete; Parametric design; fibre reinforced concrete (FRC)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

(mentor); Keller, A.I. (graduation committee); Mobach, Lotte (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","In most food manufacturing research and design (R&amp;D) projects, sustainability is not considered until the scalability testing or production phase, when cost reduction is the objective or when many consumers directly request it. However R&amp;D teams are highly focused on their predetermined goals at the beginning of the process. It is therefore crucial to incorporate sustainability as a criterion at the start of the project during the ideation phase for sustainable product development. Consequently, the current approach of food manufacturing R&amp;D teams needs to change. Sustainability needs to be incorporated at the start of a project, during the ideation phase. This report consists of two main parts, research and design. <br/><br/>During the research phase, literature research and many interviews have been conducted to discover the food manufacturing context in detail: the drivers and barriers for food manufacturers in developing sustainable products, a review of the current ideation activities of food manufacturers, an analysis of the possible sustainability measures that they can take to create more sustainable products, and an exploration of the trends and developments within the industry (see chapter 2 for elaboration). With the found insights, four opportunity areas are discovered (see chapter 3), and one is chosen to form a design brief (see chapter 4). <br/><br/>Following the guidelines from the design brief, several brainstorming sessions were conducted during the design phase, and the sustainable food product ideation guide was prototyped (see chapter 5). The guide encourages users to think creatively and frequently about sustainability throughout the entire food product development ideation phase. The guide provides value by stimulating creativity, serving as a sustainability exercise, and enabling product development teams to take concrete steps towards the creation of sustainable food products. See chapter 6 for elaboration on the ideation guide. <br/><br/>Then, the ideation guide was evaluated in one pilot session and three review sessions with designers, Accenture consultants and Accenture experts (see chapter 7). Whereafter, the potential use cases of the ideation guide was discussed with various experts from Accenture in chapter 8. <br/><br/>Finally, this report concludes with an implementation plan for the ideation guide, which is designed to encourage food manufacturers to develop more sustainable product ideas, instilling a sustainable mindset that impacts everything they do. The guide offers significant value for Accenture and its food manufacturing clients. For Accenture, the guide offers the opportunity to attract new clients and initiate early-stage conversations about sustainability projects, as well as provide a standardised workshop format with a modular toolkit that saves time and is scalable. Eventually, the digital version of the guide could be developed into Accenture’s own ideation platform for security and IP purposes. The guide provides a low threshold for food manufacturers to experience sustainable food product ideation sessions. It offers tailored workshops, new food product ideas, and concrete next research steps for the development team. Additionally, the digital version of the guide caters to remote employees and assists in integrating sustainability into their practices, helping to initiate company culture change.<br","Design Guidelines; Sustainable development; Food manufacture; Research and development; Food production","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Schneegass, C.S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Cooking is an essential part of most people’s day-to-day lives. It is a dynamic activity that involves multitasking, timing of tasks, and flexibility. However, the available instruction methods for cooks who wish to follow recipes are quite rigid and linear. This project aims to create a design solution that provides instructions in a way that is in better accordance with natural cooking behaviours. <br/><br/>The scope of the project is to deliver a conceptual instruction-based cooking tool that utilizes Artificial Intelligence. While designing the solution, speculative design methods are considered in order to design for the near future. It is designed for a future where tasks in recipe instructions can be used more flexibly in digital products and Human Activity Recognition can accurately recognize complex cooking actions with mobile devices. The design solution has been created for a company called Verdify. Verdify is a food tech company with products that aim to allow users to achieve fully personalized nutrition. Swapmeals is their recipe platform that allows users to swap ingredients to fit their dietary needs while adjusting instructions accordingly and maintaining flavour profiles. The design solution aims to ultimately live on this recipe platform. The project is executed with a User-centered Design approach which involves end-users in the design process in order for them to have an impact on their final product.<br/><br/>The users were observed while cooking with instructions in order to understand the pain points that should be designed for. The most prevalent and significant themes that emerged from the study were that users experience cognitive overload while cooking and often experience uncertainty in the cooking process. <br/><br/>Academic design solutions and commercial products for hands-free instruction-based cooking were reviewed to understand which issues, discovered in the context research, have not been designed for. This gap is used to specify design requirements. The requirements specify that the design solution should allow home-cooks to use recipe instructions in a way that is hands-free, non-linear, informative, and that minimally interrupts the cooking flow along with reducing their cognitive load and the associated negative emotions. The solution is also required to allow the user to mainly focus on the task at hand; the device should manage the remaining responsibilities. Lastly, the research discovered that the design solution should create the experience of cooking a new recipe similarly to how one would cook a familiar recipe.<br/><br/>Solutions were explored that meet the specified requirements. The exploration led to 2 contrasting concepts that aim to improve instruction-based cooking in a familiar textual manner and an innovative experiential manner. These 2 concepts were tested with users in order to compare the newly defined interaction methods and understand which interactions are desired in the various moments of the cooking process. The results generated an iterated list of requirements to be applied to the final design. <br/><br/>Lastly, a conceptual instruction-based cooking design solution was introduced; a user interface that utilizes Human Activity Recognition for user-to-product communication. The tool adopts the cognitive load from its users by managing timing and their progression while adjusting to the user’s autonomous adaptations to the recipe. The design solution is an interactive, hands-free, and informative recipe instruction solution. It allows home-cooks to let go of keeping an overview of the cooking process and instead solely focus on the task at hand, allowing cooking to be a worry-free and enjoyable activity for even the tensest home-cooks.","Human Activity Recognition; Artificial Intelligence; User-Centered Design; Interaction Design; User Interface Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The tumours affect the entire gastrointestinal tract, but most commonly the stomach and small intestine. Neoadjuvant tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are administered in a selection of GIST patients to attain size reduction of the primary tumour and improve chances of complete resection. Response monitoring in GISTs is complex due to the presence of intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity and lack of pathological criteria to define response. Nonetheless, it is of importance to evaluate the efficacy of TKI treatment at an early stage in order to optimise treatment. In particular, early cessation of ineffective treatment is of importance in these patients, preventing unnecessary side-effects and healthcare costs. Medical imaging plays an important role to non-invasively predict and monitor treatment response of GIST patients undergoing TKI-treatment. This thesis aims to improve understanding of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) PET/CT imaging parameters to allow prediction and monitoring of neoadjuvant treatment response in GIST patients. <br/>In Chapter 1, the added value of CE-CT and [18F]FDG-PET imaging for early prediction and monitoring of treatment response in GISTs is investigated by means of a systematic literature review. Results of this study show that heterogeneous enhancement patterns on baseline CE-CT imaging were considered to be predictive for high-risk GISTs, reflecting neovascularisation and the presence of necrosis. Current CE-CT radiographic response criteria (i.e., RECIST 1.1 and Choi) are still lacking sensitivity and are prone to errors when predicting or monitoring treatment response. Metabolic changes on [18F]FDG-PET imaging seem to precede morphological changes in size in GIST lesions and were more strongly correlated with tumour response. Although CE-CT and [18F]FDG-PET can aid in the prediction and monitoring in GIST patients, further research on cost-effectiveness is recommended.<br/>Chapter 2 evaluates the efficacy of current radiological response criteria (RECIST 1.1, Choi and tumour volumetry) in predicting response to neoadjuvant systemic therapy, by comparing radiological response criteria with the achieved surgical benefit. Results show that size-based criteria (RECIST 1.1 and volumetry) accurately reflect surgical benefit in GIST patients treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy (accuracy of 76.3% and 86.6% respectively) and are less prone to scanner and imaging protocol variabilities, when compared to the Choi criteria (68.4%). <br/>In addition to volumetry, quantitative radiomic models using CE-CT and [18F]FDG-PET imaging features were trained to predict response at baseline. Preliminary results of this study are described in Chapter 3. The radiomic models presented in this study generally had a poor performance and can therefore not yet be applied in a clinical setting. To improve performance and generalisability, future research should focus on a bigger patient population and harmonisation of acquisition protocols. The conclusion of this thesis supports the utilisation of tumour diameters for radiological response assessment, where RECIST 1.1 response criteria had an accuracy of 80.0% to correctly predict volumetric response after the first response follow-up CE-CT scan. When properly executed, these manual measurements could aid in early surgical decision making.","gastrointestinal stromal tumor; prediction; response monitoring; FDG-PET; X-ray Computed; personalized medicine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine | Imaging and Intervention","",""

While the sensors used by these vehicles are getting cheaper, more accurate, and software is improving, the first completely automated vehicle does not exist yet. When AVs start gradually driving on the roads, there will be a mixed traffic situation consisting of AVs and human driven vehicles. To understand the implications on the traffic performance, this thesis will implement a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) and the behavioural models for AVs into a numerical simulation in SUMO. The MPC can be used to control multiple AVs in larger traffic simulations to analyse the effects of certain penetration rates and traffic densities when changing the AVs driving behaviour. Both the Post-Encroachment Time (PET) and Time To Collision (TTC) will be used for decision making in overtaking and collision avoidance strategies. In this thesis, the MPC which is solving a quadratic programming problem has proven to successfully overtake other vehicles in an on- and off-ramp highway scenario which results in a smaller average travel time for the AVs than for the human drivers. It is shown that the decrease in average travel time for the AVs was not at the cost of the Human Vehicles (HVs). This is done by decreasing the TTC used by the AVs as a headway for longitudinal overtaking behaviour, and the PET used for lateral lane changing behaviour, independently to a minimum of 0.1 seconds to guaranty safety, and measure the average travel times for both HVs and AVs. Multiple simulations using different penetration rates ranging from 0 to 40 percent also show that the decrease in average travel time for the AVs was not at the cost of the HVs. We can conclude that using an MPC integrated together with the behavioural rules of human drivers into numerical simulation can give a good indication of the implications that AVs have on traffic performance.","Autonomous Vehicles; Numerical Simulation; MPC; Model predictive control; SUMO; Human driven vehicles; Post Encroachment Time (PET); Time to Collision (TTC); Highway","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

In this thesis, an elastic<br/>frequency doubler based on an eight-bar mechanism that exploits the displacement around a singularity to double the frequency is presented. Higher frequency multiplications can be achieved by concatenating this mechanism, surpassing previous designs in the literature. To facilitate effective concatenation, criteria for optimization were established and a design study was conducted to determine the optimal geometrical parameters of the mechanism. The utilization of not only the actuation capabilities but simultaneously leveraging the inherently stored strain energy during operation has the potential to serve as the foundation for a novel group of architected materials. The embodiment of both functionalities makes these architected materials highly desirable for control in autonomous robots where, through the exploitation of close synergy and decrease in dissipation, this multifunctionality could increase the efficiency in usage of the usually limited space and available energy.","Compliant Mechanism; Frequency Multiplier; Parametric study","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/Luuk-Samuels/ThesisLuuk GitHub page containing all relevant extra information like movies, datasets, scripts, and figures.","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Precision and Microsystems Engineering","",""

In this work, we show and discuss several issues and limitations of this currently widely adopted convex upsampling approach. We propose a series of changes, inspired by the observation that convex upsampling as currently implemented performs badly in high-detail areas. We identify three possible causes; wrong training data, the non-existence of a convex combination, and the inability of the convex upsampler to find the correct convex combination.<br/><br/>We propose several ideas in an attempt to resolve current issues. First, we propose to decouple the weights for the final convex upsampler, making it easier to find the correct convex combination. For the same reason, we also provide extra contextual features to the convex upsampler. Then, we increase the convex mask size by using an attention-based alternative convex upsampler; Transformers for Convex Upsampling. This upsampler is based on the observation that convex upsampling can be reformulated as attention, and we propose to use local attention masks as a drop-in replacement for convex masks in order to increase the mask size. We provide empirical evidence that a larger mask size increases the likelihood of the existence of the convex combination. Lastly, we propose an alternative training scheme to remove bilinear interpolation artifacts from the model output.<br/><br/>We investigate whether an increase in accuracy can be achieved while leaving the low-resolution flow prediction architecture unchanged. Due to that, our proposed ideas could theoretically be applied to almost every current state-of-the-art optical flow architecture. On the FlyingChairs + FlyingThings3D training setting we reduce the Sintel Clean training end-point-error of GMA from 1.31 to 1.18, which is a 10% decrease caused solely by changes regarding the convex upsampler.","optical flow; convex upsampling; transformers; attention","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Artificial Intelligence Technology","",""

Detailed simulations of reactor physics involve complex calculations that require significant computing resources, which can be time-consuming and expensive. Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) allows for an approximation of a complex model by only capturing the essential features, thereby reducing the computational load. A reduced order model provides computationally efficient approximations of a system, but it requires still many evaluations of a high-fidelity model to capture all the dynamics. Using the adaptive sparse grid can reduce the number of evaluations needed, though the construction of the reduced order model is still computationally intensive.<br/><br/>The aim is to minimize the computational workload involved in constructing a reduced-order model during the offline phase. This is achieved by decreasing the number of high-fidelity model evaluations necessary for building the reduced order model while maintaining accurate results. To this end, the existing adaptive proper orthogonal decomposition algorithm is enhanced by employing multi-fidelity techniques. Multi-fidelity methods aim to combine large amount of low-fidelity data with a limited amount of high-fidelity data to compute accurate, yet computationally inexpensive approximations. Two novel multi-fidelity reduced order model methods based on proper orthogonal decomposition are proposed; Filtered Bi-Fidelity Adaptive Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (FB-POD) algorithm and Adapted Bi-Fidelity Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (AB-POD). These models are evaluated on two different test cases, and the balance between the accuracy of each multi-fidelity ROM and the computational cost, measured by the number of high-fidelity evaluations, is investigated. In specific cases, the proposed methods significantly reduce the number of high-fidelity evaluations compared to the single high-fidelity ROM, while yielding comparable accuracy.","Reduced Order Model; Multi-fidelity; Reactor Modelling; nuclear; Proper Orthogonal Decomposition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-03-03","","","","Applied Physics","","51.990681, 4.380679"

(mentor); Wu, Jun (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Improving sustainability in industrial processes is a key topic for the welfare of the environment. One of the major environmental problems caused by industrial processes is industrial waste production. In the automotive industry, the use of polymers such as PA12 for prototyping produces tons of waste per year which are generally destined to incineration. Recycling could help reduce waste, but recycling procedures can be resource-consuming, therefore it might not always be efficient or more sustainable than traditional practices. In most cases, recycling involves extra steps in the process value chain, including finances, transportation, workforce, as well as machinery. To make sure recycling has positive effects in terms of sustainability on industrial processes, a framework to assess the sustainability of recycling procedures is needed. <br/><br/>In this study, it is proposed an assessment framework which considers four pillars of sustainability: (1) technical, (2) environmental, (3) economic, and (4) social. While the environmental, economic, and social pillars are usually considered in sustainability assessments, the technical pillar has been neglected and should be considered in understanding the sustainability of recycling procedures. This framework can be applied to gain insights into recycling procedures’ sustainability and help as a tool to decide which procedure to adopt. Likewise, it considers the company’s needs and objectives, as fundamental factor for the evaluation. In recycling procedures, the technical pillar should include indicators related to resource efficiency but also recycled material quality, an essential factor when evaluating their effectiveness. Such a framework, consisting of a ten steps approach, aims to facilitate the adoption of recycling procedures, through qualitative and quantitative assessments, on the basis of a set of indicators, selected within the four pillars of sustainability. <br/>From the analysis of the current system, to the definition of objectives, design of the pathways, and the evaluation of sustainability indicators, the framework aims to allow companies to systematically assess and select a sustainable pathway in terms of defined objectives and environmental regulations. <br/><br/>The framework was applied to the case study of mechanical recycling of PA12 waste from automotive prototyping. The aim is to reduce plastic parts waste, to be turned into filament for Additive Manufacturing technologies for use as jigs and fixtures. Following systematically the assessment framework, ten potential recycling pathways were identified and compared. Major differences among them include the ratio of waste parts to virgin material, and filament extrusion location. The sustainable recycling pathway that resulted from the evaluation features the shortest transportation distances (connected to lower carbon footprint and energy consumption, and higher flexibility). The application of the framework provided a trade-off analysis, where not only the interests on the environment are considered, but particular attention is given to companies’ needs and opportunities. <br","Sustainability Assessment Framework; Recycling; Additive Manufacturing; polyamide-12; Automotive industry; Prototyping; Framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","","48.2622484, 11.5575271"

(mentor); van den Ouden, Eric-Jan (graduation committee); Del Buono, Marcello (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The demand for offshore wind energy has never been higher, yet the number of ideal areas for wind farm installations is decreasing. As a result, larger wind turbines are being placed in deeper waters, which poses opportunities for floating foundations. However, due to the industry's inability to scale up the production of relatively expensive floaters, companies are exploring alternative foundation methods for offshore wind turbine generators in deep water, including the extension of the use of monopiles, which are now being considered for use in water depths up to 60 meters. However, higher loads in deep water require increased stiffness in the monopile structure, which is typically achieved by using larger thicknesses and diameters, resulting in XXL-monopiles. The steel used for these XXL-monopiles increases exponentially for greater water depths, and the designs cross the production limits. This study investigates the use of a guyed monopile as a more favorable alternative to a conventional monopile for deepwater applications with large wind turbine generators in the range of 60-120 meters of water depth and a rated power of 15 MW. The guyed monopile concept involves adding moorings to a conventional monopile to provide additional stiffness at a certain elevation, reducing the required material within the monopile. A numerical model is elaborated where the structure is represented by a one-direction FEM model having two degrees of freedom. The model is supported by springs that represent the soil and mooring system. The soil is modelled by a series of p-y reaction curves. For the mooring stiffness, a nonlinear stiffness approach is used where the axial stiffness and geometry of the mooring are considered. The method is used to determine the maximum stiffness that a mooring system can bring. After that, the mooring system is included in the FEM model. Static and dynamic analyses are performed to determine the response of the structure. The described methodology also implements requirements based on potential resonance (1P and 3P frequencies), ultimate limit state (yield strength, column buckling, and local buckling), and fatigue limit state (fatigue damage due to wind and waves). The static and dynamic responses are validated using Ansys. It is concluded that the moorings can provide enough stiffness to reduce the impact of the acting loads on the structure. A case study is conducted to compare the use of a conventional monopile and a guyed monopile for a foundation based on realistic wind and wave loads. Data of a reference wind turbine and a reference location is taken to find the advantages of a guyed monopile for a realistic case. The study iterates the process for different water depths and varying numbers of moorings. Greater water depths lead to more issues due to resonance and fatigue, which can only be overcome by increasing the diameter and thickness of conventional monopiles. This can also be overcome for guyed monopiles by increasing the mooring stiffness. The results show that the guyed monopile is favored over the conventional monopile in all cases, with up to a 45% reduction in steel required.<br/>The case study's findings are used to identify key parameters in the design of a guyed monopile. The sensitivity of the mooring system stiffness is compared to other key design parameters, including monopile diameter, thickness, and embedded length. The study finds that the moorings have a favourable effect on the system's natural frequency. Also, bending and shear stress may be reduced when moorings are applied.","Guyed Monopiles; Offshore energy; Deep Water; Finite Element Analysis; KCI the Engineers; Mooring design; Static analysis; Dynamic analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-03-02","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); van der Velde, J.R.T. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","With nearly 70% of people living in cities by 2050 (United Nations, 2018), our urban environments are being put to the test, with more severe and frequent heat waves, droughts, floods, ongoing biodiversity loss, air pollution, and land subsidence. To sustain and increase the liveability and climate resilience of cities, the design and implementation of urban green infrastructure, with the urban forest as its backbone, is one of the most critical solutions (Spronken-Smith &amp; Oke, 1998; Rosenzweig et al., 2015; Norton et al., 2015). However, the current indifference that runs through the veins of the anthropocentric political, economic, and socio-technical systems limits the urban forest from being a central part of the built environment.<br/><br/>As an attempt to put urban trees on the political agenda, the USDA Forest Service developed and launched the i-Tree software in 2006 to quantify the ecosystem services provided by urban trees (Nowak, 2020). In 2019, the first version became applicable to the Netherlands. This project is part of the three-year-long follow-up, i-Tree 2.0-NL, consisting of a consortium of 28 stakeholders to further elaborate the cooling performance, model growth curves, and synchronise the potential of the software for the stakeholders. This thesis concerns the latter.<br/> <br/>The project starts with an understanding of the overarching transitions, exploring the direction in which the urban green domain should (and currently is) heading to calibrate the compass for change (see Figure 1). The newly proposed paradigm illustrates five societal shifts in how we relate to, integrate, account for, collaborate for and provide access to the urban forest. The ideal is to reposition the urban forest as critical infrastructure. The project is moving towards mapping the current system and processes of the consortium stakeholders, localising the role of the public green sector in urbanisation and discovering interrelationships. The different domains are strategically separated and examined in isolation to explore opportunities for integrating i-Tree into architectural, municipal and nursery processes. From this set of five opportunity areas, the concept of a management dashboard was selected for further development with the aim of linking municipal green space policy and green space management. <br/><br/>The ‘Urban Forest Portfolio’ is created, evolving the use of i-Tree from static assessments to a dynamic portfolio. The dashboard aims to integrate the urban forest lifecycle into planning, management and design, to track progress towards the realisation of long-term quantified targets, and to enable scenario evaluation for just compensation.<br/><br/>The integration of the proposition into the system is discussed, leading to eight concrete new practices and six speculations on a system scale, one of which is the establishment of the ‘Rijksgroenstaat’. Finally, the principles behind these new practices helped to make the new paradigm tangible, operationalise the transitions and bring into focus the parts specific to the domain of this project. <br/> <br/>The project aims to discover the systemic granularity of the urban green domain, oscillating between abstract paradigms, concrete practice, and levels in between. A systemic strategy developed side by side with the stakeholders in the green sector. <br","Urban forest; Urban planning; Climate resilience; i-Tree; Participatory design; Systemic strategy; Speculative proposition; Transition design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

At one point this will even mean that cars will be able to fully drive themselves, so that the driver is relieved of all driving related tasks. In this situation the car effectively becomes a robot, resulting in a novel relationship between human and car. This project explored that relationship by looking at the possible overlap between autonomous vehicles and robotics, aiming to answer the following research questions:<br/><br/>What emerging phenomena can be identified from the combination of AVs and robotics?<br/>In what way could the combination of AVs and robotics add value to humans’ lives?<br/><br/>The project started by reviewing previous shifts in this relationship that came about with technological developments, and a similar analysis of robotics and its relationship to humans. After providing historical context and formulating the current state, the project continued with an exploration of existing work in academia and industry. The findings from this initial exploration helped define a further focus into the relationship between an AV and a community of people that surrounds it. <br/><br/>To gain user insights a co-creation workshop was conducted. In these workshops the participants were all part of a certain community, and their task was to envision how a ‘shared mobile space’ (an abstract term used in substitution of AV) and robotics could add value to their lives. The outcomes of these workshops were analysed and together with insights from the related work review they served as input for finding a design analogy for the envisioned future role of the AV. The selected analogy was that of a language buddy, which acts as a sort of catalyst for expats or refugees to be included in a community. <br/><br/>To finally bring all findings together and link them to the envisioned future role, a set of design principles was created. After iteration with mobility-related experts they were formulated as follows: when researchers and designers are working on future AVs, they should keep in mind that AVs should be considered shared mobile spaces rather than self-driving cars. Because of the robotic characteristics of the AV, its use-opportunities are far greater than just an evolution of current-day car use. To help with this notion, the following principles should be followed.<br/>AVs provide opportunities for interest-based communities to be nonsimultaneously connected in a physical space;<br/>Tailored NDRAs should be used to catalyse community inclusion;<br/>Adaptability should be a core characteristic of an AV, therefore also of its design process.<br/><br/>The work that is presented aims to contribute to both academia and industry. Firstly by shining light on the overlooked community perspective on AV design. By providing the aforementioned design principles this work advocates researchers and practitioners to take on this perspective, to ensure a positive impact on the community level as well. Secondly, by promoting a less car-centric approach to AV design, broader and more experience-focused AV use opportunities may arise.<br","Autonomous Vehicles; Robotics; User Experience; Design principles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

In the early stages, The Attention Restoration Theory by Kaplan (1995) inspired what mood-regulating experiences to design for: the softly fascinating experiences in nature that support the restoration of mental fatigue. A design opportunity revealed itself in realizing that, unlike nature, our indoor environments show few softly fascinating stimuli. This resulted in a design direction aiming to enhance restorative potential indoors by bringing the softly fascinating qualities from the outside in. <br/><br/>This led to a quest in search of the softly fascinating qualities of nature. It was found that it's the self-similar patterns in motion, like drifting clouds and leaves swaying in the breeze, that attract our attention. It's the quality of unity in variety in the self-similar patterns as well as the movement of the patterns that lures us in this moment of fascination, creating scenes that are ""the same, but never the same.""<br/><br/>In a process of experimentation and prototyping, three key elements of design were found to establish the fascinating effect of shimmering light patterns as sunbeams pass through dancing leaves: a light source, two patterns, and physical movement. The integration and refinement of these design elements ultimately resulted in a working prototype called Daze.<br/><br/>Results from the final user test show positive results in regards to Daze's potential for restoration. On a 5-point Likert scale, the average ratings of nine participants for the living room's restorative qualities significantly increased with Daze's presence compared to without. Additionally, the majority of participants mentioned feeling fascinated and relaxed by Daze. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Daze was designed to enhance indoor spaces' restorative potential by introducing softly fascinating qualities from the outside in. The results have shown that Daze is capable of doing so, thereby providing proof of concept: it's possible to transfer restorative nature experiences by recreating its softly fascinating qualities. ","design for mood; restorative environments; restorative nature","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

An investigation by an engineering consultancy firm concluded that the design loads in the building code are too low, raising questions about the safety of grandstand elements. Currently, no method to assess the reliability of grandstand elements exists.<br/><br/>This thesis presents a state-of-the-art method to determine the reliability of concrete grandstand elements. The reliability is assessed by performing a non-linear dynamical analysis. The element is modelled as a non-linear single-degree-of-freedom system. Excitation signals are synthetically generated by consulting the literature and by analyzing a data set of jumping crowds. A bi-linear force- displacement relationship based on technical drawings of the collapsed grandstand element is adopted and extended by a model uncertainty parameter which accounts for both the non-linearity of the analysis and the uncertainty related to the dynamical basis of the analysis. The reliability is determined through a Monte Carlo simulation: almost 100,000 simulations can be performed per assessment.<br/><br/>Out of the 100,000 simulations, 0 failed. This result is not in line with what happened; one failed out of only a few elements. This gives rise to two different investigations. On the one hand, the failure of the Goffert stadium grandstand elements has to be explained. On the other hand, the lifetime reliability of a grandstand element has to be determined.<br/><br/>The first assessment indicated that if the element’s resistance conforms to the technical drawings, there is no cause for concern regarding its reliability. Measurements on 23 other grandstand elements in the same stadium showed a high variation in the concrete cover. The collapsed element was, therefore, also likely subjected to a high variation in the concrete cover. To understand the influence of an increased concrete cover on the reliability, two additional analyses were performed, where the post-yielding resistance of the structure was slightly reduced. This resulted in an increase in the probability of failure, which indicates that this parameter plays a crucial role in determining the reliability of grandstand elements. These points combined make it more plausible that the element failed because the concrete cover was larger than intended rather than the design loads being too low, as concluded by the engineering firm.<br/><br/>When investigating the lifetime reliability of grandstand elements in general, no collapse is expected after 8 seconds but rather after 30 seconds or even longer durations. Therefore, two additional analyses were performed where signals of longer durations (120 seconds and 300 seconds) excited the system. In these analyses, it is assumed that the resistance of the grandstand element conforms to the technical drawings. Signs of a converged reliability were perceived as 120- and 300-second excitation signals led to a probability of failure of the same order of magnitude, indicating that a steady-state solution is obtained after 120 seconds of jumping. In that case, the lifetime reliability of a grandstand element would be equal to the 120-second reliability. The corresponding reliability passes the lifetime reliability requirements for existing structures in consequence class 2 (for a reference period of 15 years).<br/><br/>While the results presented are estimations, and a larger sample size is needed for a converged probability of failure, the proposed method provides a valuable framework for assessing the reliability of grandstand elements. This method can easily be extended to any grandstand element by changing the model parameters, and the true reliability of grandstand elements can be assessed by performing more (1-10 million) simulations.","Reliability assessment; Grandstand elements; Method; Case study; Jumping loads","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

The coastline west of the capital, Oranjestad Bay, is of vital importance to the island as it is here where tourism, recreation, the harbour and historical ruins are located. On the other hand, Oranjestad Bay has a heavily fluctuating beach, which is undesirable. The Public Entity of St. Eustatius is investigating the possibility of a coastal solution that could preserve and extend this beach. However, there is insufficient knowledge of the hydrodynamic processes and morphology available to design a solution. By analysing the morphological system, this study aims to advise the Public Entity of St. Eustatius on the decision for a coastal solution to create a beach in Oranjestad Bay. <br/><br/>A literature study was performed to obtain basic knowledge of the coastal system of Oranjestad Bay. A two-dimensional numerical Delft3D model was then developed to gain more in-depth knowledge of the wave, current and sediment patterns. The result of both findings is combined in a conceptual model, where the cause of the beach fluctuations along Oranjestad Bay was analysed. Based on the system knowledge and stakeholders’ demands and regulations, three alternatives to create a beach at Oranjestad Bay are proposed. The alternatives are qualitatively verified and evaluated with a multi-criteria analysis and cost-value ratio. <br/><br/>The literature review shows that Oranjestad Bay has the characteristics of a wave-dominated coast. The seasonal wave climate has a strong influence on the beach fluctuations that occur in Oranjestad Bay. The influence of tides and wind on sediment dynamics is expected to be minimal. The modelling study concluded that the wave climate can be described by three main wave conditions, namely a sea condition, a storm condition and a swell condition. The different hydrodynamic and morphodynamic characteristics of these conditions provide a reasonable simulation of the coastal processes in Oranjestad Bay. The model results give an impression of the seasonal wave climate and a net northward sediment transport capacity is found. These results are consistent with the expected coastal morphodynamics found in the literature study. The effect of a storm is less well represented in the modelling study. This limitation is caused by the modelling approach. In addition, there are some uncertainties in the model due to the lack of detailed coastal data in the nearshore. The conceptual model indicates that the coast of Oranjestad Bay may experience seasonal gradients<br/>in alongshore sediment transport leading to beach fluctuations. From April to September, beaches are likely to erode due to net northward sediment transport. In addition, beaches erode due to periodic storm conditions that occur from June to November. It has been found that the recovery of beaches after a storm varies along Oranjestad Bay. Scubaqua beach recovers much faster than the beach at Smoke Alley. This is due to the larger sediment transport capacity in the alongshore direction at Smoke Alley beach, the amount of larger cobbles on the shoreline of Smoke Alley and the lack of sediment north of Smoke Alley...","Delft3D4; Coastal morphodynamics; St. Eustatius; Beach fluctuations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

Since it is essential to make an informed decision, there is a need to develop a method to look at decision-making in an integral and systematic sense. Therefore a DSS is designed in this study to support this bridge programming. The DSS will systematically show which main effects play a role, the options a municipality can choose, and their advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, it will reveal the trade-offs a municipality will have to weigh when making its choice. The DSS was designed using a case study, namely a part of Amsterdam. In the end, the expert evaluation showed that the DSS is plausible and leads to meaningful insights into decision-making.","Decision-making; Bridge; Maintenance; Decision Support System; Programming; Municipality; Trade-off","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

A key element of the AMOC is deep convection, which is still not fully understood. One of the unknowns is where water is exchanged between the boundary current and the regions where deep convection can occur. This is important for models to know where deep waters are formed and where they are transported to. This study focuses on the Irminger Sea (IRS), a sub-sea of the NAO. The interior of this sub-sea is a known area where deep convection can occur. Using data from the Argo Float Program, a analysis was conducted to investigate exchanges of water between the boundary current of the IRS and the area where deep convection can occur. The entries and departure locations of the Argo floats are collected and statistically compared. Furthermore, seasonality difference between winter and summer months are compared using the Mann-Whitney U-Test. Lastly, the internal pathways water takes within the interior area are analysed, by tracking where a float enters the interior area and where it afterwards leaves the area. The results show water takes many different pathways in and out of the interior area and the pathways taken within the area show the expected cyclonic pattern. There were no clear differences between summer and winter months, except in the northern part of the interior area, where in winter a clear south-western current is present, but not in summer. Future studies on the exchange between the boundary current and the interior area can use these results as an indication that the exchange happens all around the area, but the water does follow a cyclonic pattern.","AMOC; Irminger Sea; Deep Convection; Argo Floats","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the aim of this study is to design a reusable modular superstructure, with a small span, which can replace an existing so-called volstortligger superstructure. This is a structure that Dura Vermeer often uses and it regularly happens that these constructions are demolished after a lifespan of, for example, 10 years. This is a waste of materials and therefore an alternative will be investigated in this research. The following research question guides this study:<br/><br/>What is the optimal structure, in terms of shadow costs, mass and financial costs, for a modular superstructure?<br/><br/>In order to answer this question, a parametric study is performed using the software Grasshopper, using the Finite Element Model plug-in Karamba3D. In this way, quick structural analyses were performed, to explore multiple options. In total, more than 11.000 bridge design variants have been generated, divided over 12 different runs. The model allowed targeted optimization of shadow costs, weight and financial costs. Optimization is achieved by varying the following input parameters: number of steel girders, steel profile girders, outrigger deck, concrete deck thickness, concrete class, outrigger deck, FRP sandwich panel height, facing thickness, web thickness, and fibre volume. <br/><br/>In total, 6 different variants would be developed in this way, 3 with a concrete deck and 3 with an FRP deck. However, the optimization results in only 4 different variants, 3 with a concrete deck and just one with an FRP deck. The results show that the variant with the FRP deck is indicative for Shadow costs, Financial costs and weight. <br/><br/>After the four pre-designs had been developed, these variants were weighed against each other by means of a Trade-Off Matrix (TOM). Using this method, a distinction is made between the variants based on the pre-chosen performance indicators. All performance indicators have a weighting that adds up to a total of 100.<br/><br/>This study concludes that it can be advantageous to replace the traditional design with a demountable design, with the assumed boundary conditions of this study. All developed variants have an advantage with regard to environmental impact and financial costs compared to the traditional design, assuming a lifespan of 100 years in which it is moved 10 times.","Circular Design; Sustainable; Superstructure; Parametric Design; Composite; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Steel and Timber Construction","",""

We used this method to check the improvements made to the engine model. Out of the performed experiments, we concluded that the induced inlet mass temperature decreases with increasing power or mass flow. The insight found about the starting pressure for this engine is that the trapped pressure increases in relation to the manifold pressure with increasing power or mass flow. Together with an improved residual mass prediction, these insights resulted in an increase of the volumetric efficiency prediction accuracy by 2% at low powers and 10% at high power.","Volumetric efficiency; induction stroke; induced temperature; )-dimensional model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Marine Engineering","MENENS",""

(graduation committee); Abraham, E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The pressure on water and energy resources, along with the transition towards new infrastructure, requires an integrated approach to achieve future-proof concepts. A nexus approach can contribute to this by including the interaction between water and energy. This is also known as a water-energy nexus (WEN). Furthermore, when considering decentralization as an ‘infrastructure pathway’, new solutions can be considered where more resources are locally used. Therefore, the circular economy principle was used as a baseline for this research, as it becomes possible to include both water and energy as important resources. There are currently various assessment frameworks that facilitate the decision-making process for different infrastructure pathways. However, it was found that these frameworks do generally not evaluation indicator that go in line with a circular economy approach. <br/><br/>This research presents a six-step generic assessment framework that can be used to evaluate different decentralized WEN systems. The first step was formed to give the opportunity in setting up the research scope. It has the possibility to either select one neighborhood as a study case of multiple depending on the research objectives. After that comes a modular step where it is possible to include different innovative technologies that are relevant for a more decentralized WEN system. The water- and energy balance can be modeled in the third step, providing insight into the (re)use of water- and energy sources on different temporal scales. Subsequently, the generic assessment framework contains 13 evaluation indicators that are divided into four themes: (1) water system, (2) value for people, (3) energy system, and (4) general characteristics. The last step includes stakeholder perspectives to prioritize and weigh the indicators. <br/><br/>A modern Dutch neighborhood with a high building density (City Nieuwegein) was used as a case study to demonstrate the generic assessment framework. Four scenarios were designed (reference, improved centralized, hybrid, and almost decentralized) to assess the impact of a neighborhood with more decentralized WEN systems. The case study results showed that more decentralization strategies improved most indicator scores. Using different decentralized WEN systems increases the collection and storage of local water- and energy resources. It was found that neighborhoods with more decentralization strategies have a higher complexity (e.g., monitoring and spatial limitations) in implementation. Moreover, the investment- and maintenance costs can be up to 51% higher compared to a neighborhood with minimal decentralized WEN systems. However, the outcomes of the six stakeholder perspectives, showed that the scenario with the highest level of decentralization was, in all cases, preferred. <br/><br/>The results of the case study showed that the generic assessment framework can be used to evaluate different decentralized WEN systems. The 13 evaluation indicators followed the circular economy principle as this favors future-proof concepts. Besides, the generic assessment framework included stakeholder perspectives so that it can facilitate the decision-making process of stakeholders. This framework can be further improved by including multi-objective optimization resulting in more scenarios that can be simulated. At last, more research is required for qualitative indicators that improves evaluating the different scenarios.","Water-energy nexus; Multi-criteria analysis; Decentralized Energy Systems; Stakeholder perspective; Assessment frameworks; Circular economy; Neighbourhood scale","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","52.028865, 5.076531"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","A popular class of methods for solving Fluid-Structure Interactions (FSI) problems computationally are the moving mesh deformation methods. These methods generally involve deforming the fluid domain so that it conforms to the structure as it undergoes changes. An efficient and robust moving mesh technique involves interpolation of displacements using Radial Basis Functions (RBFs). But it is noticed that large deformations in the computational domain restrict the applicability of RBF methods due to resulting poor mesh quality. This further worsens the accuracy of the simulation by introducing additional numerical errors. The standard practice to overcome this deficiency has been to introduce the computationally expensive step of re-meshing the entire domain.<br/>The current thesis aims to tackle this issue of poor mesh quality caused due to large deformations of the structure by introducing localized corrections in regions of poor quality. But deforming the mesh, then calculating the quality and then applying corrections would become an expensive operation of its own. Therefore, firstly a methodology is devised to predict the state of the mesh after the deformation apriori to performing the deformation step. It is found that the gradient information from the deformation functions can be utilized to accurately predict the various algebraic mesh quality metrics. The algorithm is tested on 1D and 2D meshes and grid convergence studies are performed to validate the predicted quality with the actual quality post-deformation. The theoretical framework for the 3D prediction algorithm is also laid out.<br/>Once the mesh quality is predicted, based on a user-defined threshold, if the quality is deemed to be poor in a certain region then localized corrections are implemented to improve the mesh quality. These corrections are introduced in the form of enrichment functions on additional control points within the domain. The gradient of the deformation function is constrained using these functions such that a good quality and smooth mesh deformation is obtained post-deformation. Multiple enrichment functions are initially tested in 1D in a global sense. The findings from this analysis are then carried forward to analyze where to introduce these additional control points for local corrections and the nature of the correction itself.<br/>Finally, the methodology is tested on 2D unstructured grids. It is found that the imposition of gradients is more complicated in the 2D sense as global information can not be used directly as in the 1D case. Therefore, a parametric study is performed to analyze if a logical conclusion can be made with regard to the imposition of the gradients. It is found that such a logical trend is not clear, therefore the strategy is modified such that the interpolation coefficients are imposed explicitly instead based on data available from eigen decomposition of the deformation gradients. It is found that this strategy performs admirably when compared to the results obtained from the standard RBF model. In conclusion, the method significantly improves the robustness of the mesh deformation process by ensuring that large deformations can be accommodated in the domain without huge computational costs.<br","mesh deformation; Radial Basis Function; Fluid Structure Interaction; CFD; enrichment functions; mesh quality prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

While superhydrophobic and liquid-infused surfaces are capable of drag reduction in turbulent hydrodynamic flows, neither would be feasible in aerodynamic applications due to the added roughness and the minuscule slip lengths created by the unfavourable viscosity ratio between the liquid and air. This thesis explores the novel idea of liquid-infused superhydrophobic surfaces (LISHySs). These surfaces use liquid droplets held in superhydrophobic features to induce slip at the air-liquid interface while reducing resistance to the motion of the liquid within the cavity.<br/><br/>Since no framework existed on the drag-reducing mechanism of such a surface, this was devised and the parameters of importance were identified. These were seen to be the area of the air-liquid interface, the exposed and submerged areas of the droplets in the cavities, and the degree of superhydrophobicity of the surface. Two types of LISHySs were consequently designed - one with spherical droplets and another with spanwise cylindrical droplets. These were produced by 3D printing surfaces with cavities and applying a superhydrophobic coating, into which water was infused.<br/><br/>Direct force measurements on the surface showed an increase in the drag coefficient (between 10% and 17%) with respect to a smooth reference surface. While PIV for the flow over this surface showed an increase in mean streamwise velocity and a decrease in Reynolds stress in the overlap layer, the high degree of reflection produced by the surface meant that meaningful near-wall data could not be obtained. Observations of the air-liquid interface demonstrated that the hypothesised steady rolling motion of liquid droplets occurred at low freestream velocities, but this was observed to become more chaotic at higher velocities. Pressure drag due to droplets acting as roughness elements, among other reasons, further contributed to the total drag produced.<br/><br/>While the results showed that the current implementation of LISHySs was unsuccessful, the lessons from this first attempt point to the directions in which future studies could be made. Cylindrical droplets oriented in the streamwise direction offer high potential due to the creation of streamwise slip. Advancements in the fields of material science and hydrophobicity would allow for surfaces with finer cavities that exhibit higher superhydrophobicity to be produced. Measures such as these would pave the way for the passive reduction of turbulent drag through the novel concept of LISHySs.","turbulent boundary layer; drag reduction; passive flow control; liquid-infused superhydrophobic surface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-28","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Each task is fulfilled by a different algorithm with its own performance indices. These algorithms are not usually designed to get the best overall vehicle performance but the best performance of their respective blocks. A planned path that the vehicle cannot follow can therefore be generated and can lead to high tracking error and in some cases collision with obstacles. This can be solved by integrating path planning and vehicle control blocks with the dynamics of the AV.<br/><br/>The goal of this graduation project is therefore to develop an integrated planning and vehicle control algorithm for an Autonomous Vehicles (AV). This is done by integrating a novel-Artificial Potential Fields (APF) with Model Predictive Control (MPC) to solve both path planning and vehicle control using a single optimization problem. The addition of the AV and the Obstacle Vehicle (OV) dynamics to the optimization problem as prediction models along with recursive computation can determine accurate inputs to be given to the AV.<br/><br/>Unlike traditional APF-based path planning where the minimum potential path is generated as the result of a gradient descent method applied on the available map data and obstacle information, the APF is added as a cost to the objective function of the MPC based optimization problem to find the minimum potential path. By using a receding horizon approach for solving the final optimization problem, the potential field can be updated at each time step to avoid moving obstacles. The dynamics of the vehicle added to the optimization problem include both lateral and longitudinal dynamics and are linearized at each time step at the current state of the AV.<br/><br/>This however generates a path which does not travel in the centre of the lane and makes risky manoeuvres. Therefore, a Mixed-Integer Model Predictive Control (MIMPC) algorithm with logical constraints is used to generate an optimal lane to travel in. This optimal lane is used to generate a road potential which can guide the vehicle to the centre of the optimal lane. The MIMPC and the APF-MPC algorithms are run successively to generate a collision-free path.<br/><br/>The logical constraints, also called MLD constraints are converted into a set of linear inequalities with the introduction of logical variables. These logical variables are used to represent individual logical constraints based on the states of the system and on a combination of logical and state constraints. A novel-APF inspired by the Yukawa Potential [?] is designed to represent each obstacle. A convex representation of this non-convex obstacle potential is formulated to simplify the optimization problem. The convex representation of the obstacle APF is obtained by approximating it using a region-based APF where the region is defined by the position of the AV around the obstacle. This is further simplified by approximation using a quadratic Taylor-series expansion.<br/><br/>The simulation was performed on MATLAB on a two-lane road with multiple obstacles. The thesis report ends with a discussion on future work to be taken to further enhance the performance of the controller and to make it road-ready.","Model Predictive Control; Mixed Integer Programming; Artificial Potential Fields","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Damage to those objects will result in delay and cancellation of trains. Therefore, the maintenance of the objects is important to ensure the safety of railway operations, and the key to maintenance is to know the accurate position of the objects. RILA - a railway mobile mapping system developed by Fugro - provides continuous monitoring of the rail environment without interrupting the daily operation of rail tracks. The RILA dataset contains different types of data including video frames, point clouds, and measurement trajectories from the Global Navigation Satellite System and Inertial Measurement Unit (GNSS-IMU). This enables a remote and automatic object positioning process based on object recognition in video frames and positioning using photogrammetric techniques.<br/><br/>Most of the rail trackside objects are parts of the railway electrification system and the railway signaling system. The available ground truth data contains more information about signaling objects, so this thesis mainly focuses on the positioning of signaling objects. Three typical components: signal lights, railway cabinets, and railway side markers are selected to make case studies and develop the object detection and localization pipeline for them.<br/><br/>There are two main issues that existed in former research: One is object recognition only gives a 2D pixel position for an object, but we want to know its 3D position in the world; the other is the contextual information between frames is ignored in object positioning. Based on that, this thesis developed a new workflow: firstly, this thesis proposes the use of an existing 3D object detection model, Single-Stage Monocular 3D Object Detection via Keypoint Estimation (SMOKE), to recognize objects of interest from the RILA video frames. This model can not only predict an object's 2D pixel position on the image, but also its 3D position with respect to the camera. This enables the localization of an object in each of the frames it is detected in, which provides redundancy to define its final position. Secondly, this thesis developed a pipeline to clean the detection output of SMOKE so that most false detections can be removed. In addition, this thesis developed a method to use the contextual information in image sequences to position objects: first, extract the sequences by classifying all the predictions in the detection output through the Euclidean distances, then for each sequence, analyze the varying trend of predicted positions to select reliable positions. The mean of the selected positions is the final improved position of that object. By making tests on a part of the railway near Ely, UK, with 2983 frames, the workflow detected and positioned all of the 4 signal lights, all of the 10 markers, and 13 of the 14 cabinets in the testing dataset. Most signal lights and cabinets can be positioned within 1 meter to the ground truth, and the mean positioning offset for the railway side markers can be controlled around 2 meters. Complex scenarios could be solved, when up to three cabinets were located close together.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-28","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","52.41469393, 0.29598187"

The tests have shown that rubber has the highest energy dissipation capacity and fairly unstable behaviour, steel has the second highest energy dissipation and irregular behaviour and aramid has the lowest energy dissipation performance and very consistent behaviour. Finally, the application of a method that calculates the energy dissipation of friction damping based on direct experimental outputs is an important contribution to the field regarding experimental investigations.","Friction damping; Steady-state response; Energy dissipation; Coulomb friction; Mass-Spring System","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Due to its high energy density and flexibility, it can be employed to make electronic devices self-powered by ambient mechanical energy in many application scenarios, such as biomedical devices, wearable electronics, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors. However, it is challenging to extract electrical energy from TENG due to its time-varying and low internal capacitance. IC technology is advantageous in triboelectric energy harvesting (TEH) and power management with low leakage current and active harvesting configurations. Currently, studies on dedicated integrated power conversion techniques are very limited. Due to the exponentially increasing research interests in TENG, a comprehensive study on the TENG energy harvesting system, emphasizing IC power conversion techniques, is urgently needed. <br/><br/>Therefore, this project contains two parts. The first part is summarizing and comparing the state-of-the-art in TEH, as well as the advanced techniques employed in other kinetic energy harvesting such as piezoelectric and electrostatic energy harvesting. The potential of mature IC energy extraction techniques in TEH is emphasized. This part of work is collected and summarized in a literature review, which is being reviewed by IEEE Transactions on Circuit and System: I. For the rest of this thesis, a dedicated TEH interface employing Synchronized-Switch harvesting on Capacitor (SSHC) and Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) working at 70 V is proposed, with theoretical analysis, design details, and simulated performance elaborated in this thesis. This is the first fully-integrated active rectifier reported for TEH. It is going to be fabricated on April 2023.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-02-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

Housing is in high demand as a result of factors such as population growth, rapid urbanization, smaller households, the freezing of ""mobility in houses, and so on. The low developing speed to cater to these issues might instigate an investigation into possible adjustments to the current building methods to increase the rate of housing production.<br/><br/>The building sector has the potential to fulfil these demands by becoming more product-driven, efficient and sustainable, which are said to be attainable with the use of modular construction (Bertham et al., 2019). However, traditionally, the building industry is characterized as a project-driven industry with unique characteristics such as location-bound design, one-of-a-kind/unique production, changing partnerships per project, outdoor and environmental factors, and multiple clients and suppliers involved in a single project. These characteristics conflict with the product-driven ambitions, leading to negative effects on performance such as low levels of effectiveness and efficiency, low rates of innovation and difficulties in knowledge sharing and learning.<br/>This research explores the potential benefits of vertical integration in modular construction value chains. The study is based on an empirical single case study of an integrated modular building company in the Netherlands. The case study examines the implementation of vertical integration in the modular building company, and its impact on the project- and product value chains.<br/><br/>To achieve effective vertical value chain integration during the development phase, the industry needs to focus on synergy, competency, and organization and adopting the appropriate production system fitting to their organization, product and production profile. Synergy involves establishing a clear and structured collaboration structure between departments, early involvement of key parties, and having a systematic approach to the project. Competency involves having adequate experience in the modular construction industry, defining a modular design system with configurable designs, and focusing on modular design systems with configurable elements, design flexibility, and efficient and streamlined production processes. Organization involves establishing unambiguous guidelines and expectations for each phase of the project, creating a comprehensive project plan that clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of each team member, and identifying the primary coordinator for each phase. Additionally, it is essential to have a supportive and collaborative company culture with trust among employees, morale and motivation, and leadership that encourages and facilitates cooperation and collaboration across different departments and locations for all factors to thrive.<br/><br/>Based on the modular construction goal, fitting product and production characteristics were explored, which resulted in defining appropriate production systems. The focus on modular design systems with configurable products and the need for design flexibility described in the product description align with the characteristics of assemble-to-order production. The emphasis on product-oriented and project-oriented approaches, as well as the need for design consistency and efficient translation to production, aligns with the characteristics of make-to-order production. <br","modular construction; value chain integration; product-based; project-based; production systems; construction; manufacturing; cross-functional departments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-28","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

As the market moves towards AI-based solutions, so does the computation need for these solutions increase and change with time. With the rise of smart cities and cyberphysical systems, the need for edge devices and efficient computation on the edge increases. While most of these newly developed deep learning models are quite large and wasteful in terms of energy, there have been recent methods that help improve the performance on the edge. However, due to their size, variety, and irregularity, the computing and power requirements are often too large to deploy these models on edge devices. This prohibits the application of such models within a rich field of application that requires high-throughput and real-time execution. <br/> <br/>SENeCA (Scalable Energy Efficient Neuromorphic Computing Architecture) is a next-generation RISC-V-based neuromorphic computing architecture that was designed primarily for ultralow-edge applications where adaptivity is required.

CCA commonly metastasizes to the lungs and lymph nodes, significantly reducing overall survival. However, a mechanistic understanding of how CCA invades these metastatic sites remains lacking. This is partly due to the failure of current models to recapitulate the complexity of tissue-specific environments for metastatic CCA. Patient-derived tumor organoids are promising models for studying cancer in vitro, including CCA. However, organoids are frequently cultured in basement membrane extract (BME), which does not represent the native microenvironment. Decellularized scaffolds can serve as a culture environment for investigating tumor-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. Nonetheless, decellularized scaffolds are often utilized in conjunction with cancer cell lines, lacking critical characteristics of a growing tumor in vivo. Therefore, this study aims to decellularize and characterize human-derived lung (n=3) and lymph nodes (n=17), and recellularize these with patient-derived CCA organoids (CCAOs) (n=3) to establish an in vitro model for studying the interaction between epithelial tumor cells and the microenvironment of the metastatic site. Decellularization resulted in acellular scaffolds with preserved ECM components. Local ECM heterogeneity was shown by the macro- and micro-scale mechanical properties as determined by rheology and micro-indentation. The CCAOs showed adherence and growth when combining them with the decellularized lung ECM (dLECM). The metabolic activity of CCAOs was diminished when cultured in dLECM compared to those cultured in BME, and was dictated both by the organoid line and the dLECM donor. Distinct CCAO gene expression profiles were observed between the two culture environments (BME and dLECM). This elucidates the effect of the culture environment on the behavior of CCAOs in an in vitro model. In conclusion, the convergence of CCAOs with their organ-specific location of metastasis obtained by decellularization, provides a valuable tool for integrating the ECM of the metastatic location in an in vitro model for the mechanistic study of cancer metastasis.","decellularization; cholangiocarcinoma organoids; extracellular matrix; metastasis; recellularization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-28","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","","51.910144, 4.4660355"

The dynamic power cables, which interconnect turbines and transport the generated electricity, are under large dynamic stresses due to the environmental loads and the motion of the floating platform. Limited knowledge about the structural behaviour of these cables is available, which is why there is need for new analysis and design methods. This MSc thesis presents a method for the preliminary design optimization of the dynamic power cable configuration. A parametric model of a dynamic power cable is built in the commercial software package OrcaFlex, from which motions, loads and fatigue on the cable can be calculated. Following that, a radial basis function model-based optimization algorithm is applied to find the optimal cable configuration for an arbitrary environmental scenario. The key performance indicator here is fatigue damage on the copper conductor, which is expected to be critical due to the cyclic loading on the cable and the poor mechanical properties of copper. Experiments are carried out to test the optimization model’s validity in terms of convergence, robustness and efficiency. The final method is capable of consistently finding a near-optimal dynamic power cable configuration design within reasonable time. Additionally, findings are presented about the fatigue behaviour of the DPC, what causes the fatigue damage and how to mitigate the effects.","Floating offshore wind turbine; dynamic power cable; model-based optimization; fatigue analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

Preoperative patient-specific finite element (FE) modelling of fracture fixation may help to minimize these complications. However, developing such models requires labour-intensive work including (manual) segmentation of bones from medical images, making them unpractical for clinical applications. This study aims to establish a semi-automated workflow for the development of three-dimensional (3D) patient-specific FE models of long bone fractures based on two-dimensional (2D) X-ray images and patient characteristics.<br/><br/>Methods: A statistical shape model (SSM) of the tibia was developed based on computed tomography (CT) scans of subjects without tibial fractures. Using this model, shape parameters were correlated to patient characteristics, including gender, age, weight, and height of the subjects, using multilinear regression. Thereafter, strategies were developed to (1) fit the SSM of the tibia to a previously unseen fractured tibia based on two orthogonal X-rays and patient characteristics to estimate its intact 3D shape, and to (2) automatically model the fracture lines as detected on the X-rays in the intact tibia model. Using the automatically created geometries of the fractured tibia, FE models of the stabilized fracture were developed in Abaqus/CAE and used to investigate strains within the callus under post-operative loading conditions. The workflow was tested on one patient and the strains obtained from the FE models within the fracture region were compared to strains reported in the literature.<br/><br/>Results: An SSM of the tibia was successfully developed based on CT scans of 25 subjects (15 male, age = 60 ± 5.5; 10 female, age = 51 ± 7.1). The first five shape modes captured 90% of the total shape variation in the studied population. Significant correlations were found between the first shape mode, which described shape changes in the tibial length, and patient gender, age, weight, and height. SSM-to-patient fitting was achieved with a mean error of 0.81 mm and a maximum error of 4.22 mm. FE analysis of the stabilized fracture predicted inter-fragmentary compressive strains between 0 and 10% with a median value of 2%. Increasing the fixation working length by 13 mm, led to a 10-fold increase in the predicted median compressive strains.<br/><br/>Discussion and Conclusions: A workflow for the semi-automated generation of FE models of tibia fractures was successfully established. Patient-specific FE analysis results predicted strains within the fracture in a range reported for optimal bone formation. Additionally, predicted strains were highly dependent on the fixation configuration and material, most notably the fixation working length. Future work should focus on fully automating the suggested workflow and on the validation of the results. Ultimately, such a workflow could be used to formulate individualized treatment recommendations during the early pre- and post-operative phase in tibial fracture management to prevent non-union development.","bone fracture fixation; preoperative planning; osteosynthesis; computer-assisted; finite element modeling; patient-specific; Statistical Shape Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-03-01","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Despite advancements in research, the possibilities for miniaturisation, specific control, speed, and universal gripping capabilities still pose significant challenges. This study aims to overcome these obstacles by embedding magnetic intelligence within the material of a suction gripper and enabling the actuation of the attachment by an external magnetic field.<br/> In this study, magnetic responsive soft materials are explored and different suction mechanisms are designed and validated to explore the opportunities of a magnetically actuated suction gripper. The miniaturisation options of the gripper are improved by implementing a compliant deploying mechanism. This results in the design of a magnetic actuated deployable suction gripper, using a thin magnetic membrane consisting of carbonyl iron particles in a silicone matrix material, in a frame of superelastic nitinol providing pressure on the rim and allowing for deploying. <br/> A proof-of-principle prototype has been experimentally validated for attachment performance on a variety of curved surfaces in both dry and wet environments. <br/> The attachment was achieved on curved surfaces with a radius of 50mm and 75mm, with a maximum attachment force of 2.89 \textpm 0.54 N. Observation suggests that only on surfaces with a curvature that is positioned exactly at the rim of the gripper attachment is not possible. For these surfaces, the nitinol wire rim prevented the flexible footprint membrane to seal onto the surface and leakage occurred. <br/> The current gripper design is able to achieve a 75\% folding percentage, which allows it to enter hard-to-reach places in a small configuration while remaining enough surface area for attachment forces. <br/>The proposed prototype serves as a foundation for further research in the development of reliable and effective magnetic-actuated suction grippers in a variety of configurations.","Suction gripping; Magnetic intelligence; Compliant deploying gripper","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-02-28","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Pourquie, M.J.B.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Pollution in urban environments is increasingly becoming a major concern for our societies which, together with the increasingly powerful capabilities provided by computational fluid dynamics (CFD), has made pollution dispersion a common topic of research during the last two decades. Several factors are relevant to the dispersion of pollutants in an urban environment, such as the variable roughness of the urban canopy and the thermal stratification conditions. However, the effects of these two factors are only partially understood, especially when it comes to their combined effects. <br/><br/>The present research work has been motivated by an unintuitive strengthening of the streamwise-elongated coherent structures of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), observed by Jayaraman &amp; Brasseur (2021), for a certain range of weakly unstable thermal stratification conditions. Such observation evinced the existence of a sweet-spot where the large-scale streamwise-oriented counter-rotating vortical structures, characteristic of any turbulent boundary layer, were able to strengthen themselves by collecting small-scale thermal plumes, eventually creating the so-called large-scale atmospheric rolls. The importance of these findings lies in the fact that large-scale atmospheric rolls are known to be one of the most important structures when it comes to vertical transport of momentum and scalars (i.e. pollutants) in the ABL.<br/><br/>Following from this observation, we hypothesize that the counter-rotating roll structures behind a high-rise building could potentially exhibit a similar behaviour and strengthen themselves under weakly unstable thermal stratification conditions by collecting small-scale thermal plumes. If this was the case, it would enhance large-scale vertical mixing which could be beneficial for street canyon ventilation, reducing urban pollution levels. Therefore, the importance of studying the evolution of the roll structures behind a high-rise building under different thermal stratification conditions becomes evident.<br/><br/>In this regard, the present work has focused on the study of the roll structures behind a high-rise building under different thermal stratification conditions, by means of wall-resolved Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) using the Nek5000 Spectral Element Method (SEM) code. The present work has succeeded in providing a qualitative proof of concept of the presented hypothesis, proving that the rolls behind a surface-mounted cube (model for a high-rise building) under weakly unstable thermal stratification conditions do strengthen themselves in a similar manner as observed by Jayaraman &amp; Brasseur (2021) for the ABL. Moreover, a reliable LES numerical model for simulating flow past a surface-mounted cube (high-rise building) has been built and thoroughly validated against DNS data, tuning the optimal mesh, and simulation and filtering settings.<br","LES; unstable thermal stratification; urban flows; Nek5000; spectral element method; large-scale atmospheric rolls; surface-mounted cube; pollutant dispersion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy, Flow and Process Technology","",""

It has previously been shown that continuous piecewise affine (PWA) functions, conjunctive MMPS functions (also lattices- or min-max functions) and kripfganz MMPS functions (difference between two convex functions) can each describe the same function. Each form has its own specific use cases and benefits and thus it may be desired to rewrite a specific function described in one form, into another. Current techniques are input dependent and not available for each combination, while some techniques blow the number of parameters. The technique presented in this thesis however is input and output independent and rigid in its construction. It fills up the gaps where some realisation were not possible yet, it generates a rigid and predictable output. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of each form are proposed. Additionally, it is explained how redundant terms may be removed in order to ensure a minimal representation. An algorithm is given for the decomposition and for the construction of each canonical form and supported with some worked examples. The decomposition provides the tools to efficiently map between different descriptions.","MMPS; finest-base-regions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The aim of this thesis was to overcome some of the limitations of current 3D-MEA devices and develop structures approaching the stiffness of the brain microenvironment, by using materials softer than conventional Silicon.A polymeric 3D-MEA was designed and developed by means of an innovative combination of two-photon polymerization (2PP), a 3D printing technology with sub-micrometer resolution, and standard wafer-level microfabrication methods from the semiconductor industry. Two novel fabrication protocols were developed, the first being a combination of 2PP with high-aspect ratio photolithography, which, though feasible, proved to require an inconveniently laborious process flow. The second fabrication process employed instead 2PP to fabricate the polymeric structures, pattern the microelectrodes, and provide electrical insulation. The 2PP-based process flow was ultimately preferred due to its potential for fabrication of structures of higher aspect ratio and geometrical complexity for 3D-MEA, extending their measurement resolution. Furthermore, a wafer-level alignment routine was developed with an alignment repeatability of 2PP structures of ±5 µm, which enabled the multi-step 2PP fabrication process. A novel maskless photolithography via 2PP process was also developed to pattern thin films over slanted surfaces, utilizing photoresist and glycerol-based immersion optics. The resulting 3D-MEA consisted of 15 printed polymeric pyramids featuring a total of 60 gold microelectrodes. The electrical insulation of the traces was partially successful, and will require further process development.The results demonstrate the feasibility of merging, for the first time, the 2PP process with standard wafer-level microfabrication techniques, specifically for the fabrication of a 3D-MEA for in vitro studies of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) neuronal cultures. The 2PP-based solutions provided in this thesis show a promising pathway for the development of more complex and biomimetic 3D-MEAs. More generally, the developed wafer-level alignment routine and maskless photolithography via 2PP process for high-aspect ratio structures contribute to advance the field of microfabrication, and may enable the development of other types of innovative microdevices.","3D multi-electrode array (3D-MEA); Two-photo polymerization (2PP); micro-fabrication; Brain-on-chip (BoC); Organ-on-chip (OoC)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-03-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Precision and Microsystems Engineering","",""

By strategically constructing and reconstructing an ephemeral network of stationary robots and relocating the rest of the robots throughout this network, swarms performing CSP can efficiently find targets with minimal risk of fracturing the network.

Adding a seawards facing overhang at the top of crownwalls has successfully reduced overtopping even further without increasing the freeboard of the crownwall. Crownwalls with a fully curved (FC) face are most often used in seawalls where they are subjected to wave load by breaking waves. However, it has recently become of interest to explore the possibility of using the fully curved shape for vertical breakwater crownwalls instead of a crownwall with a recurve (R). This thesis aimed to investigate further the wave loading by non-breaking waves and the dynamic response of a FC crownwall on a vertical breakwater through an offline one-way coupling of a CFD-generated pressure-time series and a FEM model in Diana FEA. The results were then compared to those of other studies on the wave load and dynamic response of a R crownwall. Pressure-time series from CFD numerical simulations of three wave states (W5, W6 and W7) were analysed to determine how the structure was loaded. The analysis of the pressure-time series showed that for the smallest wave state, W5, the pressure distribution at the moment of maximum total force was trapezoidal. However, for the larger wave states, W6 and W7, there was a pressure peak at the top of the curve of the crownwall due to the C-CI phenomenon. Waves with impulsive pressure and force impacts were found in all wave states, and the pressure and force impulses were much less variable than the maximum pressure and force values. Dynamic nonlinear analysis showed the fully curved crownwall cracks under wave load by wave states 6 and 7. Cracking occurs at the centre of the curve, where the largest tensile stresses are located. Comparing the results to those of the recurved crownwall, it was concluded that the fully curved crownwall was less favourable than the recurved crownwall. For the same wave states, the FC crownwall was subjected to larger wave forces than the R crownwall, which led to a larger bending moment exerted on the structure. The FC crownwall is also larger than the R crownwall, with the same freeboard, and therefore requires more use of concrete. Due to the shape of the FC crownwall, the maximum tensile stresses are 2.5-3 times higher than those in the R crownwall. More use of steel reinforcement bars is therefore also needed. It would, however, be interesting to investigate further FC crownwalls on vertical breakwaters with different geometries, e.g. radius of the curve, to see if their design can be improved. The applicability of the extended Goda method for calculating static wave load on recurved crownwalls was also investigated for the FC crownwall. It was found that for waves with wave steepness less than 6% and vertical wave velocity less than 2.4 m/s, the calculation method could be used for a preliminary design. However, the dynamic response of the structure must be addressed in the final design, e.g. with a dynamic analysis or the DAF method.","Crownwall; Breakwater; Wave load; Pressure; DIANA FEA; Finite element analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""

However, the major drawback in the use of compliant mechanisms is the stiffness is the desired direction of motion. The advantages of conventional and compliant mechanisms can be combined if the stiffness can be reduced or ideally removed, resulting in a zero-stiffness compliant mechanism. In current designs of zero-stiffness mechanisms, a preload is applied in the stiffest (compression) direction of a flexible beam. This working principle is based on Euler buckling. In this work, compliant mechanisms with zero-stiffness behaviour are obtained using lateral torsional buckling as their working principle. For this purpose, two compliant joints are modelled in a FEA, a translational and a rotational joint. The results of the FEA are verified by experiments. Also, a sensitivity analysis is performed on the cross-sectional dimensions of the flexible beams to optimize the range of zero-stiffness. Both types of joints showed zero-stiffness behaviour for the optimal preload and a good agreement is found between simulations and experiments. From the sensitivity analysis is found that a rectangular cross-section results in the largest range of zero-stiffness.","Lateral torsional buckling; Compliant mechanisms; Zero-stiffness; Translational joint; Rotational joint","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-02-24","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

Therefore, this research presents a teleoperated semi-autonomous controller which assists the user with remote grasping by relieving the user from controlling the grip force. Our design enables the user (1) to control the position of the remote gripper while (2) the system controls the grip force autonomously. When the user grasps an object, the semi-autonomous controller maintains the grip force based on tactile feedback to prevent object slippage. For tactile feedback, our system uses a tactile sensor that can detect incipient slippage from deformations at the location of the contact. With two experiments, we show that the system can maintain an adequate grip force while being robust to external perturbations and input changes. Since this controller stably grasps objects while the user maintains control over the position of the remote robot, our method relieves the user and prevents object slippage","teleoperation; Grasping; adaptive impedance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Cognitive Robotics","",""

Although light is helpful, dark nights are also needed. Not only did humankind use the position of stars to navigate or measure time, but it also inspired the artistic and philosophical aspects of wonder and awe at night. This thesis project started with a personal fascination for the night sky. The research focuses on the consequences of using artificial light at night. Light not only prohibits sight of the stars but also negatively impacts both flora and fauna.<br/>Moreover, that is not the only effect of artificial light at night. The natural human experience of the night also changes due to excessive light use. Darkness is being pushed out of the nocturnal experience under the belief that light leads to safety, while research shows no significant correlation between light and actual safety.<br/>Light use at night is continuing. As recent studies show, artificial light at night is increasing by 6% a year on a global scale, causing an increase in light pollution issues. Therefore, this report argues that we are losing the night. It describes the harmful effects of light on nocturnal ecology, human health, and the nocturnal landscape experience. This subject is gaining more interest in recent years but is still underrated and not (yet) put on the agenda of governments and municipalities as much as this report argues that it should. This report aims to contribute to a raising awareness for the topic and as an example of possible explorations of how to treat the experience of the night and nocturnal ecology in design by creating dark connections, transitions in the landscape, and new spatial lighting guidelines for the urban context. The goal is not to switch off light but to examine different possibilities of using light in a night-friendly way. Ultimately, this report could be a sound principle for nocturnal urban design and how to deal with the far-stretching consequences lurking in the light.","nocturnal ecology; nocturnal landscape experience; light pollution; streetlight; the night sky; stars; transitional lighting zone; spatial lighting guidelines; artificial light at night","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","","52.085161, 4.273281"

(mentor); Schneegass, C.S. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Dementia is an umbrella term for progressive loss of cognitive abilities, which mainly affects elderly- affecting relationships, feelings and behaviour. A person living with dementia (PLWD) might forget the names of their grandchildren, the face of their loved ones, important places and life events. Due to the rising population growth with more than 55 million people living with dementia (8.1 % of women and 5.4% of men over 65 years) and increasing life expectancies, dementia is already recognized by the WHO (World Health Organization) as a public health priority, and it is now the 7th leading cause of death (WHO, 2021).<br/> <br/> The population pressure that care homes are currently under cannot be easily remedied without significant monetary investment into the manpower of the industry. Therefore it would be more fruitful to enable PLWD to function more independently from the help of their carers.<br/><br/> VR technology has seen immense growth in the last 10 years especially within the field of child and elderly care. Although dementia has been understood since 700BCE, the decrease in stigma has allowed the current era of dementia care to flourish using music, art and drama therapy- amongst other person-centred care techniques. Combining these reminiscence therapy techniques with the booming technology of VR is therefore the next logical step in improving immersion. To this end, VR offers control and consistency in testing virtual environments that guarantee safety. However, a key obstacle in the uptake of VR for PLWD is the risk of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia- negative behaviours. To reduce these behaviours, a balance must be struck between stimulation and overload- namely stress. <br/><br/> Emotion classification models were established using the valence-arousal circumplex model before identifying the physiological embodiments of such emotion. Of the stress sensing technology surveyed, electromyography was the only technology reviewed that showed evidence of accurate, low-latency, sensation of arousal and valence by way of measuring contractions in the trapezius and zygomaticus muscles respectively.<br/><br/> To design a conducive VR environment, overarching goals for reminiscence in VR were identified as presence, occupation, comfort, inclusion and novelty. The method of reminiscence therapy was broken down into three forms- place, object and interaction based.

It is possible to discover useful information for network transportation planning, such as forecasting demand, finding bottlenecks, and prioritizing infrastructure improvements, by concentrating on network-wide traffic prediction.<br/><br/>Scholars have developed a variety of methods that can be generally divided into model-based and data-based methods in order to accurately predict network-wide traffic. However, while studies have demonstrated the capability of deep learning methods, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in predicting traffic states, the complex nonlinear spatial and temporal traffic characteristics, the time-consuming model creation and training, and the unexplained methodology and predictions continue to pose challenges to the task. <br/><br/>This thesis seeks to address these issues by analyzing how deep neural networks identify spatiotemporal traffic patterns for network-wide traffic predictions. To this end, a hybrid CNN-RNN model utilizing a pretrained Inception ResNet v2 feature extractor and a long short-term memory encoder-decoder is constructed to forecast network traffic speeds. A pretrained Inception ResNet v2-based image classifier is built based on the predictions to identify traffic patterns, and Grad-CAM is used to explore how the model identifies them. A freeway network in Amsterdam, Netherlands, is used as a case study. <br/><br/>While it is expected that the hybrid CNN-RNN model can give comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods, e.g. the DGCN proposed by Li et al., results indicate that it cannot fully capture the<br/>dynamic characteristics of the traffic, nor can it accurately provide predictions. The image classifier failed to identify the distinct traffic patterns as well, despite Grad-CAM's success in indicating locations with rapid changes of values. <br/><br/>Overall, the findings highlight the influence of inductive bias on deep learning models, and the importance of fine-tuning and model-data compatibility. Although further research is required, the conclusions are still beneficial to make informed decisions when choosing appropriate models for future network-wide traffic speed prediction tasks.","Deep Learning; traffic forecasting; Transfer Learning; Neural Network; Explainable AI; Image Classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

Analysis of aviation intensity, quality of satellite retrievals, and emissions from non-aviation anthropogenic sources showed that the North Atlantic, including the North Atlantic Flight Corridor, would have high detection potential. Over this corridor, emissions from telemetric observed aircraft are computed under assumption of stable meteorology leading to an upper bound for the average accumulation of emissions for the months of April 2020 and April 2021.

When it is known that only a single target is present, the matched filter is proven to be optimal detector. However, in practice, a radar scene often consists of multiple targets. For example, in air surveillance and monitoring applications, multiple aircrafts might be in the airspace. When multiple targets are to be detected the matched filter is not guaranteed to give the best results. This can happen when a strong reflector masks the signals reflected from weak reflectors, thereby resulting in missed detections. Furthermore, when the sensor resolution is low, targets that are spaced closely together may only result in a single target actually being detected. This research explores how the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) framework may be used to achieve a better multi-target detector than the commonly used basic matched filter approach. RVM was selected to resolve the multi-target detection problem as it estimates the target locations iteratively. In this research it was shown how the RVM framework can be used to model the fluctuation of swerling I/II targets. Additionally, the RVM algorithm was modified to incorporate a notion of statistical thresholding. Simulations show that using RVM the false alarm rate can be reduced and target locations can be more accurately recovered compared to other existing methods in case of multiple swerling I/II fluctuating targets. Furthermore, the proposed approach is shown to have a much lower convergence time compared to a similar expectation-maximization based method, namely Enhanced Sparse Bayesian Learning.","Multi-target detection; Statistical thresholding; Relevance vector machine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Patients with kidney failure usually need hemodialysis, which uses a machine to replace the function of a healthy kidney, to keep them alive and prolong their lives. In order to begin hemodialysis, it is crucial to prepare vascular access, which is a location in your body from which blood can be drawn and then returned at a high rate. People have found that the traditional ways of achieving vascular access will lead to a series of complications. So the newly designed Dynamic Arteriovenous system (DAS), which can control the opening and closing of the arteriovenous graft, was designed to solve the problem. Since the DAS is implanted under the skin of the human arm, it is hard for the operator to observe the status of the graft, so a monitoring system that can detect the graft status is needed.Objective:The goal of the research is to deisgn and evaluate a monitoring system for detecting the graft status of the DAS.Method: To solve the research problem, four sub-questions are proposed and solved to achieve possible concepts for the design. A Harris profile with grading criteria is set up to compare and determine the final concept to be developed. After building a test set-up for the final design, the design's effective range, accuracy, size, mass, usability, and detection success rate are evaluated. Results: The final design of the monitoring system consists of three sensors outside the body and two magnets in the DAS. The three sensors react to the position change of the magnets in the DAS and determine the relative position of the DAS under the skin and the status of the graft with the help of a User Interaction Interface. Through in-vitro tests, it is evaluated that the design meets most of the requirements and can be further developed if proper components are chosen and in-vivo tests are done. Conclusion: A relatively complete concept of the monitoring system and the corresponding User Interaction Interface are designed. Through a series of tests, it is believed to have the potential to be further developed and be useful to the DAS. In-vivo tests must be done to evaluate the system's biocompatibility before the clinical appliance.","Hemodialysis; Passive Implantable medical device; Monitoring system; Dynamic Arteriovenous system; Design and Evaluation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2028-02-23","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Instruments","",""

(mentor); Armbruster, Wolfgang (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","High-frequency combustion instabilities represent the main technical risk faced by design engineers when developing new chemical rocket propulsion systems. Such instabilities are driven by the coupling between the flames’ heat release rate and the combustion chamber’s acoustic field. As such, they can only be assessed during detailed design phases, making design iterations costly. Despite constant efforts being invested in developing numerical tools for their analysis, their reliable prediction remains a major issue. Furthermore, with the advent of the New Space industry, a need to cost-effectively analyze the stability of Hydrocarbon-based systems is stressed.<br/><br/>As a result, this work contributes towards the development of a reliable numerical framework to predict the onset of high-frequency combustion instabilities in liquid rocket engines by ameliorating their acoustic modeling. More specifically, the performance of a novel Linearized Navier-Stokes (LNS) solver in COMSOL is benchmarked against its established Helmholtz solver and validated against the data of two hot-fires of DLR’s LOX/CH4 LUMEN engine. Following a step-wise increase in modeling complexity and by investigating how the background flow description influences the results, sub-5% eigenfrequency errors were obtained. The results also showed that the moving background flow in rocket engines significantly reduces the eigenfrequencies, and that its influence can be accounted for by prescribing varying flow properties to the acoustic solvers. Besides achieving the most accurate eigenfrequency results for a LOX/CH4 system, a more representative velocity disturbance distribution is also attained with the LNS simulation, allowing future studies to better account for the influence of velocity fluctuations on the heat release rate driving the instabilities.<br","Rocket propulsion; rocket engine; Combustion Instability; Aeroacoustic; CFD; eigenmode analysis; Experimental validation; Combustion; Simulation; LOX/CH4; LUMEN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-06","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Space Flight","MSc Thesis",""

Repeated pitching has been associated with changes to kinematics, kinetics, and perceived fatigue, but no statistical model exists which incorporates all the most common aspects of fatigue into one framework. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) can be used to investigate possible fatigue frameworks and their plausibility in explaining the multivariate nature of observed changes occurring with repeated pitching. AIM: To investigate how multiple fatigue manifestations could be associated with a shared factor in baseball pitching. METHOD: Two CFA models were proposed; one a priori model based solely on previous findings and literature linking commonly found variables which change with repeated pitching, and one a posteriori model with added correlation factors between maximum external shoulder rotation (MER) with perceived fatigue and MER with triceps EMG activity. RESULTS: Model fitness test performed on the first a priori model proved plausible, with it passing some of the tests but failing others. The a posteriori model showed to be an excellent model for explaining the covariance of the data, passing all model fitness tests. CONCLUSIONS: Confirmatory factor analysis can serve to provide a plausible framework for explaining the covariance measured in kinematic, kinetic, and other fatigue related changes to baseball pitching data. Both models would suggest that the shared latent variable represents an underlying aspect of physiological fatigue. Changes to MER were determined to not be directly caused by fatigue. A proper understanding of different fatigue manifestations can potentially reduce the amount of fatigue related UCL injuries plaguing baseball pitchers by providing a more accurate proxy for measuring physiological fatigue.","Fatigue; Baseball; Pitching; Confirmatory factor analysis; UCL; Injury","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/ThomasBTHL/BTHL_public","","2024-03-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

Recent developments replaces the Silicon with Silicon Carbide as it results in superior performance of the power conversion applications. However, due to the increased performance, challenges regarding heat dissipation emerge and the lifetime of the power semiconductor packaging or power module is compromised. Since this leads to an increase power density, the cooling of the power module is becoming of more importance and the heat sink becomes an interesting component to optimize. The best performance of a heat sink can be obtained when the flow through the device is turbulent. Developing turbulent flow heat sinks by using topology optimization methods can significantly improve the cooling performance compared to the current designs. This work is thus aimed towards improving methods for topology optimization of turbulent flow cooling devices. However, this work focuses on turbulent flow topology optimization only and aims to improve the accuracy of current methods. It is important that the flow physics are accurate since the thermal energy transfer is dependent on the flow field. The current state-of-the-art method based on the &#x1d458;−&#x1d714; turbulence model developed by Dilgen et al. is investigated. A design domain is subdivided into elements since the finite element method (FEM) is used, such that an optimization algorithm is able to turn every element into either fluid or solid with the goal of finding the best performing structure. This density based approach, models the solid domain as a highly impermeably porous material. To inhibit flow in the solid domain a Darcy penalization is added to the momentum equation. Moreover, in the method by Dilgen et al. boundary conditions in the other turbulent fields are also enforced using a similar penalization approach. Weaknesses and errors in the density based method are investigated by comparing solutions to ones computed on a body fitted mesh. It has been found that the largest errors in the solution, by using the state-of-the-art method, appear at the solid/fluid interface in the design. In these regions the penalizations are not applied correctly for the desired boundary conditions. Therefore, in this work it is improved on by the enforcement of the boundary condition by using the Dilation method. The Dilation method focuses on the solid/fluid region where it shifts the boundary conditions for the specific dissipation rate (&#x1d714;) and ensures it reaches the desired value at the solid/fluid interface. Secondly, severe flow leakage is found in the “porous” solid domains using the state-of-the-art method. Flow leakage is reduced by using an improved formulation of the maximum Darcy penalization in the solid domain. Finally, the improved approach is investigated in several topology optimization cases and compared to the state-of-the-art Dilgen method. It is shown that by using the new approach, different designs with a better accuracy can be obtained. In an extreme test case, the Dilgen method resulted in an infeasible design which disconnects the flow inlets from the outlets while the new and improved method resulted in a feasible design.","Topology optimization; Density-based method; Fluid flow; Turbulence; Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-02-23","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Due to their recent growth spurt, it was found that Nacar is currently in a transition phase from being a small-sized agency to a medium-sized organisation. Due to this transition phase, Nacar faces new organisational challenges. This project aims to identify these challenges and develop a sustainable growth strategy that will allow the organisation to maintain its success in the long term.<br/><br/>The central focus of this graduation project is therefore to answer the research question: ""How can design agency Nacar create an effective transition strategy?"" The chosen approach involves engaging various stakeholders throughout the different phases of the project. This includes direct participation from employees across various business units, with validation from top management afterwards. To guide the research, two sub-questions are formulated to guide the process, aiming to find the obstacles and enablers of the transition that Nacar faces, as well as the organisational challenges Nacar encounters in facilitating the transition.<br/><br/>Nine insights are identified from the research, being obstacles, enablers, or challenges. To refine these insights, they are further categorised into three levels: operational, tactical, and strategic insights. After validating the research insights with top management, the following conclusion could be drawn: “There is a need to create a bridge between the perspective of the employees and the perspective of top management.” In order to develop this bridge, employee participation during the creation of a solution is crucial. Therefore employees are recruited for a workshop to share their input and ideas for the solution, after which a roadmap for 2025 is created, addressing the insights found during the research. By collecting both perspectives in this roadmap, a framework for the transition is created. <br/><br/>However, this roadmap does not provide directions or guidance for Nacar during the transition. Therefore three strategies are created in the shape of routes that can be taken within the roadmap. These strategies each prioritise a different strategic goal for 2025 and provide the path to achieve it. The strategies are validated to ensure they resonate with the perspective of the employees. After this validation, the final solution was created.<br/><br/>The transition strategy exists as a combination of the strategy with a business focus and the strategy with a people focus. This combination results in a strategy that aims to introduce a new innovation lab and optimise daily operations to improve the employee experience. Further recommendations are made to support the outcome in terms of advice on implementation and execution.<br/>Overall, this report provides a framework for designing an effective transition strategy that can help Nacar navigate the complexities of change in the future.<br","Organisational design; Growth strategy; Roadmapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The autoinjector, a device that aids in the self-administration of medication, is a product that belongs to this specific sector and emits 164 gr CO2 eq. per device originating from the use of raw materials in its production. In order to decrease the carbon footprint of this device a more circular approach is needed. One specific circular strategy is discussed namely, recycling. According to Plastic Recyclers Europe (2019), recycling plastic parts reduces the environmental footprint. Recycling knows two different methods namely, mechanical and chemical recycling. <br/>Mechanical recycling of a single material stream is an established form of recycling, that has the best ability to reduce emissions, and has the preference of experts <br/>In contrast, chemical recycling of which the most desirable sub-process called depolymerisation, only has the ability to recycle three plastics that reside within the product. Therefore, chemical recycling cannot be used as the sole process to recycle the materials of the autoinjector.<br/>From four scenarios that were presented to Alliance to Zero was confirmed that mechanical recycling of single material streams had the preference. In addition, the single material streams should be obtained through the disassembly of the product and the early separation of its components. <br/>These conclusions were used to construct a value chain that further explained which routes materials had to follow in order to get them to a recycler. Developing the value chain requires resources such as machinery and a physical space. However, due to the expected growth in production and therefore collection numbers of the autoinjector, some machines were suggested to switch towards a more industrialised process later on in the strategy. <br/>In addition, the amount of value captured through this process was optimized by looking at the recyclability of the materials. During this exploration, the polymers PA and POM were defined as plastics that are difficult to recycle. As a result, based on polymer specific properties, it was suggested that the PA component (5) could also be made with the polymer PBT, and the components made from POM (4, 7, 9, 10) with PC. <br/>Additionally, the plastic supplier and recycler Sabic was highlighted as an important partner in both returning plastic components to be entered into mechanical recycling, and helping increase the use of mechanically recycled plastic in the production of new devices. As a result, a partially closed loop was obtained.<br/><br/>To aid in the realization of the value chain, a strategic and material specific roadmap and a sustainable business model that communicate the strategic and entrepreneurial decisions were provided.<br/>Realizing the value chain resulted in 76,9 to 100 % of the autoinjectors materials being recycled and 39,03 to 51,17 % of its materials being circular. <br/>Consequently, value was created through a decrease in emissions of 32,21 to 46,17 g CO2 during the production of each autoinjector and the reuse of its valuable materials. <br/><br","Autoinjector; Mechanical recycling; Chemical recycling; Circular economy (CE)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-23","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The ultimate state capacity of the structures is important for an individual's safety, however, these earthquakes are of low intensity and cause aesthetic damage. <br/><br/>In order to investigate the light damage initiation and development, TNO has performed shaking table tests on an unreinforced masonry (URM) cavity wall specimen in out-of-plane (OOP) one-way bending with small increments in intensity. The test specimen consisted of calcium silicate brick inner leaf and perforated clay brick outer leaf. The damage development in the outer leaf was monitored during these tests using a high-speed digital image correlation (DIC) technique to study the initiation and development of damage in the outer leaf of the specimen. The experimental tests showed damage initiation at the mid-height of the outer leaf. The tests could not capture the development of cracks through the thickness of the cavity wall. <br/><br/>The scope of this research is a numerical assessment of the experimental study by using a Non-Linear Time History (NLTH) analysis of light damage initiation and development of a URM cavity wall under out-of-plane loading. The high-resolution experimental results are used as a basis for the development and calibration of models which can better predict the crack initiation and development in URM. The finite element software DIANA 10.5 FEA was used to set up the numerical model and conduct transient analysis.<br/><br/>The seismic signal as an input loading and the top boundary condition of the test specimen. The acceleration data measured from the shaking table tests at the base was used as an input seismic signal for the transient analysis of the models. The input signal needed to be processed before application as the presence of low-frequency content leaded to inaccurate results. Different approaches are discussed in this thesis regarding the processing of the input acceleration signal.<br/><br/>The experimental tests were modeled along the cross-section of the test specimen, thereby highlighting the thickness of the inner leaf and the outer leaf. This enabled tracking the light damage initiation and propagation through the thickness of the cavity wall. A total of thirteen shaking table tests were conducted on the experimental setup. In order to gain insight into the behavior of the specimen during each shaking table test, a model was created corresponding to each shaking table test. Preliminary analysis schemes were set in order to check the validity of all thirteen models. The two cases of top boundary conditions were checked, roller support and spring-mass support. The roller boundary condition proved to be stiff in comparison to the experimental results.<br/><br/>The numerical results were calibrated on the basis of material properties. The results were compared to experimental results by checking the dynamic behavior at the mid-height, dynamic behavior over the height, and light damage initiation and development of the specimen. The results of the numerical models were stiff in comparison to the experimental results. According to the conclusions, it is recommended to research further regarding the boundary conditions, especially the bottom boundary condition due to the formation of a rocking crack. Another important aspect to focus on is the combination of all input signals, thereby, taking into consideration the damage accumulation.","Light damage; Masonry; Out-of-plane behaviour; Numerical modeling; DIANA FEA; Transient Analyses; Cavity wall; Calibration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","AGE",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","With the increasing concerns of the emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants and the push towards sustainable and greener means of transportation, there is a need for new drive systems running on alternative fuels. One fuel that holds significant potential as a marine fuel for the future is methanol. When produced utilising carbon capture methods and green energy, it has the potential to be a net zero fuel. Among other high-potential future fuels, methanol has the added benefit of being liquid at room temperature. Additionally, methanol has the potential to be utilised in novel drive systems, such as the combination of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and a reciprocating internal combustion engine (ICE). This concept utilises the high efficiency and negligible NOx formation of the SOFC, while the ICE provides dynamic load capabilities. This study concentrates on the electrical efficiency of this type of plant for maritime applications. <br/>This work presents an in MATLAB &amp; Simulink constructed first principles based model of a methanol fuelled SOFC-ICE combined cycle. The zero-dimensional SOFC model consists of a temperature controlled methanator which maintains an external reforming ratio of 0.5; a cell mass balance; a cell energy balance, and an electrochemical model. The ICE model core consists of a turbocharged five-state Seiliger cycle. It simulates Wärtsilä 12V31DF fuelled with methanol and dehydrated hydrogen-rich anode of gas (AOG). The SOFC efficiency and its separate losses are evaluated for different temperatures, current densities, fuel utilisation factors UF and steam-to-fuel ratio’s in combined cycle operations. Additionally, the standalone SOFC performance, without the use of waste heat from the ICE and disuse of residual fuel in the AOG, is evaluated, but only for the nominal condition. The ICE efficiency and losses are evaluated for a power range between 1% and 100%. By varying the ammount of cells, the following power splits PSOFC/PICE have been evaluated: 0/100 25/75; 50/50; 75/25 and 100/0. The combined cycle performance is evaluated for different temperatures and current densities. <br/>This study found that while varying the steam-to-fuel ratio and fuel utilisation factor (UF) have minimal impact on the electrical efficiency of the SOFC in combined cycle operations, temperature and current density have a significant effect on the efficiency of the SOFC. For a steam-to-fuel ratio of 1:1, a UF of 0.8, a current density of 5000 A · m−2 and a mean cell temperature of 1073K an efficiency of 58.6% was obtained. The standalone SOFC, or 100/0 power split, obtained an efficiency of 48.4%. The stand-alone ICE genset, or 0/100 power split, operates at a nominal efficiency of 42.3%. When the ICE is used in a direct drive configuration, it corresponds to an efficiency of 43.6%. The combined cycle obtained efficiencies of 45.4%, 49.1% and 53.4% for 25/75, 50/50 and 75/25 power splits, respectively. These results are compared to the results of a similar study investigating an ammonia-fuelled SOFCICE combined cycle for maritime applications, which reported efficiencies of 47%, 50% and 52% for 25/75, 50/50 and 75/25 power splits, respectively, under similar operating conditions. <br/>The efficiency gain of the methanol-fuelled 75/25 configuration compared to the direct drive is limited. This raises the questions about whether the added complexity of introducing an SOFC is justified for the limited efficiency gain. The highest efficiency was obtained with the methanol-fuelled 75/25 power split, but due to the large proportion of SOFC power, it is less tolerant to dynamics in the load, making it questionable whether it can fully meet the dynamic power demand of a ship. Therefore, the 50/50 power split configuration is expected to be the most viable option in terms of both technological feasibility and efficiency gain. A change in the power split to 100/0 results in a decrease in system efficiency due to the lack of waste heat from the ICE and the inability to utilise residual fuel in the exhaust. When considering efficiency, the values for the ammonia fuelled and methanol fuelled plant are similar. <br/>The 50/50 powersplit configuration is 5.6 percentpoints more efficient than the methanol fuelled direct drive ICE and 1.2 percentpoints more efficient than the methanol-fuelled standalone SOFC. This clearly shows the synergistic benefits of combining a methanol-fuelled SOFC with an ICE. However, when compared to the ammonia fuelled combined cycle with 50/50 power split, it is 0.9 percentpoints less efficient. Nevertheless, it is important to exercise caution when drawing further conclusions from this last figure as the model has been constructed at a system level and no thorough uncertainty analysis has been conducted. Furthermore, the requirements regarding the power and energy density are strongly dependent on the type of ship and its operational profile. Therefore, future research should include the implementation of dynamic load capabilities in the model to evaluate its technological feasibility and overall net efficiency gain in various operational profiles of ships. Also, further research is required on the methanol-fuelled ICE cylinder process and the heat integration of the combined cycle.<br","Combined cycle; SOFC-ICE Hybrid System; Modelling; Maritime drive system; Methanol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-28","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Especially, the symmetric exclusion process with local perturbations was investigated. These perturbations, were in the form of sinks and sources, which add or take away particles at certain rates. Moreover, simulations were done for the asymmetric exclusion process. This process took place on a ring, with the addition of a source. For the symmetric exclusion process with sinks and sources, certain expressions were proven for the expected occupancy of a site. For the simulations, the main goal was to find out how the jumping rates and starting density, influenced the time to get to the fully occupied state, at different source rates. The first proof was for a source at an arbitrary site. From this expression, one could see that if the rates were recurrent, the system converged to the fully occupied state. If, however, the rates were transient, the system had a limiting density. Thereafter, it was shown that if a sink and source are placed in the same arbitrary site, the system always converged to a density, which under the Bernoulli measure, was not equal to the fully occupied state. The fact that the sink and source were in the same site, was an indispensable condition. Subsequently, the case of countably many sources was investigated. For which it was also shown that recurrent rates always yield a fully occupied state, as time tends to infinity. Whereas transient rates, once again, caused a limiting density. Moreover, the special case of a simple random walk in three dimensions or higher was investigated. If, for distances far away from the origin, the source rates could be bounded above by a certain function, then the system would not converge to the fully occupied state. Also, another proof showed that a recurrent set of source sites would always let the process converge to a fully occupied state. Lastly, similar conditions for one time dependent source at the origin were proven. Namely, it was shown for recurrent rates, that if the source dies out quick enough, as t tends to infinity, the system did not converge to the fully occupied state. For the simulations, it was found that the expected time to fill up was influenced by the starting density, both at small and large source rates, in a linear way. This conclusion could not be drawn for the rate difference: p-q. Due to the large error of the fit, a linear relation was not clearly seen.  Finally, some concluding remarks were made on both aspects of the thesis, along with some recommendations for future projects related to this topic.","Interacting Particle Systems; Exclusion processes; perturbations; Proof; Simulation Model","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

Geothermal energy is a lower carbon energy source, which can be used for both electricity production and for direct heat use (Fridleifsson, 2001).<br/>However, radioactive mineral scaling can accumulate in filters and tubing of the geothermal facilities, which can be an operational hurdle as this scale needs to be removed with necessary caution. The problem is not only the riskiness of being exposed to radioactive elements, but also the rise in pressure caused by scale accumulation. This occurs at the filters resulting in more process stops. Another problem with the scaling is that it causes increasing injection pressure. Since there is a regulatory limit to this pressure, an increase in injectivity is not preferable. Here, a case of a low-enthalpy geothermal project is discussed where very limited radioactive galena, PbS, is found.<br/>This geothermal system is modelled in the geochemical software package PHREEQC. The PHREEQC model shows that a fraction (78 wt.%) of the collected galena is produced in solid phase from the reservoir, and a smaller fraction (22 wt.%) is formed after the heat exchanger. Gamma ray logs analyses and sedimentation history are presented to find potential sources of Pb and S ions. With the geological history and literature study it is found that the radioactive Pb could be originated from the Zechstein and Rotliegend where it attaches strong to the Copper shale formations. Scale and water analysis show that most of the captured galena is transported in a solid phase into the geothermal facility.<br/>In the second part we discuss the development of a SKID for scaling determination during geothermal production. It is proposed to design a new SKID with additional measurement and monitoring options, which is able to provide the requested input parameters for the PFREEQC model. Requested data acquisition for long term monitoring includes fluid pressure, flowrate, temperature and pH values. The mobile function makes it possible to sample at several surface locations along the line of the geothermal facility. The obtained and stored data can be analyzed and compared to other locations in order to find out whether or not the brine and its composition change, and if so, how it changes<br/>In order to reduce the amount of radioactive PbS in the filters of the geothermal system, it could be considered to acidify the brine to a level where the minerals are dissolved. In addition, increasing the facility pressure and/or increasing the minimum brine temperature after the heat exchanger, could reduce the amount of galena precipitation captured in the filters of the geothermal facility.","Geothermal; Radioactivity; PHREEQC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The world is facing environmental change, mainly due to human actions. To prevent serious environmental, economic, and societal impacts of climate change, all United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) member countries have committed to limit global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial level by 2050. Current mitigation measures, like moving to renewable energy, are not sufficient. Implementing circular economy can address this issue. A transition is required to move from a linear to a circular economy. The main research question for this research is: What can be learned about targeting the transition to a 100% circular Dutch infrastructure sector in 2050, through three social agreements if we take the perspective of Mission-oriented Innovation System (MIS)? This research also provided input for the second Integral Circular Economy Report (ICER) of 2023. <br/>The Dutch economic model operates in a predominantly linear economy. The three principles for circular economy are: eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials and regenerate nature. A large renovation awaits us. The very long lifespan of infrastructural projects makes the transition in this sector challenging. One of the four central frameworks to study transitions is the Mission-oriented Innovation System (MIS) approach. To tackle grand societal challenges, MIS also takes non-technological innovations into account. To see whether something has been learned from the transition process, four learning dimensions in sustainability-oriented learning have been identified. By pursuing all four dimensions, properties can be developed to take steps toward building a circular world. <br/>The three cases studied for this research concern the materials concrete, wood, and steel. Per case a separate MIS analysis has been performed. The three cases have been generalized into two different categories: the “already established materials” and the “yet to be introduced materials”. The main dynamic in the already established materials is the negative feedback loop between the market formation and destabilization, availability of human and financial resources and the lack of directionality. Moreover, the lack of coordination also negatively affects the entire system. For the yet to be introduced materials the non-supportive socio-technical environment is the root cause of many negatively influenced system functions. Due to the lack of a supportive environment, there is a lack of financial resources which causes insufficient knowledge development. The lack of knowledge has as a result no clear direction for the transition and little possibilities to create a market for the new material. <br/>The research question consists of four main elements: learning, transition, circular economy, and the MIS perspective. From studying the transition to a 100% circular Dutch infrastructure it can be learned that taking the scope of a social agreement can be a good start. In line with the learning dimension about boundary crossing and system thinking, the next step it to broaden the view. Also, there should be special attention to the successes in the strategy “narrow the loop” to motivate people.","Circular economy; Mission-oriented Innovation System (MIS); Transition Theory; Infrastructure; Concrete Agreement; Wood chain Trajectory; Construction Agreement Steel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

One option is to construct a network from trees, which have been constructed from DNA data. Another option, which is studied in this work, is to create a network which represents all clusters from the trees. We are interested in finding a network having the lowest level possible, i.e. the lowest number of reticulations per biconnected component.

In this thesis, an optimal algorithm is presented called STCass, of which many ideas are inspired from Cass. We lay<br/>theoretical foundations on how to build an optimal network. Furthermore, (greedy) steps are proposed to solve the problem, which seem to work very well in practice.

In order to speed up any Cass-based algorithm or derivatives of it, several lower bounds are presented on the reticulation number r(N) per biconnected component N of an optimal network. Besides, a new upper bound on r(N) is conjectured which can be evaluated in seconds, although e.g. an upper bound obtained by the HybridInterleave or PIRN algorithm is mostly lower and which can be evaluated often in twenty minutes for the tested instances.","Phylogenetic network; phylogenetic tree; level minimization; reticulation number; optimization; hybrid; hybridization event; level-k; cluster; compatibility; incompatibility graph; STCass; MSTCass","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The total damage in the Netherlands is estimated to be between € 350 and € 600 million, with Valkenburg aan de Geul suffering the most damage. The economic and tourist heart of this city is located in the lowest part of the valley, therefore developing a flood reduction measure is challenging due to the limited space and restrictions in this location to protect the culture and nature.<br/><br/>In previous studies, different solutions were proposed for reducing the flood risk such as flood walls in Valkenburg; however, due to the locational difficulties, many options are difficult to implement except for the option of a flood bypass tunnel. A flood bypass tunnel has never been applied in the Netherlands, however; it is applied in mountainous countries. A flood bypass tunnel rapidly conveys floodwaters through densely populated areas. For Valkenburg, a flood bypass tunnel will reduce the flood risk locally while taking up little space and keeping the historic district intact. <br/><br/>Recent research did not look further into the opportunity of a flood bypass tunnel as a flood measure assuming it would be too expensive (Asselman &amp; van Heeringen, 2023). However, different studies concluded that a flood bypass tunnel is a viable option (Van Dijk, 2022; Kallen et al., 2022; Leijser &amp; Nijhof, 2022). Nonetheless, a flood bypass tunnel has never been applied in the Netherlands, and there is no prior research detailing the hydraulic and operational applicability of a flood bypass tunnel for Valkenburg aan de Geul. The main objective of this thesis is therefore to develop a hydraulic flood bypass tunnel design for Valkenburg aan de Geul which should operate to reduce the flood risk.<br/><br/>The objective is reached by combining the design approach for hydraulic structures with a Systems Engineering approach. First, the river system and its environment are analysed. Secondly, the basis of the design is determined. Thirdly, two alternative designs are developed from the two different types of reference projects: a passive and an active flood bypass tunnel.<br/><br/>The first design alternative is based on a passive flood bypass tunnel. It consists of a 2.4-meter-tall and 24.5-meter-wide Ogee weir, two tunnel tubes of 3.5 m diameter, and allows for a maximum discharge capacity of 55 m<sup>3</sup>/s. Once the tunnel is filled, the flow is pressurised. After a flood, the remaining water will be pumped out. A co-current channel is designed to prevent water from refilling the tunnel from the outlet side in a non-flooding situation.<br/><br/>The second design alternative is based on an active flood bypass tunnel. It consists of four vertical moving flat gates at the inlets and outlets, two tubes of 3.5 m diameter, and allows for a maximum discharge capacity of 58 m<sup>3</sup>/s. The water level will be controlled by the flat gates using a system for early automatic detection of flood hazards. The tunnel is always filled, thus pressurised. After a flood, the gates at the in- and outlets will close off the tunnel from its environment. The gates are tested twice a year, during which the system is flushed and refreshed.<br/><br/>The two design alternatives were evaluated according to six weighted criteria and ranked using a multi-criteria analysis in discussion with the municipality (gemeente Valkenburg aan de Geul) and the waterboard (waterschap Limburg), and a cost analysis was conducted. The first design alternative with the passive flood bypass tunnel was selected due to its high reliability and serviceability, which were highly valued, and low maintenance costs, compared to the second design alternative<br/><br/>The flood bypass tunnel reduces the flood risk based on discharge reduction from an estimated once every 19 years to once every 250 years in the current climate. This accounts for uncertainty due to climate change and ensures flood risk reduction in the future. The flood bypass is only active when a flood is impending; hence the water remains to flow through the Geul and does not interfere with the cultural heritage and tourism of Valkenburg aan de Geul. Due to the cost-efficient pipe jacking method, the total construction cost is approximately €40 million with an estimated yearly maintenance cost of €100 k.<br","Flood Bypass Tunnel; Flood Risk Reduction; Limburg 2021; Summer 2021 Flood","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Using a reduced-order model, the planner generates an energy-efficient reference trajectory by minimizing the Cost of Transport. The controller then iteratively learns the feedforward control signal such that the full-order system tracks the reference, without altering its stiffness characteristics. We show that our strategy results in energy-efficient tracking of the reference. We also show how functional Iterative Learning Control can be used in a continuous approach to learn a stable forward pronking gait. We give experimental validation of this approach through experiments on the compliant quadruped E-Go. We show that the pronking gait can be learned on hardware in minutes and that it is robust to various types of terrain.","Legged locomotion; Quadruped; Iterative Learning Control; Trajectory optimization; Articulated Soft Robot; Elastic leggged systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Cognitive Robotics","Natural Intelligence Project",""

Ships will probably have to be converted to an alternative fuel during their lifetime and methanol seems to be the fuel with the most potential for offshore ships. By preparing for this, Design-for-Conversion to methanol, the costs of changes can be significantly reduced with only minor investments during the new building phase. The added design preparations pay for themselves only if they are being used in the future. However, due to large uncertainties, it is unclear whether a ship is actually converted to methanol in the future. Therefore, an answer had to be found to the main research question: How to determine the value of Design-for-Changeability under uncertainty to find the optimal DFC level when preparing for conversion to methanol?<br/><br/>From the literature is concluded that Design-for-Changeability principles can help to deal with uncertainty during a ship's lifetime. Moreover, Real Options Analysis is selected from the literature, as a method to deal with decisions and uncertainty when designing for conversion to methanol. By means of a combination of these methods, a methodology is established which is used in a case study.<br/><br/>In the case study, it was found that waiting with the execution of conversion to methanol results in decreasing added value of Design-for-Conversion. Moreover, it was found that the Discount Rate used for Net Present Value calculation significantly impacts the choice of whether to prepare a ship for methanol. It can be concluded that an instigator is needed so that ships are converted to methanol. Two instigators have been researched, a carbon pricing measure and a ban on harmful emissions. It can be concluded that a carbon pricing measure is only effective if the right price is established, while a carbon ban is highly effective as ships are converted instantly.<br/><br/>The combination of methods, the Design-for-Changeability principles together with a Real Options Decision Tree, provides a suitable framework to quantify the impact of Design-for-Conversion to methanol under uncertainty.","Real Options Decision Tree; Design-for-Changeability; Uncertainty; Methanol; Ship Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design and Marine Technology | Maritime Operations and Management","","2025-03-01","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design","",""

(mentor); Orsini, G.A. (graduation committee); Buitenhuis - van Groos, Vera (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Flatland, a visual thinking agency, helps companies and institutions turn complexity into clarity by using visual thinking, co-creation and design thinking. They work together with their clients in a (physical) setting where they co-create together and use visualization as a means of problem solving and communication. During these sessions their clients are expected to fully engage and participate, while they usually do not have extensive experience with this way of working. This leads to some participants closing off during sessions, which leads to less (valuable) input from them.<br/><br/>Research suggests that one’s involvement and participation in creative activities is influenced by one’s creative self-beliefs (Karwowski, Lebuda &amp; Beghetto, 2019). In the context of Flatland the specific creative self-belief of creative confidence has the biggest impact, which is the belief in one’s ability to think or act creatively in and across particular performance domains’’ (Karwowski &amp; Beghetto, 2018). This influences what creative tasks one will engage with and in what way they will perform (Karwowski &amp; Beghetto, 2018). The latter is especially important for Flatland, since they would like their participants to perform to their full potential, because this results in more (valuable) input and a more qualitative end result. <br/><br/>Several observations, interviews and surveys were conducted which resulted in the following insights. 1) Several participants feel overwhelmed when entering the first co-creation session with Flatland as they have to adjust to a new way of working, new team, new context, etc. 2) Flatland did not structurally prepare their participants for their co-creation sessions. 3) The participants with the lowest creative confidence scores usually talk less, initiate less, mostly react and feel doubtful when they speak which sometimes results in them disappearing into the background. This is not beneficial to Flatland nor the client, since this leads to less (valuable) input and a less qualitative end result. <br/><br/>This resulted in the design of a digital preparation booklet that aimed to improve the creative confidence of participants that usually score the lowest within a group, by preparing them before their first co-creation session starts, so they are able to express their opinion more easily and fully engage during the process. This was done through the use of the four sources of self-efficacy (Bandura, 1996) and through decreasing the impact of the four fears that influence creative confidence (Kelley &amp; Kelley, 2012). <br/><br/>The final booklet was validated through several observations, interviews and a survey. Client input showed that they valued the thorough preparation and that the booklet felt as a warm welcome and made them excited for the upcoming sessions. Observations and interviews with Flatland showed that participants seemed to work better together, persevered longer when things got complex, actively participated throughout the whole session and felt ready and excited at the beginning of the first session. Survey data shows that even though there was not a significant increase in participant’s creative confidence, there were less lower scoring participants after using the booklet. And so the intended effect was achieved. <br","Creative Confidence; co-creation; visual thinking; co-design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Hospitalization can be emotionally threatening and traumatizing for children. Children have to undergo multiple medical examinations, in a setting that is unfamiliar to them. Resilience is needed to cope with the challenges that come with the hospitalization. A positive emotional state can help children manage fear, stress and anxiety. In this graduation project, the narrative interactive game-play intervention Hideaway was created to foster resilience and empower children during their short (3-7 days) stay in the hospital, building on the previously developed Hospital Hero app©.<br/><br/>In order to create a valuable design intervention, an iterative research and design process was followed. A literature study and a context mapping study were performed to gain insight into the emotional experience of children (4 to 14 years old) and contributory contextual factors. Data was collected using observations, conversations with (former) patients, parents and healthcare professionals, and interviews with experts specialized in psychological impact of hospitalization in children. Using activity booklets, hospitalized children were asked about their social contacts, emotions and desires. Make-and-say sessions with children and co-creation sessions with children were held to further determine the core intervention strategy.<br/><br/>From the research, multiple challenges that negatively influence children’s mental state were identified: accumulation of medical procedures, unfamiliar daily routine/environment, not being able to play. This is strengthened by lack of peer-interactions and restricted mobility (i.e. contact isolation, being bedbound). To help children cope with these challenges, an interactive storytelling-based game was designed, integrating peer-contact, social play and child-friendly coping tips. Hideaway invites children to work together in a collaborative digital game of ‘hide-and-seek’, thereby creating connection between peers in and outside the hospital, letting children explore and escape the hospital room, and empowering children.<br/><br/>A prototype of Hideaway was evaluated with children and healthcare professionals, showing a promising potential to evoke a positive emotional state in children and with that fostering resilience and empowerment. Research and design recommendations have been made to provide a bridge to future implementation of Hideaway.<br/><br/>The eHealth solution Hideaway facilitates playful peer-interactions and has the potential to stand in for missed daily peer-interplay. Hideaway provides a valuable addition to the Hospital Hero app©, expanding outpatient care support with hospitalization support, and could be applicable to other settings (e.g. pediatric rehabilitation).<br","Medisign; Human-Centered Design; Game design; Children; Storytelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

It consists of a carbon fiber-reinforced carbon (C) and silicon carbide (SiC) matrix. In this study, a macroscopic non-linear constitutive model accounting for the damage-induced plasticity is proposed for the 2/2 twill weave C/C-SiC composite.<br/><br/>In the context of this thesis, a computational model is developed, based on the framework of continuum damage mechanics and general plasticity theory.

Moreover, an experimental investigation on the macroscopic mechanical behavior and damage mechanisms of C/C-SiC under in-plane onand off-axis loading conditions is performed. Specimens with 0&#x1d45c;, 30&#x1d45c; and 45&#x1d45c; on- and off-axis angles were manufactured and tested under monotonic and cyclic tensile and compression loads. Furthermore, the microstructure of the pristine material and the fracture surfaces of the tested specimens are studied through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A Bayesian optimization algorithm is finally used to optimize simultaneously the different material parameters based on the experimental test data. <br/><br/>The predicted stress-strain curves are in good agreement with the experimental curves, especially in the case of monotonic tensile loading.

The target group was people living with HIV (PLHIV). This study was made possible thanks to the client, Amsterdam UMC, who are undertaking a larger research project that aims to improve the quality of life (QoL) of PLHIV.<br/><br/>The project included a comprehensive literature review and user research that involved shadowing of nurses in order to explore the clinic’s context. At this point PROMs started being introduced at the outpatient clinic. To identify design opportunities, attitudes towards PROMs, and initial impressions of PROMs, semi-structured interviews were done with patients and nurses. To further the discussion of PROMs three provotypes were made and presented to participants during the interviews. The main takeaways related to patients not knowing the value or purpose of PROMs or lacking the motivation to complete them. From these takeaways design criteria were identified by making the design goal and interaction vision, which led to the development of four concepts by research through design, brainstorming, and role-playing.<br/><br/>A Harris profile was done on the four concepts and one of them was selected to move forward to design and implementation. The concept was a card game, and it was further iterated on by using accessibility guidelines and persuasive game design. The objective was to make a game that, while being accessible, would help change patient behavior regarding PROMs. A lo-fi mock-up was created for the game to test the different game elements with people, leading to refinement of the concept and turning it into a high-fi prototype that was tested with the target group, PLHIV.<br/><br/>The results were positive, with patients showing enthusiasm for the game, but with some room for improvement. Patients found the game to be compassionate and useful in learning about PROMs. The game was also tested with a peer navigator who offered many insights from the perspective of patients who are not open about their diagnosis and on how the card game could be used in relation to their role at the outpatient clinic.<br/>These findings highlight the potential of using gamification to create inclusive learning tools (i.e. the card game) in the health sector to increase engagement with other health tools (i.e. PROMs) and the importance of continued work to optimize these tools for patients with chronic illnesses such as HIV.","PROM; HIV; Game Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

This study presents a workflow for automatically extracting camera altitude information from historical imagery and doing preliminary geolocalization by computing the footprints of the imagery based on the extracted altitude information. The workflow was applied to two flight lines in the TMA Single Frames dataset, and the results were evaluated using a scoring system and by comparing the photos with their footprints.

(mentor); Leenen, A.J.R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","A baseball pitch is an explosive and dynamic motion during which one of the highest angular rates achieved by the human body in sports activity was noted. The nature of the baseball pitch puts shoulder structures at risk, and one of the most common injuries among pitchers is a rotator cuff tear, frequently connected with internal impingement. It has been found that the amount of internal impingement increases for the angle of horizontal abduction beyond the coronal plane. To better understand the mechanics in the shoulder that leads to excessive horizontal abduction, it was decided to study muscle behavior (activation and produced torque) during the acceleration and deceleration phases of a baseball pitch. The study focused on muscles that are believed to have the most significant contribution during the aforementioned phases: pectoralis major and rotator cuff muscles (infraspinatus, supraspinatus and teres major). The analysis was performed with the use of the Thoracoscapular Shoulder Model implemented in OpenSim software. About 20 pitches of 5 different baseball pitchers were simulated based on the collected marker motion data. Visible differences in the horizontal abduction/adduction angle were found between participants, with the angle of horizontal abduction between -10 degrees to 18 degrees at the moment of maximal external rotation (MER). Next, the muscle length was analyzed. The normalized muscle length of the rotator cuff muscles at MER was found to be similar to one found in the literature, as well as the changes in muscle length over time. However, discrepancies were found in the pectoralis major behavior. The conclusion was drawn that the thoracic part of the pectoralis major is too long. Moreover, it was found that the pectoralis major does not wrap around the humeral head and shaft for the horizontal abduction angle exceeding daily-live tasks. Next, static optimization was done to find the activation of the muscles in the glenohumeral joint and, consequently, to calculate the contribution of the individual muscles to the total torque in the joint. The contribution of the rotator cuff muscles was in accordance with the information found in the literature.<br/>However, the pectoralis major was not as active as expected. Instead of it, high activity of the deltoideus muscle and coordinate actuators was found. The results indicate that the pectoralis major was not working as expected, and other muscles needed to compensate for its normal function. Several improvements to the model and data collection were proposed. For the model development, it is suggested to ensure wrapping around the humeral head and shaft for the pectoralis major. Moreover, further evaluation of the model scaling is recommended, as problems with scaling the thoracic part of the pectoralis major were found. It is believed that after their implementation, it will be possible to find a potential correlation between the range of horizontal abduction and muscle activity while using the methodology and tools presented in this study.","Baseball Pitching; OpenSim; Shoulder; Biomechanics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

This has local impacts on surrounding ecosystems and sea ice formation. On a global scale, salinity patterns and ocean circulation are affected. In addition, <br/> tudying icebergs as a proxy for ice shelves in a warming climate can help predict future climate impacts and sea level rise. Furthermore, drifting icebergs can pose a threat to ship navigation and offshore projects. In the past, icebergs have been tracked mostly manually, a time-consuming and labour-intensive task. The most widely used data source for this is Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), as icebergs often have a much higher backscatter than their surroundings. A few attempts have been made to automatically track icebergs, but these methods do not allow tracking of icebergs that are only partially visible in a satellite image. In this study, a new method is proposed based on partial contour recognition using the contours’ curvature, a technique derived from the matching of ancient pottery fragments. Since the automatic tracking of multiple icebergs requires a large amount of data and computational resources, the web-based environment of Google Earth Engine is used. The new method, called the Contour Curvature (CC) method, is based on three main steps. (1) Detection of icebergs using Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) in combination with a threshold function. (2) The icebergs targets are filtered using an area and solidity filter. (3) Among the remaining targets, the best match is selected by comparing the curvature function of the contour with the reference iceberg. The performance of the algorithm is tested by automatically tracking 15 icebergs and comparing<br/>the results to the existing Centroid Distance Histogram (CDH) method. The overall performance of the CC method can be attributed in large part to the inclusion of the area and the solidity filter, with the latter serving as an overall shape filter. For small icebergs (&lt; 10 km2), both the CC and CDH method perform poorly, due to the abundance of icebergs in this range. For medium to large icebergs (10 to 1000 km2), the methods show similar performance with one method occasionally outperforming the other method. For large icebergs (&gt; 1000 km2), the CC method performs better. Since these icebergs are often only partially visible, this leads to strong deviations in the histogram used in the CDH method, making this method less suitable for these situations. Since the CC method allows for partial contour recognition, these icebergs can still be identified. Furthermore, due to the wide variety of backscatter conditions, the detection method occasionally fails to distinguish icebergs from their surroundings.","Iceberg; tracking; antarctica; weddell sea; contour; segmentation; curvature; trajectories; matching; recognition; tabular; southern ocean; calving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","73.00, 45.00"

(mentor); Popescu, M.A. (mentor); van Wely, Rowan (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The building sector is responsible for 38% of global energy and process-related greenhouse gas emissions. In recent decades, a rapid increase in energy consumption in buildings has been witnessed, making energy reduction a pressing issue. Thermal insulation systems, that can operate dynamically in response to changing transient conditions, by alternating between thermally conductive and insulated states, are gaining attention in their architectural applications, since they constitute an effective mean for reducing energy consumption while simultaneously improving occupants comfort levels. Despite the pioneering work that has been conducted by researchers to develop adaptive insulation technologies in different engineering fields, currently none of the adaptive insulation technologies are embedded in real-world buildings for a number of reasons. The aim of this thesis, therefore is to identify these reasons and on this basis, to explore, the different ways in which an adaptive insulation system can be created. There are no established standards or requirements for the development of adaptive thermal insulation technologies. Consequently, this research initially focuses on the creation of design criteria that address aspects related to thermal performance, design feasibility, and technological complexity of the examined systems. Subsequently, the exploration of different design concepts was initiated by first creating a scheme of aspects, concerning the geometry of the core, the mobility of the outer layer, the number of cavity compartments, the type of actuation and the types of mechanisms that facilitate the transition between thermal insulation states. From the combination of these aspects, six design alternatives emerged, the principle of operation of which is based on the idea of a structure that can inflate and deflate during the transition of the system from the insulated to the conductive state. The core geometry of the concepts was modeled within TRISCO steady-state 3D software tool, where various parameters were tested in order to obtain the final topology. The aim was to achieve a thermal resistance comparable to that of state-of-the-art insulating materials in their insulated state and furthermore, to achieve a large range of shift in order to acquire a significantly low thermal resistance in the conductive state comparable to the case of an uninsulated concrete block. Simultaneously, the thermal transmittance (U-value) for the insulated and conductive states of each concept was estimated through numerical simulations in TRISCO and validated using analytical models for comparison. The results of the analysis indicated that, the thickness of the air cavity and the emissivity of the membrane material greatly affect the examined thermal resistance. Additionally, the range of shift depends significantly on the degree of evacuation of the air cavity. It has been found that technologies whose structure and working principle allow full compression of the core in the conductive state, can lead to a lower thermal resistance which is governed by solid conduction. The results of the simulations showed that one of the examined concepts satisfied the initial goal, achieving thermal transmission which ranged from 0.13 W/&#x1d45a;2K to 2.79 W/&#x1d45a;2K in the insulated and conductive states respectively. Whereas, the thermal resistance ranged from 7.5 &#x1d45a;2/KW to 0.4 &#x1d45a;2/KW in the insulated<br/>and conductive states respectively. The obtained values of thermal transmittance from TRISCO, were compared with the thermal transmittance from analytical formulas. In this way, the accuracy of the numerical simulations was validated. The final stage of the design exploration phase led to the selection of the final design through a multi-<br/>criteria analysis that is aligned with the aforementioned initial design criteria. The final design is a 1.5 m by 0.75 m opaque panel of low emissivity honeycomb core made up of 10 mm cells. In the insulated state the panel has a thickness of 0.18 m while after being compressed the thickness is reduced to 1/3. Actuation of the system is achieved using a dual-function pump that supplies air to a system of channels that access the core. An approximation of the sizes of the pump and pipes were given for the design of the air-supply system. In this way, the system can be reversibly switched between an inflated state governed by gaseous conduction and a deflated state, where the solid conduction of adjacent surfaces governs. The architectural application of the adaptive insulation system, considers the element as an infill component in which the outer skin is integrated into the system, implying that the transition between thermal states is visible from the façade. To conclude, this research explores the potentials of using the parameters influencing heat transfer capability for the development of an adaptive insulation system intended to be used in the building envelope. The research through design resulted in a promising design based on the resulting thermal performance indicators. However, to realize the proposed technology, tests on physical model need to be conducted. The thermal performance of the system should be validated experimentally in order to derive statistical data for its safe application and the actual dimensions of the air-supply system need to be determined.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

To further increase the energy efficiency of the Quooker system, this study investigates a possible heat integration system where the waste heat from the refrigeration cycle for chilled drinking water is implemented to preheat water before entering the boiling water reservoir.<br/>Due to the intermittent nature of both the supply of heat, which is coupled to the control scheme of the chilled water reservoir and the demand for heat, which is determined by the user, a thermal storage system is required. Literature showed that the best refrigeration system for this application was a vapour compression system using a natural refrigerant such as isobutane. The most efficient heat storage could be done using organic phase change materials (PCM). Using a PCM allows the system to retain more energy in the same volume due to the latent heat in the system. To enhance the heat transfer between the fluid streams and the PCM, a fin-and-tube heat exchanger concept was designed. This concept, coupled with existing Quooker system demands, leads to a preliminary set of design requirements as well as a set of variables left to be optimised by modelling. The heat transfer from the refrigerant to the tubes was modelled using known correlations for condensation in tubes. The heat transfer between tubes and fins was modelled using a two-dimensional finite difference scheme. The heat transfer between the tubes and the water was modelled using forced convection models. The models gave dimensions for the size of the PCM container, the number of passes for each fluid stream and the thickness and spacing of the heat transfer fins. An experimental setup based on the optimal design was created to validate the models. The results showed that PCM storage is an effective manner to store thermal energy. Heat transfer was significant in the regions surrounding the tubes. Further away from the tubes, the fins did not provide enough heat transfer to utilise the whole storage capacity effectively. In its current design state, the system would have an economic payback time of around 20 years. With small design improvements, such as increasing the fin thickness and decreasing the fin distance, the payback period can be brought down significantly. The added product value from being a more efficient product makes the concept promising for future implementation.<br","PCM; Heat Exchanger; Thermal Storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-20","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy, Flow and Process Technology","",""

(mentor); van Gurp, J.F.C. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Flatness is an important surface tolerance requirement during the manufacturing of a part of an ASML machine. Flatness can be measured by either measuring the variation in height of the surface in one measurement (a plane-wise measurement) or by measuring the height on multiple xy-coordinates on this surface (point-wise measurement). Point-wise distance measurement sensors tend to have small physical dimensions, while having good specifications on resolution perpendicular to the measured surface. During a separate research, a gap is found in performing a point-wise flatness measurement while accounting for undesired stage deviations. The stage deviations are in the order of <br/>micrometers, while the sensor accuracy is in the order of nanometers. The performance of a point-wise flatness measurement is therefore in a negative sense dominated by the stage inaccuracies rather than sensor performance. During this research the gap is filled by designing, building and testing a feasibility demonstrator which uses reference sensors to account for stage inaccuracies. By performing a live correction with either 1 or 3 reference sensors, the stage inaccuracy (in z, Rx and Ry) can be compensated for. The measured stage wobble for this specific setup is 3.2 µm, which is reduced to 0.13 µm when using three reference sensors. The method of using reference sensors for flatness measurements is shown to work, mainly when using 3 reference sensors.<br","Flatness; Measurement; compensation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-07","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

Hybrid technology refers to powertrain layouts that consist of hybrid propulsion and/or hybrid power supply. Advanced energy management strategies (EMS) are required to make optimal use of these available power resources. In this paper it is investigated how much fuel consumption reduction can be achieved by applying a causal, real-time equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) to a hybrid propulsion and hybrid power supply plant with a power load forecasting scheme, for a case study vessel: The Holland-class offshore patrol vessel. The forecasting tools evaluated are Linear regression, moving average, ARIMA and recurrent neural networks (RNN). The RNN outperformed the other methods and is able to predict the power demand for up to 48 seconds, while maintaining a mean absolute percentage error of under 5%. An optimization-based controller is combined with an ECMS approach which assigns an equivalent consumption cost to the battery. The controller is able to identify the power split for the hybrid propulsive system, and the power split for the hybrid power supply. A simulation proved that 0.77% fuel savings are achieved with a 400 kW battery, compared to a no-battery scenario. Fuel savings could not be proven for the EMS with a control horizon of 48 seconds, leveraging power predictions supplied by the RNN, due to limiting factors. The limiting factors are the combination of the small control horizon, the limited battery capacity compared to the overall power demand and the limited tuning of the ESFC curve.","Energy management system; Propulsion control; Hybrid vehicles; Marine systems; Hybrid energy supply","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-10","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

To understand these surface activities and mitigate potential hazards they inflict, knowledge is needed of their occurrences and properties. Near-continuous terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) enables the acquisition of point cloud time series, constituting up to thousands of three-dimensional surface morphology representations. Exploiting the full potential of this large amount of data by extracting and characterizing different types of surface activities inside these point cloud time series is, however, challenging. <br/><br/>This thesis addresses this challenge by developing an automated and unsupervised method for classifying 4D objects-by-change (4D-OBCs). These 4D-OBCs represent the spatiotemporal extent of individual surface activities in a point cloud time series. They are classified using a Self-organizing Map (SOM) and hierarchical clustering, grouping them into different levels of surface activity types. The workflow is tested on its ability to characterize surface activities in two study areas, a sandy beach and a snow-covered Alpine area.<br/><br/>Application of an optimized SOM configuration on the sandy beach results in groups of 4D-OBCs physically interpretable as different types of surface activities. A validation dataset containing 51 manually labeled 4D-OBCs of various surface activity types (e.g., intertidal bar depositions, anthropogenic bulldozer depositions) is distributed over the SOM generally according to the labels provided. The SOM thus enables the identification of 4D-OBCs displaying a particular type of surface activity, as well as subtle differences between events of one surface activity. Hierarchical clustering allows us to find and characterize broader groups of surface activities, even if the same type occurs at different points in space or time. For example, the varying spatial redistribution of sand through the initiation of different types of surface activities after the destruction of an intertidal bar system under different environmental conditions is successfully studied. <br/><br/>A nearly identical workflow configuration applied on the snow cover 4D-OBC set does not result in equal performance. Several groups of surface activity in the SOM contain a combination of 4D-OBCs representing different surface activity types. These results highlight the necessity of a study area specific workflow optimization by selecting specific features and SOM configurations. However, if optimized for the specific environment, the workflow has the potential to be used in long-term automated monitoring of surface activity in systems with complex morphological interactions, increasing the applicability of TLS for studying geomorphological change.<br","4D objects-by-change; LiDAR; Terrestrial Laser Scanning; Coastal Monitoring; Self-Organizing Map; Clustering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

(mentor); de Bruijne, M.L.C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","To deal with the pressure on urban energy infrastructures, renewable urban planning is on the rise and ambitious sustainability targets have been set to transform cities. Although these targets have resulted in many sustainable policies, the implementation of sustainability policies is lagging, hindering the energy transition. One such case, is the geothermal energy sector of the Netherlands, specifically in the urban environment. To overcome this implementation gap, this study investigates the role that assessment frameworks (afwegingskaders) might be able to play. To explore both the design of assessment frameworks and the key issues of urban geothermal energy development, the main research question investigates how assessment frameworks can support local policy making in dealing with the complexity of urban geothermal energy development in the Netherlands. The aim of this research is to develop a draft design method for assessment frameworks and to create a basis from which local assessment frameworks on urban GE can be designed. The draft design method for assessment frameworks has been developed by researching existing assessment frameworks and by studying literature on public decision-making. The case of urban geothermal energy has been investigated by conducting multiple rounds of interviews with several diverse representatives of the urban geothermal energy sector. <br/>The draft design method takes a 4 step process to design an assessment framework along the lines of a value hierarchy: gathering norms by analyzing the public debate; deriving values from these norms; specifying the values and norms into final intervention specifications; and lastly justifying each final specification, making the trade-offs between the different values and norms explicit and traceable, and hereby reflecting on the balance between long and short term values and ambitions of the municipality.<br/>For the case of urban geothermal energy development, four key issues have been identified. These are: collective action, which concerns the directing of the different actors involved; effective citizens communication, which addresses the challenge of social acceptance; lead times, which concerns the long and still inefficient processes of permit procedures; and financing, which addresses the challenges of investment in a relatively new and inherently uncertain industry.<br/>The following recommendations can be made. The design method for assessment frameworks needs refinement. The next step in developing this draft is to work out all four steps extensively. For the development of local assessment frameworks for urban geothermal energy, it is advised to help municipalities in creating an assessment framework by doing preliminary work to make the four-step process accessible. It is advised to generate a general list of values, norms, and suggested final specifications. Also, a draft can be created for the context chapter, detailing the national context of the heat transition. In doing so, municipalities only need to: 1) connect the drafted context chapter to their local energy transition policies; 2) evaluate with their citizens if the list of values and norms is adequate; 3) design intervention requirements based the suggested interventions; and then 4) consult with their citizens if the political choices made are clear and just.","Assessment frameworks; geothermal energy; policy implementation; local decision-making; urban energy transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

While there may be innumerable factors that come into play in these scenarios, such tendencies of marginalization seem to hold a strong connection to aspects of the built environment. As one of the many standardized systems in our world, design and architecture follow guidelines that commonly comply with a ‘one size fits all’ approach, catering toa mainstream majority while disregarding individuals who misfit such standards. Such scenario of design disablement is commonly true for users of assistive technology, whose scope of devices are rarely considered within traditional design practices. Although such<br/>technologies may be partially accounted for through codes and regulations regarding wheelchair access, the usability of other forms of mobility assistance - such as walkers, crutches, canes, scooters and adaptive limbs - remain absent in such guidelines. With architectural practices focusing on the needs of non-disabled bodies, the needs of mobility aid users seem to go unrecognized, leading to disadvantageous spatial conditions that restrict their capabilities. Taking that perspective into consideration, it’s possible to say that the ambulation restraints of individuals who rely on mobility aids is less about their physical capabilities and more about architecture’s lack of receptiveness towards their reliance on the<br/>use of assistive devices. Bringing to light the complexities between the built environment and the use of mobility devices, this investigation seeks to recognize the joint influence between the demands imposed by spatial design and the ranging capacities of those who may use it. Although other minorities may also face barriers of flawed design, the primary concern to be addressed within this framework is the capability limitations imposed specifically on individuals who face reduced mobility and rely on assistive ambulation devices.","accessibility; disability; inclusivity; universal design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Advanced Housing Design","",""

The thumbs play a critical role in this and losing stability of your thumb leads to a reduced Quality of Life. There are numerous conditions that can lead to joint problems in the thumb that negatively affect its stability, like rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, hypermobility, and dislocation injuries.<br/>In this graduation project, a personalized thumb splint is developed which improves the stability of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP1) joint of thumb. Creating personalized products is not easily viable, so the design workflow for Ultra Personalized Products and Service Systems is used. In this project, that means making use of patient specific 3D scans to create a modifiable design template of a thumb splint. The template needs to be parametrically adjustable to facilitate the production through digital fabrication methods, like 3D printing.<br/>The thumb splint is intended for patients who have mild joint laxity symptoms, meaning that the splint must prevent hyperextension of the MCP1 joint, but allow as many other movements of the hand as possible. This optimizes the patient’s hand function. An elaborate exploration of the current thumb splinting market reveals deficiencies in existing solutions such as the splint slipping off too easily, causing painful pressure, being too bulky or too limiting. In this project, steps are taken to standardize a thumb splint design and create a data-driven workflow, allowing the evaluation and improvement the product performance. <br/>Different scanning positions and additive manufacturing methods were used to produce over 100 thumb splinting prototypes. Each one provides new insights to improve the fit, comfort, effectiveness, security, and appearance of the splint. This led to a final splint design where all the research and prototyping insights are combined.<br/>The result is a splint made of Multi Jet Fusion printed PA12 (nylon). It is modelled on a scan in a new position: a thumb in opposition. It features a hinge which allows more flexion of the thumb, extension to a specified maximum and makes sure the splint stays snugly in place on the skin. It is well secured to the hand, does not cause painful pressure points, and facilitates almost all thumb movements except for (hyper-)extension of the MCP1 joint beyond 180°. Parametric design rules were formulated to adjust the fit to any user, based on their 3D scan, wherein the thumb is in an opposed position.<br/>Potential users were involved in the design process at four different moments to gain insights about criteria priorities and finally evaluate the ergonomics and performance of the splint. The final evaluation revealed that the splint functions as intended and has promising value. The viability of the new design was also evaluated with different orthopedic and fabrication experts. While there is room for further detailing and optimization before implementation, the proposed thumb splinting architecture shows a promising step in the standardization of a solution for people who suffer joint laxity in the MCP1 joint.<br","Thumb Splint; Metacarpophalangeal joint; Personalized product; Digital Fabrication; Joint laxity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Tremors restrict patients from performing delicate movements, creating difficulty in daily activities, such as drinking, writing, cooking or eating. Besides the challenges in performing tasks, social anxiety often occurs and negatively influences social life.<br/><br/>Currently, solutions for people with tremors are limited. STIL recognized this need and designed an orthosis for people with wrist tremors. The solution from STIL is an orthosis called the BEAM. The BEAM mechanically suppresses the wrist flexion extension and forearm pronation-supination tremors. Evaluation of the current BEAM concluded that wrist tremors are successfully suppressed, but tremors situated mainly in the fingers need additional stabilization. This study aims to design a functional wearable that mechanically suppresses finger tremors.<br/><br/>To better understand finger tremors, the project provides information on hand anatomy, the current market for finger wearables, and a video analysis of previous tests from STIL. The research found that there is limited knowledge about finger tremors and available wearables specifically designed for them. In user tests STIL saw many people with tremors also deal with a finger tremor, people can benefit from a finger wearable . In addition, the design scope research aimed to identify the specific needs and desires of people with finger tremors. The focus is on discovering a healthy and comfortable balance between freedom of movement and suppression of the fingers. The research conducted with three participant showed that the thumb, index, and middle fingers at the MCP (third joint from top of finger) and PIP (second joint from top of finger) joints need to be suppressed and that participants desire an inconspicuous and open design.<br/><br/>The ideation phase exists out of multiple iterations. The basis of the ideation is a meeting with an expert in Emerging Materials, a morphological card, and brainstorming with the team of STIL. The basis concluded in four promising design directions, which could suppress the finger tremor: wires with springs, gel/air damping, elastic bands, and splints with different stiffnesses. Prototypes were built to research and test the four directions. Finally, the most interesting concepts are elastic bands and splints with different stiffness. The elastic bands give a counterforce to the fingers by pulling them backward. The silicone splints in a glove are made of silicone with spring steel which lies on the fingers.<br/> <br/>The working principle and ergonomics of the elastic bands and silicone splints have been validated in patient research. The results showed that the silicone splints were better in terms of performance and comfort, while the elastic bands were preferred in terms of design and adaptability. The final concept used the working principle of silicone splints. The final iteration focuses on appearance, ergonomics, usability, and connection to the BEAM.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this report provides a foundation for STIL to further develop a wearable solution for people with finger tremors. The working principle of using silicone splints to suppress finger tremors is promising, but additional iterations are necessary.","Tremor; Wearable; Orthosis; Finger tremor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-20","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","",""

This proposal features a novel offshore wind turbine concept that utilises blade-mounted tip rotors to extract energy from the flow. Following a literature study phase, an experimental campaign is devised that utilises various porous actuator mesh disks as an approximation of blade tip-mounted HAWT geometries. Additionally, the implementation of a blade element vortex model is also investigated.<br/><br/>Experimentation using an existing VAWT is conducted at the Open Jet Facility at TU Delft. The test is conducted at a freestream velocity of V=4.0 m/s at an average Reynolds number of Re=7.5E4. Key outputs from the test are the normal forces on the primary (VAWT) rotor blades, the torque measured at the shaft of the primary rotor and the thrust force of the primary rotor. Through post-processing, it is also possible to determine the thrust of the tip-mounted actuator mesh disk and verify the outcome with empirical models. Moreover, large-scale volumetric flow field measurements are also conducted using a PTV system which comprises a coaxial volumetric velocimetry probe mounted to a robotic arm. The PTV system uses Helium Filled Soap Bubbles as tracers to measure the flow field.<br/><br/>Key results from the mesh disk study are consistent with initial assumptions; the thrust of the actuator disk is inversely proportional to the porosity. However, there are discrepancies observed between the different means of measuring the actuator disk thrust, this suggests that experimental inaccuracies are present. Effects of the actuator mesh disk on the blade performance showed a reduction of blade normal forces, an increase of the primary rotor thrust force as well as changes to the turbine thrust vector direction.<br/><br/>The measurements conducted using PTV highlight changes to the blade wakefield which has consequences for the BVI. Notable differences between the cases with and without actuator disks include the lack of the upwind shed vortex in the investigated region when the actuator mesh disk is present. In the case without the actuator mesh disk, the interaction with the downwind and upwind shed vortices is destructive, thus the vorticity in the wake dissipates more rapidly. Tests with the actuator mesh disk conducted at TSR=4.0 showed that the wake of the actuator disk is able to persist longer and thus interact with the second blade leading to BVI. The lack of the upwind shed vortex destructing the downwind vortex likely means that the wake dissipates more slowly. Moreover, the presence of reverse flow behind the actuator disk is identified as another contributor to the large velocity deficit observed in the wake. <br/><br/>The numerical vortex model that is proposed is an extension of the pre-existing CACTUS vortex model developed by Sandia National Laboratories. The changes to the CACTUS numerical model enable the implementation of tip rotor geometries to VAWTs. Initial testing shows behaviour that is within expectations, however, the results are limited by a coarse spatial grid; this highlights the necessity for optimisation of the numerical model in the future. The numerical vortex model demonstrates that it is possible to use this model for the investigation and optimisation of blade tip-mounted rotors.","wind energy; XROTOR; Offshore Wind Energy; Tip rotors; VAWT; Vortex model; PIV; PTV; Actuator disk; Porous disk; Wind tunnel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","XROTOR",""

Nowadays, it is frequently observed that construction activities in complex urban environments appear undesirable effects on the communities surrounding the location of the construction project having as a focal point the “construction traffic”. Nonetheless, existing studies indicate traffic congestion is a significant contributor to the inefficient management of construction logistics. Unsuccessfully managing a project’s construction logistics is strongly correlated with the unsatisfactory performance of the construction process mostly due to the occurrence of delays in the implementation of the construction activities related to incorrect delivery of building materials and construction equipment. Likewise, inefficient management of construction logistics can lead to unmanageable traffic levels derived from additional transportation volumes related to the construction process. Since the multi-faced issue of traffic congestion can cause both a negative “domino effect” on the construction activities towards the realization of a construction project as well as unfavorable effects on urban city’s living conditions, positively impactful ways ought to be researched for reducing the adverse consequences of uncontrollable traffic. This thesis works for designing and developing a transportation prognosis model that can predict the extra transportation volumes on the location of the construction project due to the transportation activity of the needed vehicles along the construction process, offering an insight into traffic conditions of the examined relevant road. In this way, the designed prognosis model can be used as a proactive tool since it indicates if and when uncontrollable traffic levels can occur.","Construction Logistics; Transportation Modeling; Knowledge Management; Requirements Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

However, policies that have been implemented over the last year, prompted experts to question the future of the market. The question is, what are the effects on energy security when these policies are in place? Using 3 relevant theories (TPB, VBN, and DOI) on household decision-making processes, a study of what is meant by decentralised solar and the context in which the market operates in the Empire State, I used an agent-based model to analyse the impacts of these policies in terms of energy security. Energy security is defined into 6 dimensions (Availability, Affordability, Accessibility, Acceptability, Ability, and Appeal). Experimentation and subsequent analysis showed a limited effect on most of these terms. However, a combination of these policies showed a less favourable effect on all scenarios as compared to the business-as-usual scenario. What was salient during experimentation was that the combination of the policies led to a difference in direction of the effects than when the effects of the policies implemented in isolation were added together. Indicating an inter-relationship between policies. Moreover, during market analysis it was found that the influence of the traditional utilities (owned by private investors) exert great influence on the policy making process, in their own favour. Based on this research, the future of decentralised solar electricity generation in the State of New York is going to be a tough battle with the greatest hurdle being overcoming the power of centralised utilities.","Policy analysis; New York; ABM; Design Science Research; Theory of Planned Behavior; Value-Belief-Norm theory; Diffusion of innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Wind industry companies demand the safe operation of two-bladed offshore wind turbines. To guarantee safe operation, the companies perform operational modal analyses to investigate modal properties variation which might be allocated to damage. However, the operational modal analysis of an operative two-bladed offshore wind turbine faces multiple challenges. (1) Fundamental operational modal analysis assumptions about the applied loads are violated by environmental and operational loads. (2) The closely spaced modes of an offshore wind turbine are hard to identify. (3) An operative two-bladed offshore wind turbine is a linear time-variant system. This paper introduces an enhanced operational modal analysis procedure to overcome some of the mentioned challenges. The enhanced procedure incorporates a post-processing technique in a transmissibility-based approach. A developed representative model of an operative two-bladed offshore wind turbine is used to compare the enhanced procedure with the frequency domain decomposition method. Based on the comparison, this paper proposes a new operational modal analysis method that combines a transmissibility-based approach, the post-processing technique, and the frequency domain decomposition method.

A novel orthosis has been developed which counteracts this impediment to the ankle. It is expected that gait training will improve stroke patients' use of the orthosis by increasing their ankle dynamics. Gait training with biofeedback, which is based on physiological signal, has been shown to be effective for stroke patients. The main design requirement for the biofeedback is that it facilitates learning of an increased active range of motion of the ankle. To fulfill this requirement the biofeedback is based on the maximum angle in plantar- and dorsiflexion during the swing phase of the impeded leg. In this research, the biofeedback is validated on healthy participants with an impeded right ankle performing five gait trials. First an unimpeded reference trial was conducted capturing normal gait. After which the participant's ankle was impeded. During the initial impeded trial the participant got accustomed to the impediment during gait. Then two trials with feedback were conducted followed by a retention trial without feedback. During the retention trial the effects the biofeedback has on the ankle dynamics are determined. The outcome measures were chosen to validate whether the biofeedback facilitated learning of an increased active range of motion of the ankle. The outcome measures were the increase of active range of motion of the ankle from the initial impeded trial to the retention trial and the error quotient. The error quotient is a measure showing to what extent the angles making up the active range of motion during a trial were the same as during the reference trial. The active range of motion of the ankle of participants increased (p &lt; 0.001) from the initial impeded trial to the retention trial. Moreover a significant decrease in the error quotient of participants was found between the initial impeded trial and the first feedback trial (p = 0.033), second feedback trial (p = 0.013) and retention trial (p = 0.020). Therefore, the biofeedback facilitated learning of an increased active range of motion of the ankle to participants. Further research is required to determine how to best adapt the biofeedback such that it is suitable for use by stroke patients in daily life.","Biofeedback; Gait training; Stroke; Spastic paresis; Active ankle range of motion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","Stiffness as Needed",""

In recent years, Model Predictive Control (MPC) has started to see more application for the purpose of Rendezvous and Docking (RVD) with an uncoopera- tive target. This is both due to the increased capability of online solver algorithms and the increased interest and need for autonomous RVD to an uncooperative target for Active De- bris Removal (ADR) and in orbit servicing. Acknowledging the potential applications of these developments, this thesis seeks to close the gap between research and real-time application of an MPC aimed at minimizing propellant consumption for such a RVD mission. In this thesis, an MPC strategy with the aim of decreasing propellant consumption is developed for an RVD mission. First, an overview will be given of some related orbital theory and the three relative orbital dynamics models, which will be used as prediction models for the MPC strategies. These models are the Clohessy Wiltshire (HCW) model, Xu-Wang model in Cartesian coor- dinates, model and STM developed by Yamanaka and Ankersen in ROE. An overview will be provided on the available MPC strategies developed until now. Second, the various MPC formulations that will be evaluated, for each mission phase, and their related constraints and cost function are presented. Next, the results of the all the MPC formulations for the different mission phases are presented. Finally, it is shown that the use of more accurate prediction models does not add any significant benefit in terms of propellant consumption and error for all mission phases. However, the use of robust techniques and the inclusion of disturbances in the prediction models is shown to have a clear benefit for all prediction models in terms of propellant consumption and error. The use of incremental input cost function is not shown to consistently improve the propellant use and error. It is determined that a robust MPC for- mulation using the HCW model with a disturbance estimator provides the best performance in terms of propellant use and error from far range to proximity operations.","MPC; Rendezvous & Docking; Space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This is understandable given its numerous advantages such as the reduced need for personal vehicle ownership, reduced traffic congestion and emissions, increased parking efficiency, and cost savings for users. Overall, shared mobility systems offer the potential to revolutionize transportation, providing individuals with more options and helping to create more sustainable, livable cities. For shared mobility systems to fully deliver their benefits, vehicle availability must be maintained at the right place and time. If the vehicle distribution is not optimal, it may lead to overcrowding and shortages which in turn will discourage usage and lead to reduced revenues for the operator. Therefore, ensuring proper balancing of supply and demand is crucial for the success of the shared mobility service. One way to balance supply and demand is through physically rebalancing vehicles within the service area. In this study, a simulation-based optimization model is created and used to determine the optimal rebalancing operations while quantifying system improvement. A case study is conducted using real data from the Dutch moped sharing provider Felyx to examine the impact of performing rebalancing operations in Eindhoven throughout May ’22. The results demonstrate a potential increase in profit of up to 2.06%. By performing the recommended rebalancing actions several times a week in each city where the operator is active, a significant amount of extra profit can be made. This additional profit will even rise as the usage of shared mobility rises in general.","Shared mobility; Operator-based rebalancing; Free-floating; Discrete-event simulation; Simulation-based optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-17","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

These brainwaves can be interpreted as commands that can be used to control different applications. These frameworks that interpret the brainwaves are called brain-computer interfaces. Steady-state visually evoked potentials is one of these paradigms that uses external stimuli flickering at fixed frequencies to evoke brainwaves. This paradigm is fast to issue, is reliable, and needs no training time of the user. However, to be able to distinguish multiple commands it is important to distinguish between multiple commands reliably. The fundamental metric that determines the signal quality is the signal-to-noise ratio. The signal-to-noise ratio is measured in decibels and is the ratio in power between the signal that is evoked around the stimulus frequency and the power of some baseline, referred to as noise. <br/>To extract the power the discrete Fourier transform is calculated from the measured brainwaves. The brainwaves are measured in millivolts over time. These brainwaves can be recorded using implants in the head named intracortical or external, such as electroencephalography. External methods such as electroencephalography are much safer for the user. <br/><br/>Important to recognize is that one of the contributing factors to signal-to-noise ratio are the characteristics of the external stimuli displayed. Research is still trying to figure out the exact relationship between stimuli characteristics and signal-to-noise ratio. However, the experiments of previous research lack the context of the gaze of the subjects to explain the electroencephalography recordings.

The other experiment simulates the natural environment of the external stimuli across the same frequencies, colors, and shapes. The natural environment of a single stimulus is actually surrounding stimuli at different frequencies, as applications often require the ability to distinguish between multiple different commands.

The increasing pressure for more renewable energy sources is accompanied by the success of the offshore wind turbine. As a result, the installation of offshore wind farms has become a major business. The challenges posed during installation become more complicated with larger turbines. Forces exerted on taller and softer support structures and longer blades limit the installation options of the wind turbine components even more.<br/>Nevertheless, the dimensions of wind turbines have grown explosively over the years and this growth is foreseen to continue.<br/>To overcome the growing challenges of blade installation on offshore wind <br/> turbines, it is crucial to better understand the forces and the induced motions. Insufficient understanding of the behaviour of the support structure and blade during installation of the latter could lead to over-conservatism of an already vastly time-constrained process, resulting in loss of workable weather and unnecessary costs.<br/>The objective of the research conducted in this thesis is to develop a dynamic model of a 20 MW offshore wind turbine to quantify motions at the blade-hub interface during blade installation and examine potential mitigations. When the objective is reached, a good comprehension of the blade behaviour is achieved, allowing for exploration of solutions to reduce the observed motions and increase workability.<br/>A 20 MW wind turbine does not exist as of writing, but with a scaling assessment a configuration was composed. The future wind turbine is estimated to have a hub height of 154.7 m and a blade length of 131.5 m with an estimated weight of slightly less than 90 tonnes. Due to offshore placement of the wind turbine, the length of the support structure is estimated to be extended with a water depth of 35 m. The problem has been further delineated by assuming the weather conditions of a typical North Sea offshore site at the boundary of what is currently possible for blade installation. Installation is assumed to be conducted with a floating vessel, posing even more challenges.<br/>Modelling the installation of a blade is subdivided into examining the behaviour of a wind turbine support structure and a blade suspended from a crane separately. The performed simulations are conducted in 3D, with the support structure and blade being multi-body systems excited by unidirectional<br/>waves, wind and current. Calm, normal, and rough weather conditions are assumed as input conditions to examine the environmental impact. A combination of the results of the models simulating the multibody systems provide the relative motions between the support structure and the blade, resulting in potential impact velocities in the horizontal plane. The model is solved in the time domain, because it allows for a better understanding of the input and output variables...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-02-17","","","","Offshore Engineering","",""

However, the construction of such barriers may lead to unwanted coastal changes. This thesis examines the effect of the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier on sediment pathways and the implications for coastal erosion. In addition, possible sediment-based interventions to redirect the current with the aim of reducing coastal erosion were investigated. First, a literature study was performed to provide historical context on the natural and human induced development of the ebb tidal delta. A data analysis on the sediment budget of the ebb tidal delta was performed, which showed that from 1960 to 1987 the ebb tidal delta gained sediment, from 1987 to 2010 it lost sediment, and from 2010 to 2019 it gained sediment again. A numerical model in Delft3D FM was used to produce sediment transport vector fields over a morphologically representative tidal cycle, which were then visualized using SedTRAILS. The research found that the barrier decreased the strength of the ebb current on the entire ebb tidal delta. The Roompot Zuid has a predominantly ebb-dominant character before the barrier in 1976 but changes to a flood-dominant character due to the construction of the barrier, which weakened the ebb-current. In 2019, part of the Roompot Zuid regained an ebb-dominant character. The Schaar van Onrust also became flood-dominant due to the barrier, eliminating the sediment-retaining effect the ebb dominated current in this channel. This shift indicates that sediments that previously stayed in front of the coast of Noord-Beveland are now redistributed further along the coast in south western direction, which led to a sediment deficit and erosion at the coast. The tested interventions seem to induce little structural changes in the tidal currents. The removal of sediment causes the sediment transport patterns to converge into the dredged area, suggesting deposition. Therefore the tested interventions do not seem effective from a coastal management perspective. The approach used here may also be useful for the assessment of sediment transport impacts at other sites where the construction of similar barriers is being considered.","Ebb-Tidal Delta; Eastern Scheldt; SedTRAILS; Coastal Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

A combination of representative techniques, such as Hardware, Virtual Reality, Software and Theory will be used to create the most realistic training experience with a strong focus on hands-on capabilities. A supportive literature and user research has been conducted on training context, aiming at methods and psychology, future trends complemented by in-depth interviews conducted with other technology-focused companies to study their practices. Additionally, the user experience was investigated at the graduation company through a combination of interviews, observations and surveys. This extensive exploration phase has resulted in a wide diversity of possible future training focus points such as for example (1) improving effectiveness and practice opportunities of hands-on trainings targeting optimal knowledge retention and (2) increasing on-the-job performance support through mentor guidance and manager evaluation. Incorporating the input of the majority of engineers, as part of the User-Centered Design approach, it could be concluded that focusing on a planning tool, while optimizing the amount of effective hands-on modules, was the most promising direction. Product requirements have been gathered through interactive co-creation and brainstorm sessions with users and business stakeholders. Once the core features were determined, the prototyping phase was launched, consisting of two separate sections. First a UX design was created through wireframing and several conducted rounds of usability testing. Next an effective planning proposal was defined representing a possible training scenario. A balanced merging of these two sections characterizes the High-NA TC planning tool ‘MyTraining’, which enables micro-managing and adapting a training to the needs and preferences of trainees. It supports a flexible environment, where learning by doing is encouraged, and practice opportunities are facilitated. It entails three main functionalities; book training time slots according to own preferences and availability, self-direct the training journey while encountering the planning guidance and explore other training programs for personal development awareness. The tool can be perceived as valuable to the users, since it will boost their motivation through a sense of autonomy, mastery and purpose. Furthermore, their confidence level will be increased through practice opportunities and effective modular training slots.

(mentor); Gelling, J.L. (mentor); Fiscaletti, D. (mentor); de Vos, P. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Introduction - Hydrofoils are often used for high-performance craft. They enable the hull to rise out of the water and reduce drag. A recurring problem is ventilation, this is the presence of a cavity filled with ambient air on the lifting surface. Ventilation causes the lift of the hydrofoil to decrease drastically. A lot of research has been done on ventilation behaviour. Ventilation remains a stochastic phenomenon to this day. The same operational conditions do not yield the same flow behaviour, a correlation between the pressure on the lifting surface and ventilation behaviour might exist. This research is an intermediate step towards finding a correlation between pressure on the surface of a foil and ventilation, making ventilation repeatable. The main goal of this research is to find out if a full surface pressure reconstruction can aid the search for a correlation between pressure and ventilation.<br/><br/>Method - The test geometry is a NACA0012 surface-piercing hydrofoil with pressure measured using 2 rows of 15 pressure tappings. Extension pieces are used to obtain the span-wise pressure distribution while keeping the submerged span constant. The test program has three sets: all vertical runs (Set 1), high roll angle runs (Set 2), and runs with ventilation (Set 3). During the experiment, the loads are measured with force transducers on a frame that measures forces in 6 degrees of freedom. The calibration of the force transducers is performed prior to the experiment. The calibration of the pressure sensors is done first using a 9 meter water column before the experiment and during the experiment in the towing tank, extra re-calibration (stepped runs) data is collected. The collected force measurement data is processed to attain the lift and drag coefficients. The pressure measurements are translated to the pressure coefficient and placed in a matrix on the right location of the lifting surface.<br/><br/>Results - Based on repeated experimental runs the percentage differences are obtained on sensor and array levels. 30% of the sensors have a percentage difference of more than 10%, while the maximum difference for an entire array is 2.5%. A cross-check between the upper and lower arrays showed a percentage difference above 15% for 28% of the sensors, with a maximum difference of 1.2% at the array level. The pressure distributions at 0∘ roll angle, from Set 1, match the general pressure distribution characteristics. Comparing the 3D lift coefficient computed from the pressure measurements to that of the force data or an empirical method yields ambiguous results. The 3D lift coefficient based on the pressure measurement is within a 4% difference to Xfoil. The result of the high roll angle runs, Set 2, show the effect free-surface proximity has on the chord-wise pressure distribution. For the shallowest pressure reconstructions, close to the free-surface, the pressure distribution shows a minor peak near the leading edge after which the curve drops to near zero quickly. The operational conditions do not affect the quality of measurements. During two runs ventilation occurred, this is Set 3. The time-traces of the three forwardmost sensors show a dip prior to ventilation, with one sensor displaying an oscillating response. It is hypothesised that this is the position where ventilation is induced, but based on the results this can not be proven. All sensor response follows the same pattern when the ventilation bursts over the surface. The set-up is able to capture quick pressure changes.<br/><br/>Conclusion -The percentage difference is too high for too many sensors. On the array level, however, the difference is considered small enough. The results of set 1 are in good agreement with known data. The results obtained at 60∘ roll angle are concluded to be of the same quality as for 0∘ roll. The method is capable of providing results in a wide range of operational conditions. Based on the ventilation runs, no correlation to pressure reading has been found. The time-traces of the sensors near the leading edge of these runs do show fluctuations prior to ventilation. With more ventilation runs available, it is highly likely that a correlation can be established. Due to the slim data set, it is possible that the conclusions drawn will be refuted in the future when a larger data set is available. Currently, the goal has not been achieved, and it cannot be stated with certainty that the method used here to attain a full surface pressure reconstruction can be used to correlate pressure to ventilation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

(mentor); Oosting, R.M. (graduation committee); Piscaer, T. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Open Wedge High Tibial Osteotomy (OWHTO) is an extensively used, effective treatment option for medical conditions such as medial knee osteoarthritis and varus malalignment. The current developments in the 3D printing industry facilitated using 3D printed patient-specific guides (PSSGs), making OWHTO a desirable treatment option. Although the PSSG improves the outcomes (e.g., high accuracy, lower radiation) of the OWHTO, lateral hinge fractures and posterior soft tissue injuries of the tibia are two main risks still present. Therefore, this study aims to facilitate an optimal 3D printed PSSG design with a lateral hinge protecting K-wire and a soft tissue protecting sleeve for OWHTO that can prevent or reduce these two critical risks. For this purpose, first, 3D models were constructed from pre-operative CT images of the cadaver specimens. Afterward, a monopolar osteotomy cut was created at a location where the orthopedic surgeon Tom Piscaer decided on the 3D-constructed models to develop Finite Element (FE) analysis. Using the FE analysis and 3D constructed models, different intact lateral hinge lengths (5 mm, 6 mm, 7 mm, 8 mm, 9 mm, and 10 mm) without apical drill holes were analyzed for relative comparison between six different simulations. The intact hinge length was chosen between 10 mm and 5 mm according to the information in the literature. Von Mises stress was used as an outcome measure. The decrease in distribution and magnitude for the von Mises stress at the lateral side of the tibia and the lateral hinge was used to point out the overall impact of the hinge length reduction. As the intact hinge length decreased, the von Mises stress on the lateral hinge generally decreased. According to the results from FE analysis using a high-quality mesh, leaving a 6 mm intact hinge was determined to be the optimum case among other cases. It reduced the stress around the hinge, maintained sufficient cortical and cancellous bone, had a higher margin of error, and likely reduced the fraction risk. The results of this FE analysis were used to develop the hinge K-wire location on the PSSG. Several PSSG models with soft tissue-protecting sleeves were created. Among these designs, the second and third prototypes (3 prototypes in total) were tested on the cadaver specimens. After the tests, post-operative CT images of the cadavers were taken. From these images, 3D models of the tibia were constructed. Pre- and post-operative 3D models were registered onto each other for measuring the deviation between the planned and obtained osteotomy. This was used to analyze the accurate placement of the PSSG and its effect on the sleeve function. While the translation deviations ranged from 5.2 mm, 2.05 mm, and 7.81 mm, the rotational deviations ranged from 7.04°, 1.55°, and 9.16° for cases 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Two PSSG designs passed the acceptable region for translational malpositioning (lower than 5 mm). Although the malpositioning of the PSSG affected the sleeve position slightly, the cadaver test results showed that the sleeve still protected the tibia's posterior side from soft tissue injuries by stopping the cutting saw at the cutting trajectory due to its lengthy coverage at the posterior side of the tibia. Since the cadavers did not have the necessary soft tissues, it wasn't easy to give a concrete answer. Still, according to the results, the sleeve is expected to ensure soft tissue protection. Using the PSSG with a hinge-protecting K-wire and a soft tissue-protecting sleeve will likely provide lower radiation exposure, shorter operation time, fewer complication risks and lateral hinge fractures, less posterior soft tissue damage, and increased healing.","3D printing; Patient-specific implant; patient-specific; Surgical guide; open wedge high tibial osteotomy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2028-02-29","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

In many applications, semantic segmentation is used to pixel-wise classify a visual scene. The pixel-wise segmented map is used to estimate the traversability of different environments. The semantic segmentation accuracy can drop if environmental conditions change. The introduction of shadow in images can cause the segmentation network to misclassify pixels, which leads to an<br/>inaccurate traversability estimation. This inaccurate estimation could lead an autonomous vehicle to deviate from traversable paths, leaving it unable to continue or even cause accidents.<br/><br/>To increase the segmentation accuracy in shadow conditions, shadow removal before semantic segmentation is proposed. In this research, the supervised Dual Hierarchical Aggregation Network (DHAN) and unsupervised cycle-based Shadow Generative Adversarial Network (SGAN) are used for shadow removal before semantic segmentation with Segmentation Network (SegNet). The shadow removal networks are evaluated on two datasets, containing image triplets, consisting of shadow, shadow-free and shadow-mask images. The structural<br/>similarity is calculated for complete images and the non-shadow regions by inverting<br/>the shadow-masks. The networks are applied to the Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid) dataset to evaluate the change in segmentation accuracy. In a second set of experiments, the DHAN shadow removal network is retrained on multiple datasets containing synthetic shadows. The obtained DHAN networks are tested on shadows with increasing intensity. The retrained DHAN networks are compared to evaluate the training dataset for shadow removal to increase segmentation accuracy.<br/><br/>The experiments show that the DHAN increases the structural similarity of 99.8% and the SGAN for 74.5% of the datasets. After retraining on the synthetic shadow dataset, segmentation accuracy after DHAN shadow removal increases the segmentation Pixel Accuracy (PA) for a maximum of 91% and the segmentation mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) for a maximum of 88% of the images of the CamVid dataset. We conclude that segmentation accuracy increases after DHAN shadow removal if the DHAN is trained on the synthetic shadow dataset.","Generative Adversarial Networks; Shadow removal; Semantic segmentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Colomes, Oriol (graduation committee); van den Berg, Bas (graduation committee); de Jong, Robin (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","During ‘float-out’ installation of export cables, the cable is pulled to shore while floating, supported by inflatable floaters. Understanding the hydrodynamic behaviour of these cable-floater-systems (CFS’s) is important, to be able to relate the hydraulic environment to the cable stresses and determine the maximum allowed hydraulic conditions for these procedures. The software package OrcaFlex has appeared to be insufficient and gives untrustworthy results, namely really high peak axial tension and compression forces in the cable. In this research, the CFS is studied with three methods to explain these extreme forces and improve the CFS design. <br/><br/>With the first method, the CFS is modelled as an Euler Bernoulli Beam (EBB) on a continuous elastic foundation. In this analytical model, straight, accessible formulas showed that the CFS is a really stiff dynamic system, dominated by the buoyancy stiffness of the floaters. As a consequence, the natural frequencies are relatively high and in the same range as the wave frequency spectrum. This lead to this research’ hypothesis that the extreme, internal stresses in the cable-floater-system are caused by resonance taking place between the external wave forcing and the CFS itself.<br/><br/>With the second method, the CFS is modelled with the finite-element-method. In the vertical direction, the natural frequencies are again in the range of wave frequencies and are barely increasing for higher modes. The explanation for both of these observations is given by the local oscillations in the modal shapes occurring in between floaters. A parametric study on floater spacing shows that the length of these oscillations is determined by the floater spacing. Since the original floater spacing is small, it causes small wave lengths and high frequencies.<br/><br/>With the third method, dynamic analyses are done in OrcaFlex with cases varying in wave frequency and presence/absence of a current in order to test the hypothesis of resonance. It can be concluded that the CFS is really sensitive to Stokes drift when an other current is absent. This causes a different positioning of the CFS and a mean axial tension in the cable decreasing in wave direction. Consequently, the hydrodynamic behaviour of the CFS is changing throughout its length. Near the cable end most closest from where waves originate, the Stokes drift induced axial tension causes the CFS to be unable to move vertically in waves. Consequently, no interaction between wave and CFS, necessary for resonance, is taking place. Near the other cable end, the mean axial tension is close to zero and the most extreme axial forces occur for resonance conditions with wave frequency equal to natural frequency.<br/><br/>The results do not fully confirm the hypothesis, but do give answer to the first part of the research question. Regarding the second part on the optimisation of a CFS design, one could focus on eliminating the chance on the occurrence of resonance, by increasing the floater spacing or decreasing the floater dimensions, or focus on decreasing the impact of resonance by increasing the floater’s drag area in vertical direction.","Finite Element Method; Cable dynamics; Modal Analysis; Resonance; Euler Bernoulli Beam; Stokes drift; OrcaFlex; Finite Element Modeling; Finite Element Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-09","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Sinnige, T. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The angular momentum or swirl in the propeller slipstream is an energy loss. An effective method to recover the swirl and increase the propulsive efficiency is to use Swirl Recovery Vanes (SRVs). Former research showed an over-prediction in SRV thrust by a lifting line theory (LLT) model compared to wind tunnel experiments. The LLT model assumes an unbounded flow field from minus infinity to plus infinity, while in reality the SRV flow field is bounded due to a small axial spacing between the SRVs and the propeller plane. Using a 2D correction method, based on the application of the Kutta–Joukowski theorem in an axially confined domain combined with the thin airfoil approximation, a correction in the angle of attack can be computed for each blade element of the SRV. The LLT model including the correction method could match the SRV thrust of the experiments. Additionally, the original LLT thrust prediction was met with a corrected pitch angle of the SRVS. An SRV in off-design conditions would result in different correction angles. For a smaller thrust setting of the propeller, the thrust of the SRV will also be lower, hence the correction angle will be smaller. To make the correction method also applicable in off-design conditions, a fixed correction angle would be more practical since the whole vane can be rotated with a variable pitch to match the appropriate correction angle for the corresponding thrust setting. The fixed correction angle was determined by taking an average of all correction angles along the blade radius and the thrust prediction showed good agreement, with a negligible thrust loss of the SRV compared to correcting the pitch angle for each blade element separately. Finally, in the airfoil profile optimization, it was found that the profile drag of the profile is of less influence on the SRV thrust, hence more design freedom can be used to select the appropriate airfoil profile for the SRV.","Swirl Recovery Vane; SRV; Propeller; Slipstream; lifting-line method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The experimental setup presented in this study is the third iteration of the physical models aiming to recreate the main plume characteristics, where in this study the effects of the channel length, width, type (straight, converging/diverging or diverging), temperature and material are explored and linked to Enceladus’ crevasses. This is done by conduct- ing experiments with 7 different models, where the temperature and pressure are measured along the channels. The models are placed on top of a water-filled reservoir, where the reservoir conditions can be controlled to a limited extent by varying the heating power supplied to the reservoir water. The experimental setup is placed in the test section of the Hypersonic Test Facility Delft (HTFD), which functions as a vacuum chamber.<br/><br/>It is shown that the varying geometry of the channel imposes constraints on the maximum expansion angle before flow separation occurs, the sonic point location and the length/width combination in order to achieve a certain vent Mach number and mass flow rate, although this is also decided by the reservoir and ambient conditions. However, besides the physical properties of the model, there is evidence that the flow properties are dominated by the thermal processes occurring inside the setup. Condensation occurs only in the reservoir, releasing latent heat and making the isentropic flow assumption invalid by definition. It is demonstrated that it is likely that the thermal radiation from the test section of the HTFD onto the model is sufficient to thermally choke the flow. It is unlikely that the flows become choked due to the effects of friction alone. Cooling the models by 10-15°C did not result in significant changes in flow properties, and to have noticeable effects on the flow, the models would have to be cooled to much lower temperatures so that condensation occurs in the channel instead of the reservoir. Although the vapor remains unsaturated in the channels, there are signs of local temperature spikes in the ex- panding sections of the channels, near the vent, when either no or low heating power is supplied to the reservoir water and the pressure in the channel is reduced. This implies that either the temperature at the center of the channel is lower than what could be expected from the temperature measurements and heat is thus released by the deposition of the vapor, or the particles that condensed in the reser- voir partially evaporate after the throat of the channel, after which the evaporative cooling freezes the remainder of the particles, with the accompanying latent heat release. It is also not expected that a pressurized reservoir is necessary to create the plumes on Enceladus, nor is the presence of a geomet- rical throat, due to the combined effects of friction and condensing vapor. The results of one physical model are compared to a computational fluid dynamics model using the same geometry, and the main difference between the physical and numerical model is that the vent pressure of the numerical model is approximately half the vent pressure of the physical model, and the temperature of the numerical model dropped to about -50°C at the expanding section of the channel where the temperature only increased throughout the channel for the physical model. This, and the small heat spike near the vent under low-power conditions, has questioned the accuracy of the temperature measurement method and further research would be required to improve this accuracy.","Enceladus; Plumes; icy moons; geysers; phase changes; thermodynamics; gas dynamics; nozzle theory; HTFD; crevasse; channel design; vacuum chamber; experiments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This increasing prevalence of mental health problems among young adults, including burnout, anxiety, depression and feelings of hopelessness, has been exacerbated by factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change and societal pressures. Despite increased awareness, reduced stigma and efforts to improve mental health, the number of diagnoses appears to be increasing. The demand for professional mental health care is outstripping the capacity of institutions to provide it, making it difficult to access professional care in a timely manner and leading to an increasing reliance on biochemical solutions for symptom relief rather than psychotherapy. This sudden increase in mental health diagnoses among young adults cannot be attributed to changes in genetics, as genes don't change in a population over such a short period of time. If we assume that neither reduced stigma nor a change in genetics is solely responsible for the increase in mental health diagnoses, then we seem to have created an environment that is conducive to mental health problems in young adults. In particular, the transition from a learning environment to a working environment seems to be a moment of vulnerability for young adults, and this research therefore focuses on a transitional group, mostly aged 20-28, who can identify with this life transition. The aim of this thesis is to address the social phenomenon of declining mental health among the transitional group and to look for novel ways forward.<br/><br/>In order to find ways forward, a probable vision for the future of 2032 is defined through the collection of 168 contextual factors; concise statements that serve as building blocks for the future context.

This novel system is equipped with a power conversion system, to power the electrolyser and auxiliaries. Seawater lift with water treatment for desalination and demineralisation. And ultimately, the electrolyser with accompanying balance of system. <br/>This study selects a PEM electrolyser with three parallel modules of 5 MW capacity each. The individual components are separately modelled and combined to complete the system into a mathematical model. Furthermore, a power management strategy is included. The power management strategy determines which, how much and how many modules are powered. The enhanced results are measured by key performance indicators, which are total annual yield, number of start-stop events and power fluctuation within a module. These KPI's are inspired by the drivers of Shell to get the lowest levelised cost of hydrogen. More hydrogen production drives down the costs and the two other KPI's ensures less degradation on the modules, therefore extending the longevity. <br/><br/>This report shows that the use of a power management strategy improves the annual yield, but is also capable of minimising the effect of degradation caused by start-stop events and power fluctuation. The equal power division strategy increases the annual yield by at least 2%. The total number of power fluctuations can be significantly reduced by using the segmented start strategy. Finally, a strategy is developed to enhance the longevity of the system and diminish the degradation of the modules. <br/>Moreover, independent of the strategy, a higher annual yield is achieved by decreasing the size of the modules with the same total electrolyser capacity. However, only when it is operated on the right setpoint. <br/>Furthermore, over-sizing of the electrolyser capacity results in under-utilisation of the electrolyser. While under-sizing the electrolysis capacity leads to an increase in performance as the system is utilised more efficiently. The results are tested and strengthened in a sensitivity study, where other wind conditions and design parameters are applied to the system.<br","Green Hydrogen; Offshore Electrolysis; Power Management Strategy; PEM Electrolyser; Key Performance Indicators","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-15","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Concrete half-joints are a specific support detail in reinforced concrete structures, which reduce the construction height of the total structure. The use of concrete half-joints became popular around 1950s, but decreased its interest as a result of new insights on structural behaviour and collapses of these structures. Typical issues regarding concrete half-joints are either due to inadequate reinforcement detailing or due to deterioration mechanisms. The most critical deterioration is when a crack at the re-entrant corner allows for water ingress and thus corrosion of the rebars. This thesis focuses on the negative influence of this corrosion on the load bearing capacity and proposes an assessment method, which includes the reinforcement detailing. Firstly, problematic half-joints have been categorised and studied for reinforcement detailing. Subsequently, they have been analysed using an analytical tool, in which corrosion was implemented on the rebars. The outcomes were validated numerically.<br/><br/>For this thesis research, a series of Dutch concrete bridges has been studied to identify general reinforcement issues and categorise concrete half-joints. It has been observed that the majority showed short transfer- and/or anchorage lengths of the rebars and that all of them showed no shear stirrups as hanger-reinforcement. In stead, only a horizontal- and hanger rebar are present, which can be accompanied with a diagonal rebar, prestressing at the top or nib (or combinations in between).<br/><br/>An analytical tool is designed to calculate the load bearing capacity of (un)corroded concrete half-joints. The analysis is based on a lower-bound approximation using a strut-and-tie approach and an upper-bound approximation using a kinematic approach. The analytical tool is used to determine the load bearing capacity of the series of investigated Dutch concrete half-joints. Both approximations are comparable when rebar failure is the governing failure mechanism. The strut-and-tie approach also incorporates detailing checks, which are not considered in the kinematic approach. Therefore large differences occur when detailing governs the capacity.<br/><br/>The nodes in the strut-and-tie model, in which two ties are connected to one concrete strut, appear to be critical in the lower-bound solutions. The capacity depends on the concrete strength and dimensions of the node. The dimensions are influenced by the mandrel diameter of the hanger-rebar and anchorage length of the horizontal rebar. In order to study the influence of corrosion on the load bearing capacity, the effect of a reduced rebar capacity due to an increasing corrosion rate was implemented in the analytical tool. The kinematic approach appears to be more sensitive to load bearing capacity loss, as this calculation depends mainly on the strength of the rebars. The strut-and-tie approach is able to redistribute forces over the struts and ties and is less sensitive.<br/><br/>In order to verify the analytical results, a numerical study is performed. The specimens are modelled in such a way that rupture of one of the rebars at the re-entrant corner is governing. Both analytical solutions appear to be conservative compared to the numerical results, in which the lower-bound solutions are very conservative. Different crack’s angles have been found between the upper-bound calculation and numerical results. If the same angle is applied in the analytical tool, the difference reduces from 7% to 2% for an uncorroded concrete half-joint without diagonal. The differences can be explained by the simplification in the kinematic approach, in which the concrete compression zone is not able to transfer shear stresses.<br/><br/>Based on the conclusions of the analytical tool and numerical verification, an assessment method is proposed in which the upper-bound solution is combined with the lower-bound solution. If the load on the concrete half-joint is lower than the calculated lower-bound solution, the concrete half-joint is safe. However, questions arise if the load is between the lower- and upper-bound solution, in which structural safety cannot be guaranteed. The analytical tool is still a useful tool to understand the behaviour and vulnerabilities of the concrete half-joint. The analytical tool is even more useful if the strut-and-tie approach is governed by rupture of the horizontal-, diagonal- or hanger-rebar. The kinematic approach can be extended by implementing the same crack’s angle, which occurs in the existing concrete half-joint. <br","Existing; Concrete; Half-joint; Deterioration; strut and tie model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Many mitigations targeted at reducing the resulting stresses on the spud and other critical operating components have been proposed in recent years, most notably by adding a level of flexibility to the connection between the pontoon and the spud for rotational motions. Investigating the merits of the implementation of a flexible spud keeper however are hindered by the lack of accurate, CSD-specific models that are able to simulate real waves in the working area, as well as the multibody system of a CSD and its complex interactions with the sea floor. In this thesis, an ANSYS AQWA model is developed to conduct an operability analysis of a CSD in operation in offshore, coastal conditions. Three modelling objectives were established to provide a complete analysis of the effect of increased flexibility in a spud keeper: adding non-linear wave effects, improvement of the soil boundary conditions, and building a dynamic multibody system of a CSD in ANSYS AQWA.<br/><br/>A wave model is developed that expands upon standard Linear Wave Theory (LWT) through the use of Stokes 2<sup>nd</sup> Order Wave Theory (S2). S2 was found to be valid for a larger range of water depths and wave parameters than other wave theories, mainly in shallow, coastal conditions, which is the main operating area of a CSD. These non-linearities cannot be implemented into a frequency domain (FD) model, therefore a time domain (TD) model is required. A combination of S2 waves in a JONSWAP spectrum is used to simulate the motion and force response in TD, as well as second-order forces from the interaction of wave groups with the CSD. The model output is then used as a means of verification of these assumptions and to show the effect of the wave shapes on the spud bending stress.<br/>An altered spud model is proposed for shallow, wide spuds, using a rotational spring system instead of the commonly used clamped model. For the use-case of a CSD it shows a spud's tendency for rigid motion below the mudline, while also providing an upper operational limit for soil failure around the spud. The model output showed this upper limit to likely not be a important operational limit, but it can be used to investigate spud rotation below the mudline. Mooring effects from the cutter are absent in older models, but are added in the form of spring elements to better approach reality.<br/>Finally, a number of CSDs with different levels of flexibility are tested for four operational limits. The model shows a clear shift in motion resonance towards lower frequencies when the stiffness is decreased, while operability analysis in TD presents a significant increase in operability when a CSD is free to move in pitch. This completely flexible connection provides a major reduction in spud bending stress, but is governed by the acceleration limit of the pontoon. Other reduced stiffness designs are shown to only provide limited benefits to the operability.","cutter suction dredger; hydrodynamics; operability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-02-15","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Patients are admitted to the ICU after cardiothoracic surgery for continuous monitoring to prevent or treat postoperative complications as much and as soon as possible. One of these complications is the development of circulatory shock. It is likely caused by one or a combination of several factors, leading to increased morbidity and mortality in the ICU. The main purpose of the circulation is to transport O2 and nutrients to the tissues and remove waste products of the tissues via the tissue’s microcirculation. Under normal conditions, O2 supply exceeds O2 demand. However, during circulatory shock, the circulation cannot meet the perfusion demands of the organs, leading to organ dysfunction and organ failure. Resuscitation procedures for patients with circulatory shock focus on normalizing macrocirculatory parameters, such as CO and SvO2, by administering fluids and vasopressors to support tissue perfusion. Improvement in macrocirculatory parameters is expected to be paralleled by improvement in microcirculatory perfusion and tissue oxygenation (i.e., hemodynamic coherence), but it appears that these do not always improve simultaneously. Loss of this coherence has been associated with adverse outcomes. <br/><br/>The microcirculation can be imaged sublingually with an HVM. Studies in patients with septic shock have shown that hemodynamic coherence is often lacking. Therefore, it could be valuable to monitor the microcirculation of cardiothoracic surgery patients. <br/><br/>This thesis aimed to investigate the postoperative time course of microcirculatory parameters in patients admitted to the ICU after cardiothoracic surgery with and without circulatory shock,  the relationship between macro- and microcirculation, and the usage of leukocyte detection in understanding patient’s systemic inflammation.  <br/><br/>Chapter 2 provides general background information on cardiothoracic surgery, CPB, the physiology of the microcirculation, the latest generation of HVM, pathophysiological changes in the microcirculation after cardiothoracic surgery, leukocyte-endothelium interactions, the macrocirculation, and hemodynamic coherence. A retrospective study of cardiothoracic surgical patients with shock is described in Chapter 3 of this thesis. The results showed that the microcirculation might adapt to compensate for the circulatory shock state by decreasing RBCv and increasing FCD, TVD, and cHct compared with normal values of healthy volunteers while maintaining tRBCp. Chapter 4 describes a prospective study comparing cardiothoracic surgical patients with shock from Chapter 3 with cardiothoracic surgical patients without shock. The comparison between these two groups showed that both groups exhibited different behavior of the microcirculation. However, the underlying mechanism is not understood and requires further research. Chapter 5 contains an explanatory review of the use of STDs for leukocyte detection. Chapter 6 provides a general discussion and reviews the future prospects of microcirculation measurements as a tool in the management of critically ill patients. Our findings should be examined in more extensive clinical trials to determine whether microcirculatory changes contribute to the development of shock. <br/><br","Microcirculation; Cardiothoracic surgery; Intensive Care; Circulatory shock","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-30","","","","Technical Medicine | Sensing and Stimulation","",""

Being such a significant feature with regard to universal sustainable development, every aspect of its properties should be evaluated, examined and optimized so that there is a well-known, well-described and ready to use product. This project aimed at correlating some of the established parameters of conventional concrete such as water absorption of the coarse aggregate fraction and the resulting compressing strength, only applied in the field of recycled aggregate concrete. Along with these two properties, a prediction model was sought for which would be able to forecast the mechanical strength of concrete based on its coarse aggregate composition. A series of experiments were performed on samples fabricated for water absorption tests and compressive strength assessment. In total, 112 water absorption samples and over 250 concrete specimens were prepared and examined for the respective attribute. These samples used natural aggregate as the base of the coarse aggregate portion of the mix design, alongside a series of so-called contaminants which replaced the gravel in certain concentrations. These contaminants included bricks, ceramic tiles, glass, wood, gypsum, plastics, mineral fibers and recycled sand concrete and were entirely based upon the C&amp;DW composition globally. Further investigation was done on the inclusion of air within concrete so that contaminated concrete results could be equated to this constant. All water absorption tests were performed according to the current standards and concrete specimens were crushed after 7 and 28 days of curing in order to obtain their strength in compression, while the predictive model was initiated via the Minitab statistical software.<br/>The results indicated some interesting and promising trends. From both sets of experiments, it was evident that the water absorption of the coarse aggregate fraction was not the main contributor towards the strength development of recycled concrete. It had a minor influence, especially compared to the type of contaminant present and how much volume it took. Furthermore, samples with identical water absorption fabricated concretes with different strengths. Overall, plastics and wood had the most negative effect in terms of compressive strength, while bricks, tiles and glass seemed to affect this aspect in neutral or even slightly positive manner. EPS foam in very limited amounts yielded a notable 30 to 35% strength drop, while on the other hand, brick replacing 20% of the NA improved the strength by approximately 7% after 7 days and 2% after 28 days. In the end, based on all experimental input, a predictive model was developed, optimized and validated in several steps so that it was able to predict the water absorption of coarse aggregate, compressive strength after 7 and 28 days and equivalent air content based on the composition of the coarse aggregates.

To reach this goal, the fossil-fuel-dominated energy system must be transformed into a low-carbon renewable-based energy system. One method proposed to reduce fossil-fuel dependence is to establish a renewable hydrogen supply chain between Africa and the European Union. This work provides a model framework that enables an economic analysis of a renewable hydrogen supply chain between northern Africa and the EU. The aim of this work is to gain a better understanding of large-scale intercontinental renewable hydrogen production by investigating the factors that impact the economic performance of this system.<br/>A mixed-integer linear programming model that describes the supply chain is built, and modeled in Python and a case study defining the overall energy system under consideration and applied to this model. The system must provide 780 TWh of hydrogen demand for the EU in 2050. Hydrogen is produced by water electrolysis, using renewable electricity from solar photovoltaics. The water required for electrolysis is supplied through reverse osmosis of seawater. Seasonal storage of hydrogen is enabled through the inclusion of hydrogen storage in salt caverns.<br/><br/>The resulting annual costs of operating the supply chain are 36.55 B$, corresponding to a levelized cost of hydrogen of 1.56 $kg<sup>-1</sup>. The main contributors to the cost of the supply chain are solar photovoltaics (50\%), alkaline electrolysis (22%), and transportation (26%). Through a sensitivity analysis on price uncertainty, it is found that the system is most sensitive to photovoltaics prices (59%), electrolysis prices (21%), and hydrogen pipeline prices (18%). A sensitivity analysis of the interest rate on capital investment points towards a significant impact of the interest rate on the total annual cost.<br/><br/>The findings of the model and applied case study in this work are then compared to projected costs in other works. From this analysis, it is found that hydrogen production using electrolysis will be cheaper than fossil-based low-carbon hydrogen production alternatives in the form of steam methane reforming or coal gasification with carbon capture technology. Predictions of the selected works regarding electrolysis-based hydrogen production using renewable electricity show an expected LCOH of between 1.66 - 2.39 $kg<sup>-1</sup>.<br/><br/>This work indicates that a renewable hydrogen supply chain between Morocco and the EU in 2050 is both technically and economically feasible, able to compete with alternative hydrogen production methods, and able to supply 35% of the projected hydrogen demand.

Salvagers typically use their expertise, experience, and data from previous projects to make these estimates. Diamond wire cutting is a material-cutting technique with much potential for use in wreck salvaging. However, a previously conducted literature review revealed a lack of sufficient information in the existing literature to determine the cutting rates of diamond wire used in wreck removal, indicating a gap in current knowledge. A deeper understanding of the technique is needed to evaluate salvagers' capability of cutting diamond wire in wreck removal. Therefore, the primary focus of this paper is to provide a method to estimate the cutting rate of diamond wire when used in wreck removal. The effect of wire speed, normal load on the workpiece, various materials encountered in wreck cutting, different geometries, and environments on cutting rate have been investigated. Filling this knowledge gap is of particular interest to Boskalis, as they currently have limited knowledge and experience with diamond wire cutting, making it challenging to estimate costs. Additionally, research into wreck removal techniques is socially significant, as the ability to remove wrecks efficiently and with minimal environmental impact is crucial. Therefore, this thesis aims to provide a deeper understanding of diamond wire cutting in its application in wreck removal.<br/><br/><br/>Main factors determining the potential of a technique for removal include the total duration of removal, the required assets, and the associated risks. The primary focus of this thesis is to develop a method to estimate the cutting rate of diamond wire when used in wreck removal. The cutting rate will be predicted using the Archard wear equation, which requires an unknown coefficient ($K$) that can be determined through experiments. A real-world set-up with diamond wire was used to obtain data.<br/><br/>The results show that for the steels and cast iron in this survey, Archard's assumption that the wear volume is inversely proportional to hardness is not supported. Consistent with Archard’s equations, the wear volume has been found to be proportional to normal load, sliding distance but independent of speed within the range of tested conditions. As such, the Archard wear equation can be applied to the materials tested, but its applicability to materials that differ significantly from those tested is uncertain. Furthermore, results show that cooling significantly impacts both wire life and cutting rate. Specifically, fully submerging the workpiece resulted in a <br/>XX\% improvement in the cutting rate as compared to spraying with coolant. It should be noted that these results were obtained under controlled conditions where normal load, wire speed, and cutting angle were kept constant, and proper cooling was possible. These operational parameters may vary in real-world scenarios, such as cutting through a shipwreck, leading to deviation from the predicted cutting rates.","Diamond wire cutting; Wreck removal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-02-14","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

Recently, more and more research interests are devoted to durability performance. In cold areas, freeze-thaw resistance is a crucial durability factor for concrete. However, the understanding of the freeze-thaw resistance of AAMs is minimal. Accordingly, the subject of this thesis is drawn forth. The main aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of using admixtures (SAP and AEA) to improve the freeze-thaw resistance of alkali-activated slag (AAS). <br/>Regarding the general properties, such as workability and mechanical properties, it was found that the influence of adding SAP or AEA is acceptable. Then, the air-void systems created by SAP and AEA were reconstructed and characterized by the micro-CT scan. It was found that both SAP and AEA successfully entrained air voids into AASM, while the characteristics of the resultant air-void system were quite different. Further analysis on the surface condition of AASM undergoing 28-day sealed curing or preconditioning procedures in the CDF test, and the ASTM C672 test revealed that AASM shows a considerable surface microcracking potential. Samples sealed for 28 days showed a considerable extent of microcracking due to autogenous shrinkage. Samples that underwent 14-day drying after 7/14 days’ curing showed significant microcracking due to autogenous shrinkage and drying shrinkage. With the addition of SAP, the cracking caused by autogenous shrinkage was minimized, but the cracking caused by drying was only slightly reduced. With the addition of AEA, there was only a minor improvement in surface integrity. <br/>The freeze-thaw resistance of AASM with or without the addition of SAP or AEA was investigated in the form of surface scaling damage by a modified CDF test. Plain AASM showed poor surface scaling resistance mainly attributed to the pre-existing surface microcracking. The addition of SAP and AEA successfully improved the surface scaling resistance of AASM. The improvement was more significant by adding SAP due to the effect of improving surface integrity. Based on the SAP mixtures, a good correlation was found between the SAP air-void system and the resultant surface scaling resistance. The final cumulative surface scaling generally decreased with higher entrained air content, denser air voids distribution, and smaller air voids size. A preliminary logarithm model was developed for the relationship between the reduction in surface scaling and the equivalent water/binder ratio and the air-void system. Finally, upscaling tests on the concrete scale also found that the addition of SAP improved the surface scaling resistance of AASC.<br/>Overall, in this study, the freeze-thaw resistance of AAS was successfully improved by the SAP and AEA. The effects of adding SAP/AEA and the related factors on the selected properties of AASM were revealed. The mechanisms behind these observations were also understood and generated a series of further research possibilities. It is hoped that these findings and observations can give some guidance to the industrial applications of AAS and some inspiration to the scientific community.","Alkali-Activated Materials; Alkali-activated slag concrete; Freeze-thaw resistance; Air entraining; Superabsorbent Polymer; Air-Entraining Agent; Microcracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Tonnes of prematurely disposed, functional and repairable furniture is often destined for landfill or incineration, with small proportions recycled. The emergent sustainability needs of the planet, and changing policies for repair of consumer products, drives the home furnishing company IKEA to explore repair as a circular strategy to enable prolonging the life of IKEA furniture. This project explores the context of repair at IKEA and is focused on the use-life of furniture, in people’s home. <br/><br/>Linear models aimed at profit making from the sale of new furniture, have so far prevented exploration of repair in IKEA stores. Subsequently leading to lacking visibility, knowledge, competencies, and resources for repair. While interventions are now being explored, in the form of tests and few examples at IKEA globally, channels for exchange of knowledge and service to customers are limited or yet to be developed. <br/>In terms of customer behaviour for repair various values associated to furniture, from functional, aesthetic, emotional, material, and social, motivate customers to repair their home furniture. Yet highly person and product dependent and oftentimes limited perceived ability, in terms of knowledge, skills and resources for repair of home furniture, prevents people of taking any actions for repair. Furthermore, missing triggers, especially in the face of easily available and affordable new furniture, and high effort, low impact perception of repair leads people to replace rather than repair their furniture. <br/><br/>A participatory approach to include various perspectives relevant for repair, guided the research + design project. Desk research, interviews, front days, and co-creation with various stakeholders from IKEA helped identify the context of repair at IKEA NL. In terms of the infrastructural capacities, shortcomings, and subsequent opportunities for customer-end repair interventions by IKEA. Customer insights were gathered from desk research and further explored through interviews, survey, and co-creation sessions. Pain points, challenges and needs identified for distinct customer personas, enabled conceptualisation and prototyping of repair interventions to prolong the life of IKEA furniture. <br/><br/>Within the scope of this project, customer challenges of missing awareness of resources and overwhelming options for repair were explored alongside their needs for a sense of preparedness, advice, and guidance for repair of home furniture. In-store repair and refurbish activities for customers were explored as prototypes in collaboration with external experts to mitigate the limited repair resources and competencies in the store. The activities explored repair as a creative and social process. These were proposed to inspire, motivate, and enable customers to add value to their IKEA furniture. Creatively repaired products, demonstrations, hands-on engagement, and advice from experts were evaluated to investigate customer experience and desirability of the workshops.<br/><br/>While customer experience was positive and desirability for future workshops was high, yet there is low scope of feasibly and viably operating the workshops in their current format. Prominent challenges included limited dedicated space for and exploration of creative repairs and repaired products for inspiration, as well as many interdependent systems, especially in case of customer engagement and. The prototype workshops revealed a need to develop infrastructure, knowledge and products that are creatively repaired, prior to engaging with customers for knowledge exchange. <br/><br/>An alternate model of in-store repair and refurbish of IKEA furniture is proposed as future recommendation in the form of a visible creative repair hub, hosted by external experts. To enable development of a range of creatively repaired furniture for sale and inspiration, thereby preventing the waste of abundant damaged furniture from showroom and customer returns. A local repair hub in-store and expert collaborations also offer the opportunity to cater to customer repair requests in-stores, or referral to at-home services. <br","Repair; Furniture; Creative; Social; Care","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Their Nova product line offers force feedback, haptics, and finger tracking to increase immersion in VR and provide intuitive interaction with virtual objects for training purposes. Driven by a desire to implement new features, communicate a new branding direction and increase production rates while maintaining quality, SenseGlove requested a full redesign of Nova’s enclosure with a focus on improving assembly time.<br/><br/>An analysis of Nova’s original assembly process and design was conducted and showed several areas in which it could be improved. Then, three focus points were defined based on principles from Poka Yoke and DFA:<br/><br/>Focus point 1:<br/><i>Minimize the number of parts needed for subassemblies within the scope of this project.</i><br/><br/>Focus point 2:<br/><i>Improve the logic of the assembly steps and make them as self-explanatory as possible.</i><br/><br/>Focus point 3:<br/><i>Reduce the loss of progress that can occur from human error during assembly.<br/></i><br/>Guided by the focus points, a three-phase design process was completed in which Nova was divided into several subproblems that were individually solved, then combined into a configuration model, before finally being integrated with a new aesthetic direction that was co-developed with SenseGlove to create a Nova 2.0 concept with a new assembly process. A proposal for CMF was also provided, along with an evaluation based on assembly, aesthetics reception, manufacturability, and costs.<br/><br/>The Nova 2.0 concept is estimated to take approximately 53% of the original time to assemble, while eliminating the need for several assembly stations and enabling nondestructive disassembly. The new aesthetic direction fits well among other VR devices often used together with Nova but requires some refinement to meet all visual goals set by SenseGlove. The model provided in this report is not yet completely manufacturable, but with minor adjustments and implementation of recommendations should be ready for production. The new production cost is expected to be higher than the original Nova due to the implementation of new features and a redesigned PCBA, though the exact price cannot be determined as some features were beyond the scope of this project. <br/><br/>The Nova 2.0 concept reaches the goals set at the start of this project and SenseGlove is recommended to further develop it but is advised to keep the three focus points in mind when making changes, as design for assembly needs to be applied in all stages of development to bring maximum benefits and reduce the risk of facing issues in the future.","Design for Assembly; Virtual Reality; Rapid Prototyping; Haptics; Force Feedback; Wearable; Redesign","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

There is bed-driven and suspended-driven density wave amplification, in which the grain size determines which mechanism is dominant.<br/><br/>Density wave amplification in hydraulic pipeline transport causes significant risk during operation with the consequences of blockage. Current design methodology for pipeline transport considers mixture velocity and density constant over space and time. However, these conditions are only possible in laboratory circuits where conditions can be controlled carefully. In real-world conditions, concentration varies significantly over time due to the natural dredging process in which a dredging vessel takes slurry from the seabed. Density wave amplification can be differentiated into two different flow categories. Both long horizontal transport and a combination of vertical and horizontal transport. With the first category, there are two main theories that explain the amplification of density waves: 'erosion and sedimentation imbalance' and 'the unstable slip point of the bed'. Here, density wave amplification only occurs in the presence of a bed.  <br/>In the second category, there is one theory called the: 'transient accumulation theory' which is applicable to a combination of horizontal and vertical transport. With this density wave, amplification can occur far above the deposit limit velocity. Mixture velocities change when density waves travel from horizontal to vertical orientation and vice versa. When mixture velocity changes density will change. The influence of grain size, concentration and the centrifugal pump on density wave amplification has not been researched yet. <br/><br/>A test loop has been built with an inner diameter of 46mm and a length of 46 meters. The goal of this laboratory circuit is to investigate the mechanisms that result in the amplification of density waves. Two types of density waves were measured: bed-driven density waves occurring with coarse sediments (Dorsilit 7: d<sub>50</sub>=1040 μm and Dorsilit 8: d<sub>50</sub>=619 μm) and suspended-driven density waves occurring with fine sediments (Dorsilit 9: d50=316 μm and Zilverzand: d<sub>50</sub>=240 μm). With bed-driven density waves, there is fast amplification and multiple sharp waves which can result in areas where no concentration is left. With suspended-driven density waves, there is one smooth wave, and amplification takes multiple loop lengths.<br","Density waves; Slurry transport; Amplification; Horizontal transport; Dredging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-06","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Since 1901, the temperature in the Netherlands has risen about twice as fast as the global average and the effects of climate change seem clearly noticeable. With sea levels rising and peak river discharges increasing an enormous pressure is mounting on the current Flood Protection Programme in the Netherlands and measures to prepare for an uncertain future are being developed. Although expensive, the most commonly used strategy as in the current Flood Protection Programme is to increase the retaining heights of the existing dikes. A new method to improve the flood defence system in the South West Delta of the Netherlands is the Delta21 concept. With discharging instead of raising the dikes in mind, Delta21 poses an alternative strategy to reinforcing dike sections for the downstream area of the Rhine and Meuse. The idea of Delta21 is a future-proof solution for the Southwestern Delta of the Netherlands. A solution for not only flood risk management, but energy transition and nature restoration as well.<br/><br/>Between the coastline of the Tweede Maasvlakte and that of the island of Goeree-Overflakkee, the Delta21 project aims to construct a flood defence in the form of a row of dunes, multiple pumping stations and a closable storm surge barrier. Considering protection against flooding, Delta21 strives to limit the water level at Dordrecht to a maximum of NAP + 2.5 m. The flood defence ensures that a lake of about 20 km2 is created in the sea, as it were. By closing off the newly created Tidal Lake by means of a storm surge barrier and opening up a spillway to the Energy Storage Lake, pumping stations are able to pump excess river water from the Energy Storage Lake into the sea. The dunes and the closable storm surge barrier together provide sufficient protection against high seawater levels.<br/><br/>This thesis aims to come up with a preliminary, integral design for the Delta21 storm surge barrier taking into account the new Delta21 landscape design as such that the required functionality of Delta21 is met. This design must fulfil the functional and structural requirements and must fit within the ideology of Delta21. To achieve this, the hydraulic engineering design method is used. The first step in this cycle is to analyse the system with the purpose to better understand the situation in order to formulate the requirements and boundary conditions more accurately. The first design phase is concluded with the basis of design where the processes and functions of the Delta21 system explored<br/>in the system analysis are translated into the requirements and boundary conditions used for the design. The Basis of Design provides mostly ""SMART"" formulated functional- and structural requirements and boundary conditions. Boundary conditions at sea have been determined using Hydra-NL software.<br/>Climate change plays a vital role in this, as mostly sea level rise influences the boundary conditions significantly. Wishes from stakeholders, which are also explored in the system analysis, are translated either in requirements or evaluation criteria.<br/><br/>In the second step a gate type variant study is conducted. From an inventory of multiple concepts, the vertical lift gate and the segment gate remained after verification. After evaluation of the two remaining concepts using the functional requirements and criteria from stakeholders, the vertical lift gate came out as most suitable for the Delta Barrier. Subsequently, in the second step, a spatial and functional design is presented which satisfies all functional requirements. A new Delta21 flood protection process is proposed in order to more effectively<br/>protect the hinterland from flooding. The reliability of the closure operation has been researched after which is concluded that the closure procedure can be considered reliable until a sea level rise of ca. 1 m. It is verified with a hydrodynamic model that an effective flow area of 6000 m2, defined below NAP,<br/>is to be preferred where mostly the impact on the ecosystem was governing. In order to enable passage of shipping, a location of a separate lock complex is proposed and bridge girders are incorporated into the design in order to enable the passage of road-traffic over the barrier. Furthermore, it is concluded that using tidal turbines to generate electricity with tidal flow behind the Delta Barrier is unfeasible due to the shallow water depth behind the barrier and the relatively low tidal flow velocities through the barrier. Hydraulic cylinders are chosen as driving mechanisms for the gates as it is expected that hydraulic cylinders are less expensive and have a lower failure probability than e.g. a rack and pinion system. Lastly, using a climate adaptive pathway approach, three general strategies are presented to the closure reliability problem of the Delta Barrier after ca. 1 m of sea level rise. Firstly, the barrier could be closed permanently as part of the ""protected closed"" strategy. Secondly, the dikes in the hinterland<br/>could be strengthened, the bottom protection could be strengthened, the probability that the closure of gates fail could be decreased and the Tidal Lake water level could be increased during a non-closure event. Additionally, the Water Act allows for redistribution of failure probabilities over dike segments<br/>and failure mechanisms. Changes in the closure regime could also prove beneficial. These solutions are part of the ""protected open"" strategy. Thirdly, inhabitants of the lower lying areas of the Netherlands could be stimulated to move to higher ground in the Netherlands as part of the ""move along"" strategy.<br/>It should be noted that a combination of either three strategies is very much possible and perhaps to be preferred. The Delta21 project enables the adaptation of any climate adaptive pathway where especially the ""protected closed"" and ""protected open"" strategies seem in line with the ideology of Delta21. Whereas the solutions above are presented within the context of the Delta21 flood protection system and the Delta Barrier, the problem is not specific to the Delta Barrier alone and a solution placed within an integral flood protection strategy for the entire (South West) Netherlands might be preferred. <br/><br/>As the third step, a structural design is presented which satisfies all structural requirements. Firstly, it is determined that a prefab construction method suits the construction of the Delta Barrier best, where the piers are to be sunk on to a prepared bed and most of the assembly of the barrier is to take place from the water using specialised vessels and equipment. Secondly, the 40 m long and<br/>10.4 m high steel gates (25 in total) are designed. Thirdly, all main elements of the concrete civil superstructure are designed consisting of the 25 top beams, 25 sill beams and the 26 piers. In general, all concrete elements are restrained from cracking and post-tensioned. Finally, the global stability of the Delta Barrier is verified, taking into account horizontal, vertical and rotational stability, uplift,<br/>scour and internal erosion. A geometrically closed granular bottom protection is designed to tackle the latter two failure mechanisms. In a structural sense, the Delta Barrier is able to withstand a sea level rise of 3.81 m corresponding to the median projection of climate scenario SSP5-8.5 and has a design life of 200 years. The construction of the Delta Barrier will take ca. 5 years, is assumed to be<br/>completed in 2050 and will cost between ca. 2.67 and 3.50 billion euro (price level 2022).<br/><br/>It is recommended to further investigate the ecological impact of the Delta Barrier. Furthermore, a detailed driving mechanisms design and as such a more profound estimate for the probability that the closure of the gates fail is to be recommended.<br","Civil Engineering; Storm surge barrier; Climate adaptation; DELTA21; Hydraulic Engineering; Hydraulic Structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","DELTA21",""

Equip is a Fintech startup currently developing a financial coaching platform to be offered to employees paid by their employer. For employers, it is a valuable strategy to improve employees’ financial wellbeing since financial stress results in lower productivity, increased absenteeism and lower retention. In addition, improving employees’ financial wellbeing can also attract young and new talent while maintaining current employees. <br/><br/>The most common reasons early-stage startups fail are lack of resources and insufficient customer research, resulting in the absence of good product market fit. The platform involves a complex stakeholder field: two types of customers, namely the employer and its employees, and in addition to these, the service supplier in the form of several financial experts. The researcher of this master thesis has identified each of these actors’ motivation to use and interact with Equip.<br/> <br/>Different stakeholders' needs and value indicators were discovered through literature, user interviews, generative sessions and internal analysis of Equip. During a joint prioritisation session with Equip’s team, the identified needs were assessed according to the expected customer and business value they would generate.<br/><br/>The prioritisation resulted in the focus area: Providing personal guidance during the first steps users have to take to secure their financial future so that they stop procrastinating.<br/><br/>A new proposition, i.e. the Financial Roadmap, was developed through ideation and experimentation. The Financial Roadmap enables users to simulate the effect of specific financial decisions (i.e. life events) on the development of their financial situation over time. This allows users to think ahead of their financial future by putting a plan together and making their finances more tangible.<br/> <br/>Given that measuring the impact on the repeat usage rate by implementing the Financial Roadmap is impossible since this requires full implementation and time, a Minimal Viable Product is presented to validate the concept further.

(mentor); Storm, S.T.H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Since the conception of the euro, it has often been suggested that the eurozone start a programme of jointly issuing government debt. There are many arguments for these so-called Eurobonds, and temporary issuance of them has already taken place in response to the economic impact of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. However, a permanent Eurobond programme remains a controversial topic within the EU.<br/>Advocates claim that a Eurobond programme can facilitate economic growth and stability for the entire eurozone. It could offer much-needed fiscal space to some of the eurozone’s most heavily indebted southern economies, by decreasing borrowing costs. It is assumed that the extra growth facilitated in these countries will spill over to the rest (mostly the less indebted north) of the eurozone, through increased cross-country trade and investment. Criticism mostly originates from the more financially sound eurozone member states, which fear a situation of moral hazard that leads to uncontrolled spending, and a possible deterioration of their own creditworthiness.<br/>This research attempts to explore the economic effects of the introduction of Eurobonds on the eurozone economies. For this effort, two distinct types of Eurobonds are identified and analysed: unlimited Eurobonds and Blue Bond Eurobonds, with the former allowing unlimited issuance of mutualised debt, and the latter restricting this to 60% of a country’s GDP.<br/>The economic sub systems that are crucial for explaining the dynamics relevant to this study show a high degree of complexity and uncertainty; whether it is the dynamics of debt management (including stocks, flows, delays and feedback mechanisms), the different ways of determining bond yields (these are structural uncertainties), or the magnitude of economic elasticities/sensitivities (these are parametric uncertainties). These system characteristics stress the need for a simulation modelling approach. Because the interactions between the system’s components and the relative importance of certain elements are of interest, and because the results should be insightful to non-technical policy-makers, a transparent, ‘white-box’ model can provide the most meaningful results. For these reasons, a system dynamics model has been developed for this study.<br/>Specifically, an exploratory system dynamics modelling and analysis approach is used, due to the inherent structural and parametric uncertainties related to the system that have to be accounted for. Through exploratory experimentation with this model, the effectiveness of both Eurobond policies has been assessed based on how they affect eurozone and country-specific GDP, interest rates, and debt levels. All experimental results are robust for the different structural and parametric uncertainties identified in the system; multiple methods of determining bond yields taken have been into account, just as a large number of configurations of the parametric uncertainties.<br/>As for the economic growth facilitated by both Eurobond policies, the country-level results are mostly insignificant (i.e., not more than 0.50% additional GDP growth after 10 years). Only slight increases in GDP are observed for both policies, with the benefits not evenly distributed amongst member states. Southern, more heavily indebted economies have more to gain, due to the larger relative decrease in their borrowing costs, assuming that the additional funding is spent productively. Furthermore, the anticipated positive economic spill-over effects caused by increased cross-country trade and investment (and not attributed decreases in interest rates) are shown to be insignificant as well.<br/>ii<br/>However, the results of the analysis do indicate that both unlimited and Blue Bond Eurobonds have the potential to offer significant benefits to the eurozone’s economic stability, by reducing borrowing costs for all participating countries. As anticipated, it is again mostly the heavily indebted southern economies that benefit from this. Unlimited Eurobonds offer slightly more benefits to these countries, when compared to Blue Bond Eurobonds. However, the latter is the preferred option for the less indebted north, since it restricts debt issuance and subsequently prevents Eurobond yields from surpassing their current borrowing costs; something will eventually be the case with unlimited Eurobonds.<br/>Based on this study’s results, a recommendation is made to start the implementation of (a variant of) the Blue Bond Eurobond policy. It has the potential to significantly increase the eurozone’s public debt sustainability, while also offering minor (mostly insignificant) growth benefits to the heavily indebted southern member states, without deteriorating the creditworthiness and the fiscal position of the other, northern member states. Furthermore, the existing market pressure for prudent fiscal behaviour is maintained in the Blue Bond Eurobond proposal, mitigating the risks of moral hazard feared by critics of debt mutualisation.<br/>Additionally, it is necessary to set up an adequate legal and political framework that incentivises fiscal discipline and does not allow for free-riding behaviour. A transfer of fiscal sovereignty to the EU level is to be a requirement for participation in the Eurobond programme. This is necessary to build confidence in the system, both for the eurozone member states, as for the capital markets and the general public. It is further deemed sensible to include a legal clause in the Eurobond programme that allows for the suspension of individual member states’ participation. The (budgetary) conditions for such a clause to be invoked, and the potential (financial) penalties associated with this remain to be decided upon by the eurozone member states and the EU’s (to-be erected) fiscal and monetary institutions.<br/>Keywords: Eurobonds, Bond yield determination, Debt sustainability, Macroeconomic analysis, Policy analysis, Exploratory Modelling and Analysis","Eurobonds; Bond yield determination; Debt sustainability; Macroeconomic analysis; Policy analysis; Exploratory Modelling and Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

A recent work proposes to rely on the edges to reveal the braiding statistics of nonAbelian anyons in the bulk, in an entirely deterministic dynamical process. A time-dependent gap in a Josephson junction couples two co-propagating Majorana fermions, and as the gap closes, a pair of edge-vortices is injected into the edges. Because these defects have the same non-Abelian statistics, they are braided with vortices in the bulk. Conveniently, the fusion of the edge-vortices results in a quantized unit of charge at the exit. However, this process is so far only predicted in the adiabatic limit. In this work, this assumption is relaxed by means of a full manybody evolution of the superconducting ground state in the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes formalism. Beyond revealing the collective nature of the edge-vortex excitation, we demonstrate that the quantization of charge still holds if the system does not return to the ground state. Furthermore, the effect of path length difference between the edge-vortices confirms the theoretical predictions done in another work on the subject. At fast injections, we reveal weak oscillations in current contributed by the bound states in the junction which average to zero and are removed in the short junction limit. This work is concluded with a preliminary evaluation of the manybody parity operator, which indicates that the edge-vortex may encode the parity of the bulk vortices. This opens the possibility for sequential qubit manipulations on the edge-vortex.","Edge vortex; Majorana zero mode; non-Abelian anyons braiding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-27","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","Master Thesis",""

The current tools and models used in the industry are inadequate and do. not provide the necessary insights into an organisation’s strategic direction. To address this issue, the research project focuses on creating a holistic model that provides a comprehensive approach to the creation of flourishing organisation strategies.<br/><br/>The research project employs a research-by-design approach to develop the concept. This involved exploratory interviews with Strategiemakers employees, interviews with other strategy consultants, strategists within companies, and educational experts. The aim was to define the components necessary for a flourishing organisation, the requirements for a successful flourishing strategy and to examine the tools that can help to create a flourishing strategy.<br/><br/>As a result of the research and ideation, the concept produced four interrelated components: the Bee Flourishing Model, the Tool Inspiration Guide, the Sustainable Tool Storage, and the Back-end Spreadsheet.<br/><br/>The Bee flourishing model is an organisational model starting in the organisation’s core with its purpose and offers a holistic view of the interconnectedness between the impact of an organisation’s business on sustainability and its internal impact within the organisation. The Tool inspiration guide provides Strategiemakers with advice on the selection of tools that are best suited to support their clients’ journey towards a flourishing organisation. This guide adds value to Strategiemakers by better suiting the client’s needs and not forcibly converting the tools they always use. A structured approach to selecting tools for building sessions can help ensure that the strategy for achieving a flourishing organisation is well-thought-out and effective.<br/><br/>The reorderable matrix approach, when applied in a novel way for the back-end spreadsheet, provides a fresh perspective for strategic designers. It enables the visualisation and analysis of interactions between elements, i.e. tools for developing a flourishing strategy and facilitates how tools can be combined to complement each other to fulfil the specific needs or requirements of an organisation.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Strategiemakers can position themselves with this concept as thought leaders in the field of sustainable transformation by conducting research and making their findings open source. The Bee flourishing model can be used by organisations seeking to transform into sustainable entities, and the Tool inspiration guide should be expanded to better align with the requirements for a successful flourishing strategy. To improve usability, it is recommended to establish a hierarchy among the tools and to bring the style of the guide even more in line with Strategiemakers’ style. To stay relevant and up-to-date, Strategiemakers should keep actively researching new tools and expanding the guide, making it a comprehensive resource for the company.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Over the years, it has been noticed that project success is a challenging issue, which requires several endeavours from project parties. The procurement system is characterized as a tool, the implementation of which delivers project results. The procurement system is classified into four distinct categories; traditional, design &amp; build, strategic &amp; integrated, partnering. Based on those, the most popular procurement technique historically is the traditional method. The traditional method is mostly applied successfully in small projects, when less complexity and uncertainty emerge. However, the complexity and uncertainty have largely increased, marking the traditional method slightly impractical for successful results. In that case, a new procurement method is introduced, the Best Value Procurement (known as BVP) method. A critical advantage of the BVP is the embodiment of complexity and collaboration demands into its process. Despite its advantages and ambitions, the BVP does not always secure a successful result. Therefore, the main question that will be addressed in this research is: <br/><br/>“How could public organizations implement Best Value Procurement (BVP) to benefit the project <br/>delivery?”<br/><br/>To answer the main research question, a deep investigation through the BVP concept (elements, activities etc.) was executed. Firstly, an extensive literature review was exercised in order to cover the BVP method on the theoretical side. Based on the literature results, a theoretical BVP framework was established. Secondly, the findings acquired from the literature review were examined, leading to the exploratory interviews. Interviews are exploring the practical side of the BVP and how is applied in practice. Seven interviewees were selected. An understanding of differences and similarities between theory and practice was essential. Using the findings from the frameworks’ comparison, a list of adjustments (or recommendations) for improving the BVP method is established. Interviews with experts were held. Three experts, coming from public organisations and consultancy firms apply their knowledge and expertise in order to improve the BVP method. Thereafter, an alternative BVP framework was established. The alternative BVP framework incorporates components (elements, activities, including parties, final deliverables), the influence of which is characterized as critical for the BVP success. Public organisations frequently apply the BVP method in their projects. Being BVP initiators in the market industry, public organisations should implement BVP carefully. The alternative BVP framework, proposed in the research, could be used by public clients in order to achieve successful project outcomes. For a successful implementation of the BVP method, special attention should be attributed to the main alterations:<br/><br/>General highlights:<br/>1. An introduction of Stage zero; training sessions, about BVP philosophy, are becoming available<br/>through every single project participant<br/>2. An introduction of final deliverables (per step); setting clearly the deliverables to be received <br/>at the end of every stage<br/><br/>Selection stage:<br/>1. Interviews inclusion as part of the evaluation process, not separate activity of the selection <br/>stage<br/>2.

Only on-board sensors are used, with no knowledge of thrust and rpm. A deterministic method models drag experienced by the drone classically as a quadratic function of true airspeed, and estimates wind by deducting the estimated true airspeed with the GPS ground speed. Additionally, a particle filter is implemented and compared to the deterministic method. To validate the proposed methods, a series of verification flights is conducted in which the drone is flown straight into the wind, perpendicular to, and away from the wind. The results show that the proposed method can estimate wind for various ground speeds and altitudes. The root mean square error ranges between 0.3-2.0 m/s and 5-35 degrees in most scenarios with high true airspeeds. In most cases, the particle filter shows a slight improvement over the deterministic method, at the cost of reduced adaptivity to wind changes (gusts).","quadcopters; state estimation; wind estimation; particle filter; sensorless; imu","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","METSIS",""

The dawning era of space exploration aims to set the groundwork for long-term off-Earth settlement, with sights on bringing the first humans to Mars. In order to provide a safe means of inhabiting extraterrestrial (ET) environments, a self-supporting habitat shield concept has been developed by the Specialist Modelling Group at Foster + Partners, which is based on the use of mechanically interlocking masonry manufactured from in-situ resources. Significant progress must still be made in the structural design and validation of such systems, however, before they can be safely implemented. Due to the novelty of the proposed structure, existing research does not provide numerical evidence of its stability under self-weight, or under seismic loading. Research in this direction is valuable, as it explores alternatives to popular design concepts based on monolithic additive manufacturing and addresses research gaps related to the analysis of mechanically interlocking structures. <br/><br/>The aim of this project is to provide novel insight into the stability of self-supporting dry-stone vaults under the influence of microgravity and ground motions. This is achieved through a three-part analysis approach, which starts with an investigation into the fundamental structural behaviour of dry-stone, Nubian-type vaults based on a series of parametric studies. Key geometric parameters of the vaults are varied, and the resulting distinct element models are subjected to quasi-static pushover-type analysis in 3DEC. The parametric studies indicate what configuration of the vault geometry can maximise seismic capacity. This optimal vault geometry is modelled in Rhino using geometric constraint solving, which is used to produce a model which can be assembled from mechanically interlocking components. Through pushover-type testing and dynamic time history analysis, the performance of the resulting vault model is assessed with respect to possible moonquake loading. The final part of the design process accounts for uncertainties in material properties by conducting sensitivity studies, which indicate what degree of variation in performance is possible. <br/><br/>After completing the three mains sets of analysis needed to design a moonquake-resistant vault, several comparative analyses are carried out to provide context to the structural performance of the Nubian-type vault. The first of these additional investigations models an equivalent monolithic vault geometry in DIANA and conducts finite element analysis to determine its capacity for lateral acceleration. The second comparative study determines how covering the vault in loose regolith may influence its structural performance. The third study investigates how the variation of gravity affects the stability and seismic performance of the vault. <br/><br/>Several key findings are obtained in this project, leading to an understanding of the structural behaviour of Nubian-type vaults and how they may be a possible solution to shielding demands in ET contexts. The final vault model was shown to remain stable under a uniform lateral acceleration equivalent to the PGA for a possible moonquake with a 475 year return period. Dynamic analysis conducted using an artificial ground motion record obtained for the same return period produced less favourable results, resulting in partial collapse of the outermost six courses of the vault. Computational constraints necessitated the implementation of an undamped analysis, however, so these results are considered to be conservative. Further analysis is needed, but these results suggest that with minor adjustments, the vault may be able to safely resist moonquake loading. The comparative monolithic vault analysis demonstrates that an additively manufactured vault may provide slightly better resistance to static lateral acceleration than a component-based vault. When considering the structural redundancy and energy dissipation necessary for safe seismic design, however, the discrete vault is expected to perform better. Results show that covering the vault in loose regolith is expected to reduce its overall stiffness. Conclusions about changes in stability cannot be made with confidence due to modelling issues at the interface between the regolith and the structure. By studying the influence of gravitational variation on the vault, results indicate that it may perform favourably on the Earth or on Mars, though the possibility of material damage must be studied further.","ET Architecture; Space Exploration; DEM simulation; Rhino; Parametric Design; Kangaroo; Numerical Modelling; Regolith; Lunar base; mars colonization; mars habitats; Computational Design; Masonry; Form-Finding; Seismic Analysis; Sintering; Moon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Wastewater Treatment (WWT) technologies stand as an important step to promote water reuse and potentially recover raw materials with added value.<br/>While WWT technologies have been assessed at the environmental and economic levels, their social repercussions are not extensively studied. Hence, the present master thesis project resorts to the Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) framework to execute an evaluation of the social performance of an innovative WWT system for resource recovery in Portugal. S-LCA was conducted at the organizational level, assessing the social performance of organizations in the value chain through the evaluation of the social effects on Workers, Consumers, Local Community, Society, and value chain actors. In addition, a generic assessment was performed to identify hotspot areas of the Portuguese water sector, following the S-LCA framework. <br/>The systems under analysis integrate a Water Mining (WM) project case study, where an innovative urban WWT technology is implemented. In the two systems defined, the wastewater is treated with the Nereda technology and safely discharged into the environment. Nevertheless, while in the reference system the sludge generated from the treatment is stored or forwarded to landfill, in the novel system a new biobased raw material is recovered.<br/>Regarding the generic assessment, a total of eleven impact subcategories were listed as critical areas regarding the operation of companies in the WWT sector. These were further investigated in the site-specific assessment conducted at the plant level. The results of the site-specific assessment indicate that the organisations included in the assessment performed well for both <br/>systems under analysis. However, organizations’ individual performances reflect that improvements are necessary mainly in the subcategories “equal opportunities/discrimination” and “community engagement”. Other subcategories where organizations need to improve are “promoting social responsibility”, “social benefits/social security”, “local employment”, “health and safety of consumers”, “safe and healthy living conditions” and “public commitment to sustainability issues”. For each organization that did not reach a satisfactory performance <br/>level in a certain subcategory, improvement recommendations were proposed. <br/>In general, the novel system performs better in all impact subcategories when compared to the reference system. Nonetheless, this result is intrinsically connected to system characteristics and model decisions such as weighting factors definition and multifunctionality matters, which remain as rather abstract concepts that do not completely reflect reality.<br/>The main challenges faced during the study concern the accessibility and availability of site-specific and generic data. In terms of site-specific assessment, the high similarity of the reference and novel systems in terms of organizations involved hindered the comparison of the two systems. <br/>To conclude, the S-LCA methodology allowed the identification of social hotpots areas as well as the evaluation of the reference and novel systems' social performance, contributing to the elaboration of strategies to improve social sustainability along the value chain of innovative WWT technologies.<br","S-LCA; Wastewater treatment; Social impact; Sustainability analysis; Wastewater treatment technologies; resource recovery; Kaumera Gum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","Water Mining",""

The stabilisation solution is a modular suction cup referred as the ProSTATIC, which can be transperineally inserted via a 5 mm incision to attach to the prostate within the rectoprostatic space. The ProSTATIC has a multi-holed design consisting of three structural layers with their functionality; (1) the top to maintain the pressure inside of the suction cup and provide for structural stability, (2) the footprint to adapt and form a closed seal with the prostate surface, and (3) the self-regulating valves to increase the attachment reliability on irregular surface textures. For the footprint, we experimented with micro-patterns and suction hole sizes to increase the overall grip force. The prototype was completely fabricated out of biocompatible and ultrasound-compatible silicone rubber using mould casting. An experimental evaluation showed that the self-regulating valves work only on healthy prostate phantom. On healthy-tumorous and full tumorous tissue phantoms the suction holes deform, hindering the optimal working of the valves and leading to air leaks. Furthermore, only the prototype with the base footprint with enlarged suction holes (from 2 mm to 3.2 mm diameter) and radial ridges was able to generate a maximum grip force higher than the required 5 N for stabilisation and demonstrated that prostate displacement was reduced by 75% during needle insertion without the use of the ProSTATIC. The prototype proposed in this study forms an initial breakthrough in safe and reliable volumetric stabilisation of the prostate during brachytherapy.","Suction cup; Prostate cancer; Mould casting; Biologically inspired design; Stabilisation; Suction gripper; Medical device","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-09","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","","52.0008,4.3714"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The applicability of the Sellmeijer design rule to Limburg dike sections near Well, Hout-Blerick, Buggenum, and Thorn was investigated in this thesis. This was accomplished by building a finite element numerical model, in COMSOL Multiphysics, to assess the piping in the hydrogeological systems of the research locations. The proposed model is composed by combining several groundwater and piping model principles, schematizing dike cross-sections, and calibrating the model. The schematization choices that define the model geometry of the average pipe cross-section are critical. It was decided to apply a fracture flow pipe cross-section and the piping assessment was performed iteratively for multiple pipe height values, because the true pipe height is unknown. The pipe height is expressed as a function of the number of grains and the representative grain size.<br/> <br/>According to a deterministic assessment, which was performed analytically using multiple versions of the Sellmeijer design rule and numerically using the proposed FEM model, piping does not occur at the research locations Well, Hout-Blerick and Thorn. Piping is theoretically possible at Buggenum, but only with a very small pipe height, making it appear very unlikely. The assessment also revealed that the critical head determined by using revised Sellmeijer design rule (2021) is conservative for the examined dike sections in Limburg. Furthermore, it is discovered that the original Sellmeijer design rule with the new geometry factor (1988/2011) produces critical heads that are similar to the results of the revised Sellmeijer design rule (2021) multiplied by 1.8, which is the current design rule used to assess piping in Limburg.<br/> <br/>The Sellmeijer design rule (1988/2011) was stochastically evaluated to determine how the design rule changed when calibrated to Limburg parameter values. 1000 unique randomly generated dike cross-sections were evaluated on piping using the proposed FEM numerical models. The unique dike cross-sections are made up of a random combination of model parameters that were sampled from a uniform distribution using Latin Hypercube Sampling (Olsson et al., 2003). The randomly generated dike cross-sections that demonstrate piping for a realistic pipe height, were used to re-calibrate the Sellmeijer scale factor. Using a linear regression, it was demonstrated that the scale factor corresponding to the broadened application range (including Limburg parameter values), of the Sellmeijer design rule, is 1.56 times greater than the original scale factor. This means that the original Sellmeijer design rule with the new geometry factor (1988/2011) and the additional factor of 1.56, can be applied to (Limburg) dike sections, for which the model parameters fall within the newly set parameter application ranges (e.g. 100 µm ≤ d70 ≤ 900 µm).<br","Piping; Dikes; Sellmeijer design rule; FEM modelling; Limburg; Groundwater modelling; Stochastic evaluation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

ZF builds ”innovation vehicles” with new components to showcase and test them. These components are connected to the automotive buses. ZF uses a web-based Human Machine Interface (HMI) to control and view the state of these parts. This HMI is needed because some systems are not visible or controllable in regular operation. A gateway is required to connect the HMI and the buses. ZF currently uses a CAN to WebSocket gateway that does not support other buses. There is no readily available hardware with the required buses and interfaces. A WebSocket interface is required, as the HMI is running in a browser, limiting the possible protocols.<br/>Therefore, the challenge for this thesis is how to (re)design this HMI system for future innovation vehicles with buses besides CAN. Each vehicle can have a different number and types of buses, so the system must be able to cope with this. The HMI system is not the only part in the network, so it also must be efficient to not interfere with other systems, like network cameras. This redesign was done by analysing the types of buses, the hardware that could be used, and the software components needed for this flexible system. The software components were mapped onto the available hardware to make the architecture as flexible and efficient as possible. Two mappings are proposed, one using a Software Gateway, a custom application with support for different hardware interface drivers, capable of running on Windows, Linux and in containers. The other mapping uses WebSockify, where WebSocket messages are converted to TCP/UDP messages. <br/>These two mappings were combined into a single architecture to combine the features and possibilities of both systems. Then a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was made to test the envisioned architecture, showing excellent results compared to the current solution while adding more flexibility and other features. Using this new HMI system, the HMI developers can interface with more types of networks, build HMIs that connect to multiple different vehicles and make distributed HMI systems.","Gateway; CAN; CAN networks; flexray; HMI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Eitelberg, G. (mentor); Yu, W. (mentor); Goyal, J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","In recent years, there has been renewed interest in propeller research due to environmental concerns. Propellers are known for their low-speed efficiency and compatibility with electric motors. The utilization of regenerative energy during deceleration has been demonstrated to be beneficial for automobiles and has the potential to be applied to propeller-driven aircraft. This technology allows for the recharging of batteries and could increase the overall efficiency of the propulsion system by utilizing the regenerated energy in other flight maneuvers. The negative thrust mode of propellers has several additional advantages, including weight reduction, improved safety, and increased maneuverability. However, when operated in reverse thrust conditions, the performance of conventional propellers is suboptimal because they are designed for forward thrust. This suboptimal operation can lead to boundary layer separation on the blades, increasing broadband noise and potentially making it more dominant over tonal noise. To assess the relative importance between an isolated propeller's tonal and broadband noise sources under positive and negative thrust conditions, an experimental study was conducted using a scaled propeller setup in a low-turbulence wind tunnel (LTT). Aeroacoustic measurements were taken using a microphone array with 63 microphones placed in the floor and wall of the test section. The advance ratio was varied across different wind speeds at Reynolds numbers ranging from Re<sub>c</sub><sup>0.7R</sup> = 0.8·10<sup>5</sup> to Re<sub>c</sub><sup>0.7R</sup> = 1.9·10<sup>5</sup>. Signal processing methods were used to analyze the data and quantify tonal and broadband noise sources, including fast Fourier transformation (FFT), phase averaging, beamforming, and blade element momentum (BEM) analysis. The results showed that the broadband noise component of the propeller significantly increased in negative thrust mode compared to positive thrust mode due to fully separated boundary layers. The tonal propeller components were often masked by interference from wind tunnel and motor noise, suggesting the need for further research to validate propellers in regenerative mode.","negative thrust; regenerative thrust; propeller noise; propeller experiment; wind tunnel experiment; isolated propeller; tonal noise; broadband noise","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This means that only these measurements are needed and no complex model of the cable is required for control. This reduces model dependency of the controller.<br/>The control system is simulated in different wind conditions in order to analyse its performance in turbulent conditions, where the cable changes shape constantly.

Therefore, successful sustainability implementation depends significantly on the performance of a Project Manager, how well they are equipped with the knowledge about sustainability and supported with tools and internal processes. But first of all, how well they are aware of the importance of sustainability for the organisation and how strong their intention to implement the changes is. <br/>The project manager, as an enabler of sustainability in a construction project, can contribute to the construction industry to meet sustainable development goals.

One such material is graphene, perceived as the holy grail in material physics, due to its unique material properties. Its aspect ratio diminishes the bending rigidity and allows wrinkles, ripples and other morphological imperfections to dominate the mechanical behaviour. Applying tension is a necessity to control these geometrical imperfections and simultaneously opens up pathways to study physical phenomena such as magnetism, superconductivity, optics and much more. Typically, this tension is applied using electrostatic forces, which alters amongst others, the electric properties of the material. Mechanically applied tension offers a solution to this problem but comes at the cost of difficult manufacturability. In this work, a new method to incorporate 2D materials with N/MEMS is presented. The dynamics of mechanically tensioned graphene are probed in linear and nonlinear regimes. The former regime finds the exact opposite of what is observed in electrostatically tensioned membranes. The latter shows exotic nonlinear effects that can be tuned by applying tension. Furthermore, it is identified that the dynamics of the MEMS device are coupled to that of the resonating membrane despite their mass and stiffness being roughly five orders of magnitude apart. The bottleneck of this project is the adhesion force between the two is insufficiently strong to apply significant strain allowing slippage to occur.","Graphene; MEMS; NEMS; strain; Nonlinear dynamics; interferometry; dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Engineering Dynamics | Mechatronic System Design","",""

The second aim is to evaluate whether incorporating the changing load distribution due to trunk movement could improve the friction power estimation compared with neglecting changes in load distribution. Twenty-five subjects performed forward handrim wheelchair propulsions with no trunk, moderate and fast trunk movement on a treadmill in a wheelchair with six conditions regarding wheelchair mass and tire pressure. Two IMUs were placed on the trunk and wheelchair and two load pins in each castor wheel measured the normal force. After feature, model and hyperparameter selection, a model was trained to estimate the normal force on the castor wheels in percentage of the total weight from the IMU data. Accordingly, the predicted instantaneous normal force is used to calculate the friction power including changing mass distribution. When using the linear velocity and acceleration of the wheelchair and the, linear acceleration of forward movement of the trunk, adequate estimations (MAE of 3.69% total weight) of the normal force from an LSTM model can be obtained for unseen subjects. This model is robust for wheelchair settings regarding wheelchair mass and tire pressure and for propulsions with no, moderate and fast trunk movement. The instantaneous friction power prediction incorporating the changing load distribution is proven to more accurate during propulsions with moderate and especially fast trunk movement. Coaches, sport scientists, and athletes may find this model useful for analysing the effect of different propulsion techniques or wheelchair conditions on the friction power. As part of a larger context, this research will contribute to the process of filling the technological gap of in-field monitoring mechanical power.

(mentor); de Visser, C.C. (mentor); Hoogreef, M.F.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","To improve the safety of commercial air transport, pilots are required to train on simulators to recognize the characteristics of an impeding stall and subsequently correctly recover from it. To prevent negative training, it is important that the accuracy of the used simulation models is high. A manner to model the nonlinear, unsteady aerodynamic effects during the stall is by using Kirchhoff's theory of flow separation. However, widespread difficulties exist in correctly estimating the stall-related parameters in these models. It is not always possible to simply gather more flight data to solve this problem. Therefore, the research in this paper aims to increase model accuracy by making optimal use of already existing flight data via introduction of the slice-based modeling method. This is done by analyzing the change in the parameter estimate values when applying the system identification procedure to sliced partitions of simulated flight data. These partitions incrementally increase in size with time from the stall. The simulation data is generated to be representative of the available flight test data. The change in parameter estimates was analyzed for both the pre-stall and post-stall phase. The estimated value for each partition was compared to the actual parameter value setting in the simulation model used to create the data. Manually, an optimal window was found for each parameter for which the estimated value and actual value were equal. For the stall-related parameters this window is often not more than 10 s wider than the stall. For the linear stability and control derivatives it is found that using more data generally results in a better estimate. These window sizes were used in the estimation for each separate parameter on the real flight test data. Even though this method represents a prototype, in more than half of the validation cases a decrease in MSE of 10 % to 35 % could be achieved. This shows that the new slice-based modeling method is able to improve the accuracy of nonlinear stall models without the need to gather more flight data. Additionally, the parameter estimate behaviour analysis technique and slice-based modeling method may have applications that reach beyond the realm of stall modeling.","aerodynamic stall modeling; optimal slicing; Kirchhoff's theory of flow separation; parameter estimate behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-03","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Sinnige, T. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","From the desire to reduce the impact of traveling on the environment and the increase in fuel prices over the past years, the propeller has regained interest as a propulsion mechanism in the aviation industry. Two main reasons can be found in their high propulsive efficiency and ability to combine with electric motors. The scaling of the motors is rather insensitive to the efficiency, allowing the propeller to be placed around the aircraft, resulting in new design freedoms.<br/><br/>The influence of the propeller slipstream can increase the aerodynamic performance of a propeller-wing system. Propellers with inboard-up rotational configuration are found to reduce the induced drag of the wing in propeller-wing systems compared to isolated wings. To increase the aerodynamic performance of propeller-wing systems and certify design choices, a detailed understanding of the relative contribution of the lift-induced drag and swirl recovery to the induced drag of propeller-wing systems is desired. A low-order numerical model has been used for a parametric study on propeller-wing systems. From the results follow that the gradient of the spanwise wing lift distribution is of influence on the amount of net swirl recovery that the wing can obtain. It is shown that when a propeller is placed in front of a wing section where the gradient of the isolated spanwise wing lift distribution is positive from root to tip, more swirl recovery can be obtained by the inboard-down rotating configuration. In this case, the difference in lift between the wing sections behind the two propeller sides is increased. The increase of the difference in the lift also increases the lift-induced drag of the wing. With low disk loadings, the contribution of the swirl recovery is found to be higher than the increase in lift-induced drag. Increasing the disk loading results in more significant differences in lift between the wing sections behind the propeller sides, such that the gradient of the spanwise wing lift distribution increases. From this increase, the contribution of the lift-induced drag can become more significant than the contribution of the swirl recovery of the wing, increasing the induced drag of the system.","propeller-wing interaction; swirl recovery; induced drag; propeller; drag reduction; aerodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

(mentor); Pearson, S.G. (graduation committee); Gijón Mancheño, A. (graduation committee); Smits, B. P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Mangrove forests are important (sub)tropical intertidal ecosystems providing coastal protection and other ecosystem services like carbon storage and biodiversity. In view of the loss of these forests many rehabilitation projects have started, but unfortunately these efforts often fail. A main cause for coastal erosion is a disrupted (fine) sediment balance due to human interventions. This imbalance prevents establishment of propagules (floating mangrove seeds) at intertidal areas and the early growth of planted mangroves. Coastal solutions such as permeable dams have aimed to stop the erosion, but we need additional systematic methodologies to understand the coastal system.<br/><br/>The objective of this thesis is to extend the physical and ecological understanding of coastal mangrove systems, especially of currents, sediment pathways and propagule pathways, to improve rehabilitation strategies using Demak (Central Java, Indonesia) as study area. Demak's coastline suffers from erosion problems, originating from extensive land use by fish ponds and land subsidence. An idealized morphostatic 3D model was set up in Delft3D-4 to simulate the hydrodynamics of the area, influenced by the interaction between flows due to river discharge, tides and wind. The simulations are used as input for the SedTRAILS particle tracking model to compute sediment and propagule pathways.<br/><br/>The model results support that sediment supplied by alongshore currents and riverine sediment could serve as source for the coastline. The river plume is at the same time obstructing as well as trapping sediment and propagules, because stratification prevents mixing of the sea and river water. However, sediments suspended near the bed could be transported underneath the river plume towards the coast by estuarine circulation. Another lesson learnt is that sediment (suspended in the water column) and propagules (floating around the water surface) do not follow the same pathways, as for propagule dispersal the wind direction is of much larger influence than tidal currents. The simulations confirmed that seasonal variability in wind direction could significantly influence the establishment area and availability of propagules, and old fish pond bunds can increase the establishment area for propagules. Sensitivity analysis show that the timing of propagule release within one tidal cycle (flood-ebb) influences the probability to successfully establish on the nearby coast. A propagule survival module is developed (based on inundation-free period and bed shear stress) as stormy seasons may increase the sediment establishment, but the larger bed shear stresses may lower the survival of propagules. <br/><br/>Although this modelling study is focusing on Demak, there are many other similar mangrove coasts around the world where an idealized model would enable to understand where the sediment and propagules are going and the travel time from source to sink. Permeable bamboo dams would be recommended to add to the model in further research, because they could increase the survival of propagules by reducing bed shear stresses and increase the establishment of propagules by trapping them. In conclusion, this research has made a start in counteracting coastal erosion and improving the success of mangrove forest rehabilitation by studying sediment and propagule pathways, and developing a propagule survival module.","mangrove rehabilitation; SedTRAILS; Delft 3D; mud coast; delta; sediment transport pathways; sediment connectivity; propagule; coastal erosion; Lagrangian particle tracking; Building with Nature; Demak; Indonesia; river plume","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","MuMaCo","-6.890955, 110.622149"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Electric vehicles (EVs) take advantage of reducing fossil-based environmental pollution and developing a more sustainable logistics network. Compared with internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), EVs have new technical characteristics like limited battery capacity and long charging time at charging stations. With the diffusion of EVs, vehicle routing problems (VRPs) of EVs draw transportation service providers’ attention, which extends VRPs with intra-route charging considerations. In real-life practice, the punctuality of preplanned<br/>vehicle routing may be affected by uncertain travel time caused by traffic congestion, which derives undesirable penalty costs for violating time windows. Besides, long intra-route charging time at charging stations presents an even greater challenge to trade-off between completing tours with enough electricity and providing delivery service on time. This assignment aims to investigate the impact of travel time uncertainty and electric vehicle characteristics on planning fleet size, vehicle routing, and charging schedules. A pickup and delivery<br/>problem of electric vehicles is studied in this assignment, which considered flexible fleet size, partial charging policy, soft time windows and uncertain travel time. The problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic linear programming model. The fleet size, vehicle routing, and charging decisions are determined in the first stage. After the realization of travel times, the second stage determines specific charging times at charging stations. The objective is to minimize the total operational cost, which consists of travel costs of vehicle usage and charging,<br/>and the expected penalty cost of earliness, delay and overtime. The sample average approximation method is applied to model the stochastic programming to the deterministic equivalent and the Gurobi Optimizer is used to solve this mixed-integer programming. A computational experiment is conducted based on a small data set with one depot, 9 pickup and delivery requests, 5 charging stations at service vertices and 3 available electric trucks. The travel times along the delivery tour are assumed to follow Gamma distribution. To investigate the trade-off between travel costs and penalty costs, 12 instances are conducted in the experiment by tuning parameters of time windows, the uncertainty of travel time, and the importance of punctuality. The experiment results showed an increasing vehicle fleet size could improve the level of service but also derive more vehicle<br/>usage costs. Besides, the intra-route charging operations impact vehicles’ departure times at each charging station, which subsequently impacts service start time at customer vertices. Longer intra-route charging time has the potential to enhance punctuality in instances with tight time windows or congested traffic conditions. Moreover, different operator inclination leads to different fleet size and charging time preference. Instances attaching more importance to punctuality have a larger fleet size and longer intra-route charging time.","Stochastic Programming; Pickup and Delivery problem; Electric Vehicles; Uncertain Travel Time","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","CIE5050-09 Additional Graduation Work, Research Project",""

During their stay, guests, their bodies, and their resort-provided outfits are on full display for everyone within spaces of simultaneous performance and spectating. This resort—an escape from daily life for people of the Red Thread—serves as a testing ground for the recalibration of clothing norms and body standards.<br/><br/>In 2040, increased leisure time encourages people to break away from their daily routines and seek out opportunities to experiment with social behaviours. This is in response to the contemporary condition, in which people follow the through advertisement and standardization established fashion norms and impose these norms on other people, homogenizing social contact in public space.<br/><br/>Examining how fashion norms are dictated through the design, programming, and marketing of space, the resort consists of two opposite worlds. The standardized structure accommodates the stylistically conventional guestrooms and facilities that dictate known dress codes. In contrast, the ballroom -sited in a former wine storage facility- is a constructed disorder that blurs these conventions, allowing designers and consumers to let go of their shame and challenge and redefine fashion norms. Having fulfilled a 3-month residency testing and learning from this context, designers are granted the Shameless certification.<br/><br","Fast fashion; Consumption; Shame; Resort architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://thesisinprogress-theberlage.nl/Fashion-House-Introword","","","","","","The Berlage Post-MSc in Architecture and Urban Design","","39.492062, -0.328185"

We also theorize that the perspec- tive that a book is told from varies depending on target audience age. In this paper we examine traits that could be used for recommendation instead of review data. By examining both the description of books as well as the fulltext we obtain a set of traits relating to perspective and sentiment. Com- paring these traits among books written for differ- ent age groups we observe a subset of these traits that show potential significance in age categoriza- tion. By performing a combination of empirical examination and significance testing we find that both book descriptions and book fulltext contain perspective and sentiment traits that show signifi- cance when comparing books written for different ages. Because traits obtained from book fulltext present a higher quantity of significant instances when compared those obtained from descriptions, we conclude that analysing fulltext for traits shows promise when considering a recommender system that aims to use book content.","sentiment analysis; Children; recommender system; perspective","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

The optimization problem in this case is to select the best-performing algorithm based on the problem features, resulting in a much faster overall runtime. This is defined as the algorithm selection problem. Many different approaches have been used to solve this problem, such as constructing optimal decision trees. However, there is little published data on using optimal decision trees for algorithm selection and one study reveals a problem in finding a feasible solution on a large number of problem instances. We provide new insights into solving algorithm selection using a dynamic programming approach. The motivation to use this novel approach is that recent studies suggest it has lower scalability issues compared to the traditional optimal decision tree algorithms, due to several efficient techniques such as caching and frequency counting method. The investigation has shown that compared to the integer programming method, the dynamic programming approach is significantly faster and is able to solve large problem instances.","Algorithm Selection; Optimal Decision Tree; Dynamic Programming","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

This is done to gain insight in the stability of tugs during escorting, where they operate at high drift angles, heeling angles and forward speed. The Damen RSD 2513 tug was simulated in steady CFD simulation using the software FINE/Marine. The simulations were performed for 0, 15, 30 and 45 degrees drift angle, 0 to 10 degrees heeling angle for every 2 degrees of heel, and at 8 knots forward speed. Curves of the righting moment and heeling moment were created with the results of these simulations. These curves were analysed to see the effect of the drift angle, heeling angle and forward speed. Furthermore, a comparison was made between the restoring moment of the RSD 2513 calculated by SARC PIAS. <br/><br/>The following conclusions were drawn from the righting moment:<br/>1. Without a drift angle, forward speed doesn’t influence the righting moment significantly. This results a minimal difference between the restoring and the righting moment of the tug.<br/>2. Introducing a drift angle will result in a decrease of the righting moment.<br/>3. Even with a drift angle, increasing the heeling angle will result in an increasing righting moment. In fact, the heeling angle and drift angle can be assumed to have independent effects on the righting moment.<br/><br/>Furthermore, two conclusions were drawn from the heeling moment:<br/>1. The heeling moment increases when a drift angle is introduced.<br/>2. Increasing the heeling angle will result in a slight increase in the heeling moment.<br/><br/>There are however concerns about the result’s numerical uncertainties and convergence. Firstly, the error estimation in the verification exercise is unreliable and therefore has a large safety factor leading to high uncertainties. Secondly, issues with convergence were experienced for higher drift angles. This was caused by large separation areas with high turbulent kinetic energy. Because of these two things, the results have limited reliability and the conclusions should be viewed with scepticism.","CFD; Ship stability; Tugs; Escorting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Hydromechanics","",""

This research is an explorative case study to comprehend the pluriformity of ideologies and protest motives that came together at the Woonprotest. By means of a literature review, a photo analysis and qualitative interviews, the differences in housing ideologies and protest motives of the protesters are determined. Based on a literature review, the run-up to the housing crisis is reconstructed. A photo analysis determines the different types of protest attendees. By analysing the interviews, it appears that protesters clearly have three different ideologies when it comes to housing: communism, anarchism, and solving the crisis within the current system. However, the respondents’ opinions on actual policy changes are very similar, even when it comes to radical ideas. Considering the protest motives, the respondents have equivalent purposes to protest. Protesters want to express their discontent with the housing shortage and they want something to change after the protest. The results of this research helps the movement to get a grip on its supporters. Further research is needed to understand the implications of having strong differences in ideologies within the housing movement.","Housing crisis; Social movements; Protest motive; Ideology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

Furthermore, the importance of sufficient urban response systems for storm water is growing due to climate change and urbanization. Sustainable Urban Drainage Solutions (SUDSs) are seen as a key tool to tackle multiple urban challenges. This is as their design is multi-objective, focusing on water quantity, water quality, amenity, and biodiversity. However, currently knowledge is lacking amongst decision makers on how SUDS affect the urban environment. Therefore, this research aims to develop an assessment framework for SUDS-based storm water management in the urban landscape to help Dutch municipalities improve their decision making to improve the live-ability of the urban environment.<br/><br/>To evaluate the performance of SUDS, assessment frameworks include Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). KPIs are measurable indicators demonstrating how effective SUDS are in achieving their objectives. This research highlights that there is no universal or even country based standard assessment framework for SUDS. Furthermore, there are few examples of the translation of the scientific assessment methods of SUDS to engineering practice available. The assessment of the full effect of SUDS therefore remains unclear to practitioners.<br/><br/>This research proposes a new framework (”extended framework”) to assess the performance of SUDS, building on the existing framework (”conventional framework”) which assesses cost and water quantity currently used in engineering practice. The extended framework adds KPIs assessing the remaining three objectives of SUDS design. Firstly, water quality is assessed with the KPIs Site Pollution Index (SPI) and Pollutant Removal Capacity (PRC). Amenity with the KPIs Thermal Comfort Score (TCS) and impervious area. Thirdly, biodiversity is assessed with the KPI Biotope Area Factor (BAF). Furthermore, it improves the assessment of water quantity by replacing the currently used KPI with Expected Annual Damages (EAD). With the choice of KPIs in the extended framework, it is ensured that their assessment methodologies are suitable to engineering practice. Furthermore, by including KPIs that assess the multi-objectiveness of SUDS, the co-benefits are included in the extended framework.<br/><br/>With the application of both frameworks on the municipality of Alkmaar, this research substantiates the positive influence of SUDS on urban areas. The case study shows improving performance for water quantity, water quality, amenity and biodiversity if the number of SUDS increases.<br/><br/>To assess the effect of the extended framework on the decision making process, the MCDA type Compromise Programming (CP) is applied to the results of both frameworks. With the identification of the best choice of design based on the performance results of either the conventional or extended framework, the outcome of the CP method showed that using the extended framework as opposed to the conventional framework sometimes led to different design choices.<br/><br/>It is demonstrated that the extended framework indeed improves the decision making process to improve the live-ability of the urban environment. Even though the extended framework is more time consuming and may result in more costly designs, using this framework to base decision making on is likely to result in better quality of life for humans with a reduced negative impact on the associated natural environment. This framework better equips decision-makers to face<br/>emerging urban challenges. However, both frameworks are of use in engineering practice. The ultimate choice of using either one of the frameworks is dependent on the goal of the project, the client, and the amount of time and money available.","SUDS; KPIs; Storm water management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor); Isler, Devris (mentor); Kellnhofer, P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The media watermarking technique domain has had the last 30 years to develop itself. The non-media side, however, is a way newer sub-domain. [1] The data-gathering process for machine learning algorithms is a tedious and time consuming task. This becomes worse as the scale of these algorithms increases. Thus, protecting the datasets against illegal use or sale and proving they are intellectual property is useful. In this paper, we answer the question: How can image watermarking techniques be applied to classification algorithm datasets, without degrading the dataset's quality? Algorithms that use the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the data are often the basis of other matrix decomposition based Image watermarking techniques. Thus if an SVD based algorithm can be applied to a machine learning dataset then the other matrix decomposition based algorithms can also be applied. This implies that a large part of the much older media targeted watermarking techniques can be applied to the non-media datasets. In this paper we apply the watermarking technique described in [2] to a machine learning dataset. This watermark provides decent imperceptibility and robustness against update, zero-out and insertion attacks but it's held back by its lackluster robustness against deletion attacks. That said, we proved that when an image watermark is found that is impervious against deletion attacks, it can be applied to the machine learning datasets.","Singular Value Decomposition; watermarking; Machine Learning","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

For this reason, it is important to detect and forecast these phenomena to be able to take action beforehand. Remote sensing is measuring and monitoring the characteristics of an area at a distance and it is typically done by satellites. Remote sensed data containing various environmental measurements can be used as the input for a machine learning system to estimate chlorophyll-a concentrations which is the main indicator used for detecting algal blooms. The main question this research aims to answer is: Which input modality is the most predictive for estimating chlorophyll-a concentrations for water bodies in Uruguay? This research presents the step-by-step construction of a system to pre-process the environmental data collected through remote sensing and use this data to train and test a machine learning system to assess and compare 11 different environmental factors or so-called data modalities individually against each other to find out the most predictive one. Carrying out the machine learning experiments brings the results into the open that radiation mean and turbidity of water are the two most predictive data modalities for algal bloom forecasting with accuracy scores of approximately 34%, while radiation mean is performing slightly better.","Algal bloom; Remote sensing; Data modalities; Machine learning","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Drift detectors are important as they allow us to detect when a classification model becomes inaccurate. Some possible uses of drift detectors can even go as far as detecting adversarial attacks on machine learning algorithms. The detectors discussed in this paper are Margin Density drift detectors. Their evaluation is made within an unsupervised context, where we assume no testing labels are available. In real world applications of machine learning models, this might often be the case, as finding labels is costly. Experiments in this paper have found that margin density detectors can be useful tools in detecting the first drift for synthetic data, even though parameter tuning must be done to achieve high accuracy for some datasets. In an unsupervised environment with more than one drift, the drift detectors are unreliable as was seen in experiments involving real world data.

Here, the classifier has to minimize the cost of misclassifying the patient and minimize the costs of the tests. Unfortunately, obtaining features may be costly, e.g., taking blood tests or doing an x-ray scan. Furthermore, it is possible that acquiring those test results may take a few days. To train such a classifier, several machine learning algorithms exist. Decision trees appear as favourites since, unlike other classifiers, decision trees do not need all feature values to classify an instance. Current approaches, however, only use heuristics to find a local optimum. Although heuristics are relatively fast, they are not optimal and therefore may not capture well the underlying characteristics of the given dataset. We propose an optimal approach to train cost-sensitive decision trees while also considering these delayed tests. Here we show, smaller trees with higher accuracy and a lower cost can be constructed, compared to a heuristic approach.

The micro level comprised a case study at KLM using theory of Melissa Schilling, Strategic management of technological innovation. The method was qualitative in which several interviews were performed with industry experts and innovation experts at KLM. <br/><br/>This study revealed that the TIS for sustainable aviation technologies is currently active. However, the TIS is not performing optimally as main barriers emerge for the function legitimisation and lobby, obstructing the transition towards a sustainable aviation future. KLM could take a leading role in overcoming these barriers by using its reputation and profound industry knowledge. For this,<br/>it is important that KLM prioritises innovation and use its will to pioneer in the transition. A long road lies ahead for the industry to become green due to the complexity of the actor network and the technical challenges. Nevertheless, given the technological advancements, it is expected that the first battery-electric flights will emerge in this decade, marking the start of a sustainable aviation industry.<br/><br/>Recommendations were made for policymakers, KLM, and science. The main recommendation for policymakers is to install legislative incentives for entrepreneurial activities and stimulate the market in the future. Furthermore, aerospace should be made available to test battery-electric and hydrogen<br/>technologies. Recommendations for KLM are to prioritise innovation by reorganising innovation teams in the organisation. Autonomous teams should be installed that are separated from the core business to explore new business models and the impact of new technologies on the existing model. Future research should investigate the role of sustainability on the TIS. Also, during the interviews it came forward that the relation between entrepreneurial activities and knowledge creation is bilateral rather than unilateral as presented in the TIS model.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Quantum networks offer more capabilities than classical networks. For example, quantum networks can solve certain problems faster than classical networks and they can even solve problems which cannot be solved with classical networks. One well-known quantum network application is blind quantum computing (BQC). In a BQC application a client node sends a computation to a server node in the network. The server node performs this computation without knowing the details about the actual input or computation being performed and returns the result of the computation to the client node. Quantum applications are often repeated many times, due to randomness that is involved in the result of executing a quantum application. When a server node performs BQC repeatedly with multiple client nodes, there follows an interesting problem how all corresponding instructions can be scheduled for the server optimally, given that certain types of instructions referred to as entanglement instructions can only be scheduled at given moments by a so called network schedule. One classical metric used to assess the quality of a schedule is makespan, which is the time that it takes to complete all instructions. A quantum oriented metric involved is success probability, which indicates what fraction of executions yield a desired result when repeatedly executing an application. In this thesis, an experimental demonstration is given of the use of constraint programming (CP) for the scheduling of instructions of quantum network applications. This demonstration focuses on scheduling instructions that the server node should execute when performing BQC repeatedly with a small number of client nodes at the same time. Different CP models are presented that assign start times to tasks that the server node should execute. By comparing the CP models to a baseline scheduler that schedules tasks as soon as possible, it was found that CP can be used to reduce the makespan when BQC is performed by the server node with multiple clients at the same time, while preserving a similar success probability. A main drawback that followed from the CP approach is scalability. Future work is to be done on studying how CP can be used for larger quantum networks.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Software Technology","",""

Open Wear is a sustainable outerwear brand that uses sustainable materials and ethical production to produce clothing from 100% recycled plastic. The brand promotes sustainability in the winter sports industry but acknowledges the potential impact of climate change on the industry and its existence. The report discusses the potential changes in the winter sports industry due to ecological changes, economic interests, human experiences, and cultural values. By creating a worldview of winter sports in 2040 and designing a concept product there has been explored how the brand can innovate in this changing world. The ‘Vision in Product’ method has been used, which focuses on the ‘raison d’etre’ and uses a worldview created from various context factors such as trends, developments, and principles to design a future vision. The company’s strengths, weaknesses and potential opportunities have been analyzed, stating that especially the Open Wear community can be a great asset in the future. Literature research indicates that winter sports can still be practiced for decades to come, but low ski areas or ski areas with unfavorable locations in terms of snowfall will have to deal with less snow in the coming years. The amount of snow-reliable days seem to be decreasing exponentially. To understand the impact of these and other factors on the worldview of 2040, driving forces have been created by forming clusters of these factors. A prediction has been made about what the world will look like in 20 years. Open Wear wants to encourage environmentally conscious people to moderate their ski behavior and to keep enjoying their outdoor escapes. They can do this by making multi-sport vacations more accessible by designing clothing that is created around conditions instead of sports. A digital platform for collaboratively creating future-proof products has been designed to switch from winter clothing to multi-sport clothing. In this way, Open Wear can motivate people to continue to enjoy their outdoor escapes sustainably, without being dependent on a changing climate.","Vision in Product Design; Future Vision; Winter Sports; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

A novel, lightweight, and simplistic design is proposed that reduces the number of actuators and limits ineffective water discharge. External camera feedback was used for position control as a first step towards autonomous flight. An initial prototype of an unmanned hydro-propelled aerial vehicle (UHAV) connected to a water hose was designed and fabricated. Flight tests were conducted to show that attitude control with uniaxial thrust-vectoring of two nozzles was impossible due to undamped vibrations and coupling effects. By redesigning the PID controller, pitch rate damping was accomplished. Furthermore, a design trade-off led to the introduction of a canting keel to reduce bank-yaw coupling effects due to asymmetric nozzle deflections. Flight tests proved that the iterated design with a hose length of 3m was capable of disturbance rejection and setpoint tracking. An external camera was used to show that the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm and the implementation of the YOLOv5 segmentation model can be used for positional water jet placement. By increasing the pitch rate damping, improving the water jet detection algorithm and implementing a cost function for water discharge at the area of interest, autonomous missions can be flown in the future.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-02","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

While substantial academic work has addressed the ESG topic and how firms’ ESG characteristics impact their financial performance and valuations, relatively little ink has been spilled on the issue in the entrepreneurial finance literature. An important impediment for researchers and for investors in the entrepreneurial finance markets wanting to adopt the practice of responsible investing has been the lack of a unified framework for the assessment and quantification of startups’ ESG characteristics. This thesis proposes a startup ESG framework that is based on the status quo of existing ESG frameworks and related literature. The study then analyses a proprietary dataset of 47 technological startups that seek funding from the Dutch venture capital (VC) firm FORWARD.one, to empirically investigate whether the positive relationship between firms’ ESG characteristics and financial valuation, found in the public market setting and the crowdfunding and token offering setting, also holds in the VC context. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis and Independent Sample t-Tests are used to examine the impact of the startups’ ESG risk scores on their financial valuations. The results indicate that the amount of ESG risk in a startup is negatively correlated to its financial valuation, meaning that venture capitalists do value startups’ ESG characteristics. As a result also those entrepreneurs that seek funding from venture capitalists have an economic incentive to work on their sustainability performance. However, this study finds that sustainability performance is only valued to the extent that it concerns ESG risk management, i.e. minimizing ESG-related negative externalities. The creation of ESG-related positive externalities is not valued by purely financially driven venture capitalists. The study does not attempt to establish a causal mechanism. The findings contributes to the still emergent literature around the role of ESG in entrepreneurial finance markets and several promising avenues for further research are suggested.","Startup; ESG framework; Financial valuation; Entrepreneurial finance; Venture Capital","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

There is a risk of perforating the femur while drilling in the cement plug. This risk increases when the orientation of the prosthesis tip is excentric. The aim of this study was to design a reusable drill guide that facilitates centric drilling in the cement plug and to evaluate this design. The extremity of the drill guide contains two centralizers. Activation of the centralizers results in the centralization of the drill guide in the femur. A set of requirements was defined for the drill guide. To check if the drill guide meets these requirements, different tests were performed. The centralizers were tested in a fatigue test and a radial force test. The usability and functionality of the drill guide were tested in a simulation of the cement plug removal procedure performed by an orthopaedic surgeon. In this simulation was a cement plug in a bone sample drilled in three different conditions. The first condition was without the drill guide. The second condition was with the drill guide by which the handle was kept pressed during the drilling. The third condition was with the drill guide but the handle was released after activation. Furthermore, the disassembly and assembly of the drill guide were tested by five inexperienced test subjects, and the cleaning and sterilization of the drill guide were discussed with experts. This study's results show that the drill guide prototype meets the requirements. The centralizers could be activated ten times without breaking and will not apply a force on the bone that exceeds the yield stress of cortical bone. The absolute deviation of the position of the drilled hole from the centre of the cement plug was significantly lower in the tests with the drill guide compared to the tests without the drill guide. The same test showed that the generated temperature by the drill guide will not cause bone necrosis. Furthermore, the (dis)assembly of the drill guide was performed in less than 110 s. However, the drill guide would benefit from some design adjustments and further testing, such as testing the durability after multiple sterilization cycles. When this is included in the design, the drill guide could be a valuable addition to the standard tools in THA revision.","Total hip arthroplasty revision; Cement plug removal; Drill guide; Centralizers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

Despite the dependency of the Island's prosperity on the condition of the ecosystem, research suggests that wastewater management is likely to be a significant contributor to this effect. Incorporating both open literature results and information obtained from an extensive constructed research network, this study demonstrates essential aspects of the urban wastewater management system of Willemstad regarding the quantity and quality of the urban wastewater fluxes and their potential environmental implications. The system, which merely connects 33\% of Curaçao's population, is concluded to be outdated and insufficient with respect to capacity as well as treatment efficiency. Although it is solely designed for pure domestic wastewater, this study concluded and demonstrated the significant impact of illegal discharge onto this system by industrial sectors leading to both high contamination loading and increased wastewater volumes. The combination of these features is the major cause of wastewater discharge pathways into marine environments. Arising from the constructed urban wastewater flux model, which visualizes the wastewater management system, 14 discharge locations correlated to significant environmental contamination pathways are identified with Piscadera Bay, Rif Mangrove area, Playa Kanoa and Shut concluded as the utmost importance. Furthermore, the model revealed that the urban wastewater is predominantly directed towards the treatment plant Klein Hofje via either the northern trajectory (Bonam - Suffisant F - Garipitoweg - Argentianweg - Klein Hofje) or the southern one (SVB - Klein Hofje). Also, the quantity and quality of the fluxes are estimated based on the connected area and the potential industrial activities within it. However, validation of these estimations is recommended since no water quantity and quality analysis was performed or available for conducting the modelled estimations. Furthermore, since the system is partly a combined sewage system, hence harvesting stormwater fluxes as well, its effect is recommended to incorporate in the model and estimations for accuracy purposes. Lastly, the government reports that at least 90\% of all industrial wastewater is discharged either directly into the ocean or onto the sewer system. Since the actual ratio as well as the water quality remains unknown this is recommended for future research. Overall, this study enables tailored future research programs to overcome the discussed limitations and with that significantly contribute to eliminating the current existing white spot concerning the effect of urban wastewater fluxes on the marina ecosystem of Curaçao.","urban wastewater management; environmental implications; Curaçao coral reefs","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","Additional Master Thesis","12.16960, -68.99000"

When one of the people involved reaches out to Blijf Groep, the social workers mainly focus on them because they are seen as the one who has experienced the most severe violence. The needs of the person who committed domestic violence are not considered as much. The social workers have little understanding of them, and therefore, they are not included in the counseling process. <br/><br/>The central aim of this research has been to explore an understanding of the person who commits domestic violence since, for a lasting solution to domestic violence, they have to be included in the counseling process. <br/><br/>This research was divided into a theoretical study, qualitative context research, and an exploratory study with methods including interviews, quick prototyping, and user tests. In addition, the course of a violent relationship and the counseling process at Blijf Groep were mapped. This research led to the insight that the initial phone call between the residential social worker and the person who committed domestic violence can be an entrance. The phone call takes place at a vulnerable time in which both involved are most open to receiving help and can be the starting point for the rest of the counseling process. <br/><br/>Based on the insights of this research, a workshop for social workers was designed which consists of a workbook and twelve theme cards. The purpose of the workbook is to allow social workers to reflect on themselves and their work so they become aware of the origins of incomprehension for the person who committed domestic violence and how these affect their involvement in counseling. For support during the counseling process, the theme cards contribute to solution-focused work by providing knowledge about the background of the person who committed domestic violence, with accompanying questions that can create an entry point for conversations. Besides, it helps social workers to chart the origins and persistence of violence. <br/><br/>Finally, the workshop has been evaluated with social workers. The design succeeded in creating an understanding during the first phone call. Therefore, it is proposed that the workshop should be included in mandatory training at Blijf Groep so the social workers learn how to work systemically from the start.","Domestic violence; Partner violence; Taboo; Social work; Perpetrator; Victim; Understanding; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

However the rate of change in the future is hard to predict and therefore very uncertain.<br/><br/>One of the projects which seeks to be a (part of the) solution in climate change and flood prevention for the Netherlands is the Delta21 project.

When the sea level increases even more, the designs should be altered to the new circumstances. Various adaptation options are put together in the form of adaptive pathways which provide adaptation methods for up to five meters of sea level rise. The pathway schemes are evaluated on 4 evaluation criteria to select the preferred adaptation method for each of the three base design variants.<br/><br/>Using an analysis over the total lifetime of the sea defence measured in meters of sea level rise, the preferred conceptual design for the Delta21 sea defence is selected.<br/><br/>It turns out that the adaptive pathway approach can be used to integrate the uncertainty of climate change into the selection of a conceptual design variant for a sea defence.

These openings will have a significant influence on the transfer of forces in the panels, as well as the stiffness of the façade. The connections required to transfer the forces between the panels are designed. Deformations of the connections introduce addition deformation of the façade itself. The components that influence the force transfer and deformation of the façade have been identified in this research. Their contributions have been investigated. The theoretical calculations have been compared to computer results. The resulting conclusions aid designers in an early design phase regarding the feasibility of a CLT façade structure. <br/><br/>The main focus of the research has been on the mechanical fastener connections that are required for the CLT façades. The research question is stated as:<br/><br/>“What is the influence of mechanical fastener connections on the strength and stiffness of CLT façades that function as the main stability system?”<br/><br/>The research started with the goal to find the limitations of CLT façades for multi-story timber buildings. In order to find these limitations, a complete understanding of the structural behavior of the façade was required.

Dedicated models were constructed, using data obtained from wind tunnel and flight experiments, that take the power spectra of the microphones’ signals as an input and provide the airspeed as an output. The model structure is a feed-forward neural network with a single hidden layer, trained using a second-order gradient descent algorithm, following a supervised learning approach. The models were validated using only flight data, with the best one achieving a mean approximation error of 0.043 m/s and having a standard deviation of 1.039 m/s.

The thesis studies existing path planning algorithms and determines the essential functionalities of the algorithm and the unique requirements of Lunar Zebro.

This rotational repulsive force ensures obstacle avoidance and prevention of the local minimum trap, which often occurs in Artificial Potential Field path planning. Improvements are suggested to increase reachability and decrease path length and planning time of the rotational vector field algorithm. In the Python developed simulation, the improved algorithm accomplishes a 62% reduction in planning time compared with the original Artificial Potential Field algorithm and achieves similar path length results.

For this problem, Jones, Weller and van Iersel (2022) have created an algorithm that uses dynamic programming on tree-decompositions to achieve a running time that is exponential in the tree-width parameter instead of in the number of reticulations. However, due to the implicit formulations of two crucial steps in this algorithm, this running time cannot be achieved in practice without finding ways to generate the required structures explicitly. This paper provides two new sub-algorithms that can do that. To further improve the performance of the algorithm, I introduce a number of criteria and other methods that can be used to reduce the number of structures generated. Additionally, I describe a way to manipulate the nice tree-decompositions to create a more favorable order of bags for the dynamic programming. These sub-algorithms and improvements are used by two new algorithms TWITCH and PITCH, whose implementations are compared to a brute force algorithm and a new branching cherry-picking algorithm named BOTCH. The latter has an FPT running time that is exponential in the number of vertices that have only reticulations as children. The comparisons show that the implementations of the dynamic programming algorithms TWITCH and PITCH are slower in practice than the brute force algorithm, despite their numerous improvements. Of the four new implementations, BOTCH has the best test results and it is shown to be fast in practice. <br/><br","Phylogenetic network; tree containment; tree-width; fixed-parameter tractability; Phylogenetic tree; display graph; embedding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The study assesses the influence of non-structural elements on the bearing capacity of the slab, maps possible errors in the integration process, and proposes an integrated design strategy to resolve safety errors. <br/><br/>The structural analysis focuses on four parameters of the openings (shape, size, longitudinal placement, height placement) and their effects on three failure modes (bending moment failure, shear failure, and interface failure).

Previous research has already shown that wait time experience is an important impact factor on the overall patient experience.<br/><br/>The project started with a literature study. The literature study looked at the topics of patient satisfaction, communication of patient information and the waiting experience. For each of these topics, patient expectations and uncertainty appeared to be among the most important drivers. The result of the literature study was a set of possible interventions, each based on adjusting and managing patient expectations and reducing uncertainty for the patient.<br/><br/>Next in the project was mapping the context where these possible interventions happen. This user and context research concerns the environment and work flow of the clinic and patient needs and characteristics. For each sub-topic, the research method was chosen that provided the most valuable and reliable information with the least possible burden on the patients of the outpatient clinic. Methods used include walk-alongs, expert interviews, system analysis, user experience account analysis and empathy mapping.<br/><br/>Three main causes of dissatisfaction of patients were identified in the research. Firstly, the unrealistic expectations that patients have about the length of a visit. Secondly expectations about the provision of waiting time information, partly caused by the hospital itself, that are not being met. Lastly the lack of a clear overview of the different steps a patient goes through during a visit for both patient and employee. The complexity of the patient cases at the ophthalmic outpatient clinic in combination with the work flow at the outpatient clinic makes it difficult to predict the steps and waiting times during a patient visit based on the information present in the system. However, three data sources were found in the study that can serve as a reliable source of information to provide personal appointment information to patients. Another important finding of the user and context study is the way in which patients’ visual impairments affects their waiting experience.<br/><br/>The design phase consisted of designing ways to apply the proposed interventions within the described context while considering the limitations of the patient group. This resulted in the following three recommendations: adding information to the appointment letter, optimizing the provided digital and printed information for OOC patients, and providing OOC patients with personal, dynamic appointment information during their wait using a physical information booth in the waiting area of the clinic. These recommendations work in unison with each other to ensure the desired effects for all patients during the full patient journey. A prototype of the designed physical information booth was developed and used in user testing to evaluate certain aspects of the design concept.<br","Expectations; waiting time; visually impaired people","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

While timber itself is a carbon-neutral material and can sometimes even be carbon-negative, reusing wooden structural members made that have been in service for several years can widen the approach to structural design using wood. In the extensive network of rivers and canal systems that the Netherlands has, the banks are often covered with sheet-pile walls and a majority of these are made of timber. Tropical hardwood, especially Azobé (Lophira alata), due to its high biological resistance to decay, is used to make these sheet-piles. However, when exposed to the groundwater table for a long period of time, the wood undergoes decay due to bacteria destroying the cellulose slowly, while the lignin remains constant, and over decades the large cellulose molecules are replaced by water making the walls weaker.<br/><br/>In this study, the characteristic mechanical properties of Azobé sheet-piles that have been in service for 57 years have been found, so that they can be assigned with an appropriate strength class and reused. Destructive, quasi-destructive and non-destructive tests have been performed on the sheet-pile boards to understand the correlation between them and to also ascertain to what level tests on timber specimens that do not affect their usability can be reliable. Since the knowledge of how visual grading can be performed on used, decayed structural timber, especially hardwood specimens is limited, a methodology has been developed in line with NEN-EN 14081-1:2019 along with the definition of a visual decay score. The results from the RPD tests are quantified in terms of the resistographic measure value to identify whether, in tropical hardwood, is there any effect in the drilling direction and whether this value can qualitatively or quantitatively describe the actual mechanical strength of the sheet-pile boards. The stress-wave tests and the four-point bending test are used to calculate the strength and stiffness of the boards, which determine the characteristic values, that are also based on their wet density (at which the tests are conducted). The results obtained are also analyzed for occurring patterns in terms of the location of the board in the sheet-pile wall (top or bottom), testing configuration (E-side or W-side-up) and variation in thickness within the boards due to decay.<br/><br/>The bending test performed on the boards is modelled numerically in multiple iterations with curved-shell, layered-shell and 3D brick elements also varying the respective material models to find which one of them is best suitable to model bending of timber. The load-sharing mechanism observed when grouping multiple timber specimens has been simulated numerically to predict the characteristic load-sharing factor of the sheet-pile wall system.","DIANA; timber; Sheet pile wall; azobe; load sharing factor; rpd; dynamic modulus; Sheet piles; Characterisation; Hardwood; Four point bending test; Stress wave propagation; resistance; bending moment capacity; visual decay analysis; decay; timber piles; fea timber; hill criterion; Hole Drilling; compression test; local MOE; global moe; Tropical hardwood; tropical hardwoods; Tongue and groove","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-03","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

For this research a literature and case study as well as an expert meeting were used. With the case study methodology four urban area developments in the Netherlands were studied and included a desk research regarding the vision documents published and interviews with developers regarding their views of these documents and their reasons to invest. The results from the case studies were analysed and validated through an expert meeting.<br/><br/>Main results:<br/>This research concluded that spatial policy documents play a crucial role in the urban development process since they create a first framework for the development. However, it was also noted that these documents can be unrealistic and fail to effectively persuade developers due to not considering the financial aspect of the development. It was furthermore concluded that these documents are important for the decision-making process of developers, as it is political statement from the municipality that it endorses housing development in a certain area. Developers furthermore look for clues in vision documents on what could be built since this greatly determines their development business case. However, such clues are of lacking in these documents and are therefore described by developers as vague. Furthermore, developers desire a balance of flexibility and certainty in spatial vision documents and the area development process. The internal decision-making process of developers regarding participation in an area development consists of creating a business case and conducting a risk analysis of the development, which are combined into an investment proposal. The decision whether to invest is not solely based on the business case being profitable and line with the internal goals of the developer, but also on having the 'belief' the development can be realised, which is based on the risk analysis as well as the developer's (gut) feeling about the development. <br/><br/>Main conclusion and recommendations:<br/>Based on this research, it can be concluded that ultimately many factors influence the decision-making process of developers. Spatial vision documents contribute to this decision, but there is no direct cause-effect since other factors are also in play. Crucial are the shaping factors indicating what could be built that can be derived from the spatial vision document. Moreover, capacity building factors related to the reputation of and relationship with the municipality play a crucial role. These factors influence the 'belief' of a developer for successful area development. Additionally, factors related to developers' internal goals and modus operandi have a crucial impact on their decision of where to invest. It can be concluded that it is crucial that parties collaborate early in the process, that their relationship is good and, importantly, that there is mutual trust. <br/><br/>Summarising, spatial vision documents, shaping instruments and capacity building tools are an important influence on the decision-making process of developers, but internal and external factors play an at least equally important role.<br","Urban Area Development; Real estate developers; planning instruments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Water board ‘The Dommel’, managing the drainage basin of the Dommel brook, aims for a future proof water system by 2050. At the same time, the urbanization agenda for North-Brabant anticipates a growing need for houses in the near and far future. A switch to local, biobased construction could ecologically justify the current and future housing assignment, and potentially boost the local landscape with a more local oriented architecture as by-catch.<br/>This thesis combines both challenges by answering the question: ‘What spatial framework for the drainage basin of the Dommel supports the move towards a future proof water system that simultaneously provides local, natural construction materials for the future building program?’ <br/>Within the graduation lab of Urban Ecology and Ecocities, the landscape is approached as a system of layers that interact. Therefore, a regional framework is made using the water system as base, informed by the ‘layer approach’ and ‘a hydrological approach to landscape planning’. The framework is informed by a landscape biography of historical local building materials. By design-through-scales, the general framework is translated to a local design of a high pressure zone in between Eindhoven and Helmond, and site specific design experiments evaluate the spatial and perceptual value of the framework. <br/>The foundation of the resulting spatial framework is the natural system layer and its preferred hydrological conditions. Strategies to improve the water system are based on retaining water, buffering of water, and delaying drainage. Potential pairing opportunities simultaneously providing local building materials are: a productive tree network that acts as a sponge network by increasing the soil organic matter, surface water basins that provide loam by excavation of land, expanded heathland on the dry surface sand ridges to provide wool of sheep maintaining the heathland and sods for roofing, winter grains that improve the water retaining capacity of soil by increase of the organic matter as well as providing straw, raised forest that buffers water and provides timber, countryside wadi’s that provide reed/willow/cattail fibers, hydrated brook valleys that provide reed for roofing and additional fibers, and use of wastewater for cultivating fibers. These findings show that a combination of both strategies can provide a win-win situation. The design experiments result in a landscape that is diverse, more healthy and is aligned with the regional program. A landscape in which new houses do not invade, but integrate into the landscape and therefore strengthen the local identity of the place.","productive landscape; drought; future proof water system; place-based approach; biobased building materials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","",""

Vacuum extraction is still little-used in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) compared to high-income countries, due to the lack of sufficient devices on the market that fit the local context. For this purpose, a novel reusable and affordable vacuum extractor was designed. This study compares this device, the VelaTM, with a commonly used vacuum extractor, the Kiwi Omnicup®, in terms of performance and user experience in a non-inferiority mannequin study. Methods: Obstetricians and residents from LUMC and CWZ hospitals performed a vacuum extraction on a birthing mannequin using both devices. During simulated “traction windows” of 25 seconds, the participant was allowed to pull. The primary endpoint was the traction window in which successful vacuum extraction occurred. Secondary endpoints were the total number of pop-offs of the cup, the exact success time within the successful traction window, the pumping time before the successful traction window, the satisfaction rate and the comparison between the two devices on placement, pumping and pulling. Finally, the participants were asked for their opinions about the Vela in an open-ended question. Results: A total of 47 participants were included in this study, of which three never achieved success with the Vela. For the primary endpoint, the Vela was non-inferior to the Kiwi in both LUMC and CWZ. Furthermore, no significant differences were found between the Vela and the Kiwi regarding any of the secondary endpoints, with the exception of the satisfaction rate in the LUMC. This was significantly lower for the Vela. Themes raised by participants concerned the stiffness of the Vela tube, the comfort of the Vela during usage and the need for familiarization with a new device. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that the Vela is non-inferior to the Kiwi Omnicup when used by clinicians who had success with both devices, however there is room for improvement regarding satisfaction of the Vela. More familiarization is needed and the tube of the Vela should be reduced in stiffness. With this initial validation, the Vela can be seen as a promising alternative for LMIC, and can be further optimized into a high-quality fully reusable vacuum extractor.","vacuum extractor; medical device validation; mannequin study; kiwi omnicup","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-31","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The ever-remaining drive to improve the spatial resolution in CT for enhanced image quality introduces the need for small focal spot sizes, as the focal spot size is directly related to the geometric unsharpness in the image. Therefore, a collimation method was proposed to virtually reduce the focal spot of existing systems as an alternative to fully replace the current X-ray tube.<br/><br/>A collimator was designed, consisting of numerous tiny hexagonal-shaped holes focused at the center of the focal spot. Theoretical derivations were formulated for its dimensions, and the collimator's efficacy was validated using Monte Carlo simulations. It was concluded that it is theoretically achievable to use collimation to virtually reduce the focal spot size to an arbitrarily chosen smaller virtual focal spot for existing CT systems, significantly reducing the penumbra effect, without requiring any integral changes to the X-ray tube. However, the collimator's practical suitability and manufacturing feasibility were problematic due to its significantly low collimator sensitivity and exceptionally tiny dimensions.<br/><br/>Future work could build on this thesis by obtaining reconstructions from multiple projections of the virtual focal spot to quantitatively assess their theoretically improved spatial resolution. The quantitative confirmation could further establish the theoretical effectiveness of focal spot collimation for future work to enhance reconstructions to uncover valuable information previously hidden.<br","Computed Tomography; focal spot; size reduction; spatial resolution; penumbra effect; collimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The triggering condition is designed to guarantee the stability and desired performance of the control system. This prevents the excessive use of scarce communication and energy resources. To fully take advantage of these savings when dealing with a (physically) distributed system, it is vital to decentralise the triggering condition. A decentralised triggering condition can be checked locally at the nodes of the system using the locally available states, eliminating the need to send updated sensor measurements to a central location constantly. However, the decentralisation of the triggering condition needs to be optimised for the state of the system to fully take advantage of the possible resource savings. This thesis provides a framework to optimally decentralise quadratic triggering conditions for Periodic Event-Triggered Control (PETC) systems in the absence and presence of bounded disturbances. In addition, a method of constructing a region-based map of such optimisations is provided, making it feasible to implement the optimisation approach on larger systems without needing more powerful hardware.","Periodic Event-Triggered Control; Decentralised control; Hybrid systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","3-D ultrasound imaging using a 2-D array provides much more information about our body than conventional 2-D imaging. However, due to the large number of elements in a 2-D array, channel count reduction is required and the power and area budget for each element is limited. It is quite challenging to design an ultrasound interface circuit with limited power and area budget. In the interface circuit, the ADC usually consumes considerable amount of power and area, which limits the performance of the whole system. <br/><br/>This thesis explores a new ADC architecture: a beamforming noise-shaping SAR ADC (BENSSAR), in an attempt to reduce power and area of the ultrasound receiver and thus improve the performance of 3-D ultrasound imaging. BENSSAR mainly consists of three parts: a subarray beamformer, a charge-sharing SAR ADC and a loop filter. They all operate in the charge domain, which makes the communication between each other efficient and thus reduces power and area. <br/><br/>Previously published works on noise-shaping SAR ADCs are all based on charge-redistribution SAR. In BENSSAR, the noise-shaping function is built based on the charge-sharing SAR. With the help of noise-shaping, the strict requirement on comparator noise, a disadvantage of charge-sharing SAR, is greatly relaxed. Since the error-feedback (EF) structure typically operates in the charge domain, this structure is very suitable for the charge-sharing noise-shaping SAR. <br/><br/>An active charge amplifier is implemented in the EF loop filter to achieve sufficient SNR improvement. The charge amplifier is realized by a current conveyor. We find out that the noise of the basic current conveyor is inherently limited but can be reduced by adding auxiliary amplifiers.<br/><br/>The BENSSAR has been designed in 0.18μm CMOS technology and has a subarray size of 9. The sampling rate is 30MHz. The BENSSAR consumes 1.31mW from a 1.8V supply and occupies an estimated area of 0.096mm2. In a bandwidth ranging from 3.75MHz to 6.25MHz, the BENSSAR achieves a SNR of 63.25dB, an ENOB of 10.21 bits and a Schreier Figure of Merit (FoM) of 156.1dB. <br","Ultrasound; Noise-shaping SAR; Beamforming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-01-30","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

(mentor); van Huijstee, Pieter Jan (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Pectus Excavatum (PE) is a common deformity of the thoracic wall, characterized by a depression of the sternum. In the current golden standard for surgical correction of PE, the deformity is instantaneously corrected, causing severe and prolonged post-operative pain. The goal of this study is to design and validate a novel implant to slowly correct PE over time and minimize post-operative pain. A<br/>new procedure was developed called SCARPE: spring-loaded continuously actuated repair of pectus excavation. During the SCARPE procedure, an implant continuously applies a small force on the posterior surface of the sternum. The continuous force is just large enough to stimulate cartilage remodeling and correct the deformity in two years. The SCARPE implant uses two symmetrically<br/>located tape springs as force generator. A tape spring is a thin sheet of metal with a constant cross sectional radius. When subjected to sufficient bending, a tape springs starts to buckle and applies a constant bending moment. The resultant force can be controlled by adjusting the fold location of the buckled tape spring. Adjustments are non-invasively actuated by an external drive mechanism that creates a rotating magnetic field.<br/>A proof-of-concept experiment was performed to investigate the force displacement relationship (FDR) of a tape spring mechanism in various conditions. It was found that the elevation force increased with spring size, number of layers and thickness. Furthermore, the FDR of the tape spring mechanism showed a unique curve for each fold distance, but was equal for the number of spring layers. Only three layered tape springs, with layers fixed together, applied an average elevation force large enough to correct the PE deformity in two years. None of the tape spring configurations, however, could adhere to all requirements simultaneously.<br/>Although the tape springs could achieve a constant force within the force boundaries, some challenges arose. Mainly, the small margin towards the lower force boundary, delamination and anatomical constraints pose a problem. In its current form, the SCARPE implant is not yet suited for clinical application, but is to be considered as a novel approach towards PE repair. Several recommendations are presented for optimization, as well as alternative design proposals for future research.","Pectus excavatum; Implant; Medical device; Tape spring; Concept design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

It has the potential to generate more than 420,000 TWh per year worldwide, an amount approximately equal to eighteen times the global electricity demand today. While many of the most abundantly resourceful sites are at water depths too extreme for fixed-base solutions, current floating turbine technologies suffer with high-costs and inefficiencies. Seawind Ocean Technology B.V., a Netherlands based company, is a manufacturer of fully integrated floating wind turbine systems. They have designed an innovative set of low-cost, low-weight, upwind two-bladed wind turbines, with teetering hinge and yawed power control. This teetering hinge decouples the shaft from rotor, by adding an extra degree of motion, and protects the turbine from harmful aerodynamic and gyroscopic loads, as well as the rotor from hydrodynamic loads. The innovative active yaw control eliminates the need for complex pitching systems to regulate power output, in turn reducing turbine head weight and turbine costs.<br/><br/>There are a number of aims and objectives for this thesis project. The first, and most fundamental, was to investigate two-bladed and floating offshore turbine technology and share these findings with the hope that they make their way into the hands of change-makers who can promote the technology and consequently accelerate the green transition. The second was to optimise the loading analysis models of the Seawind 6 turbine using DNV GL’s wind turbine design software, Bladed. This is a 6 MW two-bladed floating offshore turbine and is intended for commercialisation by 2024. Seawind have extensive operational data from the Gamma 60’s deployment (the world’s first variable speed, two-bladed, wind turbine with a teetering hinge) in the 1990s. The Gamma 60 was modelled and compared to this operational data, with the calibrations in turn applied to the Seawind 6 models to improve its accuracy. Once achieved, the third goal was to carry out a thorough ultimate and fatigue load analysis of the optimised Seawind 6 model for various design load cases at extreme water depths. This investigation proved that the various investigated turbine components have been adequately sized and that suitable construction materials have been selected considering the loads they are expected to withstand. Following this large body of work, the fourth objective was to verify the theory that teeter motion is aerodynamically damped when the blades of a two-bladed, teetered turbine, are vertically oriented due to differences in angles of attack of the oncoming and retreating blades when yawed out of the wind. The fifth and final goal of this thesis work was to pull everything together and compare the floating offshore two-bladed Seawind 6 to a conventional floating three-bladed state-of-the-art turbine competitor. This was in terms of ultimate and fatigue loads experienced, capital and operational expenses (CAPEX and OPEX), lifetime carbon abatement, levelised cost of energy (LCOE), ease of manufacture and deployment, and operational performance.","floating wind; Offshore; Offshore energy; renewable energy; Renewables; Wind; Wind Turbine; Two bladed wind turbine; Two blade; Teetering hinge; Teeter; Energy; MSc SET; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-30","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The research focuses on the prefabricated block form of the material and investigates different aspects that can play a major role and eventually affect the choice for the selection of the material in building applications. Such aspects are: the regulation and performance proofing requirements which are associated with the application of an unstandardised material, the application methods, the strengths and limitations related to the nature of material, the current industry barriers, its hygrothermal, energy and environmental performances according to the Dutch building regulation in comparison to popular industrialised materials in the Netherlands and the related costs. The compared industrilised options were two: the Aerated Autoclaved Blocks, which account for an industrialised option with equivalent properties as these of the hempcrete blocks, and the option of Sand-lime bricks in combination with Fiberglass insulation, which is currently a widely used construction option in the Netherlands. Dynamic hygrothermal simulations were performed in WUFI software, whereas available EPDs were used for the investigation of the environmental impacts of the materials under scrutiny in a life cycle analysis. Available literature, interviews with parties characterised by different roles and high experience regarding the use of biobased materials in the building industry were also used as a means for the completion of the current graduation project.<br/>Apart from the available literature, the research methods followed in the current graduation project were influenced by the results of the performed interviews, which indicated aspects that could be further explored. The results of the research show that in terms of performances, the material is able to satisfy the requirements of the modern Dutch building regulation and therefore the later does not account for the reason behind the limited propagation of the material in the Dutch building industry. Nevertheless, the current Dutch regulation is currently a barrier that discourages the international material supply and disregards important properties of hempcrete as its moisture buffering capacity and specific heat capacity which can play an important role. The Sand lime brick option has been proved more competitive in comparison to the Autoclaved Aerated option, as hempcrete outperformed its industrialised version AAC in the vast majority of the analyses performed in the current study. Hempcrete shows a better moisture buffering capacity and environmental footprint. The hygrothermal performances of hempcrete blocks were also proved beneficial in the condensation analyses, where even hempcrete walls with lower thermal resistance still reached the same performances as the better thermally designed SL walls. Hempcrete design of the residence exhibited slightly lower energy performances, which can be attributed to the lower volumetric heat capacity of the material.<br","hempcrete; hemp concrete; hempcrete blocks; hygrothermal properties; biobased materials; biobased design; environmental footprint; sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

As the consideration and integration of concepts such as sustainability and circular economy are becoming increasingly popular in the civil engineering sector, it might be time to re-consider certain activities. <br/><br/>From both scientific and practical points of view, it is concluded that currently a great deal of research is focused on stimulating concepts such as sustainability and circular economy in the “early stages” of the lifecycle such as procurement, design, and construction stages. However, the aforementioned concepts are not yet elaborately researched in stages after construction, such as the maintenance stage. However, in the Dutch context, there are hundreds of existing civil engineering assets, that need to be maintained daily. As the Dutch government has certain goals, it is important to see how maintenance strategies for existing civil engineering assets can be affected in the case when sustainability and circular economy are considered. <br/><br/>This research aims to explore the integration of concepts such as sustainability and circular economy within the maintenance stage of existing civil engineering assets. As a result of this research, a tool is developed in Microsoft Excel. This tool referred to as “Maintaining sustainably and circularly in a collaborative way” can be used by actors involved in the maintenance stage. It is possible to apply the tool in the following two phases, namely (1) the pre-contractual phase and (2) the execution phase for maintenance works. With the help of indicators, the actors involved can (re)consider aspects such as the (current) maintenance strategies, and the requirements for maintenance contracts. The tool can help to overcome certain identified barriers such as knowledge gaps on sustainability and circular economy within the maintenance stage, and diffused collaboration among parties involved in a certain process. <br/>For this research, two important constraints to mention are: <br/>(a) The developed tool is currently only applicable for sluices and bascule bridges (in Dutch: beweegbare bruggen), and <br/>(b) the focus of this research is solely on performance-based contracts for maintenance works. <br/><br/>As an approach to conducting the research, the “Double Diamond Methodology” is applied. This is a design-thinking research approach. In the first part of the diamond, literature is reviewed and semi-structured interviews are conducted. The results of the literature review and the interviews led to the requirements that should be used as a basis for developing the tool. In the second part of the diamond, the tool was developed and tested via validation sessions.","Sustainability; Circular economy (CE); Maintenance; Collaboration; tool development; Barriers and enablers; Indicators; Double Diamond method; performance-based maintenance contracts","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The production of plastic materials has experienced incredible growth over the past decades. Polyethylene constitutes the largest part (25%) of plastic production, finding its application mostly as film in industrial and food packaging and agricultural use. However, since packaging materials are getting increasingly complex, polyethylene waste is nearly always mixed with other polymers, making direct recycling impossible. Compatibilization of polymer blends can be used to convert an immiscible polymer blend into a homogeneous material with synergistic properties. When this compatibilization is carried out inside an extruder, one less reaction step is needed and the material can directly be processed according to its application.<br/><br/>This study addresses the reactive compatibilization of recycled LDPE (rLDPE) originating from industrial film waste with its polymer impurities, as well as virgin low-density polyethylene (LDPE)/polyamide 6 (PA6) blends of various compositions through reactive extrusion with PE grafted with MA (PE-g-MA). A literature review was carried out, summarising the current state-of-the-art of reactive compatibilization and reactive extrusion. The composition of the recycled stream was identified through various characterisation methods. Through a wide variety of characterisation techniques, the mechanical properties of the extruded sample pellets were investigated, as well as the mechanical and optical properties of the blown film.<br/><br/>The compatibilizing effect on the virgin LDPE/PA6 blends was found to grow in importance with increasing PA6 content. For 1 wt%, the samples did not exhibit any improvement upon compatibilization. The samples containing 5 wt% showed their improvements predominantly in the optical properties. The 10 wt% samples showed large enhancements overall, after being treated with the compatibilizer. Both the optical and mechanical properties of rLDPE saw a significant amelioration as a result of compatibilization. This study thus achieved compatibilization through reactive extrusion for an extensive variety of polymer samples.<br","plastics; polymers; recycling; compatbilization; reactive extrusion; industrial film; ldpe; pa6; rldpe; polyethylene; extrusion blowing; grafting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-30","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

Governmental organisations, institutes and manufacturing companies themselves are concerned about high emissions and all together are making efforts to find and apply more appropriate technologies to reduce GHG emissions. This research focuses on the chemical industry, from the perspective of the chemical industrial cluster, and presents a way to identify the most suitable technologies for decarbonisation. The concept of an industrial cluster has the view of interconnected companies located in industrial proximity and there is a perspective of cooperation in order to find a way to reduce emissions. This cooperation, however, creates complexity as the companies will have to cooperate on a financial, technical and social level. <br/><br/>In order to study the topic, a specific case study was chosen to study, which is the Port of Moerdijk industrial cluster. Using publicly available data, three are chemical manufacturing companies and the one is a glass packaging manufacturing company, which is taken into account. The cluster analysis, results that companies are already strongly interlinked by exchanging material streams and utilities, which is an example of existing industrial symbiosis. The main raw material is naphtha, while energy is produced mainly by burning natural gas. This explains the high emissions of the cluster, around 2.8 Mt CO2/y, while the biggest emitter is the steam cracker unit (55% of the total emissions). Based on the cluster analysis, various options for decarbonisation are studied, such as alternatives for feedstock, energy carriers and the alternative processes itself. <br/><br/>The proposed scenario for the cluster of Moerdijk is, investing in the partial substitution of fossil-based naphtha feedstock with 10% co-feed of bionaphtha and 10% co-feed of waste plastic oil. Implementation of the electrification of the steam cracker, the steam boilers and the glass production processes and finally, Carbon Capture &amp; Storage (CCS) technology is recommended. By implementing the recommended combination of decarbonisation options, it is estimated that by 2035 this will result in reduction of 45% of cluster emissions. <br/><br/>After the proposal of the final scenario for the case study, an attempt is made to generalise this analysis, and thus a way towards a decision framework is presented. Essentially, a list of actions is presented, which someone could follow to find the appropriate solution for another chemical industrial cluster. In this framework, all the social, environmental, economic and technical sectors are taken into account. This leads to a rather complex topic that should be solved or at least simplified. This study can be used by decision makers of a chemical manufacturing company, which is a part of an industrial cluster, as a tool in order to follow the right steps to conclude the most suitable option for decarbonisation.  The advantage of studying this topic from an industrial cluster perspective is the decrease of individual investment costs by investing in a common solution with shared infrastructure.<br","Chemical industry; Decarbonization; Industrial clusters; Industrial Symbiosis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

In the offshore wind industry, Service Operation Vessels (SOVs) are needed to operate and maintain wind farms. To reduce the environmental footprint of SOVs at offshore wind farms, the possibility of battery-electric sailing with plug-in charging at offshore wind farms is investigated. Battery-electric sailing has been applied to many vessels, however, it is mostly applied to ferries which operate with a fixed daily schedule. An SOV has a variable operational schedule and therefore the energy use calculation is more complex than for a fixed operational schedule.<br/><br/>At the root of calculating the daily energy use are the daily schedules of the SOV. The daily schedules are determined by the maintenance strategy applied by the contractor, and the optimisation of the vehicle routing problems. However, in the concept design phase, this method is too detailed to get a useful and trustworthy result. A discrete event simulation is suggested to create daily operation schedules of the SOV where the power and duration are still calculated for, but the too-detailed routing information is left behind. The daily schedules are structured as a vehicle routing problem with delivery and pick-up with full-day and half-day tasks. They are influenced by wind farm characteristics, vessel characteristics, and operational characteristics. <br/><br/>With the information that is known about the daily schedules and the input parameters, a Monte Carlo simulation is deemed the most appropriate. This method takes into account the likelihood of input variables, can deal with these uncertainties, and still give a useful, trustworthy, result. The model creates many daily schedules of which the resulting maximum energy use, by the law of large numbers, converges to the expected value. For the idle time, a charging module is implemented to make the choice between standby and charging. <br/><br/>A case study is done to look at the influence on the results of design choices and boundary settings. The inputs that are varied during the case study are: with or without charging, the number of charging points, the layout of the offshore wind farm, the workday length, the task distribution and the charging power. The daily energy use results for a 12-hour workday vary from a bit over 4000 kWh with not that many tasks and six charging points, to over 10000 kWh for many tasks and only one charging point. Individual inputs can make a difference from 500 to 3000 kWh. The case study gives a good insight into how much influence different parameters have on daily energy use and shows that offshore charging during the day can drastically reduce the maximum battery energy needed during the day.","Electric sailing; energy use; Service Operation Vessel (SOV); operation & maintenance; Monte Carlo simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-27","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Secondly, it derives theoretical bounds for the true value function when dealing with environments where a reward is only given for successful completion of a task (sparse/binary reward). Lastly, a deliberate underestimation objective is added to the TD3 algorithm together with the theoretical bounds to improve system performance when using human demonstration data that only covers a specific part of the state and action space. All the algorithms are tested and evaluated using simulated robot manipulation tasks in the robosuite environment, where the robot is first trained on the demonstration data and then can gather more experiences in the simulation. Results show that the deliberate underestimation together with the value bounds enable the robot to learn from human demonstration, which was not possible for the standard TD3.

Possible consequences of climate change are sea level rise, heavier storms and high river discharges, but also prolonged drought. For a country such as the Netherlands, these water level variations, high discharges and droughts could have a great impact. Therefore, solutions of flood protection and water management are required to cope with these possible consequences.<br/><br/>The Delta21 project proposes a solution for flood protection of the Southwest delta in the Netherlands, while contributing to energy storage and nature preservation. The Delta21 project is a dam structure located in the Haringvliet mouth and, when constructed, results in a large change of the environment in the Haringvliet mouth. The remaining area of the Haringvliet mouth becomes the tidal lake. The important functions of the tidal lake are to be navigable and to have the capacity for extreme discharges to flow through the lake, without posing threats to safety. The functions are fulfilled by a channel through the tidal lake. The current channel (Slijkgat) requires highly frequent maintenance to allow for navigability and contains bottlenecks to meet the discharge capacity function. Hence, the objective of this research is to determine a suitable channel configuration in the tidal lake of Delta21, considering navigability and discharge capacity.<br/><br/>A suitable channel configuration is determined by designing a channel, accompanied by a morphological modelling study. The functional requirements and criteria for the design are defined based on the stakeholders interests. The requirements and the expected hydrodynamic and morphodynamic conditions in the tidal lake have resulted in three channel concepts that are considered for the design process. One of the concepts is the current bathymetry of the Slijkgat. The other concepts are Channel Concept 1 and Channel Concept 2, which are the same in cross-sectional area but different in orientation and location. The orientation of Channel Concept 1 is a small adjustment from the current Slijkgat, where the bend is slightly straightened. Channel Concept 2 is an almost straight channel and has the shortest length through the tidal lake.<br/>The numerical modelling study is applied on the design in order to determine the morphological response of the system to the concepts and indicate the influence on the navigability, discharge capacity and maintainability. A Delft3D-FLOW model is applied for two simulation periods; normal conditions of one year of morphological modelling and extreme conditions for one week. The normative hydrodynamic drivers for normal conditions are the tide and the river discharge and for the extreme conditions only (extreme) river discharge.<br/><br/>The hydrodynamic and morphological results from the modelling study are processed in order to evaluate the three concepts in a qualitative and quantitative manner. The evaluation criteria are based on navigability, maintenance and nature preservation. Based on the results, Channel Concept 2 is most suitable in terms of navigability and maintenance with respect to the other concepts. Therefore, evaluation has led to the selection of Channel Concept 2 as the most suitable channel configuration. Additionally, an optimisation is proposed for the selected channel concept in order to improve the fulfilment of the maintainability criteria. A dam around the north western end of the channel is proposed in order to decrease the sedimentation volume in the channel. Modelling computations including the dam resulted in a significant decrease of sedimentation in the channel. Hence, the dam is an improvement to the selected channel concept.<br/><br/>Concluding, Channel Concept 2 is considered the most suitable channel configuration in the tidal lake with respect to the other concepts. Implementing the dam in the tidal lake further improves the channel concept in terms of maintainability and navigability.<br/><br","Morphodynamics; Delft3D; DELTA21; Haringvliet; Channel; design approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","DELTA21","51.887988, 3.996428"

(mentor); Hoving, J.S. (mentor); Leemans, Joost (graduation committee); Brouwer, Ruben (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Due to the rapidly growing offshore wind market, there is a high demand for capable wind turbine installation vessels. Current wind turbine installation vessels struggle with the installation of large diameter monopiles due to a lack of crane capacity and with the installation of wind turbine components at hub height due to a lack of crane height. Most jack-up vessels currently have a crane capacity of 1600 tonnes or lower. This is adequate for the current average diameter monopile but already too low for the larger diameter monopiles. Due to a lack of crane capacity, these vessels are at risk of no longer being capable of installing wind turbine foundations in the near future. However, if it would be possible to reduce the crane loads during the installation process of monopiles, the commercial viability of these vessels can be extended. Previous research and practical experience have shown that a floating monopile upending process is feasible. A theoretical research with an experiment has been performed on the upending of a monopile where the buoyancy is utilized, but this research does not include the environmental conditions that can impact the monopile during the upending. This research also does not show the maximum amount of buoyancy that can be utilized during the installation process. <br/><br/>This thesis determines the maximum installation capacity that can be reached with a floating upending method, using a 1600 tonnes crane. It also analyzes the impact of the environmental conditions and presents the workability of the upending method. An analytical model has been made to calculate the motions of the monopile while it is partially submerged and hanging in the crane. The analytical model is used to validate the numerical model made in Orcaflex that was developed to consider five different concepts for the upending of the monopile. The best-chosen concept is further developed in the floating upending method.<br/><br/>To make the monopile water and airtight during transportation and upending, both ends of the monopile are plugged. The monopile is transported to the installation site by two tugboats that connect it to a rotating gripper which is placed on the side of the jack-up vessel. Then, the crane upends the monopile while the pile stays connected to the rotating gripper and maintains a certain amount of submergence during the upending which creates the buoyancy force. After the upending, the lower plug is removed by increasing the air pressure inside the monopile whereafter the monopile can be lowered to the seabed. This method is analyzed in the frequency domain for six upend angles whereafter the workability of the method is determined by simulations of the three most critical upend angles in the time domain. The floating upending method increases the installation capacity by 40% while maintaining a workability of 60-70% depending on the monopile diameter. It extends the lifetime of jack-up vessels and is a cost-competitive alternative when compared to mobilizing a floating heavy lift vessel instead.<br","Floating monopile; Monopile installation; Upending XXL Monopile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-27","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Šavija, B. (graduation committee); Mustafa, S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Strain hardening cementitious composites (SHCC) can be used to reduce the amount of reinforcement needed to control crack widths. SHCC has a strain hardening behaviour with dense micro-cracking, which makes it more ductile compared to conventional concrete. Conventional concrete can be used in the non-critical locations. An interface is formed in between the two concrete layers. The interface is the weakest link in the system, governing the structural performance. Therefore, the interface is of interest in ongoing research. The lattice model allows to investigate the effect of the fundamental parameters, the interface tensile strength and interface stiffness, on the structural behaviour in different bond tests between normal strength concrete and SHCC. Direct tension, direct shear and the notched-beam test were used to investigate the effect of the individual interface properties on the global behaviour. In all bond tests a smooth and profiled interface were simulated to investigate the effect of applying a roughness to the interface. <br/>In the small-scale tests activation of adjacent materials was found to occur at increased interface tensile strength and decreased interface stiffness. For a smooth interface a decrease in interface stiffness resulted in a scatter of failed elements over the interface in the direct tension test, increasing the ductility. Initially, a linear relation is obtained between the interface tensile strength and load capacity for the direct tension and direct shear test. With higher interface tensile strength cracking of the adjacent materials increased the load capacity, but the adjacent materials started to become governing. The application of a profile in the interface increased the capacity even further and resulted in an increased softening. For a profiled interface the effect of changing interface properties was limited in most cases compared to the effect on a smooth interface. This was due to the activation of the adjacent materials at lower interface properties compared to the smooth interface. <br/>Similar trends were found between the structural behaviour and interface properties for the notched-beam test. Only the application of a profile did not increase the load and displacement compared to the smooth interface. With the beam simulation results a data set is generated with the information about the load, displacement, interface opening and joint opening at failure. The data is classified based on the failure mode of the beams. From the classification it was found that with a smooth interface higher interface properties can be reached before the failure mode would change from interface to partial failure or from partial to concrete failure compared to a profiled interface. The range of interface properties resulting in interface failure is higher for the notched-beam test compared to the small-scale test. The notched-beam test will, therefore, be more likely to show interface failure when used for testing the interface. <br/><br","Interface; Strain Hardening Cementitious Composite (SHCC); Lattice model; Bond test; Hybrid structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

The frequentist approach is commonly integrated into academic curricula, while the Bayesian approach is less frequently employed. However a comparison of the approaches, further investigating their shortcomings and advantages, might give a better comprehension of statistics and more insight in statistical inference. Therefore the current study applied both the frequentist and Bayesian approach to multinomial logistic regression. <br/><br/>The multinomial logistic regression model can be described as a generalized linear model and as a random utility model, and the current study has shown that these models generate an equivalent probability function. Moreover, the method of estimating coefficients in the frequentist and in the Bayesian approach were described. The multinomial logistic regression model was subsequently applied to data from educational research, conducted by PRIME. Three different R packages were used to perform the multinomial logistic regression: the VGAM package (frequentist, generalized linear model), the mlogit package (frequentist, random utility model) and the UPG package (Bayesian, random utility model). The results of the analysis of one dependent variable were subsequently compared. <br/><br/>The results indicated that the frequentist and Bayesian approach differ in their estimation time and model fit: the Bayesian approach required more computational time, but resulted in a better model fit. The frequentist 95% confidence intervals and Bayesian 95% credible intervals are comparable, but the interpretation of these is considerably different due to the philosophical underpinnings of both approaches. Moreover in the Bayesian approach, existing knowledge and information can be incorporated by choosing the prior distribution. Furthermore the Bayesian approach gives a posterior distribution, which is more informative than only a point estimate. In comparing the three different R packages it is noted that all three have a slightly different theoretical background. Since the packages all have their own shortcomings and advantages, combining them when conducting multinomial logistic regression could be desirable.<br","Bayesian statistics; Frequentist statistics; Multinomial logistic regression; Random utility model; Generalized linear model; Educational research","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","PRIME",""

Targeted radionuclide therapy has become a important treatment, this is when a carrier molecule is attached to a radionuclide to deliver cytotoxic radiation levels to diseased cells. β<br/>− emitters are frequently used in RNT because they have a long penetration depth, such as the dysprosium-166/holmium-166 (166Dy/166Ho) in vivo generator. The 166Dy/166Ho in vivo generator shows great potential for large tumors because of the long half-life time of the mother nuclide 166Dy and the emission of high energy β− from the daughter nuclide 166Ho. Previous research shows the release of 72 % of the 166Ho when 166Ho is bound to conventional chelators due to internal conversion after the β− decay. The aim of this thesis is to synthesize an iron oxide nanoparticle as carrier for the 166Dy/166Ho in vivo generator. This iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) should prevent internal conversion and thus the loss of the daughter nuclide 166Ho.<br/>Results:<br/>The dysprosium doped iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized successfully with an average diameter of 6.1 ± 1.5 nm, measured with TEM. The DLS and TEM results showed that the SPIONs were aggregating. The labeling efficiency represents how much Dy is retained in the Dy doped SPIONs, for the non-radioactive Dy this was measured with the ICP/OES. The labelling efficiency was 3.21 ± 0.8 %. The 166Dy doped iron oxide nanoparticles were also synthesized successfully with a radiolabelling efficiency of 3.12 ± 2.2 %, measured with a 2480 Wizard 2 Gamma counter.

While vulnerable households are especially at risk in the energy transition, energy poverty effects of the transition are unknown. In Delft, a district heating network based on geothermal energy is planned. The distributive justice aspects of heat networks in the heating transition remain largely unexplored. In this master's thesis, an agent-based model is developed to explore inequalities in energy poverty and access to energy that might arise from the switch to a heat network. The thesis aims to explore the scenarios in which these inequalities can occur and for what types of households, and to determine policy interventions that contribute to a just and inclusive heat network. The extent and distribution of energy poverty and heat network access was explored in multiple energy price contexts, in combination with the following interventions: lower energy tax for gas use below average use and high energy tax for gas use above average use; vouchers to cover upfront costs of heat network connection; renovation of dwellings with poor energetic quality; and awareness campaigns to reduce energy use. The results show that the current district heating pricing structure increases inequality. These costs should be shifted from the high fixed costs to the variable costs to reduce energy poverty in households with low energy consumption. In addition, it was found that building renovation could decrease inequality and energy poverty. Recommendations are made for policy, research and the development of new energy poverty indicators to reduce energy poverty and inequality in the energy transition.","Agent-based modelling; Capability approach; Energy Justice; Energy poverty; Heat networks; Energy transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","dataset: Agent-based model code and input data on 4TU.Research Repository","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

To improve energy efficiency and reduce environmental impacts, buildings can be renovated or replaced with more energy-efficient alternatives. Although new buildings often cause less environmental impacts from operating energy use, the higher material requirements cause additional environmental impacts. Housing corporations own more than 25% of residences in the Netherlands and need to decide between different energy efficiency improvement methods for their building stock. Therefore, the proposed thesis has the following research question: What are optimal building renovation or replacement solutions for housing corporations to improve energy efficiency and reduce environmental impacts in the context of the Dutch climate goals? Environmental impacts of materials and energy have been calculated according to the MPG+ method, which follows the life cycle assessment approach. The results show that extensively renovated porch flats and new buildings lead to similar amounts of environmental impacts if both use a collective heat pump and are insulated according to nearly-zero energy building standards. The comparison between the environmental impacts of extensive renovations and building replacement depends on the expected building life span after the intervention, the quantity of solar panels, and the use of sustainable materials. Renovations including lower energy efficiency levels or fossil energy sources cause more environmental impacts. The MPG+ method aligns with the Dutch policy context but lacks transparency, completeness, and data certainty. The alternative scenarios in this study are compared per square meter, so the overall environmental impacts may increase if the relative apartment size per resident is greater in the new building. Considering the Climate Agreement, the housing crisis, and many uncertainties, extensive renovations are recommended as a no-regret solution for housing corporations.","Life cycle Assessment; Energy consumption; Material performance; Renovation; Rebuilding; Housing corporations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

This is also true for aircraft flight routes; where wind field knowledge can contribute to flight planning and safety. Aircraft can relay flight information back to ground-based receivers, from which local wind measurements can be derived. Such measurements can be used in interpolation or a meteo-particle model to produce estimates elsewhere; yet those means do not take into account wind dynamics. A physically inspired neural network approach is applied in this work. Flight paths are derived from the aircraft measurements, and used to simulate training data from ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis data. Next, actual aircraft measurements serve as input, with the goal of predicting an entire wind field over the Netherlands and surrounding areas at cruise altitudes. The network can be leveraged by introducing physical losses, which are found to smooth the predicted flows. The network is able to predict flow fields on both simulated and real measurements, given sufficient input data. It improves over the existing methods of relying on 6-hour forecasts or using the meteo-particle model. Magnitude error of wind is reduced to 2.85 m/s, coming from 3.88 m/s for 6-hour GFS forecasts and 4.78 m/s for the Meteo-Particle model. Directional, physically inspired networks have an error of 11.2 degrees, compared to 14.4 and 17.3 degrees for 6-hour GFS forecasts and Meteo-Particle model, respectively. However, both error metrics fluctuate significantly depending on whether flow is uniform or of divergent nature at a particular day.

Energy storage acts as a buffer that mitigates the effects of over- or under-capacity in production by VRE. With 97% of global bulk energy storage, pumped hydro storage is the most widely used and mature energy storage method. With its long operational life, high round-trip efficiency (80%) and stable cost trajectory, it is a beneficial option for many energy systems. However, drawbacks of pumped storage include heavy technical, site-specific restrictions, long construction times and high initial capital investment requirements.<br/><br/>This study investigates if Ethiopia’s energy pathways benefit from adding pumped storage, where to build it, and if storage increases system resilience. The long-term energy planning tool OSeMOSYS is used, which allows for detailed investigation into system dynamics whilst parallelly minimising costs. OSeMOSYS enables the investigation into Ethiopia by looking at an extensive host of techno-economic<br/>specifications and supply and demand dynamics from the electrification of transport and integration of variable renewables to residential cooking demands.<br/><br/>This report discusses thirteen scenarios which are separated into three main categories: Base Case (3), Emission Penalty (EMI) (6) and Varying Wind Capacity and Seasonality (WND) (6). The base case introduces pumped storage to the energy pathways. The EMI scenario characterises three pathways for carbon pricing. In the WND scenario, wind power’s capacity factor and seasonality are altered to<br/>investigate the potential effects of using more accurate local data or prioritising some supply zones on the energy system configuration. Additionally, the most favourable locations for solar PV and wind are combined with potential PHS locations to find optimal sites for storage construction.<br/><br/>The results of the research show that pumped hydro storage is adopted into the energy system in all scenarios, following both a diurnal and seasonal (dis)charge pattern. Variable renewable integration increases by an average of 10% from the addition of storage (78 GWh). The emission penalty increases the electrification of residential cooking demand and boosts VRE penetration but does not integrate<br/>storage integration further than the base case due to reaching the upper limit of the storage capacity set in the planning experiments. Lastly, the changes in capacity factor and seasonality have a marginal effect on the energy pathways.<br/><br/>Pumped hydro storage increases the energy system’s resilience to climate-driven seasonal uncertainties and prices due to fossil fuel and carbon price uncertainties by making it less dependent on fossil fuels, decreasing vulnerability for potential emission penalties and seasonal capacity fluctuations.

The installation of the monopiles is done by means of a template structure. This template is specifically designed for this project and is installed on the seabed temporarily. The initial design of the template includes large mudmats to ensure the required stability during the full monopile installation sequence. Analysis shows that this initial template design does not perform well with regard to the template installation sequence. Additionally, when lifting the template through the wave zone, the large horizontal surface area of the mudmats yields significant hydrodynamic forces acting on the template in vertical direction. .<br/>Therefore, the main objective of this thesis is to generate and develop alternative foundation concepts to optimize the template installation sequence. The foundation concepts considered in this research are a mudmat, suction bucket, push-in pile and helical pile foundation concept. Using the mudmat as a foundation concept yields a foundation area of 924 m^2 in order to ensure stability on the seabed, independent of the soil type. The suction bucket foundation concepts results in a horizontal foundation area of 390 m^2 for sand, or 117 m^2 for a clay seabed. The push-in pile and helical pile foundation concepts developed for a sand seabed, result in an area of 306 m^2 and 319 m^2. For a clay seabed respectively a foundation area of 75 m^2 and 88 m^2 is required.<br/>The operability of each foundation concept is determined by means of a hydrodynamic analysis of the template when lifting it through the wave zone. The operability is the amount of time the template can be lowered through the wave zone, expressed in percentage based on 24 hours. A simplified method stated by DNV is used to determine the hydrodynamic loads acting on the foundation in heave direction. For the considered homogeneous sand and clay seabed, the mudmat foundation concept proved to have the lowest operability. The suction bucket concept scored second, and the push-in pile and helical pile foundation concept showed the best performance on operability for both types of seabed. <br/>To evaluate which concept yields the most optimal template installation sequence, a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) is performed. This MCA also takes the installation time, construction costs and the risk of damage into account as criteria. Taking all these criteria into account, it is obtained that the mudmat foundation concept does provide the best performance when considering the template installation sequence, based on the assumptions stated throughout this thesis. Even though the mudmat foundation concept has the lowest performance of all foundation concepts when lifting the template through the wave zone, this concept overall performs better than the alternative foundation concept due to a short installation time on the seabed, low construction costs and low damage risks. The suction bucket foundation concept shows an average score on all criteria. This resulted in the second preferred option. The push-in pile and helical pile foundation concepts show a good operability, however, these concepts score low on the construction costs, installation time and damage sensitivity. As a result, these concepts show the lowest performance considering the template installation sequence.<br","Offshore Wind; Monopile; Foundation; Design; Installation; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-26","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Grabs are essential in the process of unloading a bulk carrier by grabbing bulk material such as iron ore from the cargo hold. Due to varying operational conditions, the consistency and the amount of payload can vary significantly. One of the largest varying operational conditions is the occurrence of irregular bulk surfaces. Therefore, it is highly desired to attain a more predicable unloading capacity. This can be achieved by designing a hybrid grab which combines a regular grab with mechanical (rope) closing with an energy storage system that can deliver extra torque to increase the penetration depth. This hybrid grab will be designed by comparing its components on important assessment criteria and it will be analyzed if its stored energy provides more benefits than the additional weight of the hybrid grab mechanism over multiple grab cycles. Six hybrid grab concepts were formed by combining the sub solutions with several interconnection possibilities which resulted in a final concept score. The supercapacitor concept has been chosen as the main design based on the benefit of supercapacitors having the ability the absorb energy quickly and because the electrical system has the benefit to be connected in a smart system with interactive accelerator sensors input. To investigate the performance of the hybrid grab in terms of unloading capacity, several experiments were replicated with a new simulation setup. The average of unloading capacity of these simulations increased by 20.1%. It was found that for a SWL of 50 ton the hybrid grab could be activated half of the times. This resulted in an unloading capacity increase of 7.7% for the hybrid grab. The peak is reached for allowable load or SWL&gt; 58 [ton] after which the hybrid grab is activated every cycle which results in a payload increase of 16.3%. These results show the excellent performance the hybrid grab can deliver when unloading a bulk carrier.","DEM simulation; Bulk handling; Grab design; Hybrid grab; Morphological table; SolidWorks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2028-01-26","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

The process generates solid carbon instead of gaseous, thereby inhibiting emissions and has a relatively low process energy demand.<br/><br/>A three-step approach was taken to investigate the feasibility of offshore methane pyrolysis for sustainable hydrogen production. Firstly, a model was developed to evaluate the potential for converting methane into hydrogen under various design scenarios. Secondly, the model was utilized as a tool to create an offshore design for the methane pyrolysis reactor, including necessary auxiliary equipment. Finally, a calculation of the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) was conducted to compare it with conventional methane reforming technologies for hydrogen production.<br/><br/>The ultimate results showed a higher LCOH of offshore methane pyrolysis compared to the reforming technologies, however, two main components were identified that have the potential to close this gap. First, the sales of the solid carbon by-product would reduce the LCOH of offshore hydrogen and second the introduction of a CO2 tax would increase the LCOH of reforming technologies where methane pyrolysis is not affected. Thus, it can be inferred that offshore methane pyrolysis can be cost-competitive under the appropriate conditions.<br","Methane pyrolysis; Hydrogen; Offshore energy; Offshore engineering; Natural gas production","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

As ANWB requested research into targeting Gen Z with their camping portfolio, this project dives into an analysis of the current market trends, the company and its industry and the consumer and their behavior. The ultimate goal of the project is to answer the research question: What business strategy can be designed for ANWB to activate Generation Z to become members of the association through the camping portfolio of the company?<br/>The process starts off with orientation, using variable research techniques to gain insight into the context of the problem. It became clear that ANWB is not currently targeting the selected demographic audience well, as both their offering and their branding does not suit the consumer’s demands. Using this as the problem source, an explorative search on trends and the consumer lead to various more insights that allows for the strategy to be detailed later on in the process.<br/>After elaborating on the widespread initial research, this document discusses the design process that has been followed. Using the first ideation round to narrow down the scope towards vanlife, a deeper dive into the consumer behavior is derived from qualitative interview. Insights into vanlife enthusiasts identifies three value drivers linked to their experience: freedom through unrestrained travel, joy of building, and the expression of identity through creative decision-making. These drivers are used to further design a concept that enables the distinction of these drivers between its service offerings.<br/>The concept is split into two services: the hosting of workshops to repurpose vans into RVs, and the renting of these RV-vans for private use. The workshops will eventually be held in a workspace environment that also facilitates a community of van builders and vanlife enthusiasts to meet and connect.Having this community can greatly boost the naturally occurring oral advertisement for the brand, in turn tackling the current negative brand image. The rental service offers the consumer a low-investment option for experiencing vanlife first-hand, ignoring the necessity for building the van themselves. Breaking apart the act of building and travelling allows for the consumer to choose to engage with the concept however they prefer: only building, only travelling, or both.<br/>To help ANWB target the consumer, their innovative offering should be combined with a good branding strategy. This project therefore presents a product launch campaign, with several recommendations on styling and tone of voice. Focussing communication on the adventurous experience paired with vanlife instead of the current ‘parent’ aesthetic the brand is known for is proposed to shed new light on the brand, better suiting the target group in the process.<br/>Taken together, the roadmap presented as the result of this project presents a full strategy that covers both portfolio innovation and the marketing strategy,, thus enabling the company to successfully target the predefined demographic audience.","ANWB; vanlife; Gen Z; case study; Strategic Innovation Roadmap","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","Graduation project",""

(mentor); Morete Barbosa Bertolo, V. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Thick-section high strength steels (HSS) are widely used in engineering applications with requirements of high toughness and strength. Structural components are commonly joined by welding, known to significantly degrade the mechanical properties of steel due to changes in microstructure (e.g., grain size coarsening and martensite-austenite (M-A) constituent formation). This degradation is even more prominent at sub-zero temperatures, where steels exhibit ductile-to-brittle transition behaviour and cleavage becomes the governing fracture mechanism. The most detrimental area is the part of the base material exposed to high temperatures during welding, known as the heat affected zone (HAZ). This work investigates the microstructural features affecting cleavage fracture in the most brittle areas of a quenched and tempered (QT) S690 HSS plate of 100 mm thickness, the coarse-grained and intercritical coarsegrained HAZ (CGHAZ and ICCGHAZ). The effect of intercritical peak temperature and heat input is also examined. Results show that fracture toughness is strongly affected by the matrix properties. ICCGHAZ 750 °C zone, exhibiting the lowest hardness, preserved relatively high levels of fracture toughness, while CGHAZ with the highest hardness had a substantial fracture toughness deterioration. The comparison of the two different intercritical peak temperatures, 750 °C and 800 °C, revealed a strong influence of this parameter on fracture toughness since a significant toughness reduction of ICCGHAZ 800 °C compared to 750 °C was present. The larger area fraction of M-A constituents in ICCGHAZ 750 °C and 800 °C compared to CGHAZ does not influence fracture toughness, which is attributed to the small size of M-As. Although M-As are responsible for crack initiation, the majority have a size smaller than 1 µm which is not sufficient to cause unstable fracture. Consequently, the step of crack propagation is governed by the matrix. Regarding the heat input effect, a reduction from 2.2 to 1.1 kJ/mm resulted in an increase of fracture toughness in CGHAZ and deterioration in ICCGHAZ 750 °C, however, CGHAZ remained the most critical zone. The improvement in CGHAZ is attributed to a higher fraction of smaller M-A constituents leading to less critical crack initiation sites. The fracture profile shows that the main crack propagates transgranularly and can be diverted by PAG, with high-angle grain boundaries. The investigation of secondary cracks revealed that the slender M-A constituents do not act as crack arrestors as they can easily be cut off. On the other hand, blocky M-A constituents can act as crack arrestors when the crack width is comparable to their size. This thesis provides more knowledge on the cleavage fracture process of HAZ and guidelines on how to control cleavage fracture in welded structures and improve the design of welds for structural applications.","S690; Gleeble; High strength steel; CGHAZ; Heat input; Ductile-to-brittle transition; ICCGHAZ; HAZ; Cleavage fracture toughness; Low temperatures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-20","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

The goal of the OoC technology is to create disease models of various organs and use them to minimise animal testing. One of the important parameters to maintain the cells/tissues on the OoC is the temperature, typically at 37 °C. Usually, cell culture incubators are used to maintain the temperature of cells on the OoC. However, it is inconvenient for external flow control instrumentation to interface with OoC inside the incubator, and other temperatures being not possible. Therefore, an on-chip temperature controller is needed. In this report, a temperature control system for an OoC is designed, implemented and tested. To cover a wide temperature range, multiple peltier elements are chosen to confine the temperature control only at the region close to cell chambers in the OoC. A resistive temperature detector (RTD) is used as feedback to control the temperature by a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. To avoid any heat loss beyond the Organ-on-a-Chip, a 3D-printed polylactic acid (PLA) holder with good thermal insulating properties is used. The holder is designed for four chips to accommodate control chips along with test chips. A dedicated PCB with control electronics is designed and implemented to control the temperature on all four chips powered by a battery. A temperature uniformity of +/- 0.7 °C of 19 mm at 68 μL/min and 23 mm at 10 μL/min along a total microfluidic channel length of 40 mm (from inlet to outlet), a width of 5 mm, and a depth of 0.3 mm before compression, was achieved. The response time to recover from changes in the temperature is approximately 2 minutes. With a power consumption of 0.84 Watts per chip to maintain 37 °C, four chips can function on a 20000 mAh battery for a minimum of 4.5 hours (only cooling at a minimum of 18 °C) and a maximum of 8.3 hours (only heating at 37 °C) before recharge. The temperature control system was tested on Hepatocytes and Cholangiocytes for liver-on-a-chip applications, which showed that the oxygen disappearance rate is 9.87 times faster when maintained at 37 °C compared to room temperature.","Temperature Control; Organ-on-a-chip; Peltier elements","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-01-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

Especially in dense urban areas, where only limited space is available to integrate more horizontal greening at ground level, VGS have the potential to contribute towards creating a greener, healthier, more nature-inclusive and climate resilient urban environment. This by facilitating and contributing to natural ecosystem functioning, hence providing ecosystem services and through those, benefits for society. These benefits include among others an enhanced microclimate, biodiversity and aesthetic appeal, as well as improved physical and mental health, thermal performance, energy efficiency and air quality, and reduction of urban heat island effect and noise disturbance.<br/><br/>In order to substantiate the total set of costs and benefits associated with VGS implementation and enhance rational decision-making, in present research the development of a standardised framework and interactive economic valuation tool is proposed.<br/><br/>In the end, an economic valuation framework and tool were developed which can support the decision-making process regarding VGS application. The framework is based on Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) and Social Cost Benefit Analysis (SCBA). These analyses relate to real estate investors and society (resident focus) respectively. To assess and report on the values of the costs and benefits of these innovative systems, distinct themes were established. The cost themes entail financial costs, environmental costs and potential Ecosystem Disservices. Benefits are distributed over the themes health &amp; well-being, climate adaptation &amp; mitigation, real estate, social &amp; recreational &amp; commercial and biodiversity.<br/><br/>The current version of the tool is able to perform quantification and monetisation for financial costs, large parts of the environmental costs, reduction of airborne PM10, increased rental incomes (investors) and rental costs (residents), reduced energy usage for heating and MIA &amp; Vamil tax incentives. Based on implemented valuation methods, the case study delivers project specific results. Though, it is explicitly noted that these results do not yet provide a complete representation of all costs and benefits, due to a limited number of (benefit) indicators that are monetised. Hence, this version of the tool should be regarded as initial impetus for further development. This in order to ultimately obtain an all-encompassing VGS Valuation Tool, fit for project specific economic valuation of costs and benefits of VGS.<br/>The result dashboard visualises the valuation outcomes and results in clear tables and graphs, generating insights into the contribution of different themes towards the total costs and benefits of VGS. This can initiate further recommendations for a research agenda into distinct aspects of certain VGS.<br/><br/>Hence, the VGS Valuation tool could become a conversational mechanism or steering instrument, to stimulate or justify choices for specific types of VGS at given locations. The test panel of anticipated end users was enthusiastic about the comprehensiveness and user experience of the tool and acknowledged its future practical value.","Vertical Greening Systems; Cost Benefit Analysis; Nature Based Solutions; Nature-inclusive design; Climate Resilient City; Living Wall Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

The need for decarbonisation is not only fuelled by the aspirations of the sector but also by laws and regulations from countries and organisations. As these laws are gradually tightening and there is not one clear technical or operational solution, there is a need for a strategy to combine multiple operational and technical solutions. These solutions, as well as other aspects, are associated with risks and uncertainties, such as fuel prices, technical aspects and cost. To help the decision makers in this field, this research aims to present a method that can be used as the basis for a decision making tool. The method will mainly focus on finding the lowest total cost per tonne mile but will also consider other aspects that are found to be necessary, such as safety and technological readiness. The difficulty in the decision is the number of factors that could influence the decarbonisation of the vessel and how these aspects influence each other. The addition of CRSs (Carbon Reduction Systems) will affect the operation profile of the vessel and, with that, the fuel use of the vessel. With fuel being one of the main expenses of ships, fuel use will affect the total cost of the vessel. The method will combine several different analyses to consider all aspects and risks. The strategy will be created by adding CRSs every time the vessel does not comply with the regulations anymore, affecting the vessel's operational profile and fuel use. The cost of fuel use, and other OPEX, will be evaluated with an NPC (Net Present Cost) analysis to compare costs in time. These costs will then be entered into an MCA (Multi Criteria Analysis) and combined with the other criteria, such as safety and technological readiness level, leading to a strategy selection. To increase the method's robustness, the whole set of calculations will also be subjected to a Monte Carlo simulation to mitigate the risks that concern future inputs. The method was translated into a model where a case study was carried out to validate the method and to find some early insights. From this came the result that the method creates valid answers and that there is one method that is the most cost-effective manner to comply with the regulations. This is plainly sailing slower; it has almost no expense and significantly reduces the cost of shipping.","Decarbonisation; Decision Support Tool; Decision support model; Multi-criteria analysis; Monte Carlo simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Maritime Operations and Management","",""

The MSFR may play an important role in combatting global warming whilst ensuring energy safety considering fossil fuels’ finiteness. A key safety mechanism for the MSFR is the freeze plug, a valve underneath the reactor core designed to melt during reactor malfunction, letting the fuel salt drain into an emergency draining system.<br/><br/>In this thesis, the effect of the inclination angle of the freeze plug on its melting behaviour was investigated. This was done via the Linearised Enthalpy Method for phase change in OpenFOAM 8, a Finite Volume Method software package. First, two benchmark cases - one of inclined gallium melting and one of a heater copper fin in air - were performed. These showed reasonable agreement with established results.<br/><br/>A cylindrical freeze plug consisting of LiF-ThF4 salt was defined, with copper and hastelloy annuli around it to simulate the cooling and the draining pipe, respectively. Steady-state simulations were performed for inclination angles of &#x1d703; = 0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90°. Via simulations on meshes with 40,500 and 1.1 million cells, it was shown that the freeze plug did not form at &#x1d703; = 60° and 90°. For the other four inclination angles, the resulting freeze plug was found to be mesh convergent via a third mesh of 3.6 million cells.<br/><br/>Then, a transient simulation mimicking reactor malfunction was performed for the inclination angles 0° ≤ &#x1d703; ≤ 45°. It was found that the start and end opening times - the times where the melt front first and last reached the freeze plug’s bottom - were reduced by 74% and 52%, respectively for &#x1d703; = 45° with respect to &#x1d703; = 0°. The other two &#x1d703;’s also showed lower opening times compared to &#x1d703; = 0°. The inclination angle thus was found to have a significant effect on the freeze plug’s melting behaviour, shortening the opening times.<br/><br/>Physical improvements for the model include the incorporation of molten salt leakage after start opening time, and settling. Computational improvements are also possible, such as the refinement of the mesh near the salt boundary or adaptive mesh refinement near the solid-liquid boundary. Symmetry can be exploited to speed up results.","freeze plug; phase change; inclination; Molten Salt Reactor; Molten Salt Fast Reactor; MSFR; solid-liquid phase change; freeze valve","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","",""

(mentor); Herder, J.L. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","In the semiconductor industry, integrated circuits with nanometre scale structures are manufactured on silicon wafers. Particle contamination on the topside of the wafer can result in the defectivity of the entire die. In the ever-increasing efforts to create smaller structures onto a wafer particle contamination becomes more restrictive to prevent the defectivity of the die. In order to reduce the risk of particle contamination the wafer is placed in a vacuum environment. But further risks exist, during the grasping and positioning of the wafer new particles are generated and are able to transport to critical surfaces. This study investigates what guidelines need to be followed for the design of a kinematic coupling for use in a vacuum, whilst keeping particle generation as low as possible. The guidelines can be used to determine an optimal kinematic coupling design for any arbitrary object shape, size and mass. First of all, it is determined that abrasive wear, adhesive wear, contact stresses and outgassing are the predominant factors that have an effect on particle generation and influence the design of a kinematic coupling. The first guideline optimizes the constraint method of the kinematic coupling. Here, the guideline states that each constraint needs to be able to translate parallel to the surface of the object, doing so minimizes abrasive and adhesive wear. This can be achieved by suspending the contact points by using, for example, (folded) leaf springs. The second guideline encompasses the contact point shape and size. To equally distribute contact stresses, a spherical indenter shape should be chosen. Here, the radius of the indenter is chosen to be as small as possible to prevent adhesive wear.

The limiting factor, however, of an event-based camera is the spatial resolution which ranges between 40 × 40 and 1280 × 960. To counter this deficiency, a method is researched to super resolve event-based vision in order to enhance spatial resolution. A selection of different neural network types and configurations are researched in a step-by-step fashion. Subsequent experiments tested the selected networks on their ability to process event-based data and extract features from it. Followed by experiments that exploited the limitations of the networks to super resolve at different ratios, lengths of eventstreams and more complex event-based data. Results of various experiments showed that a network configuration that utilizes a transformer architecture was best able to super resolve event-based vision. This type of network leverages the ability to extract features based on dependencies between events which aligns with the characteristics of event- based vision. Based on the obtained results from the exper- iments, a pipeline is proposed to super resolve event-based vision and consists of a combination of a transformer network, multilayer perceptrons and a k-nearest-neighbor algorithm. Using this pipeline, eventstreams can be super resolved in the spatial resolution at a scaling ratio of 4. Visually, these super resolved eventstreams resemble more detailed and enhanced version to the low-resolution input. This proposed pipeline can be considered as a starting point in further research toward the super-resolution of event-based data and thereby contributes to the extension of application possibilities of event-based vision.","Event-based vision; Super-resolution; Deep-learning; Computer vision; Spatial resolution; Neuromorphic vision","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Cognitive Robotics","",""

The methods used include the IEF-based method, the BIM-API-based method, and other approaches. However, these methods have not helped architects out in the early design stage since the complexity of the assessment is not decreased.<br/><br/>The contradiction of increasingly complex energy simulations and early conceptual designs forms a research gap in energy optimization. As changes in the early design stage have more effect on the buildings and make less cost, the introduction of on-the-fly energy assessment in the early stages is of great importance.<br/><br/>This thesis developed a framework to help boost energy efficiency in building design. The framework aims to improve the efficiency of energy assessment by providing simultaneous and on-the-fly energy performance assessment of the design. BIM software Revit and the visual programming environment Grasshopper were integrated via Rhino.Inside, a bridge between the BIM environment and others to perform the assessment. The workflow of the framework contains three parts: data input from BIM models and the determination method NTA 8800, the connection by Rhino.Inside and the computation of the Grasshopper script, the final results, and the report produced by the Grasshopper script.<br/><br/>A script in Grasshopper as a demonstration of the framework was developed as such that Revit models can be directly linked to the energy analysis, and the results can be returned simultaneously. The script was created based on a preliminary case study and two sets of studies were conducted to validate it. The case study of a tiny house was first investigated to test and validate the developed tool. The energy demand result of the developed tool has only a 3% difference for the case study calculated via Uniec 3, a verified software used in the Netherlands. <br/><br/>The developed tool was also validated through 4 variants with different configurations to find out if the tool is accurate and robust enough concerning dimensions and physical properties. The comparison of the results shows that the developed tool can produce steadily accurate results that vary within 5% from the standard outcome. In addition, the study indicates the framework's potential of optimizing the building's performance on energy efficiency as the proposed framework significantly shortens the time and workload compared to Uniec 3 which requires a body of manual input.<br/><br/>The study in this thesis integrates the BIM models and energy analysis to enhance the sustainability concept in the building design industry. It fills the gap in the application of semi-automated BIM to the BEM framework in the early design stage of buildings. The developed framework provides a useful tool and practical benefits to the field of energy efficiency. This study investigated the potential of applying on-the-fly energy assessment in early design stage, which could be developed further in future work to explore more or better solutions.","energy assessment; Grasshopper; civil engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The ability to model other agents can be of great value in multi-agent sequential decision making problems and has become more accessible due to the introduction of deep learning into reinforcement learning. In this study, the aim is to investigate the usefulness of modelling other agents using variational autoencoder based models in partially observable settings. Previous studies that model other agents using (variational) autoencoders have shown promising results. In these studies, a single protagonist agent learns representations of other agents to then use them as additional components of its observation space which is, as such, augmented with those representations. It is, however, not always entirely clear what is being modelled and what would be the best feature of the other agent to represent. Moreover, in these works, a comparison between the used variational autoencoder based models and a baseline classifier trained to solve the same classification task is missing. This study investigates which features can best be used for the augmentation of the observations of deep reinforcement learning agents and if these features can be represented by variational autoencoder based models. Subsequently, it compares these models with a baseline classifier that solves the same classification problem to find out which model yields the best results when used for augmenting observations. Overall, the results suggest that it is beneficial to augment the observations of deep reinforcement learning agents with features related to other agents learned in a pre-training phase. Another interesting result is that the baseline classifier achieves similar or better performance compared to the variational autoencoder based model. Further research needs to be conducted to confirm the soundness of these findings.","Agent Modelling; Variational Autoencoder (VAE); Multi-Agent Sequential Decision Making; Reinforcement Learning (RL); Partial Observability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Artificial Intelligence Technology","",""

This feedback is not always reliable due to sedation, discomfort, and prone positioning of the patient. Excluding the need for patient feedback by performing objective intraoperative measurements to guide lead placement could be possible using the recording capabilities of closed loop SCS leads.<br/>Objective: Assess the feasibility of performing intraoperative evoked compound action potential (ECAP) measurements in the spinal cord using stimulation on the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) corresponding to the painful area of the patient to guide SCS lead placement.<br/>Methods: Intraoperative measurements were performed during placement of the SCS leads. The L3, L4 or L5 DRG was stimulated with a RF-needle and a recording electrode on the lead measured the neural activity in the dorsal column. The reference electrode was either on a subdermal needle or on one of the electrodes on the lead. The DRG was stimulated with a frequency of 10 Hz, a pulse width of 300 μs and a biphasic pulse type with negative polarity. By increasing the stimulation amplitude until ECAPs are visible, the activation threshold was determined, and by recording on different electrodes on the lead, propagation of the signal was validated. All data gathered during the measurements was processed and analyzed in MATLAB, and conduction velocities were calculated.<br/>Results: We included eight patients, and in two out of eight patients it was possible to measure ECAPs in the epidural space when stimulating on the DRG. A measured signal was deemed an ECAP if certain characteristics were met. The morphology should match that of an ECAP. Also, an increase in the stimulation amplitude on the DRG should lead to a linear increase in the ECAP amplitude. Lastly, an ECAP propagates along the dorsal column. In many patients, the stimulation on the DRG did not activate enough fibers to create an ECAP that was measurable in the epidural space.<br/>Discussion: There is no clear common denominator in the patients or stimulation parameters in the measurements where ECAPs were successfully measured in the epidural space, making specific improvements to the measurement protocol difficult. Age, gender or medication use seemed unrelated to whether the measurements succeeded. The experimental set-up could be improved by validating the distance between RF-needle and the DRG. Also, the use of sedation allows for an increased stimulation amplitude use, which could increase the amount of fibers activated to elicit an ECAP.<br/>Conclusion: Stimulating the DRG with a RF-needle can lead to measurable ECAPs in the dorsal column, which could help guide lead placement without the need for feedback. However, the measurement protocol as it is now does not produce predictable results and should be improved if to continue with this study. Also, the need for this intraoperative procedure should be reevaluated since experienced surgeons estimate the lead localization quite accurately. In combination with 12 electrode leads covering 3 vertebrae, the rest of the coverage overlap can often be achieved during postoperative programming of the stimulation.","Spinal cord stimulation; Dorsal root ganglion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-31","","","","Technical Medicine","ECAP Guided SCS Lead Implantation study",""

It is a foundation that stands up for the refugees’ interests and helps them to build a new life in the Netherlands. In this project, it is researched how private housing (with a matching agency) can be better facilitated in the future.<br/><br/>♦ <b><i>Project objective </i></b>♦<b><i><br/></i></b><br/><b>Focus on private housing with a matching agency for Ukrainian guests and Dutch hosts</b><br/>24 February 2022 is the day that Russia invaded Ukraine. The invasion caused a big crisis, with around 12 million Ukrainians fleeing the country and 7 million people being internally displaced.From the 86.850 Ukrainian displaced people in the Netherlands, 12.000Ukrainians joined private housing without a matching and only 3.000 Ukrainians joined private housing with RefugeeHomeNL (a matching agency). Although many Ukrainian people joined private housing without a matching agency, it is preferable to facilitate hosting arrangements that are visible as it offers the possibility to humanitarian organisations to provide help to the guests and hosts.<br/><br/><b>Guests and hosts have difficulties expressing their expectations, needs and irritations</b><br/>Based on research on the experiences of Ukrainian guests and Dutch hosts on private housing, it is found that they have difficulties expressing their expectations, needs and irritations when living together. This is understandable as they do not want to be a burden to each other. However, it is valuable to deal with conflicting interests instead of ignoring them. By acknowledging their needs and expectations, they have the possibility to discuss and align them to enjoy living together.<br/><br/><b>Value of acknowledging clashes due to different lifestyles<br/></b>To protect the mental wellbeing of the guests and hosts, it is essential that they reflect on what they need and value when living together. Their needs and expectations could be different or similar. They should understand that their differences and similarities could cause conflicts when living together. It is okay to have a conflict. What matters, is the way to manage it. The first step in managing, is being aware of their different or similar practices. At the societal level, it could help us to feel confident to discuss serious topics instead of avoiding them. Only by acknowledging the differences and similarities, we can find a way to deal with it.<br/><br/>♦ <b><i>Design concept Form: a welcome package </i></b>♦ <b><i><br/></i></b>Form is a welcome package and a conversation tool for guests and hosts that live together to support them in setting social living agreements together by sharing their expectations about different situations with the use of emotions. This way, they communicate how they prefer to interact with each other at the beginning of living together.<br/><br/><b>Introducing <i>Form </i>at the matching conversation<br/></b>Before living together, guests and hosts go to a matching conversation to get to know each other before living together. During this conversation, the matchmaker will introduce the purpose of the welcome package: their different lifestyles could cause conflicts, but is okay to have a conflict. They should be prepared on how to manage the conflict. The welcome package will help them to do that.<br/><br/><b>Interacting with <i>Form </i>when living together<br/></b>In the first week of living together, a welcome package will be sent to the guests and hosts. Guests and hosts are presented with situations that are known to be possible incentives for conflicts. They should choose one trigger card and describe the situation.Then, they are asked to choose two emotion tokens that they relate to their experience with the situation, explain why and discuss. For example, they like to cook together but get a bit annoyed when the kitchen counter is not cleaned after cooking. Choosing two emotion helps them to focus on both positive and negative aspects. Based on their conversation, they set social living agreements. By already expressing how they would prefer to deal with uncomfortable moments, they are prepared and feel more comfortable to communicate their concerns in the future.<br/><br/>♦ <b><i>Future of Form </i></b>♦</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;""><b><i><br/></i></b><b><i>Form </i>for guests and hosts with various cultural backgrounds<br/></b>It is proposed that Form will not only be used by Ukrainian guests and Dutch hosts, but also by people from various cultural backgrounds. The welcome package will be offered to them by a matching agency.The goal of Form is in line with their vision (providing a safe temporary home)as well: Form helps guests and hosts to give a voice and protect their mental wellbeing when living together. It helps guests and hosts to manage conflicts which means that the concerned matching agency could invest less time and energy to mediate with possible conflicts. Furthermore, Form offers something to hold onto for the matchmakers that evaluate the hosting arrangements.<br/><br/><b>Impact on the amount of hosting arrangements<br/></b>Currently, there are almost double the amount of guests than hosts in the database of RefugeeHomeNL and Takecarebnb. It would be desirable to equalize this. Evaluating Form on the long-term would provide insights in whether more hosts would register for private housing if Form would be implemented on a larger scale. More positive housing arrangements could result in more registrations by hosts. And, more hosting arrangements help us to embrace cultural diversity.<br/><br/><b>Impact on the mindset of the Netherlands<br/></b>Form helps to advertise the notion that we should discuss differences and similarities. Discussing uncomfortable moment might be unpleasant, but eventually it helps us to create positive impact for those serious topics.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> ","Ukraine; Private housing; Refugees; Guests and hosts; Culture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

One of the challenges of using NNs is the requirement for large amounts of labelled data to train the model effectively. In many real-world applications such as radar, labelled data may be scarce due to the high cost of acquiring measurements together with privacy and security concerns.<br/><br/>To overcome the lack of data, researchers have resorted to data augmentation (DA), a technique that aims to solve the problem at the root by generating new training samples by leveraging the available ones. In computer vision, image transformations and generative networks are used to perform DA. These techniques, however, may lead to the production of physically unfeasible samples that may hinder the generalization capabilities of classifiers in domains where the data has an underlying physical meaning.<br/><br/>Physics-informed machine learning aims to incorporate physical prior knowledge and governing equations of the target domain into the machine learning pipeline to improve the performance of NNs in fields with limited available data but with well-defined physical models. In this thesis, physics-informed DA in the radar domain is addressed to improve the task of classifying armed and unarmed walking individuals through micro-Doppler spectrograms. <br/><br/>To begin with, the usage of model-driven micro-Doppler radar simulations to improve the existing generative augmentations is investigated. After introducing several generative NN architectures, the quality and diversity of the produced synthetic spectrograms are evaluated together with their effect on the downstream classification task.<br/><br/><br/>Next, the impact of visual transformations on micro-Doppler spectrograms is studied. Their effect on the underlying physics of the micro-Doppler spectrograms and their impact on feature extraction is assessed. Based on the results, a new DA technique is devised to improve the feature extraction process by informed segmentation of the input spectrogram, halving the size of the NN model and reducing the risk of overfitting.<br","Data Augmentation; micro-Doppler; Generative Adversarial Network; physics-informed neural networks; human activity recognition; Deep Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-01-24","","","","Electrical Engineering | Signals and Systems","",""

Especially for a coarse material like limestone, the average payload can be improved, by altering the grab design. It is suggested that the penetration and cutting depth of a grab can be improved, which will have a positive effect on the payload. This research is limited to the contact surface of the grab with the bulk material, the knife. Subsequently, the following research question is answered in this research:<br/><br/>How to enhance the penetration and cutting depth considering coarse cohesionless material?<br/><br/>This is done, by implementing a DEM model using the bulk calibration approach [1], several in situ<br/>and laboratory experiments are performed to measure certain macro properties. The experiment is numerically replicated, and micro parameters are changed iteratively until the predicted macro response matches the desired results. A comprehensive study of similar papers considering the penetration resistance using a DEM model is executed, which resulted in selecting the penetration resistance and porosity as target variables. The particle shape of a DEM model has a significant influence on the bulk material behavior. The novelty of this research consists of doing a preliminary analysis before the final calibration process, in which several polyhedral and (multi)-spherical particle shapes are compared. For investigating the penetration resistance, a new test setup for in situ use is developed and constructed. The implementation of this setup proved to be successful, eleven data samples were collected. For the bulk density, an in situ and laboratory setup are compared, of which the laboratory setup proved to be more reliable. Several additional laboratory experiments are executed for the particle density, Particle Size Distribution (PSD) and wall friction. Using the results of the experiments, a DEM model is created, with which a preliminary analysis is done using extreme values of the calibration variables. Four spherical and four polyhedral shapes are compared, which resulted in the two-spherical shape begin the most optimal option. All the polyhedral shapes proved to be not fitting, especially due to their underestimation of the penetration resistance. Due to the high variance of the experimental penetration tests, two parameter sets with identical porosity are calibrated: one with a low resistance target, and one with a high resistance target. Using Design of Experiments (DoE) in combination with surrogate modelling with a linear regression, several optimal parameters sets are created, in which the uncertainty is considered as well. After selecting two optimal parameter sets, the simulations are verified by comparing the experiments and simulations qualitatively. Additionally, a quantitative verification using the stiffness of the force data of each time-step is performed as well. Using the calibrated models, an additional DEM model is created with a bigger particle bed, to investigate the penetration and cutting resistance. By altering the geometry of the knife, a decrease in resistance was achieved, mainly in the cutting phase. It is recommended to consider the flowing behavior of limestone as well, with which a complete material model can be calibrated and validated, and full-scale simulations can be performed.<br","Grabs; Coarse material; Limestone; DEM simulation; Calibration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2028-01-23","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

This project focuses on the impact of distribution centres, intended for the storage of commercial goods. Warehouses are characterised by large flexible spaces and simple structural systems, most often with steel or concrete frames aiming at efficiency and low costs. The aim of this research is to create a sustainable single-storey warehouse with a significantly lower environmental impact compared to reference designs with steel and concrete frames. Considering a new-build project with no reuse of existing elements, a meaningful target for embodied carbon reduction is set to 50% of the environmental impact score of reference steel and concrete warehouse designs.<br/>A selection of sustainable design strategies are investigated, giving insight into which actions designers shall take in priority to effectively reduce the embodied carbon of a warehouse. Reducing upfront emissions (LCA modules A1-A3) requires looking into short-term sustainability measures like reducing material use or using low carbon alternatives wherever possible. Replacing fossil-based products by renewable carbon sequestering materials like timber or other biobased alternatives contributes to lowering the impact of a building, by storing biogenic carbon for the lifespan of these elements. A sustainable use of wood presumes that its design lifespan is at least equal to forest rotation periods to maintain or increase the forest timber stock, combined with sustainable forest management practices. Biogenic carbon storage may be extended by designing for long-term reuse or recycling. Greening the envelope of a building takes advantage of ecosystem services provided by vegetation, like improving air quality, enhancing thermal performance or supporting biodiversity. Many systems can be applied on facades and roofs, depending on project-specific requirements (plant species, layout, load-bearing capacity), to effectively introduce vegetation in the built environment.<br/>The first design step investigates the embodied carbon reduction potential of substituting steel or concrete by timber in the load-bearing frame of a warehouse. Reference steel and concrete structures are selected, and baseline timber designs are created with similar geometrical characteristics and stability systems, to compare their environmental impact on a fair basis. The second design step of the research aims at further reducing the impact of not only the frame, but also other parts of the timber warehouse (foundation pads, floor slab, envelope). Big ticket items responsible for the most impact are identified and tackled in priority: in both timber designs, the floor slab and envelope are responsible for the largest share of embodied carbon. Based on the results of design steps 1 and 2, the 50% embodied carbon reduction target can be achieved by substituting steel or concrete in the frame by timber (-31%), replacing sandwich panels on steel supports by biobased materials in the envelope (-13%), and reducing the floor slab thickness by 50mm (-7%), when considering only fossil emissions. If biogenic carbon storage is accounted for, using biobased materials in the frame (-65%) and in the envelope (-58%), without modifying the floor slab, results in a carbon positive warehouse design. These results are only valid assuming long-term carbon storage in biobased materials, supported by circular design measures. Greening the envelope also contributes to making warehouses more sustainable, provided that benefits from ecosystem services outweigh environmental costs from additional materials.<br","Environmental Impact; Structural design; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Timber; Steel; Concrete; Frame; Floor slab; Building envelope; Biobased materials; Biogenic carbon; Green facade; Green roof; Circular economy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

(mentor); Boelhouwer, P.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The Netherlands is dealing with a severe housing crisis, in which there is a major shortage of affordable housing. The government has introduced many new regulations, trying to curb this affordability problem. Many of these measures seem to center around tempering market parties on the Dutch housing market. However, quite contradictory is that the same government is also dependent on these market parties to construct new housing. The relationship between government and market parties need to become less hardened, as the there is a tremendous urge for affordable housing. Many lower and middle-income groups are excluded from social housing and owner-occupied housing, therefore dependent on the middle rental segment. Within the new coalition agreement is laid down that there will be a rent regulation for middle segment rental housing, which has to conclude in affordable housing for middle-income groups and profitable investment opportunities for institutional real estate investors. This utopian way of thinking will be further explored within this research, as there seems to be a more complicated field of tension between the subjects of affordability and financial feasibility. New and innovative concepts could help to bridge this gap, however the effectivity of these concepts for realizing middle segment rental housing still seems underexplored in literature. The main research question is therefore: To what extent are new and innovative concepts effective in realizing middle segment rental housing, which remain affordable for tenants and financially feasible for project initiators?<br/><br/>The research involves two types of studies. Starting off with a literature study, to shape the theoretical context of the problem. The literature study is followed up by empirical case studies on new and innovative concepts, in which data is acquired through document analyzes and the conduction of qualitative interviews with involved stakeholders.<br/><br/>The goal of the research is to provide recommendations to market parties and governmental parties on how to effectively realize middle segment rental housing. The recommendations are based on the concluding answers to the main research question and the corresponding research sub-questions.<br/><br/>The final outcome is that new and innovative concepts are to a very high extend effective in realizing middle segment rental housing. The concepts have a unique financial structure, which allows them to guarantee the affordability for tenants and the financial feasibility for project initiators. This way new and innovative concepts are able to lower the tension between affordability and profitability. Moreover, some concepts offer additional solutions for other larger social challenges, such as the energy transition, skewed housing and an aging population. In addition to the concept itself, the important role of the government must also be acknowledged, which influences all developments in the housing management field by means of steering legislations and regulations.","middle rental segment; rental housing; mid-rental housing; new concepts; innovative concepts; innovation; effectivity; effectiveness; affordable housing; affordability; financial feasibility; profitability; rent regulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Because people play an important role in the performance of waste management systems, the systems should be inclusive to all people (Vasconcelos et al., 2021). As currently no method suffices in studying both inclusivity and circularity in waste management processes this study proposes the waste journey method. <br/><br/>The waste journey method combines the customer journey theory and the theory of planned behavior and can be graphically presented as in Figure 1. In the waste journey method, the waste is followed from a waste perspective from actor to actor. In this journey the waste interacts with people, called touch points, who take certain actions that influence the circular performance of the waste management process. By mapping the waste management process and analyzing the arguments actors have for their actions, with the theory of planned behavior, the barriers, and opportunities for realizing inclusivity and circularity in a waste management process can be identified.<br/><br/>The barriers and gaps that are identified with the waste journey method can contribute to the improvement of the waste management process. Besides, this method is one of the first to recognize the preparation phase as an important phase for the circular performance of the waste management process. A downside of the waste journey method is that it is a time-consuming method to use, and it requires the transparency and willingness of all actors in the waste management process. This was also experienced in the case study where one of the actors was not willing to cooperate and commercial actors were not transparent about their waste trading contracts. Furthermore, the interview protocol of this research could have been better specified for each actor.

The most important parameters for this project are the dimensions of the cell, the geometry of the piping network, the electrode gap, the volumetric flow rate and circulation velocity. These parameters influence the performance of the cell. As a result, the production of hydrogen is optimized by fine-tuning these parameters. In addition, the performance in different electrolyser geometries is maximized assuming free circulation of the electrolyte. The geometries differ in the number of cells and the stacking arrangement and they are the single cell, single module and horizontally stacked geometries. The performance indicators are the flow velocity through the electrode gap and the volumetric velocity through the electrode gap, which is a product of the velocity, electrode gap and electrode depth. Furthermore, suggestions on the other dimensions are given, with the aim to maximize the flow rate or velocity. To study the behaviour of the electrolysis system, I developed a Python code that simulates the flow through the electrolysis cell and channel network. This numerical model is compared to an analytical model and experimental data from the literature. Finally, the simulations predicted that the optimum electrode gap width is dependent on the total number of cells. The results with the turbulent flow model, showed that the optimum electrode gaps were 1.85 mm 0.250 mm and 0.250 mm for a single module configuration with 1, 60, and 240 electrolysis cells, respectively. Moreover, the horizontal stacking arrangement of the modules, resulted in larger optimum electrode gaps, for the same number of cells.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-24","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy, Flow and Process Technology","",""

Needle electromyography (EMG) is a diagnostic tool used to identify and localise neuromuscular disorders, but the current evaluation by a neurologist is subjective and requires years of training. Artificial intelligence can be used to automatically classify needle EMG signals. However, previous studies in this area have been subject to bias and have overestimated their performance. As a result, we aim to develop a clinically applicable method for automatically evaluating needle EMG signals to provide a more objective and eﬀicient means of analysis. Methods. In this study, we implemented and evaluated two unsupervised learning models, a convolutional autoencoder + k-means clustering model and a deep convolutional embedded clustering model. The models were evaluated on two classification tasks: the classification of spontaneous, voluntary and insertional activity and the classification of spontaneous activity in needle EMG data classified as rest. We used hospital-acquired needle EMG data from the Amsterdam University Medical Centre (UMC), location AMC, from a total of 326 patients. The data was converted to Mel spectrograms, resulting in a total of 1.3 million images available for training. Results. The unsupervised learning models reached 93.5% accuracy on unseen test data. The classification of phenomena present in rest, such as fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves, was less successful and requires further research. Conclusion. Our study provides valuable insights for the use of unsupervised learning in the automatic classification of needle EMG signals and highlights the need for further research in this area.","Electromyography Signals; Deep Learning; Unsupervised Classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-03-01","","","","Technical Medicine","",""

The presence of so-called forelands (e.g., beach, mudflat, and tidal marsh) are promising Nature-based Solutions to reduce the probability of dike failure and to mitigate the consequences after a dike breach. However, the positive effects of forelands depend, for instance, on sediment composition, geometry, and the presence of vegetation. These effects have not been studied in detail and have not been incorporated into reliable physical and validated mathematical models yet.<br/><br/>This report describes an experimental study on the stability of different foreland types. Particularly, the following aspects were considered: investigating whether surface and headcut erosion are indeed the dominant foreland erosion mechanisms, plus providing experimental data for validation purposes for models such as the extended BRES model.<br/><br/>Twelve experiments were performed in the sediment flume facility of the Hydraulic Laboratory of the faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at the Delft University of Technology. A foreland during breaching conditions (i.e. high flow velocities) was simulated by an experimental setup, a so-called broad-crested weir. This weir was developed, constructed, and built within the facility to simulate and study erosion processes of two foreland sediment types, sand and clay. Geotechnical properties were obtained by performing sediment analyses in the Geoscience and Engineering Laboratory. In order to try to exclude the influence of cracks, a special adjustment of the facility was made by covering the sediment package with plywood panels; these experiments are referred to as ‘Tompouce’. For collecting data, the facility was fully instrumented with hydraulic sensors (discharge, flow velocities, and water levels) and synchronized cameras. The erosion process was analyzed and quantified from the visual data. <br/><br/>The experiments enabled us to answer the main research question, “Which erosion mechanisms are important to consider for forelands under dike breach conditions?”. For non-cohesive sediments, surface erosion should be considered the dominant erosion mechanism. In the case of cohesive sediments, however, headcut block erosion should be considered the dominant erosion mechanism. Here, when cracks are present, the erosion rate increases considerably. Especially the latter effect is a new finding; this mechanism should be included in foreland-dike breach development modeling. More research is needed into the quantitative effect of cracks on the stability of a vegetated foreland when it is subject to (sudden) high-water events.<br","Foreland types; Headcut erosion; Dike breaching; BRES; Flume experiments; Nature-based Solutions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

This excess of nitrogen emissions is primarily the result of livestock farms, which cause problems in close proximity to Natura 2000 areas. The housing- and nitrogen crises are intertwined because certain housing developments had to be halted or delayed in order to reduce nitrogen emissions.<br/>Both crises have sparked intense debate and discord in Dutch society, leading to the government's decision to create a buyout policy for farmers. The current government's top priority is to resolve these crises, but it has not yet been able to implement effective solutions. This study explored a supporting solution for both the housing- and nitrogen crises by investigating why housing developments on livestock farm locations are not commonly utilized as such in the Netherlands, and how such developments can be made more viable for farmers, municipalities and real-estate developers. As replacing livestock farms with housing seems such an obvious strategy. This experimental study employs qualitative methods, including interviews, desk research, literature reviews, and two case studies. In addition, a research internship has been concluded, during which experimental development cases on two livestock farm locations were carried out. Following the research methodology, a clear picture of the challenges and opportunities of developing housing on livestock farm locations has been formed. As well as an understanding of the legal-, social-, governmental-, and financial aspects of developing housing on livestock farm locations. It has been concluded that housing developments on livestock farm locations are currently viable and should be more prevalent. However, due to the complexity and (political) sensitivity, stakeholders are hesitant to develop housing on livestock farm locations. As ‘regular’ housing developments are complex enough in the current Dutch climate. The research has resulted in a final advisory document to aid in the development of housing on livestock farm locations. The advisory document describes how the context of housing developments on livestock farm locations can be made more viable, plus gives practical advice on how a housing development on a livestock farm location can be made into a viable proposition for a real-estate developer.","Housing; Area Development; Housing crisis; Nitrogen Crisis; Farmers; Real-estate; Advisory document","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

A global close-up of the urban environment, if you will, which is rich in (untapped) information such as floor count. Floor count is useful in many applications, from improving energy consumption calculations to creation of 3D city models without elevation data. So far, efforts to extract floor count from SVI are mainly approached as a classification problem with the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Limitations of this approach include the need of large (manually annotated) datasets, and uncertainty how these models learn to count storeys. Therefore, we aim to develop a method that can be trained on available datasets and determine floor count in a more explainable manner.<br/><br/>In order to make the floor count determination method more transparent, we mimic the row-wise counting of storeys as humans do: by vertically parsing a column of windows (and occasional door). Façade parsing is a common computer vision task that we can solve with deep learning. In this work, we employ the Mask R-CNN framework, that is trained on publicly available datasets, for the detection and segmentation of windows and doors. Then, the vertical distribution of detected / segmented windows and doors is estimated by computing the kernel density estimation function. The floor count is extracted by finding the number of maxima in the function, as the maxima represent the dense areas of windows and doors on a horizontal axis (i.e. storeys). To improve the results, an automatic image rectification is added as pre-processing step that enforces the regularity and repetitive occurrence of windows and doors. The full pipeline thus consists of three stages: 1) automatic image rectification, 2) window and door detection/ segmentation with Mask RCNN, 3) floor count estimation via maxima finding on the kernel density estimation (KDE) function. In addition, a small ""wild"" dataset was created that contains a higher variability in floor count, image quality and architectural styles, which better reflect real world SVI than existing façade datasets.<br/><br/>The floor count performance of the full pipeline was evaluated on the Amsterdam Facade (subset), ECP, TRIMS and ""wild SVI"" datasets. Since floor count annotations were missing, these are manually added. For detection-based data, the best results are an accuracy of 83% and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.17. For normalised segmentation-based data, the best results are an accuracy of 80% and a MAE of 0.20. Considering the method is still at its infancy, the results are promising. With further improvements in the pipeline and addition of automatic façade acquisition, the approach can contribute in large scale extraction of floor count information from SVI. To encourage further development, the pipeline prototype, dataset and floor count annotations are open source and will be released on https://github.com/Dobberzoon/Facade2Floorcount.","Floor count; Street View Imagery; façade parsing; facade; Deep Learning; Kernel Density Estimation; floor counting; number of storeys; image rectification; automatic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Mirra, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","A large share of the buildings today is still masonry buildings, both reinforced and unreinforced. Post-earthquake reconnaissance studies have shown a remarkable difference between the performance of reinforced and unreinforced masonry buildings. While the unreinforced masonry buildings tend to suffer severe damage, even collapse, resulting in loss of innumerable and invaluable life; reinforced masonry buildings have often been reported to perform remarkably well under seismic events. Sometimes, this performance has exceeded performance of engineered buildings as well.<br/><br/>Himalayas are a highly seismic region in South Asia with multiple major earthquakes recorded across the past two centuries. The remoteness of the region and abundant availability of local materials along with frequent earthquakes has resulted in the development of a seismic culture of earthquake-resistant, timber-reinforced masonry buildings. Though these buildings have shown superior performance under seismic actions, little scientific research has been done to understand and analyse the reason behind this superior performance.<br/><br/>Across the different regions of Himalayas, timber has been used in different structural configurations to increase the seismic resistance of the masonry structures. These traditional building systems remain popular in the Himalayan region for their cheap and easy availability locally. This additional graduation project is a step towards understanding the behaviour of these masonry structures, and the role of timber in preventing catastrophic failure in the former.<br/><br/>In this study, different building typologies in the Himalayas that use timber as a structural element are identified and described. Failure mechanisms of masonry structures are widely studied and a brief overview is presented. In-plane, out-of-plane, combined in-plane and out-of-plane and local failure mechanisms of unreinforced masonry are discussed in detail. Furthermore, a literature review of post-earthquake reconnaissance surveys is conducted to understand different mechanisms through which masonry structures fail.<br/><br/>A review of state-of-the-art on experimental, analytical and numerical studies conducted on resistance of some of the building typologies of Himalayan region (for example, Bhatar, Dhajji Dewari, Ikra, Kath Kuni) is done in this study to understand work done previously. Finally, an analytical analysis is conducted on single room, one-storeyed Bhatar building to investigate the response of an in-plane wall to a lateral load exerted by earthquake excitation.","Himalaya; Bhatar; Dhajji Dewari; Seismic Analysis; Failure mechanisms; Failure modes; Masonry; Timber-reinforced masonry; traditional earthquake resistant structures; seismic response; timber bands; rubble stone masonry; timber floors","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Steel and Timber Construction","",""

(mentor); León Sánchez, C.A. (graduation committee); Kutzner, T. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","In order to limit the global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, all sectors have to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and become more sustainable. This also includes the building sector, which is in Europe responsible for 40% of the total energy consumption (European Commission, 2020). A way to work towards this goal is by retrofitting the existing building stock to become more energy efficient. Urban Building Energy Modelling (UBEM) can help in this endeavour by identifying energy-saving potentials and thus to effectively allocate the required resources (Horak et al., 2022). Yet, UBEM involves many stakeholders which is why standards are crucial to facilitate data exchange and interoperability among them. In this context, the Energy ADE v1.0 was developed as an extension for the semantic 3D city model standard CityGML 2.0. It serves two purposes, first by storing energy related information on the individual building level, and second by providing the necessary input data for UBEM simulations (Agugiaro et al., 2018). However, in September 2021 CityGML 3.0 was released. The introduced changes directly affect the structure of the Energy ADE, which is why it cannot fully function on it anymore. This thesis therefore answers the question, how and to what extent the Energy ADE for CityGML 2.0 needs to be adapted to be conformant with the new CityGML 3.0 standard. It is accomplished by following a model-driven approach, where the UML class diagrams for the mapped Energy ADE are created first, before automatically deriving the corresponding XSD schema file. Through the lossless mapping itself, the Energy ADE is integrated as much as possible into CityGML 3.0, while also maintaining a logical symmetry. As such it accounts for the introduced changes of CityGML 3.0, by making use of the space and geometry concept, the versioning possibilities as well as the provided structures to model time-dependent data. The result is eventually tested and verified by converting a sample dataset to the Energy ADE for CityGML 3.0. This work provides an example on how other ADEs can be adapted to fit the new CityGML 3.0 standard and thus hopefully to the further establishment of it.","CityGML; Energy ADE; Urban Energy Modelling; 3D city model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

The heterogeneity among driving behaviour has gained significant importance since some researchers argued that it might be relevant to capacity drop and traffic oscillations. Driver space is an area around a vehicle, and drivers will feel a rapid increase in discomfort when their comfort boundary is intruded. The response intensity of discomfort caused by spatial intrusion is represented by proximity resistance. With the development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), it is crucial for drivers to feel comfortable within the implemented system. Therefore, understanding the heterogeneity of driver space has enormous potential to develop better customised ADAS. This report aims to analyse the impacts of heterogeneity on proximity resistance in car-following. The HighD dataset was processed to differentiate car-following driving styles for cars and trucks through the k-means clustering methodology. After successfully inferring the proximity resistance for each driver at each frame, the impacts of heterogeneity on proximity resistance in terms of different traffic states, vehicle types and driving styles were analysed. The results show that these three heterogeneities have different extent impacts on the proximity resistance of different drivers in car following. This study is beneficial for further investigations on the potential reasons for heterogeneous proximity resistance and the development of personalised car-following models.","Car-following Behaviour; Heterogeneity; Proximity Resistance; Driver Space","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

The potential thermal buffering solutions were defined through literature research and the option of a PCM system secured to the interior façade was further elaborated on by estimating its effect on the indoor climate of the Rotonde through software simulations in DesignBuilder using EnergyPlus. The simulation results of multiple PCM types and thicknesses showed that the current indoor temperature of the Rotonde is too inconsistent during summer months for a PCM to reach the intended cooling effect. A simulation of a combination of improvements to the building envelope and the most effective PCM showed a cooling effect of two ° C on warm summer days and a decrease of 50% in heating demand during the winter. This research amplifies the importance of a well-insulated building envelope for a qualitative indoor climate and climate systems should be an additional step.

They're at the core area of the Honghe Hani Terraced Fields, stretching for more than 166 square kilometres, and a wonder of terraced farming civilisation created by generations of Hani people using the steep hills of the unique geographical conditions. The villages within the Yuanyang Terraces bear witness to this long history. <br/><br/>Under the background of rapid urbanisation and tourism development in China, the rice terraces' beautiful scenery and unique culture have gradually attracted many tourists. However, these traditional villages are not prepared for tourism development. Unfortunately, many villagers give up the conventional way of life. However, modernisation is at the cost of destroying historic buildings and their culture and the activities of tourists contribute to destroying their living environment.<br/>Furthermore, the region is affected by rapid climate change, causing a shortage of water resources, making the situation worse for the villages. Lower rainfall means less water for irrigation, which leads to a decrease in the rice yield, affecting the farmers' income. The gradual disappearance of the paddy fields also means the disappearance of the thousand-year-old terrace culture and landscape. Traditional farming cannot provide villagers with the economic source to survive in modern society. <br/><br/>To reactivate the traditional villages, many things need to be considered: how to make the Yuanyang terraces ecologically sustainable and appropriately introduce modern technology and rural tourism into the farming civilisation and improve villagers' living standards.<br/><br/>The project takes Azheke Village, one of the most intact traditional villages, as an example to illustrate the possibilities of coping with the dilemmas of tradition versus modernisation, the climate crises and increasing tourism by design solutions. The design discusses the economic, ecological, and cultural development of Azheke Village by introducing a research station to experiment with new crops, which might increase the farmers' income. In terms of ecology, the problem of water and energy shortages is solved by building reservoirs and using renewable energy. In terms of culture, landscape elements such as forests, canals, terraces, rivers, buildings, roads, crops, etc., are enhanced to strengthen the landscape narrative potential of the site and emphasise its cultural value. In terms of economy, inhabitants' income could be increased by selling tickets, planting new cash crops, and selling agricultural products. The sustainable ecological environment and unique human landscape could make Azheke Village more competitive in terms of eco-tourism. This design therefore can bring new ecological, social, and economic values to the Azheke Village, which help the villagers to stay and be proud on their landscape.<br","terraced landscape; eco-tourism; heritage landscape; Water management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","","23.10210046341806, 102.82757447321544"

We analyze how different socioeconomic and built environment factors are related to the transport poverty environment for car and public transport in terms of strength, significance, and direction for neighborhood zones within the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area—our study area. Additionally, we provide policy recommendations for the study area.<br/><br/>To this end, we use spatial distributions of environmental transport poverty indicators and perform weighted least-squares regression analyses, where we regress each transport poverty indicator on all built environment and socioeconomic variables. Our regression analyses are preceded by a combination of logarithmic variable transformation, insignificant variable elimination, and data normalization.<br/><br/>The environmental transport poverty indicators consist of average travel times, average single-trip travel costs, and the number of accessible jobs within thirty minutes. Regarding the built environment; we include inhabitant density and job density, whereas the socioeconomic characteristics in our analyses consist of household size, five age cohorts (0-18, 18-34, 35-54, 55-64, and $65^{+}$), gender, car ownership, and income.<br/><br/>Our results indicate that levels of environmental car transport poverty are fairly low over the whole study area when compared to the public transport poverty environment—the highest car transport poverty levels among all zones correspond with the lowest levels of public transport poverty. Regression results demonstrate that differences in the transport poverty environment are substantially correlated with differences in the zonal built environment and socioeconomic characteristics only for public transport travel times and public transport job accessibility, which are also the only transport poverty indicators to exhibit considerable variation among the study area zones in general.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the strength and significance of job density almost invariably greatly exceed those of inhabitant density and the socioeconomic variables—in relation to the transport poverty environment indicators. Inhabitant density is, despite being overshadowed by job density, also deemed to exhibit a marked correlation to the public transport measures of travel time and job accessibility. Both built environment variables are related to favorable transportation conditions. Remarkably, all socioeconomic variables display either insignificant or rather weak correlations to the transport poverty environment.<br/><br/>Consequently, we suggest focusing mainly on public transport measurements of travel times and job accessibility when analyzing differences in the transport poverty environment at a neighborhood level and the roles of job density and (to a lesser extent) inhabitant density herein. We visualize the combined spatial distributions of both job density and average public transport travel times, and inhabitant density and average public transport travel times for our study area. Areas potentially interesting for public transport improvement are identified based on the simultaneous occurrence of both relatively high levels of job or inhabitant density and relatively high travel times.","Transport poverty; Socioeconomic; Built Environment; relationships; Correlation Analysis; Spatial Analysis; Amsterdam Metropolitan Area","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

Armed forces are exempt of these new regulations on the grounds of national security, but some have already started taking steps to reduce the amount of harmful emissions. Due to the high efficiency and advantages that fuel cells present, the aim of this master's thesis is to study their feasibility on board of a naval surface vessel, testing it in a concept design. <br/>This report consists of two main parts. The first part tries to find the most suitable combination of naval surface vessel, type of fuel cell, and type of hydrogen carrier. It is concluded that the types of naval surface vessels that could benefit the most from the use of fuel cells are frigates and mine warfare vessels, in order to reduce their acoustic signatures; and offshore patrol vessels (OPVs), due to their constant base load, because it is a type of ship that is mostly cruising or patrolling. <br/>Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are here considered to be the most promising type of fuel cells for naval surface vessels. This is not only because of their high efficiency, but also due to their ability to internally reform hydrogen carriers, making them more versatile. Other fuels than pure hydrogen can therefore be selected, which leads to the choice of ethanol and methanol as best candidates. The latter has already shown good performance when combined with SOFCs and is largely available worldwide. <br/>Next, in the second part of this report, the concept design of an OPV using SOFCs fuelled by methanol is tested. On a systems level, the integration of SOFCs adds multiple elements and complexity to the power plant of the concept design. Moreover, since the SOFCs are only used to generate the base load needed to reach cruising speed and its auxiliary power, a peak power source is needed to reach higher speeds. After having considered batteries, diesel engines, and methanol engines, it was concluded that methanol engines provide the highest operational flexibility, on top of being the lightest combination. <br/>When comparing the concept design to the reference design, they both score similarly in terms of redundancy and they both fulfil the same design requirements. In terms of operational capabilities, the concept design can sprint for less time due to the difference in efficiency of the power source used to cruise (fuel cells) and to sprint (methanol engines) and does not have the ability to extend its range above the design requirement, opposite to what the reference design can. <br/>The use of a SOFC-based power plant shows a reduction in CO2 emissions between 13-23% depending on the type of mission, a 100% reduction of SOx and PM due to the use of methanol as a fuel, and a reduction of at least 68% in NOx emissions. <br/><br","Fuel cells; SOFC; Solid oxide fuel cell; Methanol; Offshore Patrol Vessel; Concept design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

One solution is to use magnetic positioning, which is based on spatial variations in the patterns of the ambient magnetic field. To model magnetic fields, Gaussian process regression is used, providing predictions of the magnetic field at unvisited locations along with uncertainty quantification. These predictions and their uncertainties are valuable information for probabilistic localization algorithms used for magnetic positioning. Full Gaussian process regression has poor scalability, becoming computationally intractable from roughly 10,000 one-dimensional measurements due to its associated cubic computational complexity. In the existing literature, approximations for Gaussian process regression have been extensively studied to reduce this computational complexity. Of these approximations, only approximations involving basis functions and local experts have been used in the context of scalable magnetic field modeling. A favorable approximation framework from existing literature uses structured kernel interpolation (SKI), allowing for fast regression through efficient Krylov subspace methods. The SKI framework is favorable as it allows for fast regression in low dimensions without introducing boundary effects. In this thesis, the SKI framework is used to approximate two distinct magnetic field models: the shared model, which considers independence between the magnetic field components with shared hyperparameters, and the scalar potential model, which includes physical properties of the magnetic field (Maxwell’s equations) in the model. The scalability of the approach is shown using simulations and experiments with magnetic field measurements. Through the simulations, it is shown the SKI framework accurately and efficiently approximates the models. The applicability of the SKI framework for scalable magnetic field modeling is investigated using data collected using a motion capture suit, the Xsens MVN Link Suit. In the final experiment, a magnetic field map is constructed based on more than 40,000 three-dimensional measurements without splitting the data set, which took less than one minute on a standard laptop.","Magnetic field modeling; Gaussian processes; Structured kernel interpolation; Motion capture suit (Xsens MVN Link Suit)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","A congenital heart defect (CHD) is an anomaly in the structure of the heart that is present at birth. In the last 15 years, a CHD is present in 9 per 1,000 live births, making it the most prevalent birth defect (Linde et al., 2011). <br/>CHD’s prevalence coupled with its inherent complexity culminates into situations that are both complicated and unique. This makes the treatment of patients with CHDs highly patient-specific. Patient-specific physics-based computational models can aid in selecting the optimal course of treatment for the patient and serve as a predictive tool for different surgical plans (Capelli et al., 2011). The creation of patient-specific geometric heart models of children with CHDs will be the first crucial step towards a patient-specific approach in ameliorating this challenge. Approaches have to be found to face challenges including: a lack of high quality imaging data of the target population; slice misalignment due to breathing in a breath-hold procedure; and a lack of protocols in image segmentation. <br/><br/>To accomplish the objective, seven biventricular geometric models and meshes are created for healthy hearts, tetralogy of Fallot hearts and Fontan hearts. Slice misalignment is corrected using contours of the papillary muscle and the epicardium as a reference. Lastly, ground truth geometries are constructed by stacking disks that originate directly from the MRI segmentation. <br/>To validate the geometric models, global and local approaches are used. The global validation includes ventricular mass and volume analyses with a relative error (RE) ranging from 0.00036 to 0.79. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for the local validation is between 0.711 +/- 0.138 and 0.968 +/- 0.018. The slice misalignment correction is validated using qualitative and quantitative measures. A quantitative measure is the 4-chamber long-axis local validation which has a DSC of 0.877 for the epicardium and 0.916 for the papillary muscle correction method. Global validation in the ground truth exercise has a mean RE of 0.010 +/- 0.0066. Results of the local validation show a minimum DSC of 0.960 +/- 0.008. <br/><br/>Large differences in RE can be explained by the small number of MRI slices available, segmentation variability, the complex geometry of the right ventricle, and the methods of volume and mass computations. The DSC computed in the local validation of the models shows good to excellent agreement for all models. According to the long-axis local validation, the papillary muscle is the best reference method proposed for the slice misalignment correction. The ground truth exercise reveals close correlation to the Medis Suite measurements, possibly leading to underestimation of the computed volumes. <br/><br/>Patient-specific biventricular geometric models are created and validated in this thesis. The models are representative of a range of patients including healthy hearts and hearts with complex CHDs. A patient-specific model of the heart would be beneficial for clinicians to understand complex pathological cases, as the ones described in this work. Herein, a patient-specific biventricular geometric model is presented. By including a healthy population as well as patients affected by complex congenital heart defects, this work can be used as a starting point for the development of more patient-specific computational models of the heart.<br","congenital heart disease; Morphing; patient-specific","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-01","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The finger is modeled using a Finite Element Analysis, whereby strain data at the two sensor locations is gathered for a set of different contact locations. Now, by matching the measured data to a modeled scenario, both the actual contact location in this scenario and the accompanying contact force can be determined.

Comparing the force-deformation behavior of the original and the embedded finger, a maximum difference of 6% in actuation force was observed.

The current focal laser ablation approach is to insert an optical fiber into the patient using rigid needles. A side effect of this approach is that during the needle insertion, tissue damage occurs. The larger the diameter of the needle, the more tissue damage. If the diameter of a rigid needle is reduced, the risk increases that buckling occurs during insertion. Buckling can result in tissue damage due to unwanted movements of the needle tip. By using wasp-inspired, self-propelling needles, the size of the needles can be reduced, thereby reducing tissue damage, while preventing needle buckling. The needle can advance through tissue with no net insertion force by moving parallel needle segments in a specific order. In this work, we present the design and evaluation of an MRI-compatible, pneumatic actuation unit for such a self-propelling needle. A prototype was created that was, except for the screws that were used, fully 3D printed with MRI-compatible materials. Guidelines were formed on how to approach such a 3D-printing process. The screws were also made of an MRI-compatible material. The prototype has the option to change the distance that the needle segments travel each cycle, called the stroke. By using a control unit for the air supply of the prototype, the needle segments were moved automatically. The needle consists of six needle segments with a diameter of 0.25 mm. We tested the performance of the prototype in 10 wt\% gelatin tissue phantoms in terms of the slip ratio of the needle with respect to gelatin tissue phantoms. The results showed that the prototype was functional for small strokes (i.e., 2 mm and 4 mm), as the needle was able to advance through 10 wt\% gelatin tissue phantoms using the self-propelling mechanism with a mean slip ratio of 0.912-0.955. The prototype is the next step in developing self-propelling needles suitable for focal laser ablation to treat tumors.","additive manufacturing; pneumatic actuator; medical needle; magnetic resonance imaging; biologically inspired design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-19","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Engineering | BioInspired Technology","",""

(mentor); Ragno, E. (mentor); Caires, Sofia (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Understanding the factors that drive extreme water levels is key to an accurate assessment of flood hazard. The city of Venice has always been affected by flooding due to extreme water levels. In this study, we examine the factors driving and influencing extreme water levels in the Venice lagoon, aiming at deriving accurate extreme water level estimates in the Venice lagoon. <br/>Due to the shallowness of the Venice lagoon, extreme water levels are influenced by both atmospheric forcing (surge) and water level of the lagoon (tide and bottom level) and interactions between these two. Furthermore, these extreme water levels have been changing over time due to variations in the bottom level. These variations are reportedly due to local (anthropogenic and natural) subsidence and sea level rise. In this study we resort to the available long-term water level observations of the Punta della Salute tide-gauge. Given the effects of subsidence and sea level rise in these data, we start by homogenizing the data by removing these trends and jumps from the time-series. Using the homogenized time-series, we study the influence of the dependence between tide and surge components on the extreme water level estimates. Finally, we quantify the effect in the estimates of modelling this dependence in the extreme value models.<br/>To homogenize the data and better understand the underlying trends, a time-series analysis was performed on the time-series of water level observations. Mann-Kendall tests for monotonic trend were performed, followed by an analysis using changepoint detection methods. Changepoint detection was performed using the RHtest and BEAST methods on the Punta della Salute time-series as well as time-series from neighbouring tide-gauge stations. Ultimately trend decomposition using the BEAST method was used to detrend and homogenize the Punta della Salute time-series.<br/>After detrending, the tide and surge components were separated using tidal harmonic analysis and reconstruction. The relationship of these now separated components was quantified during extreme water levels using the Pearson r correlation and the Kendall τ rank correlation. This relationship between tide and surge was described using copulas to estimate extreme water levels. Different copula variants were evaluated and extreme water level estimates derived using copulas that describe dependence were compared to extreme water level estimates using a copula that describes tide and surge as independent components. Lastly, these were compared to those derived from univariate extreme value analysis to assess the influence of separation of tide and surge components combined with copulas as opposed to a more traditional univariate extreme value analysis.<br/>The main conclusions of this study are as follows.<br/>• The water level observations of the Punta della Salute tide-gauge are indeed affected by jumps and trends due to subsidence and sea level rise. These can be successfully removed using the applied techniques.<br/>• There is a clear dependence between tide and surge in the Venice lagoon, with lower tide levels leading to higher surge levels. The non-inclusion of this dependence (by assuming independence) in the combined analysis of tide and surge signals to drive total extreme water levels leads to an overestimation of the total water level extremes.<br/>• Extreme water level estimates from the combined analysis of the tidal and surge signal are higher, but compatible with those from the analysis of the total water level signal (without separation of tidal and surge signal). This gives confidence in the combined analysis accounting for the dependence between the signals and allowing for a further application of the models to account for projected climate changes.<br","copula; Venice; lagoon; shallow water; tide-surge interactions; dependency; non-linear interactions; extreme value analysis; multivariate; univariate; combined analysis; tide surge interaction; Changepoint analysis; BEAST; RHtest; Trend analysis; Trend decomposition; Vertical land motion; Bivariate analysis; Gaussian Copula; Peak-over-threshold; POT; Generalized Pareto Distribution; Generalized Extreme Value Distribution; time-series; tide-gauge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Most of these quay walls consist out of masonry gravity walls placed on wooden relieving floors and wooden foundation piles. Due to the changing surface loading conditions behind the wall and the degradation of the masonry and wooden structures over the last century, the safety of the quay walls is in critical condition. Insight into the behaviour of the masonry wall tilt and its relationship with several failure mechanisms is still limited. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to provide this insight into the behaviour of the tilt approaching failure in the center of Amsterdam. Additionally, the use of monitoring data from SmartBrick devices is analyzed to assess the value of quay wall inclination monitoring.<br/><br/>Using PLAXIS 2D, quay wall models are made aimed to create a sensitivity analysis towards the wall tilt using multiple variations in quay structure dimensions and parameters. These variations investigate the wall height, wall thickness, floor length (and the amount of pile rows), the canal depth and the pile diameters based on a typical Amsterdam soil profile. For the tested geometry variations, there is a linear relationship seen between the wall tilt and the horizontal wall displacement towards the canal, during the addition of the surcharge load behind the wall. The relationship between the wall tilt and the surcharge load is predominately linear at lower/realistic surface loads, at higher loads, towards failure, the wall tilt becomes exponentially larger, this is also seen by setting the varied dimensions towards failure scenarios. The most sensitive variations for inclination are the change in the masonry wall height and thickness, the pile distribution underneath the floor and the addition of a surcharge load directly behind the masonry wall.<br/><br/>The failure mechanism describing the horizontal displacement of the masonry wall and the piles is recognized by increasing the height of the masonry wall and by decreasing the pile diameters (pile degradation). By increasing the wall height, the quay structure also settles vertically, which in combination with the horizontal displacement, initiates wall tilt. During the addition of the surcharge load, the crossbeam (kesp) and the piles can deform, and their bending moments can exceed their bending capacity, indicating another failure mechanism with initiates wall tilt. The failure mechanism describing rotation of the masonry wall on the floor towards the canal is activated by decreasing the wall thickness and therefore decreasing its lateral capacity. This causes the masonry wall to fall over. Damage to the foundation elements has an important impact on the tilt of the wall, due extensive axial displacements of the front pile row or cracks in the masonry wall.<br/><br/>To compare the SmartBrick inclination and PLAXIS inclination, it is important to know the exact degradation, erosion and loading conditions during the time between two SmartBrick measurements. The linear relation between the wall inclination and the wall displacement is useful for SmartBrick because it shows that monitoring the inclination also predicts the wall displacement and the state of the quay wall. Pile degradation and canal erosion only give a small wall tilt increase, but a larger increase in horizontal displacement of the wall is seen. Therefore, high measuring accuracy and resolution are necessary to monitor only the wall tilt. <br/><br/>To conclude, approaching quay wall failure shows that wall tilt in combination with horizontal displacement is expected, this behaviour can be monitored using SmartBrick. High wall tilt is often a first consequence of the exceedance of the bending capacities in the wooden elements.","PLAXIS 2D; Monitoring; Amsterdam; Quay walls; Sensitivity analysis; SmartBrick; Inclination; Geotechnical Engineering; Hydraulic Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","","52.375617, 4.890267"

The finite element method is a costly method from a runtime standpoint. Moreover, both multibody dynamics and finite element methods require approximating the geometry of the application either by meshing or by analytical surfaces. Therefore, IsoGeometric Analysis (IGA) has been proposed as an alternate method for parameterizing geometric surfaces. IGA enables a uni- fied mathematical representation of both geometries and solution fields using B-Splines or NURBS. NURBS are the de-facto standard in modern Computer-Aided Design (CAD) workflows, but their use for analysis in finite elements is rare. By directly using the geometric information for the analysis, IGA reduces the cost of mesh generation, therefore enabling a more efficient design process.<br/>The IGA-based rigid body contact algorithm offers several advantages over the traditional FEM- based approach. First, it provides an accurate representation of the geometry. This improves the efficiency of the design process and reduces the need for mesh refinement. Second, by looking for the local orthogonal projection in the parameter space rather than the coordinate space, the algorithm simplifies the definition of boundary conditions. This makes the process of defining boundary conditions easier and more intuitive. Third, the algorithm approximates the contact area by mapping it from the parameter space to the physical space. This allows for the specification of the level of accuracy of the contact area, which can permit more precise solutions.<br/>The paper compares the IGA-based rigid body contact algorithm with the existing rigid FE mesh- based contact method in Simcenter Madymo. The results show that for the same level of accuracy, the IGA-based method can largely reduce execution time. This suggests that IGA could be a valuable alternative for use in the field of contact simulation.<br","isogeometric analysis; Contact Method; Simcenter Madymo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

To reach this goal, cost estimation is a key process which can be divided into the estimation of direct and indirect costs. Unlike direct costs, indirect costs are not directly connected with the performance of any particular element of a project which makes proper allocation of these costs a challenging issue. Although the classification in the ABK model (2018) provides clarity regarding the content of the indirect cost items, estimation of these costs (ABK) and especially the tasks for quantity take-off (QTO) were identified as time-consuming and lacking standardised guidelines and procedures. <br/>At the same time, Building Information Models (BIM), which are increasingly used, offer an effective platform for linking data regarding construction costs. The fifth dimension of BIM in particular adds cost information to the 3D construction model. Full interoperability between the various information models is still a goal that has not been reached yet within the construction sector. Recent studies have examined inefficiencies caused by inadequate interoperability, like manual re-entry of data and duplication of tasks. <br/>This research aims to positively contribute to the efficiency of the indirect cost estimation process by developing a 5D computer-based tool. The development of the tool was based on literature review and interviews with practitioners. Features of BIM applications were used and linked to the outcome of the indirect cost estimate.

For instance, by using eye-gaze tracking in order to adapt the VR scenario based on what the user is looking at. The measures of the ownership and plausibility of virtual cognitions were found to be important in previous research. The research described in this thesis has incorporated a social aspect into a gaze-adaptive VR system with virtual cognitions. A system was designed which puts the user in a social VR scenario where a dialogue between 3 virtual characters is shown. The user watches and listens from the perspective of one of the 3 characters. An experiment was carried out over consecutive days, where each day a new social scenario would be used. The scenario of that day would be shown twice. Once being gazeadaptive, and once non-adaptive. After each of the 2 viewings of the VR scenario, the participants would fill in a questionnaire to measure ownership and plausibility. The results did not show a significant difference between the gaze-adaptive and non-adaptive scenarios on ownership and plausibility. The eye-gaze is determined by using special VR-goggles, with built-in cameras, capable of measuring eye-gaze.","Virtual reality; Virtual cognitions; Eye-tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

This paper presents Collaborative Gym, an open-source, physics-based simulation framework for multi-robot interaction. This simulation environment differs from existing robotic simulation environments in that it is designed to model the interaction between multiple robots. Despite the presence of a large number of single robotic environments, multi-robotic simulation environments for reinforcement learning are rare. Collaborative Gym contains four simulated tasks in which different commercial robots work in collaboration: poking, lifting, balancing, and passing. For each of the four tasks, baseline policies are presented for various combinations of commercial robots which have been trained using reinforcement learning. The study demonstrated that Collaborative Gym is a promising open-source framework for the development of multi-robotic collaborative robotic tasks.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/gabriansa/collaborative-gym","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

(mentor); van de Voort, J.A. (graduation committee); de Wit, S.I. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","In July 2021, heavy floods hit the Dutch province Limburg after days of rainfall in south-west Germany, the Ardennes and southern Limburg. Rivers like the Geul, the Roer and the Maas couldn’t discharge the large amounts of water. Many parts of these regions flooded, and approximately 50.000 people have been evacuated from their homes (Task Force Fact Finding hoogwater 2021, 2021, pp. 8 - 10).<br/>How safe residents feel in the river landscape is affected by the floods. The sense of safety people get from the landscape depends on how they perceive that landscape and how they perceive their safety in it. How landscape and safety are perceived relates to the relationship residents have with their landscape. Due to centralized supervision, local communities are increasingly cut-off from their water system, and they are changing from active workers to passive users. Ultimately, their knowledge of the water systems is forgotten. Another aspect of perceiving a sense of safety is related to the Dutch water management strategies. Optimizing and directing water has dominated the Dutch attitude. Engineering strategies including dikes, storm surge barriers and regulated polders are dominant in the Dutch landscape (Metz &amp; Van den Heuvel, 2012, p. 281). With these strategies, the Dutch have outsourced their water safety to engineers and water boards. As water safety is primarily the concern of professionals, people themselves are decreasingly aware of their dependence on these defence systems, and simply perceive dikes and other defence systems as objects in the landscape (Metz &amp; Van den Heuvel, 2012, p. 79).<br/>As a result of this strategy, the relationship between humans and river has become a rigid one. Humans dominate water by force, pushing it away hard as possible. However, because of the changing climate water is now pushing back, which resulted in the floods of 2021. Changing how we relate to rivers, and water in general, can help to establish a new spatial relationship that is not based on dominance but rather on equality. <br/>In light of the recent floods in Limburg, this graduation project deals with the question of perceiving a sense of safety in river landscapes. The research project deals with the leading question “What is the role of architecture in perceiving a sense of safety in Dutch river landscapes?”. Central in this project is a cycling trip from Delft to Maastricht, including research methods like interviewing, immersive analysis, sketching and annotating. <br/>The design project deals with a public building that provides a safe evacuation centre in times of high water, while in the everyday functioning it expresses its position in the water landscape and in turn provides a lens on the water conditions in this landscape. Chapter 8 elaborates on the resulting design project, in which a permanent platform provides the base for a temporary evacuation centre. Together with other design objects (a hiking trail, a bridge, water basins) the project addresses river dynamics and flood dangers in Valkenburg aan de Geul, in Limburg.","Architecture; Landscape; Rivers; Floods; safety; Maas; Geul; Valkenburg; Evacuation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","",""

It has been a developing idea, frequently receiving attention from society, governmental agendas, and the innovative field (Tamak,2017). Organisations are now rapidly taking steps towards incorporating sustainability in their activities and projects. However, even though there are guiding principles mentioned in the literature, practice reveals that organisations still have trouble in the long-term implementation of sustainability in projects (Kammerl et al., 2017; Stewart et al., 2016). One of the most difficult challenges TSOs (Transmission Grid operators) face in successfully integrating sustainable requirements in projects is translating high-level sustainability goals into quantifiable and measurable sustainability aspects.The main aim of this research is to develop a framework for managing sustainability requirements in TSO projects. The objective of the research is to successfully reduce the gap present in managing sustainability requirements in TSO projects.This research is divided into three phases. Phase one is literature review, where an in-depth study regarding sustainability requirements from the context of TSO, organisations and projects was done. Phase two is emiprical research done through semi-structured interviews. This phase contributed towards understanding the current situation of sustainability requirement in TSO's projects as well as the uncertainties found. This is followed by phase three, which develops the framework. The sustainability requirements management framework is a goal oriented process and aims in translating ambitions into actions. The practicability of the framework is at the program level only, as this framework aims in aligning project sustainability requirements with the strategic ambitions, resulting in better sustainable performance. The framework also assists in understanding the benefits sustainability requirements gives when implemented well in the project. <br","Sustainability; Requirements Management; Uncertainties; Framework; TSO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

However, there were villages in the area that developed informally alongside the formal city. These villages present several problems such as inadequate housing, identity loss, lack of infrastructure, lack of public space, overcrowding and crammed streets. There are two possible outcomes for these villages, their eradication to make way for the formal city or their existence in limbo as leftover space. The project aims to break through this dichotomy and an urbanisation strategy is developed for the remaining villages in the city that anticipate informal development. The project focuses on Moha Koliwada, a fishing village that is inhabited by members of the Koli people. An urban plan is developed first to provide the community with the necessary infrastructure to urbanise in a healthy manner. Three housing typologies are designed to serve different purposes: to ensure the important access to the sea, to maintain village life and to increase the density of the village. The housing typologies are inspired from Indian modernism and more specifically low rise - high density projects. The aim is to allow these villages to connect with and contribute to the formal planned city while maintaining their distinct village character. The project attempts to show how these villages can provide housing for the urban poor in a better and more humane manner than the mass housing schemes developed by the authorities and more specifically CIDCO (City and Industrial Development Corporation). The mass housing schemes are problematic as we are historically aware in the West, they don’t reach the poorest inhabitants in India and they unfortunately become an aspiration for many residents of informal settlements. Finally, guidelines regarding urban planning, stakeholders and housing typologies are developed for the urbanisation of other villages in Navi Mumbai.","Urban villages; Navi Mumbai; Informal settlements; Mass housing; Densification; Formal city; Village life; Indian modernism; High density; Low rise","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Global Housing","Global Housing: Mixing Navi Mumbai","18.989041738492592, 73.03130917727309"

Often, participation is characterised by intransparency, poor communication and distrust. It is a loss seen the potential positive effects of influential civil participation that could help us overcome problems regarding the increasing complexity of cities. Enabling the potential and making citizen participation a valuable asset demands the extra step; full facilitation. <br/><br/>The research’s aim is to understand how participation needs to be facilitated to make it worthwhile. Therefore, the following research question is formulated: How can Rotterdam facilitate and structure co-creation in the built environment in an inclusive, supportive, human-oriented and meaningful way? Although the outcome of this research reaches beyond Rotterdam, will Rotterdam be used as research subject. <br/><br/>To answer this research question, current context and good practices are analysed. Additionally, a real-life street experiment in the Old North of Rotterdam has been conducted. The context analyses consist of the current approach of Rotterdam in facilitating participation in the city, interviews about participation with urban and architectural firms in Rotterdam, and current programmes and strategies. Relevant good practices outside of Rotterdam are analysed for valuable lessons and used as input for the design. The experiment consists of the regeneration of a street, in which the process and co-creation were vital elements. The outcome of this research consists of recommendations and a design proposal. The main recommendation for Rotterdam is to communicate more about the process and the assessment of proposals. The design proposes a next step in the appropriation of public space by residents. This appropriation is guided by design coaches connected to the municipality. Currently available, as well as newly created space, is used to demonstrate the strategic design proposal. <br/><br/>Conclusion; facilitating participation in urban developments is strongly connected to actively guiding and initiating processes, good communication and transparency. For the design; to keep it tangible and make people take ownership of their surroundings, process scales should not be larger than the scale of the neighbourhood. Integrating participation into society needs to be done step by step but with complete commitment. Participation is not about saving money, but rather a new way of approaching design processes. <br/><br/>One of the main dilemmas in participation remains not being able to attract unusual suspects. The personal door-to-door approach connected people to the process, but not as active participants. Analysing digital tools will be interesting for follow-up research in this regard.

The spatial and ecological challenges resulting from population growth and the resulting urban growth, as well as climate change, are becoming increasingly urgent. To densify already urban areas, municipalities are transforming more and more inner-city port areas, which as a result of the relocation of the port to the North Sea are increasingly becoming available. However, this trend presents increasingly apparent challenges as these areas are outside of dike protection and exposed to natural influences (Breś &amp; Krosnicka, 2021). On the one hand, they offer the opportunity for housing, which is urgently needed in Rotterdam, but on the other hand are highly vulnerable due to the enhanced risk of flooding resulting from sea-level rise and higher river discharge.  <br/>The research project ""Accepting the current(s) - A porous approach for the revitalization of a former port area in the Rhine-Meuse Delta"" explores a new nature-based approach for these areas. The resulting design aims to combine the natural and urban processes in an adaptive and urban tidal landscape, working with and benefiting from the natural processes of the Nieuwe Maas and the Delta. It seeks to balance the various entities by enhancing the natural environment in the urban delta.<br/>The permeable approach enables the provision of a collaborative zones for different flows and connections. This facilitates a transition from water to land and from port to city, where people, resources and ideas can move smoothly (Höller, 2021). Leading to better exploitation of potential and a better activation and integration of the previously segregated outer dike areas into the urban context. An adaptive hotspot is created within the dynamic landscape that is continuously evolving and able to accommodate future changes. In addition, the creation of tidal habitats provides an important natural habitat for different species of animals and plants that have been displaced by the previous water management of the region, thus creating a place of migration. For both humans and animals.<br/>The work includes a design catalog for the creation of an urban tidal landscape to show decision-makers the various options available to create an adaptive wetland neighborhood. It allows the project to be more comprehensible and regionally transferable. In the end the suggested design strategies are applied to the study area of the waterfront of Nieuw Mathenesse/Merwe-Vierhavens to give a more specific outlook and to better demonstrate the potentials the design is intended to offer.","Porosity; Nature based flood defence; Ecosystem Services; Delta Urbanism; Tidal Park; Adaptive capacity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","51.909343, 4.417329"

Compared to a state-of-the-art DRL solution, SERL achieves better tracking performance in nine out of ten cases, remaining robust against faults, changes in initial conditions and external disturbances. Furthermore, the work shows how evolutionary mechanisms can balance performance with the smoothness of control actions, a feature relevant for bridging the gap between simulation and deployment on real flight hardware.","Fault-tolerant Flight Control; Deep Reinforcement Learning; Evolutionary Algorithms; Control Policy Smoothness; Intelligent Flight Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/VladGavra98/SERL Repository link Link to publicly available GitHub repository.","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The climate crisis and unsustainable growth are worldwide interrelated problems. Population growth increases the demand for natural resources and the demand for housing. This is all putting pressure on the natural system and is strengthening the conflict of space between the built environment, agricultural land and the natural landscape. Drylands are expected to expand due to climate change and human activities. As the natural resources are already scarce in these regions, human societies who live there are challenged even more by population growth. Including the future generations. The conflict of space deteriorates the quality of life and space in these regions. To counteract this development, measures must be taken now. <br/><br/>This research proposal searches for an integral approach to sustainably address population growth and urbanisation in arid regions. This is done via a case study of the Moroccan new town Tamansourt. Tamansourt is one of the nineteen Moroccan new cities developed via the state-led national-scale Villes Nouvelles strategy. Tamansourt, Marrakech’s satellite city, is the first new town under this strategy, it is founded in 2004. The spatial analysis, site visit, and interviews conducted in this research show that the city of Tamansourt is still under construction. The city has not reached its target population nor its desired level of urban activity yet. However, environmental issues already manifest themselves in the city, which resulted in the national government’s aim to transform Tamansourt into an ecocity.<br/><br/>In the Urban Arid Green project, the vision Tamansourt Ecocity 2040: Regreen to Rewild is formulated. This is a proposal to advance on a transformative framework for Tamansourt towards an ecocity. This could help Tamansourt to reach its original goals, respond to current injustices and face the environmental crises at the same time. <br/><br/>To transition Tamansourt into an ecocity, systemic change is needed. The environment must be harnessed. The now degraded soil quality must be restored. This environmental change can be sparked by making optimal use of the limited amount of water. By educating, training and employing the local community, the ecocity can be co-created, using bottom-up initiatives and top-down support. <br/><br/>To support this systemic change, a common language among all future stakeholders is needed. This common language is developed as a set of urban development guidelines, patterns. This is a brief visual overview of all measures included in the systemic change, vision, and design of Tamansourt Ecocity 2040. The patterns focus on the biosphere and add to the original design guidelines for Moroccan new towns, which were developed by Al Omrane in 2010. Together, they form the Urban Arid Green pattern language which aims to sustainably address population growth and urbanisation in the arid region. <br/><br/>In the Urban Arid Green project, the case of Tamansourt is used to show how to translate these generic patterns and ecocity principles into a unique site-specific design. Design proposals on the neighbourhood scale are made for several key locations in the Tamansourt Ecocity 2040 vision. The design aims to formulate a framework for the stakeholders to use in the city’s transition towards an ecocity. This framework aims for a triple scope of better services, amenities, and connections on one hand and to counteract environmental decay and climate change variability on the other. Via an adaptive pathway approach, the process can adapt to future uncertainties, while learning from the past. This approach allows different scenarios to reach the Tamansourt Ecocity 2040 goal. <br/><br/>The process of applying these patterns to the Tamansourt Ecocity 2040 project was one of constantly adjusting, designing, and testing. By testing the method in Tamansourt, other arid landscapes that need to sustainably address population growth and urbanisation, can learn from this, and use it as a tool to communicate with all different stakeholders involved. Every landscape might need to add its own site-specific pathway to the pattern language. By this, the Urban Arid Green Language allows unique dialects for different landscapes.<br/><br/>Tamansourt sets the example to other urban arid areas, being the first new town ecocity, focused on a regenerative productive urban landscape.","(Un)sustainable growth; Aridity; Natural resources; New towns; Spatial quality; co-creation; Ecocities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","",""

Obstacle avoidance is important, but difficult for robots with limited resources, such as drones. Stereo vision requires less weight and power than active distance measurement sensors, but typically has a limited Field of View (FoV). In addition, the stereo camera is fixed on the drone, preventing sensor movement. For obstacle avoidance, bug algorithms require few resources. We base our proposed algorithm, Frustumbug, on the Wedgebug algorithm, since this bug algorithm copes with a limited FoV. Since Wedgebug only focuses on 2D problems, the Local-epsilon-Tangent-Graph (LETG) is used to extend the path planning to 3D. Disparity images are obtained through an optimised stereo block matching algorithm. Obstacles are expanded in disparity space to obtain the configuration space. Furthermore, Frustumbug has an improved robustness to noisy range sensor data, and includes reversing, climbing and descending manoeuvres to avoid or escape local minima. The algorithm has been extensively tested with 225 flights in two challenging simulated environments, with a success rate of 96%. Here, 3.6% did not reach the goal and 0.4% collided. Frustumbug has been implemented on a 20 gram stereo vision system, and guides drones safely around obstacles in the real world, showing its potential for small drones to reach their targets fully autonomously.","Stereo vision; obstacle avoidance; Drones","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

As a result, organizations were forced to adapt and implement remote working. These implications became the norm for close to two years. Consequently, the needs and preferences of employees and employers have changed indefinitely. Employees displayed a positive experience with remote working, which has left organizations questioning whether their current real estate aligns with the desired workplace strategy. Many CEOs during the pandemic said they would cut down their office space by 69%. A year later, this has already changed to 21%. However, 51% of those CEOs also said they would invest in collaborative space. The majority of media and research directs its focus on large corporates and leading commercial landlords. Consequently, there is more uncertainty about the role of the future physical office for middle-smaller organizations (SMEs). SMEs make up 67% of the Dutch workforce and are essential for the Dutch economy. Despite their importance, SMEs have remained understudied in the ongoing experiences of the pandemic. Moreover, SME resource constraints likely limit the support for their future workplace transition. Creating a workplace that supports the organization thoroughly is a complex process. Therefore, this study aims to research how organizational components are used by Dutch SMEs transitioning to a hybrid workplace strategy.<br/>Preliminary interviews and literature provided insight into the propositions in each organizational component on how Dutch SMEs are transitioning to form a proposition. This help structure the basis for which next, a holistic multi-case analysis was used to examine the SME in each organizational component in a hybrid workplace strategy. Lastly, a proposition performance analysis to understand how each component performed.<br/>The research findings provided insight into SMEs' adoption of organization components in their hybrid strategy. The main motivator for SMEs to keep using a hybrid workplace strategy is to support the employee's desire. Employers are hesitant to provide complete flexibility and remain involved to ensure that their employees continue to use the office as their primary workstation. In addition, employers seem worried about losing their organizational sense of belonging and desire more collaboration. Furthermore, SMEs focus their resources in either their conventional office or in the home office. Very realized thoroughly included both locations.<br/>To ensure SMEs implement a successful hybrid workplace strategy and utilize their input resources as much as possible, SMEs need to prioritize an employee-orientated approach in each organizational component. Furthermore, adequate physical resources are essential in both the conventional office and the home workplace. While the physical environment is critical, focusing on the behavioral environment will most impact people's productivity.","Hybrid strategy; workplace strategy; alignment; corporate real estate management; organization change; workplace change; added value","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

The effects of environmental certification on office rents have received considerable attention in the last decade and there is now much evidence supporting the hypothesis that environmentally certified office buildings achieve higher rents over conventional office buildings. Although much attention has been paid to the United States office market, less attention was spent on the European and specifically the Dutch real estate market. The aim of this thesis is to examine the relationship between environmental certification and market value within the Dutch office market and therefore answers the following question: How does environmental certification influence market value within the dynamics of the Dutch office market? Empirical evidence shows that BREEAM-NL certified office buildings hold an average rental premium of 10.30% over non-certified offices. Furthermore, the rental premium in the G5 varies between 5.13% and 12.64%. The results indicate that the rental premium is positively correlated with the label score and show rental premiums of 10.19%, 6.18% and 14.34% for respectively BREEAM-NL Good, Very Good and Excellent. The results do not show significant occupancy premiums for BREEAM-NL certified offices. This practical evidence on the willingness to pay from the Dutch occupier market intends to bring clarification in the public debate and helps owners and investors in their decision-making around environmental certified investments in their building assets.","green premium; rent premium; green buildings; real estate economics; BREEAM; hedonic price model; vicious circle of blame; office market rents; empirical analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Through the cultivation of giant kelp on offshore farms, they create several sustainable products, new job opportunities in regions where they are needed, enhance biodiversity in the water, and above all, sequester tons of CO2 from the air. The start-up is still in its research and development phase, but plans to be building farms on a large scale in just a few years. Despite their knowledge in engineering, the company still needs consulting on certain elements. Therefore the company invited a group of students from the Delft University of Technology to Lüderitz, Namibia for a consultancy project. The project involved creating a procedure for the company to scale up in a sustainable manner. The students decided that this complex problem should be divided into sub-problems. One workstream focused on reducing the carbon emissions during upscaling, while the other workstream focused on analyzing and improving the company’s current design and installation of the farms. Following, both parts of the project are shortly summarized: Part I: Improving the company’s current design Kelp Blue is currently in the pilot phase, in which they’re installing their first large giant kelp farms. Before, they were focusing on the complete installation, including planting the kelp on the submerged netting structure, and the review of this. For the company’s commercial phase, where they want to be able to place farms daily on a large scale, designs were still developed and analyzed. For the commercial phase, this workstream made a new design and installation method. It required an installation where buoys would need to be submerged, the structure locked in place at the desired depth, without the use of scuba divers or remote operated vehicles. Despite the fact that these requirements were challenging, an outstanding result was achieved. The main problem was divided into subproblems, and for each of those a suitable solution was created. Hopes are that the company will consider the given advice as helpful and maybe implement some parts of (or the whole) new design. Part II: Reducing carbon emissions during upscaling First, interviews and desk research were conducted to get a good idea of the challenge of sustainability. This included reading reports, speaking with employees, policy makers and experts with experience within the area. With this information, the challenge could be mapped out and the solution space became clear in terms of legislation and technical possibilities. Climate information was also requested that could later be used to run simulations. During the determination of the possible solutions, research was done on the realistic possibilities, where eventually the use of either solar or wind energy was most appropriate. After conducting a multi-criteria analysis that was put together with the management of Kelp Blue, investing in a solar plant proved to be the most appropriate solution.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","Multidiciplinairy project",""

Therefore, deep learning (DL) techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can support collecting meta data about PV systems from aerial or satellite images, as research in the field of remote sensing has shown.

In this thesis we compare several methods for calculating this EAD. Basel III gives us two methods, the Standardized Approach for CCR (SA-CCR) and the Internal Model Method (IMM). Furthermore, we introduce an integrated benchmark model, whereby we estimate the EAD by integrating the Wrong Way Risk (WWR) directly, while in SA-CCR and IMM this WWR is captured by an alpha factor of 1.4. In this benchmark model, we derive the formula for backing out the probability of default using CDSs and then, via a Gaussian copula, we include a correlation between the exposures and default probability to model the WWR. The ultimate goal of this thesis is to find out how conservative the SA-CCR is compared to the IMM and the integrated benchmark model, and if the alpha factor of 1.4 is a reasonable value to account for WWR.<br/><br/>The test portfolios consist of interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and FX forwards, which are the most liquid product types in the market. To value these products we model the interest rate using the Hull-White model and the exchange rate using a GBM, following industry standard.<br/><br/>Testing results suggest that the SA-CCR is at least a factor of 1.5 more conservative than the IMM in the presence of collateral, even with stressed parameters. The level of conservatism is even higher because no diversification is allowed between different asset classes by SA-CCR. Furthermore, we observe that using the parameters backed out from calibration and a default correlation of about 30 to 40\%, our integrated benchmark model based on copula returns more or less comparable EADs of IMM times the alpha factor of 1.4. This indicates that this value of 1.4 is a reasonable value to cover WWR in the IMM framework.","Counterparty Credit Risk; wrong way risk; Exposure at Default; collateral; credit default swap; Hull-White model; Geometric Brownian Motion; Monte Carlo simulation; Gaussian Copula","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(mentor); Muraro, S. (graduation committee); Gijón Mancheño, A. (graduation committee); van der Krogt, Mark (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Mangroves can provide coastal protection by attenuating waves, currents, and trapping sediment (Menéndez et al., 2020; Bao, 2011). The effect of mangroves on the hydrodynamics depends on their size, location, density, distribution and morphology of the vegetation (Mendez and Losada, 2004). Mangrove loss during storm events will therefore impact the coastal protection. The soil-root interaction and influences of soil properties in the resistance of a mangrove tree against failure is neglected in most studies of flood protection by mangroves, due to a lack in understading. <br/><br/>This thesis improves the understanding of the soil-root interaction by deriving the schematization for multiple failure mechanisms in comparison with field observations. Firstly, the wind and wave forces are modelled to determine the different loads in the forest. Secondly, a novel schematization was developed of different failure mechanisms considering the soil properties and root system. All results are developed for a case study of a fringe forest in Demak, existing of Avicennia marina rooted in a silty, saturated soil. To be able to determine the difference between the seaward and landward edge of the forest, the width of the forest is increased to 500 meter. Also, due to a lack of information on the mechanical strength of Avicennia m., the mechanical properties of Rhizophora m. are used, which will overestimate the resistance due to the higher wood density of Rhizophora m. (Manguriu et al., 2013).<br/><br/>The results show that the drag forces were largely influenced by the tree architecture (such as vegetation width and height), forest density and inundation of the tree. Larger wind and wave forces, and therefore a larger moment occured if the width of the vegetation increased. If the height of the tree increases, a smaller part of the canopy is submerged. This leads to a decreased area that is exposed to waves and therefore a declined wave force. A higher tree does enlarge the area subjected to wind forces, resulting in an increased total moment. Overall, the 2.8-meter tree analysed in this thesis experienced the largest horizontal forces and moment at the seaward edge of the forest due to the relatively large water depth at this location. Furthermore, the maximum horizontal force and moment shift to the landward edge for larger trees due to the increase of wind contribution. To investigate the stability under these loads, the different failure mechanisms need to be inspected. <br/><br/>The failure mechanisms of root breakage and slippage are not important because of the high safety factors and no observations in the field. The failure mechanism trunk breakage also showed a high safety factor, contradictiory to field observations pulling willow trees. The model results and field observations showed that a combination of upwind soil uplift and bending of roots was found most likely to occur. For this failure mechanism, the roots are schematized as beams with a spring-support on the leeward side of the trunk. The roots are exposed to the weight of the overlying soil and the overturning moment. The model showed that an increase in the participation angle α or root diameter, or increase in root length results in larger stresses in the windward roots. The amount of uplift enlarges when the root diameter or root length increases or the participation angle decreases. The modulus of subgrade reaction and modulus of elasticity influence the distribution of the overturning moment over the leeward and windward roots. The largest difference between the moment inside the leeward and windward roots is found with a high modulus of elasticity or high modulus of subgrade reaction. This difference is in agreement with the contrasting reaction between soil types as stated in literature (Dupuy et al., 2007).<br/><br/>The results show the dependence of the different failure mechanisms on soil and root properties, but also on the forest architecture. This research shows that the incorporation of mangrove stability in wave attenuation models cannot be neglected. Using an effective stress approach, instead of a total stress approach as in this thesis, would provide extra information, such as soil behaviour in time during loading. It is therefore recommended to measure pore pressures under static or cyclic loading, resulting in the progression of the effective stress over time. The inclusion of more accurate soil descriptions would enable reducing uncertainty in nature-based solutions and enables to describe the soil-root reaction to loading over time.","Mangroves; Stability; Coastal protection; Tree; Resistance; Avicennia marina; Root System","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double degree in Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk and Geo-Engineering","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Quantile regression is a useful method to analyse data such that the estimates are more robust to outliers and the conditional distributions are more reliable for asymmetric distributions with respect to the commonly used ordinary least squares regression. Besides this, the quantile regression analysis might also include extra information on the conditional relations between the response variable and the explanatory variables. Therefore, it is previously used in educational sciences, among many other research areas. Bayesian statistics is an upcoming approach for computing estimates, as it allows prior knowledge modelling. The Bayesian quantile regression approach produces accurate parameter estimates by specifying prior distributions, likelihood estimators and MCMC methods to model an informative posterior distribution. In this research, the theory behind the quantile regression and the Bayesian quantile regression approach are considered. Especially Bayesian quantile regression for ordinal longitudinal data. This theory is then used on data of academic emotions to analyse its effect on attained grades of engineering students. Multiple aspects of quantile regression are included to analyse this effect, regarding gender, time and correlations between academic emotions. It was found that the quantile regression produced insights that were ignored by ordinary least squares regression, as the effects of anxiety altered over different quantiles. Especially when seperating genders, the effect of anxiety seemed to differ a lot between genders and different fractions of the response variable. Furthermore, an assumption for Bayesian quantile regression is made by specifying an exponentially distributed prior and by seperating the gender distributions, as was found by the estimates of the quantile regression approach.","quantile regression; Bayesian statistics; Bayesian quantile regression; academic achievement; education; Math anxiety","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-18","","","","Applied Mathematics","PRIME: PRogramme of Innovation in Mathematics Education",""

Moreover, including a prediction of power consumption in the Energy Management System (EMS) during Dynamic Positioning (DP) operations can also contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. However, predictions of future power consumption for DP operations, as well as its implementation in an EMS, have not been investigated widely, since this is a complex task for a relatively specific application. This research aims to investigate how power consumption during DP operations can most accurately be predicted for near-future and far-future, within reduced computational requirements for real-time applications.<br/><br/>In this research, six different approaches for power consumption prediction are investigated. These approaches can be categorized into projection models, which determine the power consumption independent of time based on the environmental conditions, and forecast models, which rely on the recent past behaviour of the system.<br/>The four projection models consist of two Physical Models (PMs), a Data-Driven Model (DDM), and a hybrid model. The first PM is the static model, in which the environmental loads are directly compensated by the thrusters, hence the ship is assumed not to move. The second PM is the dynamic model, in which the motions of the ship are also modelled. Then, the DDM projection is based on Kernel Regularized Least Squares (KRLS) to capture the nonlinear relation between environmental conditions and power consumption based on historical data. Lastly, the hybrid projection model is an integration of the dynamic model in the DDM.<br/>Afterwards, two forecast models are developed, being one DDM and one hybrid model. The DDM forecast is based on a combination between KRLS and Time Series (TS) forecasting. The hybrid forecast is an integration of the dynamic model in the DDM forecast.<br/><br/>Simulations are performed for each model using a data set provided by RH Marine. The DDMs show the most accurate results, taking into account the required computational effort. The results show that the forecast model, using the combination between KRLS and TS, predicts the near-future at 1 s in the future with 2.8 % error, increasing to 6.9 % at 120 s in the future. Afterwards, the projection model, using merely KRLS, predicts the far-future up to the length of the operation horizon with an accuracy of 11.2 %, based on the weather forecast. This multi-horizon prediction of power consumption can enable the EMS to make accurate short-term decisions in the control of the power plant and to define optimal scheduling of the power plant components over the<br/>complete horizon of the DP operation.<br","Ship Power; Dynamic Positioning; Power Prediction; Energy Management System; Time Series Forecasting; Data-Driven Modelling; Physical Moddeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Marine Engineering","",""

(mentor); Felicita, M.P. (mentor); Crielaard, R. (mentor); Noteboom, C. (mentor); van Adrichem, W.P.A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Timber high-rise buildings have been gaining in popularity. However, due to the low material stiffness of timber the stability systems of these buildings are often made with steel or concrete. To avoid this the material efficiency of the timber stability systems must be improved. The most material efficient stability systems for timber high-rise are the externally braced systems according to literature. The externally braced systems are the diagrid and external braced frame stability systems. In literature the diagrid is concluded to be more material efficient than the external braced frame. Nonetheless, in practice only external braced frame systems are used for timber high-rise buildings. This disconnect could be caused by the steel connections which are often simplified or overlooked in literature studies but have a large influence on the material usage of a timber stability system. The connections can increase the timber element size because the required connection does not fit, and the connections will decrease the global stiffness of the stability system. For this reason, the connections must be regarded when comparing stability systems.<br/>One diagrid and two external braced frame designs will be compared with a parametric model. In this model other parameters will be studied as well. These parameters are: plot sizes of 27.2 x 27.2 m &amp; 27.2 x 40.8 m, floor spans of 3.4 m &amp; 6.8 m, permanent floor loads of 3.5 kN/m^2 &amp; 5.3 kN/m^2 &amp; 6.7 kN/m^2 and element widths ranging from 400 mm to 650 mm. The parametric model will first size the elements individually for the ULS checks and afterwards the elements will be sized per group for the SLS checks. The ULS checks start with a regular ULS member check, then a member check in the fire situation is performed and lastly the connection design component used. This connection design component will create slotted-in steel plate connections where the amount of steel per connection is calculated, and the timber element sizes are increased if needed. In the SLS checks the global lateral displacement is checked and the along-wind acceleration. The along-wind acceleration is often normative for the sizing of the elements in timber high-rise. With a higher global stiffness or higher building mass the acceleration decreases. To make a fair comparison in the results the amount of timber and steel of the internal structure is also added to the material required in the stability system in the façade. <br/>From the results it is seen that all buildings are sized on the connection design or on the along-wind acceleration. The diagrid designs have a higher global stiffness so they are sized more often on the connection design whereas the braced frame designs are sized more often on the along-wind acceleration. The diagrid designs use 3x more steel than the braced designs. The results for the other parameters are:<br/>Plot size: A smaller plot size requires a higher floor load to meet the acceleration requirement, therefore the large plot size is more material efficient.<br/>Floor span: The floor span in the external braced frame has a large influence on the designs with a small plot size. That is because the facade with the smaller span becomes normative for the global displacement. When this happens a smaller floor span decreases the material efficiency significantly. In the larger plot size the influence of the floor span on the braced frame designs is insignificant. For the diagrid designs the larger floor span causes higher normal forces in the diagonals. This increases the material usage in the facade. However, considering the internal structure of the building the large floor span is still more efficient.<br/>Floor weight: A higher floor weight is more timber efficient for a small plot size, and the lowest floor weight is the most material efficient for a large plot size. With a higher floor weight, the steel usage always increases since the connection designs are sized on the ULS checks only. <br/>Element width: The steel efficiency increases when the element width increases. This is a result of the chosen connection design. The timber usage is similar for all the element widths.<br/>Some of the designs with a small plot size and low floor weight are unfeasible since the elements in the facade are too large. This is a result of the choice to only increase the timber element heights and not the connection stiffness to improve the global stiffness. Therefore, it is recommended to study how the global stiffness can be improved more material efficiently. Other recommendations for further research are on the stability system design and the connection design. Since in this thesis many designs are fixed in simplified exploratory studies to decrease the design space of the parametric model. <br","timber; stability systems; diagrid; external braced frame; parametric study; Slotted-in steel plate connections; material efficiency; high-rise building","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

This trend is expected to accelerate even more in the future due to the improving technologies, the economies of scale, the competitive supply chains and the improving developer experience. The main challenge for a faster and wider implementation of these resources is their intermittent character and the limitations that this implies. A concept that successfully deals with this variable energy output is the Hybrid Power Plant (HPP). HPPs combine at least two different sources of energy with the goal of delivering stable power with reduced fluctuations throughout the year. In addition, HPPs present various other synergies such as in operational costs or in the developing processes, that could lead to a reduced Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). The goal of this thesis is to assess the potential synergy of a combined wind and solar park for the case of the Energy Storage Lake (ESL) of the project Delta21. The Delta21 project has a twofold character: firstly, the usage of the ESL as a large battery integrated with green energy production and secondly the protection of the inland against floods due to high sea level or superfluous river discharge. The main challenge for this specific case is the large water level fluctuations within the lake in a daily basis due to the operation of the lake. The feasibility of a hybrid wind and solar park can be examined by various different perspectives and disciplines. Among these relevant components, the most frequently studied ones are the optimization of the energy resources, the use of common electrical infrastructure and the effect of the intermittent wind turbine shadows on the solar panels. Due to the special conditions, with the large water level fluctuations met at the lake, two more components become critical. These are the type of foundation of the wind turbines and the mooring configuration for the floating solar units. This project is evaluating a new potential synergy that regards the use of the wind turbine towers as anchor- ing points for the floating solar units. Therefore, the research is focused on the estimation of the forces acting on a floating solar unit. These forces are a combination of wind loads acting on the solar panels and the freeboard of the floaters, and wave forces acting on the submerged part of the floaters. In particular, the technology of the floating solar boat as introduced by GroenLeven and the small-scale wind turbines as designed by Dutch Wind are adopted for this project. Analytical formulations are used for the calculation of the wind loads. As for the wave forces, the linear potential theory is used and the calculations of the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave exciting forces are performed through the Boundary Element Method (BEM) software NEMOH. After the computation of first order wave forces and the corresponding responses of the floaters, the far-field approach is used for the estimation of the Quadratic Transfer Function (QTF) of the drift force. The methodology developed in this project and the accuracy of the model are validated with the use of reference data that regard the interaction of connected floating units placed in a close proximity and the corresponding second order wave forces as predicted by the far-field approach.","Hybrid Power Plant; Floating Solar; Hydrodynamic Simulations; Wind Turbines; Energy Storage; NEMOH","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The accuracy for all scenarios combined for the collected data improved from 82.1$ (current) to 93.6(NBC).These results mean that there is a solid improvement in implementing the Naive Bayes Classifier over the current RFID transition system for Dock Door Discrimination.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

(mentor); Calabrese, L.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The challenges women encounter due to numerous disparities within social superstructures are finally finding their way into mainstream debates. Interestingly, Vienna is the first European city that has been incorporating the concept of gender mainstreaming into urban planning practices since the 1990s, by providing formal platforms for women to integrate their perspectives in the city's development. This research, however, reveals that the dialogue frequently remains trapped under the restricted label of 'feminist' or 'gender-sensitive', while it deserves a deeper, more nuanced discussion. Vienna’s top-down planning leaves little space for informal strategies and hence, abandons the voices of under-represented people, particularly within immigrant communities of Vienna’s outer districts. Therefore, this research dissects the city’s gender sensitivity using a set of conflicts revealing the dissonance between the social realities of vulnerable migrant women in one of the city’s fringe districts, Favoriten, and the efforts of female activists and the city administration. The data collected during extensive field interviews is documented through drawing as a method to showcase that women are less likely to simply ‘be’ in public space. These findings lead to proposal of a discussion-starter role-playing game, which places migrant women as central figures of planning processes. Disrupting the gendered order is a critical examination of how Vienna, the humanist city with a feminist attitude, can transcend beyond its rigid definition of formal urban planning and aim for multi-perspective emancipation, subsequently redefining gender mainstreaming worldwide.","Gender Mainstreaming; Vienna; Urban Planning; Migrant women; Drawing; Critical Feminist Theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","","48.1605, 16.3820"

Currently, the inspection of objects is mostly done in-person, which is labour-intensive and not very effective. With the use of drones, areas and objects can be inspected from new angles at a much faster rate. To effectively monitor these objects with drones, the position and location needs to be extracted from drone data in real time.<br/>In this thesis, a case study is done on the localisation of fisher boats in restricted areas. Several components are integrated to create a prototype. The pretrained YOLOv3 detection model is trained on acquired nadir boat images, which makes it able to predict the bounding boxes of boats on images captured with drones. A positioning algorithm is constructed, which calculates the geographical coordinates from the pixel coordinates for images taken both in a nadir and an oblique angle. A real time connection is constructed between the drone and the prototype. This is done by creating a connection with Google Drive with the drone controller and the prototype. The positioned polygon bounding boxes are localised using a real time dashboard, which visualises the bounding boxes in a map with other relevant layers.<br/>The results indicate that the performance of the components and prototype as a whole are satisfactory for this use case. To deploy this prototype in other object localisation use cases, it is recommended to train the pretrained model further, use a drone with more accurate equipment and run the prototype on the drone controller.","Drones; Localisation; Positioning; Real time","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

There is a growing recognition of the importance of acknowledging the values conveyed by locals and tourists in heritage management and urban planning. However, the knowledge and tools available today remain predominantly expert-based. Their contribution to heritage listings and conservation plans is therefore limited. Moreover, some cities tend to unbalance locals and tourists’ needs, leading to overly touristic areas, gentrification and communities’ exodus. Although research on the values conveyed to cities and buildings is growing, there is seldom research comparing them. Hence, how do the attributes and values of Faro’s heritage conveyed by locals and tourists set the frame for transformation? This research aims to reveal the cultural significance (values and attributes) conveyed by locals and tourists, taking the neighborhood São Francisco (included in an Urban Rehabilitation Area) in Faro, Portugal, as case study. And will provide a masterplan as a visualisation of the results gathered by this research. The guidelines provided by the masterplan address the current challenges of the neighbourhood further than the actual policies in place. By using multiple methods to perform spatial analysis, which includes (1) photographing, mapping and categorization of the facades and their attributes in São Francisco, and, (2) social media analysis, where hundred Instagram posts were manually collected following strict guidelines, heritage attributes could be identified. (3) Public engagement was used in the site survey game in which pictures of the attributes would be shown to locals and tourists who would connect predefined words to them in order to collect the heritage values. By following these methods, this research aims at revealing patterns and relations between: a) attributes, in particular, buildings’ facades and their characteristics and b) values (distinguishing local and tourists). After the fieldwork, results showed clear concurrences and contradictions between both communities. Results revealed low values for contemporary apartment complexes and higher values for pre-existing typologies in both groups. Furthermore, attributes such as the street art, the materialisation of facades, and the authenticity of attributes developed into design guidelines for a masterplan in which these relations are portrayed. By understanding these relations, the Municipality of Faro can improve their awareness of who values what, and why, in order to support their strategies about how to accommodate new functions in historic buildings while respecting the limits of acceptable change of built heritage according to these stakeholders. Hence, the expected impact is to raise awareness about the cultural significance of both societal groups in order to better inform heritage management and urban sustainable planning. <br/><br/>Keywords | cultural significance, urban rehabilitation, building attributes, tourism, São Francisco - Faro","cultural significance; urban rehabilitation; building attributes; tourism; São Francisco - Faro","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","","37.014118, -7.930946"

Prefabrication in the construction industry can contribute to construct affordable houses, but that results often in standardized and not customized designs. These repetitive designs can be overcome through the introduction of mass-customization in architecture. Computational Architectural Design offers the possibility to tackle mass-customization through developing tools to let the user easily customize a design while providing guidelines and feedback towards a successful building design. This can be done by discretising a building into building blocks that can be controlled through a computational workflow. This thesis elaborates on the potential of developing a design tool that allows the customization of houses through discrete building information modelling. Since the housing design process is a complex and multi-layered problem, the process is broken down into the sub-problems of topological design, building product development, configuration, and data export. For these steps, algorithms from the gaming industry are tested to improve the participation of the end user trough a simplification of the design process. Through design grammars, a relational data structure is created that is compatible to the BIM environment of the industry. The evolved methods are applied to the test case of a rowhouse design in Delft to predict the possible impact of the design tool. The results of this are set in the context of the AEC industry.","Mass Customization; Building Information Modeling; Discrete Architecture; Participatory Design; Generative Design; Polygonization; Voxelization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

(mentor); Vossepoel, F.C. (graduation committee); Ngan-Tillard, D.J.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Using a field classification, I have assessed the likelihood that a gas field caused a seismic event. I have put the focus on all of the minor gas fields located in the Rotliegend sandstone formation in the Netherlands. These gas fields were divided into five geologically distinctly different regions: the North Holland Platform (NHP), the Groningen Platform (GRO), the Lauwerszee Trough High Pressures (LTHP), the Frisian Platform (FP) and the Lauwerszee Trough (LT). I have investigated which reservoir factors are most influential in deciding whether or not seismicity occurs. The stress ratio has proven to be the most critical parameter. Then, for the stress ratio, I have computed the stress ratio range for each region at which failure will occur. Above the stress ratio, seismic activity will occur, and below the stress ratio, no seismic activity will occur. To answer the research question ""Can the reservoir properties of small gas fields in the Netherlands predict the occurrence of seismicity?"", I have taken the following steps.<br/>First, I have examined the probability of all small Dutch gas fields being responsible for a seismic event. Based on the distance between the gas field and the nearest event, as well as the presence of other fields in the surrounding area, I have derived a classification for the likelihood that the field was associated with induced seismicity. Second, I have run a sensitivity analysis to identify which parameter was most significant. I have accomplished this by implementing a semi-analytical model that computed and depicted depletion-induced stresses and fault slip along an inclined fault. The model calculated the depletion pressure at which seismic slip starts to occur, here called the onset pressure, based on reservoir data and fault characteristics. The reservoir data contains the compaction coefficient, critical slip weakening distance, dip angle, dynamic friction coefficient, initial reservoir pressure, Poisson's ratio, porosity, reservoir depth, reservoir thickness, shear modulus, static friction coefficient and stress ratio while the fault characteristics included the absolute fault offset and whether the fault is bounding or not.<br/>Afterwards, I have plotted the onset pressure versus the relative fault offset and assessed the sensitivity of the onset pressure whilst changing input parameter settings, namely the critical slip weakening distance, dip angle, dynamic friction coefficient, initial reservoir pressure, Poisson's ratio, porosity, reservoir thickness, shear modulus, static friction and stress ratio. The most critical parameter has turned out to be the stress ratio. I have examined the stress ratio ranges for each field in order to assess whether this parameter could predict the occurrence of seismicity for an entire region. Some fields that do not suit the optimal regional stress ratio have been considered anomalies and investigated further. The main explanations for the anomalies have been geological complexity, assumed synthetic fault offsets, over- or underestimated offsets, unregistered seismic events and substantial overpressure.<br/>The answer to the research question is, yes, it is possible to predict whether seismicity will occur in a small Dutch gas field located in the Rotliegend formation based on reservoir data and fault characteristics. A regional stress ratio has been determined for each of the five regions. The regional stress ratio is 0.51 for NHP, 0.58 for Groningen, 0.69 for LTHP, 0.46 and 0.47 for FP and 0.50 and 0.56 for LT. Salt layers have most likely contributed to higher regional stress ratios for GRO, LT and LTHP.","Induced Seismicity; Gas extraction; Reservoir parameters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-01-17","","","","Geo-Energy Engineering","",""

Because of this, it holds the potential to enhance the shear capacity of reinforced concrete (RC) beams, if applied properly.<br/><br/>Experimental research was thus carried out with the purpose of investigating the shear behaviour of reinforced concrete beams enhanced with thin SHCC laminates (10 mm in thickness) in their webs (henceforth referred to as hybrid SHCC-concrete beams). This research distinguishes itself from other studies by the fact that the hybrid beams were manufactured by casting conventional concrete inside pre-cast SHCC laminates, consequently, forming an interface between concrete and SHCC. Moreover, two different types of SHCC-concrete interface designs have been used in the hybrid beams, namely smooth and profiled ones. Furthermore, beams with and without transverse reinforcement (stirrups) were both prepared in order to investigate the effect of two specific methods of shear reinforcing (i.e., SHCC and stirrups) on each other. On top of that, one of the hybrid beams with stirrups has been supported only at its normal concrete core to uncover any irregularities in the shear behaviour compared to a beam supported at its full-width. Conventional RC beams (without SHCC laminates) were also prepared as references. All beams were tested in a three-point bonding set-up while monitored by two separate systems: Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and Linear Variable Data Transformers (LVDTs). The camera images were analysed by the software package, GOM Correlate 2019. During the casting of the beams, samples of all materials were taken and tested to establish their mechanical properties for quality control purposes. <br/><br/>Results show that the hybrid beams have obtained higher shear capacity than the control group. Only the hybrid beams with a minimum amount of shear reinforcement were capable to activate SHCC web laminates to their full extent. In the case of hybrid beams without transverse reinforcement (TR), only half of SHCC laminate potential was utilised approximately. <br/><br/>This study proves that, by applying advanced material (i.e., SHCC) properly, an efficient way of improving the shear capacity of an RC beam can be achieved, so long there is minimum TR provided. If a minimum transverse reinforcement is not present, the benefits of shear enhancement by SHCC become less effective due to the low Young’s modulus of SHCC.<br","hybrid SHCC-concrete beams; SHCC; shear capacity; thin laminates; shear keys; Ultimate Limit State; crack pattern; delamination; slip of interface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

The built environment is responsible for nearly 40% of global energy consumption and approximately onethird of global CO² emissions (JLL, 2020). Therefore, the built environment must become more sustainable. Public and private parties incorporate sustainability ambitions into urban redevelopment plans, in a complex context with high ambitions and quality for high costs materials, labour and energy. All these factors put pressure on the feasibility of urban redevelopment plans. In the collaboration of public-private partnerships, there are these two conflicting interests that make it hard to develop the high requirements for urban redevelopment plans. Objective – This research aims to provide new insights in the relationship between the negotiation in the partner selection methods and incorporating sustainability ambitions in urban redevelopment plans. The main research question in this research is: “How can negotiations in partner selection methods contribute to the incorporation of sustainability ambitions in urban redevelopment plans?” Methods – This research consist of two parts. First, document and literature review provide a framework of definitions and processes from which the empirical part is studies. This empirical, second, part consists of explorative interviews, case study analysis and an expert panel. Results – The defined concepts form literature are: sustainability ambitions, partner selection methods, and negotiations for urban redevelopment plans. The findings of the empirical part state that negotiations occur in the two partner selection methods (partner selection method and tender) about the incorporation of sustainability ambitions. Both methods differ in moments and types of negotiations. Conclusions – The main conclusion is that negotiations contribute by having moments in which key stakeholders discuss about how the sustainability ambitions are incorporated in the urban redevelopment plan. In these moments different types of negotiation occur in which stakeholders deal with the sustainability ambitions. This research gives insights about negotiations in the process of the two selection methods and which elements are important for improving both. With this improvement, key stakeholders should be better able to negotiate about how to incorporate sustainability ambitions for urban redevelopment plans.","Partner selection method; Sustainability ambitions; Negotiation; Urban redevelopment plan; Public-private partnerships; Collaboration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

After a huge defeat the Roman Empire decided that the great Rhine river would be the per-manent border of the empire. From that moment on The Lower Germanic Limes was fortified in stone to protect the border from the tribes north of the river. After 100 AD the Rhine tributary started flowing southwards, the Dutch constructed their dikes and urbanization sped up. Nowadays the historic knowledge of the Romans is protected in archaeological locations by UNESCO.<br/><br/>However above ground this archaeology isn’t experienced in the urban fabric and additionally the cul-tural memory of this history induces a local identity, but the locations don’t allow for place attachment or a representation of this identity. Therefore the challenge is how to translate this experience to the current locations as part of their heritage and the main question can be formulated as ‘’How can urban design sustainably develop the UNESCO sites in Nijmegen-Oost to create awareness and create place attachment for the cultural memory of Roman Nijmegen?’’<br/><br/>Nijmegen was chosen for this thesis, since it has the highest concentration of UNESCO sites within the Limes in the Netherlands, with 4 overlapping archaeological areas. These locations were analysed through the Dutch Layer Approach in Roman and current times, becoming a Diachronic Layer Approach that shows opportunities for transformation and Roman visualizations.<br/><br/>This research firstly aims to create an elaborate design for the Limes in Nijmegen by using methods to design with archaeology. Secondly it seeks to reflect on these methods by testing designs and using theory to develop a comprehensive method on designing with archaeological heritage, which is in its infancy at the moment. The report builds upon the Limes Atlas from 2005 and where Robert Broesi categorized 10 ways of doing this with references. Using these as design methods sparked creativity, but also showed that there are more elements to the process. The main findings were more ways of creating visibility, how interaction with senses and activities created awareness, but also that the site must have a sustainable impact to function in the community. Furthermore the incorporation of a ques-tionnaire, in cooperation with the municipality of Nijmegen, determined what the inhabitants view as heritage and opportunities of the sites. This research shows that solutions to current challenges are truly under the soil and that the two fields of archaeology and urban design should interact more in future developments.<br","Archaeological visibility; UNESCO development; Dutch Layer Approach; Urban Palimpsest; Roman Heritage; Awareness of History","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","51.837674372471554, 5.893782633837532"

Continuing to feed the high demand of metals is a challenge and could result of depletion of natural resources. This raises the importance to look into renewable resources with a lower environmental impact and contribute to the transition towards a circular economy. By rethinking the material usage for the duct components, solutions should be found in bio-based materials such as agricultural waste, cardboard, bio-composites or bio-plastics.<br/><br/>This research aims to explore the potential and limitations of bio-based materials for the applicability of air duct components. Therefore the following research question is formulated: What are the potential and limitations of bio-based materials to replace sheet metal for the construction of air ducts by maintaining the same quality?<br/><br/>Relevant literature reviews are conducted to give an understand of the construction and relevant requirements of sheet metal ducts. As well the circularity approaches and the categorization of bio-based materials and related manufacturing methods. A method is developed to classify the bio-based materials according their manufacturing efficiency per type of duct component: linear component, joint, bend and t-component. In addition, an assessment is described based on key criteria to select a suitable material per duct component in which the carbon footprint assessment and comparison is crucial.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the potential for linear bio-based components made from Tetra Pak is more advanced than complex components including joints, bends and t-components. This relates to the production efficiency and the LCA of the analyzed materials. Bio-plastics and composites as potential materials for complex components resulted in a relative high carbon footprint which made recycled plastic as non-renewable material a more realistic alternative.<br/> The limitations lie by achieving a similar quality as sheet metal in terms of moisture resistance and chemical emission. Due to the porous character of most bio-based materials they are sensitive for humidity, increasing the risk of mold growth overtime making the use of bio-based materials and the design of the connections between components challenging. Furthermore, the lifespan of the bio-based materials is unknown which is crucial for an accurate LCA in terms of carbon footprint. Low lifespan indicates more replacements leading to potentially a higher carbon footprint overtime compared to sheet metal.","Air ducts; Bio-based materials; Building services; Circularity; LCA; Carbon footprint; Sheet metal; Manufacturing methods","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

The efficiency and consistency of greenhouse operations can be boosted by implementing automation. Therefore, a new concept that facilitates the robotisation of crop-handling tasks is investigated.

The combination of these two techniques has not been previously explored. For this paper, a generic conceptual design framework was developed which contains a simulation model and an evaluation protocol. In the evaluation protocol a sensitivity analysis and an optimal dimension analysis is performed. Case studies are conducted to evaluate the simulated performance, to examine the capacity of the transport system and crop-handling tasks and to assess the robustness. These case studies prove that the developed framework is generic and all-encompassing. The framework has proven its worth by eliminating erroneous design choices before significant resources were spent. The new concept is promising, as it facilitates automation and has a competitive simulated production. Therefore, it is advised to move on to the next design phase, which should mainly focus on validating the crop-growth model and the preliminary design of subsystems as the transport system and components as the movable-gutter itself.

There is a need for real-time, automatic sleep monitoring to minimise disruptions in sleep patterns. The main objective of this thesis was to develop a machine learning model that can classify sleep based on vital signs in critically ill children. In addition, methods were investigated to optimise the decision criteria in multi-class problems. <br/>Methods: Three machine learning algorithms, logistic regression, random forest and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were developed based on both the combination of features extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and pulse transit time (PTT) and on ECG features alone. To gain insight into the number of sleep stages that could be distinguished, the models were developed for two-class, three-class, four-class and five-class staging. The models were developed, trained and evaluated on a diagnostic dataset (n = 90) containing polysomnography (PSG) measurements of non-critically ill children. During model development, the decision criteria for the different classes were jointly optimised. To evaluate whether the models were generalisable to the PICU population, external validation was performed on a set of 8 of PICU patients. <br/>Results: For each number of sleep stages, the three models performed similarly. However, there was an increase in performance with a decrease in the number of sleep stages with balanced accuracies varying between 0.70 and 0.72 in two-class staging and between 0.41 and 0.42 in five-class staging. External validation on the PICU dataset showed a markedly worse performance for all three models with balanced accuracies varying between 0.56 and 0.62 in two-class staging and between 0.22 and 0.23 in five-class staging.<br/>Conclusion: Machine learning models for sleep classification in children based on vital signs have been developed and show promising results. Nonetheless, the developed models are not generalisable to the PICU population. Further research is recommended with a focus on improving the models such that they can be applied in the PICU. Combining information extracted from vital signs with EEG signal and developing the models directly on PICU data should be considered to improve the performance and thereby contribute to personalised care and minimising sleep disturbances. <br","Sleep; vital signs; machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","This study investigates the problem of prioritising trucks at the export area of the KLM Cargo ground handler terminal while maintaining a continuous operation in the unloading area. Due to the uncoordinated nature of truck arrivals and space limitations at the ground handler, substantial waiting times may arise when<br/>trucks arrive simultaneously. This study proposes a sequential approach to solve this problem. First, trucks arrive over time and are scheduled for unloading at doors that can accommodate their cargo type, while some trucks must visit multiple doors. The truck scheduling model utilises a hierarchical objective with the main aim of minimising the number of airway bills missing their outbound flight. Next, the truck’s inbound cargo is grouped into batches and scheduled for transport to their next destination inside the warehouse, while placing an upper bound on the batches queued for transport. The second model aims to minimise the time a batch is queued. This study proposes three mathematical formulations, two for truck scheduling and one for internal transport operations. They are evaluated and compared considering computational time, time to<br/>best, and optimality gap as key performance indicators. Internal transport operations have also been tackled when solving larger instances by utilising a rule-based heuristic to evaluate different prioritisation techniques and reduce computational effort. Finally, a scoring heuristic has also been developed to potentially replace or support the truck scheduling mathematical model, as this is a goal of KLM Cargo to handle trucks in quasi-real time. A parameter tuning of such heuristic has been carried out and its performance against the benchmarking mathematical model has been assessed. It is found that the dynamic scoring heuristic can reduce the number of late airway bills by up to 74 against current operations. Moreover, it is found that by utilising different prioritisation mechanisms, the time batches are queued for transport can be reduced by at least 10 percent.","Ground handling; Logistics; Mixed integer linear programming; Truck scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-16","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Application of the assessment method yields that substantial equity improvements are possible within the Alkmaar – Den Helder railway corridor.

However, the effect of temperature variations is uncertain if it is taken into account in the design of the quay walls at the Port of Rotterdam.<br/><br/>Nowadays, new quay walls are often equipped with sensors that collect information about their behavior. These quay walls are known as smart quay walls. The measurement data of smart quay walls could be used to validate FE models and reduce parameter uncertainties. This could lead to an optimization of the functionality of the quay walls.<br/><br/>Smart quay walls have been observed to show much higher strain levels in the anchors during summer compared to the winter period. According to strain records, differences of up to 10% and 20% seem to be present, which is quite high. The objective of this thesis is to verify the effect of temperature on anchor force in quay walls using the data of smart quay walls.<br/><br/>The data analysis that took place analyzed data from five different quay walls (HHTT, SIF, EMO, Brammen terminal, Brittanniëhaven). Deformations, strains, anchor forces, groundwater levels and temperatures are some of the measurements that were investigated in order to understand the quay wall reaction to the seasonal temperature fluctuation effect. The most useful measurement data proved to be the deformations of the combi walls and the anchor forces in the MV-piles.<br/><br/>This research will eventually highlight the results of the extensive data analysis from different smart quay walls, while it will further prove that quay walls are affected by the effect of seasonal temperature fluctuation. The gain is that with the available data, it is verified that the wall is moving back and forth depending on the season. However, the deformations are minor compared to the deformations of the dredging period.<br/><br/>After data analysis, a FE model was set up to predict the deformations and anchor forces of the quay wall during seasonal temperature fluctuations. For the parameter determination, CPTs, later research projects, design records and triaxial tests were used. Regarding the FE model, the case that was used is the HES Hartel Tank Terminal (HHTT-quay), which is a smart quay wall in the port of Rotterdam. HHTT quay wall was selected as the most well monitored quay wall regarding the needs of this research. Moreover, the HHTT-quay consists of sections with and without a relieving platform. Both types were considered in this thesis.<br/><br/>Then comes the validation of the FE model with the measurement data. Moreover, having a FE model in PLAXIS 2D which can realistically model the cycle heating effects, could be used both to estimate deformations due to climate change effect, as well as the anchor forces leading to better quay wall design for the future.<br/><br/>As with all of the cycle effects, heating and cooling of the quay wall could cause deformations that after many years of operation of a quay wall could lead to excessive deformations. Additionally, increasing temperature will cause higher temperature fluctuations, which means larger cycles. Therefore, further research with more cycles, better quality data and a FEM that could calculate the cycle heating effects is crucial to a better understanding of the cycle phenomenon.","Quay walls; Temperature; Port of Rotterdam; PLAXIS 2D; Measurements; MV pile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

In the treatment of liver cancer, PNPs are becoming increasingly used due to their shorter recovery times and lower complication rates. However, needle placement during PNPs can be challenging due to a lack of direct visualization of the target and liver tissue deformation caused by respiratory motion, patient (re)positioning, and needle insertion. Currently, no imaging modality provides continuous, qualitative visualization while maintaining acceptable radiation levels. Continuous feedback during PNPs could improve needle placement accuracy by enabling real-time adjustments in response to tissue deformation. Previous studies have used external- and internal markers for continuous feedback, but these markers have not been able to fully capture tumor displacement and the underlying causes of deformation. Endovascular insertion is a potential solution to this problem - it involves placing the marker close to the tumor by inserting it through the blood vessels. Here, we present exploratory research that aims to investigate the possibility of using an endovascular marker to capture the displacement of a liver tumor during a PNP.<br/><br/>An ex-vivo porcine liver with artificially created tumors and endovascular catheter markers was used. In the first experiment, robotic-assisted needle insertion was performed on seven tumors with a 13-gauge ablation needle. The second experiment involved simulating respiratory motion with an inflatable sachet to mimic the lungs and create a representable blow zone (the area affected by the inflated sachet). The displacement of the tumor- and endovascular catheter markers were tracked in the x-, y-, and z-directions using a C-arm system making Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). The x- and y-directions represents the horizontal plane within the liver, and the z-direction is the vertical plane (the direction of the ablation needle). The average offset in millimeters was calculated to quantify the error between the tumor- and catheter marker displacement.<br/><br/>The results of needle insertion showed that catheter markers placed 8-28 mm from the tumor could deduce tumor displacement in the x-direction, with a maximum offset of 1.23 mm. The catheter markers placed 8-13 mm from the tumor were also able to deduce displacement in the z-direction with a maximum offset of 0.23 mm and in Euclidean distance (total path length as measured using Pythagoras' theorem) with a maximum offset of 0.73 mm. Furthermore, the results indicated that, on average, catheter markers placed 8-28 mm from the tumor were able to accurately deduce tumor displacement for needle insertion depths of 0-15 mm. During respiratory motion simulation, tumor- and catheter marker displacement was influenced more by blow zone location than the distance between them. To apply these findings to the human body, it is recommended that the endovascular marker will be positioned in the same sagittal (longitudinal) and coronal (frontal) plane as the tumor. In this study, catheter markers could be used to deduce tumor displacement for inflation volumes of 0-500 ml, which is the typical resting breathing volume.<br/> <br/>In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the ability to use endovascular catheter markers to deduce tumor displacement during a percutaneous needle procedure is influenced by the distance between the tumor- and the catheter marker, the depth of the needle, the inflation volume of simulated lungs, and whether the marker is positioned in the same sagittal and coronal plane in relation to the tumor. Future research should focus on determining the optimal number and location of endovascular markers, including a bigger variation and spread of tumor locations, and adjusting insertion techniques, to further realize the clinical applicability of endovascular catheter markers in percutaneous needle procedures.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Research is intensifying, and technology is developing fast. However, of all the components of the heat pump cycle, the oil management system seems to be the least investigated, even though 12% of the faults in large-scale heat pumps are related to oil management. This study aims to develop a method that predicts the oil-refrigerant separation performance in high-temperature heat pumps.<br/><br/>Oil injection is necessary for high-temperature heat pumps to run without failures. The oil lubricates, seals and cools the compressor, increasing its performance and lifetime. However, if the oil is not separated correctly, it causes problems in the other components; The oil increases the pressure drop and decreases the heat transfer of the heat exchanger. Additionally, the refrigerant <br/> partially dissolves in the oil, altering its thermophysical properties and increasing the risk of improper lubrication. Finally, the transport of the refrigerant deteriorates.<br/><br/>The oil management of a heat pump includes several components; an oil injector, oil separator, oil pump, oil sump/reservoir, oil temperature regulator and an oil filter. The core of oil management is the oil separator; three types of separation mechanisms are distinguished: impingement, centrifugal and coalescence. A centrifugal-type separator is most applied for industrial applications since it provides a wide operating range, allows high flow rates, and is simple and, thus, cheap to manufacture. <br/><br/>A data set containing the flow conditions and thermophysical properties is developed to use as input for the oil-refrigerant separation process modelling. A Daniel plot and developed correlations determine the properties of the oil-refrigerant mixture. The Tatterson equation is used to predict droplet size, and<br/>the droplet distribution is described using the Rosin-Rammler distribution. A test case is designed to validate the developed method.<br/><br/>Finally, the oil separation due to a cyclone oil separator is modelled in Ansys fluent. A transient simulation based on the Reynolds stress modelling approach is conducted for the continuous phase. The discrete phase method simulates the oil-refrigerant droplets. The developed method serves as a strong foundation for future research. For the future, including models for droplet behaviour and wall-film models is strongly recommended to provide scientifically relevant outcomes.","lubricating oil; heat pump","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-16","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy, Flow and Process Technology","",""

To ensure the safety of these missions, the orbits of these space debris objects need to be precisely known. At the moment this is not possible for small (1-10 cm) space debris objects in the Geostationary ring. This thesis attempts to solve this problem by optimizing a constellation of satellites using optical observations for the number and accuracy of the orbit determinations. This was done by simulating real-life optical observations and estimating the orbit using a combination of a simplex fusion algorithm and an unscented Kalman filter. The optimized design showed good performance for newer space debris objects, however, as the inclination of the space debris objects gradually increased during its lifetime the performance of the design dropped rapidly.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Tenpierik, M.J. (mentor); Coumans, G. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Acoustics combined with digital fabrication has been investigated for multiple years. Most research in this area has focused on the combination of acoustics and additive manufacturing. This is mainly due to the ability of this technique to create any geometry, which allows for very high absorption. However, it has the downside that additive manufacturing is quite expensive and the production process is time-consuming. Therefore, this study has chosen to put the geometry first and the performance of the resonators second.<br/>To be able to produce a resonant panel based on Helmholtz resonators some additional knowledge was needed. Therefore, five experiments were performed to gain the knowledge needed to design the panel. The samples were printed using a fused filament printer and tested within an impedance tube located at the Faculty of Architecture in Delft. The experiments were concerned with:<br/>- The position of the neck compared to the cavity: According to the results of the experiments the position of the neck has a minimal to no effect on the performance of the resonator.<br/>- The crosstalk effect: According to the results of the experiments the effect of the crosstalk effect is minimal within the scope of this project. A small change in absorption was noticeable but so small as to be irrelevant.<br/>- The effect of the cavity separation between two resonators: According to the results of the experiments the cavity separation can be removed without a large effect on the absorption of the resonators.<br/>- The effect of the neck length on the width of the absorption curve: According to the results of the experiments a longer neck causes the width of the absorption curve to decrease.<br/>- The impedance of resonators with L-shaped cavities: According to the results of the experiments an L-shaped cavity can be approximated by replacing the L-shaped cavity by a cavity with an identical horizontal section right below the orifice but altering the height, so the cavity has the same volume as the original L-shaped cavity.<br/>After the experiments were done, a computational workflow was designed that is able to produce resonant panels based on the targeted frequency range and the possible size of the panel. The tool was theoretically verified using a case study. For the case study two panels were designed to improve the reverberation time for a room in the Faculty of Architecture. Using the Arau-Puchades method of calculating the reverberation time the panels showed to be effective at absorbing sound at low frequencies.","parameteric design; Helmholtz resonator; room acoustics; Computer aided design; Computer aided manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

(mentor); Straub, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","This research aimed to determine whether offsite construction leads to a lower environmental impact than onsite construction. Further, it is researched how the environmental impact of offsite construction can be reduced. This is of great importance as the construction industry has a significant environmental impact. Specifically, offsite construction is extra relevant as the Dutch government chooses to stimulate offsite construction methods for its lower environmental impact.<br/><br/>First, relevant information about offsite construction methods and environmental impact assessments are researched by literature study. The environmental impact of 2D panelized and 3D volumetric construction is likely to differ as the amount of work offsite and transport logistics are different. Then, the MPG is selected as the method to assess the environmental impact. This tool measures the environmental impact of building materials throughout their lifetime. An MPG calculation is needed to obtain a building permit for residential buildings. <br/><br/>Next, the differences between the following construction methods are compared and studied: onsite construction, modular offsite construction and panelized offsite construction. This is done through case studies of each of these construction methods. <br/><br/>The cases were compared on their differences in construction methods with a focus on differences in materials and processes. <br/><br/>The cases were then compared on their environmental impact through the MPG calculations. The scope of the MPG was limited. Services and space plan (like kitchens and toilets) as described by Brand (1994) were left out of the assessment. Interior walls and doors however, were part of the assessment. The calculation showed that the environmental impact or the MPG was highest for the onsite case and lowest for the modular case. Offsite construction did come with a lower environmental impact than traditional construction in this study.<br/><br/>Four strategies were identified after looking into the MPG comparison done in this research and in two other comparisons done by other researchers to lower the MPG. <br/>To bring down the environmental impact:<br/>1. Limiting the use of materials<br/>2. Choosing different materials<br/><br/>To bring down the MPG score:<br/>3. Use more cat 1 or 2 data<br/>4. Enter a longer lifespan for a building<br/><br/>Subsequently, these 4 strategies are tested on their viability and effectiveness in the case of Leerpark Dordrecht. <br/>Strategy 1 was not feasible in this specific case, the other 3 strategies proved viable and effective. These strategies would lead to a 29% reduction in the MPG compared to the MPG made earlier in this research.<br/>However, there are limitations to the MPG when comparing the environmental impact of different buildings:<br/><br/>• The material-based approach does not allow to account for the design as a whole.<br/>• The NMD is lacking data. There are not enough cat 1 or 2 items available in the NMD. <br/>• The energy performance of buildings is often enhanced by using building elements that negatively impact the MPG, like solar panels or insulation panels. <br/>• The MPG does not help lower construction emissions now as the embodied energy is spread over 75 years. <br/>• Biobased materials are not fairly assessed in the current system. <br","MPG; LCA; Offsite construction; Milieuprestatie gebouwen; Lifecycle Assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Currently, the municipalities pursue more often a facilitating and passive role, and prefer to utilize market resources and capabilities. The lack of municipal resources, stacking complexity of the objectives and insufficient municipal capacity, makes the shift both preferable and necessary. Unsolicited proposals are emerging along this shift to more market and networked practices. These informal proposals are original, SMART, feasible, complete, value-adding plans for exclusively municipal lands that aim to get the land directly awarded. The creativeness and smaller reliance on municipal resources makes the proposals attractive for municipalities. However, the societal desirability and legal feasibility of this instrument are ambiguous as little about the phenomenon is documented and the Didam-judgement from late 2021 bars the direct award of land.<br/><br/>This research aims to investigate whether the instrument is still available for Dutch municipalities and how municipalities may improve their management of these proposals. A literature study, 2 case study projects and an expert panel have covered the topics of unsolicited proposals, urban area management, public values and the legislative context. These research methods and topics have been the main components for the delivery of a process model to improve the municipal management.<br/><br/>The process model entails a phased model of preparatory policy design stage by the municipality to steer the market and set out the legal basis for the Didam selection procedure. The latter is complied with through a first-come first-serve open selection procedure which meets the Didam-criteria of being measurable, objective and reasonable. The process continues with a parallel Ambitioning phase by the municipality and a Design iteration phase of the private party, during which communication and process management are important. Follow up by a feasibility and elaboration phase the collaboration and project management becomes more important. Concludingly, Unsolicited proposals are still feasible and through proper employment of all management tools and activities desirable outcomes can be achieved.","Unsolicited Proposals; Process model; Municipalities; The Netherlands; Public Values; Urban area development; Didam-judgement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

(mentor); Pastor Serrano, O. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","To evaluate the effect of interplay due to breathing of the patient during proton treatment of lung tumors Interplay dose calculation techniques have been proposed in literature. The proposed method requires the deformation vector field (DVF) to register dose distributions of different phases in the breathing cycle to a reference phase. The DVF is obtained by registering 4DCT lung scans between the phases. Current methods of image registration are too slow to make the interplay dose calculation techniques clinically feasible.<br/><br/>Advances in deep learning have allowed for models that predict the DVF in orders of magnitude quicker than traditional methods. In this research, two model architectures, previously applied for registration of brain MRI images, will be evaluated to predict the DVF between scans at different phases of a 4DCT lung scan. The quality of the registration is evaluated based on the mean absolute error between the images and contour metrics of organs including the Dice score, Hausdorff distance and the mean surface distance. In addition, the amount of grid folding was evaluated based on the number of voxels with a negative Jacobean determinant.<br/><br/>The first model architecture, VoxelMorph, is an unsupervised model with an U-net architecture. Two hyperparameters were varied: the maximum size of the DVF limited by a HardTanh, and secondly the weight of the loss function for the divergence of the DVF during training. The model performed poorly in predicting the DVF, the values of the DVF were too small. Varying the hyperparameter seems to have no significant impact on the prediction quality of the model. Limiting the maximum of the DVF prevents the registration of large deformations, which is not favorable.<br/><br/>The second model architecture has a multi-resolution approach. The images are downsampled to 1/2 and 1/4 the resolution. Multiple sub-network predict a DVF at each of the resolutions in a coarse to fine order. Each of the networks consisted of a feature encoder, residual blocks and a feature decoder. By upsampling and combining the multiple DVFs, the final DVF is obtained. Hyperparameter search is performed: The number of residuals blocks and their filters were varied. At first only for the coarses network, and later for all the networks. Lastly, an additional resolution was added to the model. The model was capable of predicting good-quality DVFs. Only varying the number of residual blocks and their filters for all resolutions resulted in a significant difference in the quality of the prediction.<br/><br/>Predictions are performed in 260±4 ms and 24±4 ms for the first and second architectures respectively. Which is faster than other deep learning methods found in literature, and significantly faster compared to traditional registration methods<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2028-02-01","","","","Applied Physics","",""

By choosing materials that have a low embodied energy value and optimizing the structures that can be constructed by these materials, one could potentially minimize the economical and environmental footprint of a structural design.<br/><br/>As burnt clay bricks have a relatively low embodied energy value, are relatively cheap as a construction material and are relatively durable, it is interesting to investigate the optimization of masonry structures. To achieve this, use is made of topology optimization.

This thesis presents several methods to set up such a model based on masonry structures of arbitrary size and lay-out, departing from the smallest scale: the individual brick.<br/><br/>First, a method is developed to create arbitrary shapes for bricks. An algorithm is developed to parametrically create structures for two distinct shapes.

Several<br/>methods for structural analyses are detailed and their results are evaluated and compared. The results of these analyses are used to optimize the topology of the initial structure by means of the Method of Moving Asymptotes. The resulting structures are then verified using 3DEC.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Much like the oil crisis in the 1980s, the aviation industry is once again considering more environmentally sustainable propulsion options due to concerns around climate change. More fuel efficient propulsion methods form the pillar on which environmentally sustainable aviation can be built, since it is the propulsion system that emits harmful greenhouse gasses. The propulsion system consists of an energy carrier, currently kerosene, and an energy to thrust converter, often a jet engine. Although efficiency gains are being made, using kerosene and jet engines will prove infeasible in the long run due to global warming concerns. Replacing the jet engine with a propeller offers an attractive solution since propeller shaft power can be supplied by batteries or fuel cells. Furthermore, propellers are relatively efficient due to their infinite bypass ratio. Additionally, a surge in demand for Urban Air Mobility [3] incentives propeller optimisation studies. Aircraft are a combination of complex and interacting systems. For this reason it is important to consider interactions between wings and propellers when designing either. Propeller-wing optimisation is therefore an increasingly important topic. Propeller-wing optimisation literature is scarce, likely due to the complexity of a coupled propeller-wing system. Optimising a propeller-wing system is possible with high-fidelity simulations but often takes a substantial amount of time. The aim of this research is to address the lack of coupled propeller-wing aerostructural optimisation. The knowledge gap is addressed by designing a novel coupled propeller wing framework that is suited for computationally efficient optimisation studies. Furthermore, the optimisation framework will be modular such that it can be easily extended. The ability to expand the framework increases the scope and impact of this research...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

Therefore the healthcare professionals (HCPs) are required to choose between the several aspects and innovations for the OR. Decision-making requires a mutual vision (Littlejohn et al., 2017) and should be based on evidence (Turner et al., 2017). To improve the well-informed decision-making, the main research question is: “How can a decision-support tool for optimisation in the operating room help a healthcare professional to select the objectives and the assessment criteria for performance optimisation of the operating room and the optimisation impact?”. <br/><br/>The evidence for the tool consists of the 223 relations between the objectives and the assessment criteria (metrics) and 253 causalities of metrics that express the impact. There is a high heterogeneous perspective on the objectives of the optimisation of the performance of the OR and the criteria of assessing the quantification of (the optimisation of) the OR performance, which makes it harder to create a mutual vision on the OR performance. To achieve a mutual vision, a holistic view and consider all the perspectives, including the impact of optimisations, the HCPs should all share their perspectives on the objectives and the situation should be considered in its whole (Leinonen et al., 2008; Littlejohn et al., 2017). Therefore, the decision-making process could benefit of a decision-support tool. <br/><br/>In this study a new tool is developed, namely the Performance Operating Room Counselling (PORC-)tool. This tool provides a holistic view of the OR performance (optimisation), by displaying evidence of the relations between objectives and metrics and the causalities. It also supports a conversation, which could lead to a mutual vision (Littlejohn et al., 2017). The tool is based on the concepts flowchart, matrix table and Microsoft Excel, for respectively the roadmap, the information display and the running-programme. The PORC-tool consists of an Excel file, a brochure and a manual with a more elaborated version of the functionality and the steps. The PORC-tool provides a clear and structural overview with evidence, to gather information more easily, provides multiple perspectives on the OR performance and supports to gather more insight into the OR organisation and goals before the decision-making of the HCP. The PORC-tool should be validated in practice and the functionality should be approved by HCPs. In the future, the tool can also be extended on perspectives, field of interest, aesthetics and functionality. To conclude, the answer to the main research question is that the HCPs should be facilitated to consider the whole complex system in their decision-making process, and support the decision-making based on evidence and with a mutual vision. <br","Decision-making; Optimisation in healthcare; Operating room","en","master thesis","","","","","","double degree in Biomedical Engineering and Applied Sciences | Communication Design for Innovation","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Roosenboom-Kwee, Z. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The Iron and Steel (I&amp;S) industry is the largest contributor to man-made greenhouse gas emissions. The products of the I&amp;S industry are a constant necessity, e.g. for civil infrastructure. In addition, their processes are interwoven with coal and natural gas properties, which classifies this industry as a ’hard-to-abate’ sector. Furthermore, fundamental technology changes in process and energy utilisation practices are required to fully decarbonise the I&amp;S industry before 2050. Steel processes are divided into two major production routes, the blast furnace and the direct reducing plant. Focusing on the carbon avoidance route, the hydrogen-based direct reduction process is the most promising to decarbonise the I&amp;S industry in Europe due to its ability to use natural gas as an intermediate energy source. Several techno-economic assessments have explored the energy, emissions, and economic potential of such conceptual systems, concluding that carbon emissions are highly sensitive to the CO2 intensity of consumed electricity. However, none have used the electricity mix to estimate the electricity price and associated CO2 missions on an hourly basis to investigate the performance of such systems. Therefore, a case study is proposed of Tata Steel Netherland (TSN), which has recently announced its intention to switch towards hydrogen-based steel through the DRI-REF route. The modelling and simulation research method is used to assess this case-specific process’s technical, environmental, and economic performance in 2030. A conceptual model is developed employing the findings of the literature review. Hourly data from the national electricity mix are acquired from the EMF v7.0 model from the company Blueterra, and TSN provides specific process characteristics. From this approach, several simulations could be made for different hydrogen volumes to evaluate the performance of the DRI-REF system in the Dutch context. The simulations showed a significant shift in energy sources for increasing hydrogen volumes, which leads to a reduction of 70.1% in direct CO2 emissions under the 2030 energy market conditions. However, if the indirect electrical emissions are considered, this reduction potential is only 2.2% CO2 reduction. Although this demonstrates that in 2030 the CO2 intensity of the electricity mix is approximately the breakeven point between NG and H2 production, this development also shows a major shift from CO2 emissions towards the electricity producers. Additionally, the electricity price breakeven point is a factor 3 lower than is currently estimated by using the IPKA0 electricity generation capacity scenario of Tennet. As a result, the levelised cost of production increases by 34.9% for the maximum Htextsubscript2 volume compared to NG-based production, with electricity and capital investments as the largest increasers. Furthermore, the hourly electricity price and associated CO2 emissions data enabled to determine the variability over time. A significant increase in the interquartile spread in emissions and cost calculations is observed for increasing hydrogen volumes. This implies that in the future when electricity is predominantly produced by volatile renewable energy sources such as wind or solar energy, the production uncertainty will increase significantly if this industry shifts towards hydrogen. However, this also increases the potential of flexibility technologies. Industries with flexible production processes can thrive in the Dutch environment as they could provide load-balancing services.<br","Iron and Steel; Hydrogen; DRI-REF; Decarbonisation; Levelised cost; Modelling and simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Hail impact on the leading edge could significantly damage the protective layer and the composite substrate. The focus of this research study is to investigate the effect of kinetic energy on the damage mode in gelcoated glass fibre reinforced composite in terms of the velocity and sizes of the hailstone during hail impact. The gelcoated glass fibre composite samples were tested using a gas cannon using parameters based on conditions experienced in real life but with slight modifications to enable accelerated testing. The gelcoated samples were impacted at various velocities for different hailstone sizes, 15mm hailstone (140 m/s, 150 m/s and 160 m/s), 18mm hailstone (100 m/s, 110 m/s, 120 m/s and 140 m/s) and 20mm hailstone (90 m/s) to determine the Failure Threshold Energy (FTE) for each hailstone size considered. This threshold was determined to be the limit below which no damage would be initiated. The kinetic energy of each hailstone is estimated from the mass of the hailstone, and impact velocity, which is measured using a high-speed camera. Using non-contact profilometry (optical microscopy), cross-sectional damage analysis, and ultrasonic C-scan, the damage on gelcoated fibre-reinforced polymer composite samples were analysed.<br/>The coatings did not exhibit any damage or signs of delamination in the coating-substrate interface. However, the substrate showed signs of impact damage. The damage mode was highly influenced by the kinetic energy imparted by hail impact. The damage mode of matrix cracks in the transverse and longitudinal directions was observed in the substrate for most of the impact parameters. The damage mode remained the same for the different hailstone sizes. The impact tests confirmed that a Failure Threshold Energy existed for each hailstone size. It was observed that FTE was increasing with the hailstone size, and it could be stated that multiple impacts had no effect on damage initiation for a limited number of impacts.<br","Hailstone; Gelcoat; impact; wind turbine blades; composite","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Cazaux, S.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","This Master thesis consists in investigating the formation and behavior of vapor and ice plumes. These plumes can occur in icy moons of our solar system, such as Europa or Enceladus, which are widely believed to have a liquid water ocean beneath their crust. These plumes most likely consist of a sub- surface reservoir of liquid water fed by the ocean, a crevasse, and a vent at the ice surface. Under certain conditions, the liquid water starts evaporating and, due to the high reservoir pressure, the result- ing vapour starts flowing upwards through the crevasse. Due to the high pressure difference between the reservoir and the vent at near vacuum conditions, supersonic plumes are formed. This work stud- ies the reservoir conditions and plume physics, gathering different models available in literature and comparing them to available data, such as that from observations from Cassini spacecraft. First, a model capable of describing the condensation phenomenon is sought. The effects of the consequent release of latent heat to be absorbed back by the vapour flow are also studied. Grains will then start to nucleate and grow. These particles can either collide and stick to the walls or keep flowing mixed with the vapour. Some of the above mentioned latent heat can be absorbed back by the icy walls of the crevasse and generate more vapour by sublimation. Further, this project also aims to extend the model mentioned above so that it considers the effects of a fully multi-phase, multidimensional flow, checking for the effects of rarefaction and hence the limits of the continuum assumption. Finally, a similarity analysis is performed so that the influence of working with scales as different as the channels used in the laboratory at TU Delft or the real dimensions of the crevasses found in Enceladus can be fully tackled. Any progress on the ongoing investigations about the physical characteristics of these plumes could be crucial to deepen our knowledge on geological mechanisms in icy moons of our solar system. This, in turn, could trigger research on organic compounds present in these moons, perhaps even allowing for the existence of life. Further, the model used throughout this work can be applied to study power production devices where condensation might play an important role, such as steam turbines for light-water-cooled nuclear reactors or turbines proposed to be used in innovative organic Rankine cycle (ORC) configurations, natural gas supersonic separators, supercritical CO2 compressors for large-scale carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and micro-nozzles.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This will happen during the transition of the current power grid to the Smart Grid. Due to the importance of this power to society, it is crucial that the grid stays stable.<br/><br/>DER devices are similar to IoT devices in scale, low user interaction and the use of firmware. IoT cyberattacks have been shown to have the ability to scale horizontally quickly. A vulnerability in DER devices could lead to such a scalable attack if the market for DER is oligopolistic. Due to the same underlying economic drivers such as economy-of-scale, market-for-lemons, first-mover-advantage and tragedy-of-the-commons, DER devices will likely have the same issues as IoT devices had if nothing is changed.<br/><br/>This research focuses on the role of the grid’s transition state and the DER market’s state in introducing this risk. Eight thousand one hundred (8100) scenarios were created based on a combination of parameters describing these states. An agent-based model created for this research simulated the grid and obtained the required data.<br/><br/>Results indicate that the grid and market parameters can introduce a cyber risk into the Smart Grid. The results show that if 5% of the households are infected, an attacker could abuse them to manipulate the grid, perhaps a blackout. <br/><br/>Furthermore, related work did not show any references to this particular risk and some proposed grid monitoring solutions include the usage of neighbouring DER to monitor. An attack of this nature would be able to manipulate such a monitoring solution. If the risk of an oligopolistic DER market is not considered, the Smart Grid may not have any ways of effective monitoring or mitigation.<br/><br/>Recommendations for policymakers and regulators were made as part of this research. The first recommendation is to allow the collection of real-time information on the grid-connected DER by grid operators. Furthermore, consideration has to be made to the usage of forced patching on DER. A delay in patching could impact the grid too much. Finally, the recommendation is to develop a policy on the local diversity of DER.  Devices with the same firmware should not be allowed to obtain a critical mass in a region.<br","Distributed Energy Resources; Cybersecurity; Smart Grid; Economics; Oligopoly; IoT; Modelling; agent-based model","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/Mvdboon/ScalingUpStayingSecure","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Five main parts, the parasitic capacitance compensation, first stage, second stage, tracking quantizer and DAC, are discussed and compared with the first-order system. With some modifications of the coefficients and the structure, the system is upgraded with second-order behaviour which has 6 dB higher SQNR than the first-order system. In order to reduce the change of the whole structure, with the SQNR compromise, the second-order system can be modified in some ways, such as shifting the second-order noise shaping to the first-order at some level and optimizing the transimpedance of the first stage.

The aim of this project is to provide insight into whether the cross-sectional sizes of the member are dictated by the dimensional sizes of the laterally loaded dowel-type connection or the strength and stiffness requirements of the member itself in timber frame structures. <br/><br/>In this research project, a parametric study is performed. The parameters in this study represent the global frame structure and the laterally loaded dowel-type connections. Together, these parameters form a parametric model that lays the foundation for the tool that is constructed in this study. This tool is built in order to generate a number of unique configurations that fulfill the design verifications. Using the tool, two analyses are performed. In analysis 1, the effect of different distances between the secondary beams is examined. In analysis 2, the effect of different grid sizes of the column in the frame structure is studied. In both analyses, two member sizes are first selected based on the criteria 'lowest cross-sectional area' (LCA) and 'lowest height beam' (LHB). These two member sizes form the starting point for generating different configurations of laterally loaded dowel-type connections. <br/><br/>In this research project, three factors are found to contribute to the largest reduction in the number of unique configurations for all constructed cases examined in analysis 1 and 2. These three factors are small column widths combined with high shear forces, the effect of a 'compact' member, and the effect of 'brittle' failure mechanisms on the LCA-members, which was selected as a design constraint in this study. These factors may be relevant for engineers to take into account when designing the structural members.<br/><br/>However, in this study, no constructed case is found in which the member needs to be redesigned in order to fit the connection. This means that one can conclude that the dimensional size of the structural member is dictated by the strength and stiffness requirements of the member itself. Important to note is that, although a large number of parameters was incorporated into this study, not all potentially relevant parameters were taken into account. When incorporating factors such as the horizontal forces in the connection, the effect of shrinkage and swelling, the level of difficultly in terms of assembling the joints on site, and adjustments to guarantee a certain level of fire resistance, certain turning points in the dimensional interaction between joints and members may be found. <br/><br/>Finally, beyond allowing for the dimensional interaction between joints and members to be studied, the tool constructed in this study is also valuable to practical engineering. The large amount of data that is generated by the tool allows the engineer to explore the different possible configurations in the process of designing joints. By connecting the output of the tool to the Design Explorer interface, the engineer has the opportunity to search through all the individual characteristics or a specific range and examine different possible connections in an efficient manner. One of the main contributions of this research project, therefore, lies in the tool itself.<br","Timber; Joints; Connections; Parametric study; Brute Force Method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

Freeway traffic congestion is a major social problem, as it is the reason for increased time delays, higher accident risk and environmental pollution. There is, therefore, the need for a sustainable solution that can be implemented on the existing road infrastructure. Freeway traffic control is considered as such a solution. It uses different control measures, in order to improve the performance of the freeway traffic network, by influencing the drivers’ behaviour.<br/><br/>The Variable Speed Limits (VSLs) are a traffic control measure that aims to increase traffic safety, improve traffic flow and reduce the environmental pollution. Towards the improvement of the freeway traffic flow, easy-to-implement VSL control algorithms are used as mainline metering control approach.<br/><br/>Two easy-to-implement VSL algorithms are reported, namely the Mainstream Traffic Flow Control (MTFC) and the Logic-Based control algorithm for Variable Speed Limits (LB-VSL). The algorithms are usually implemented in an non-adaptive framework. The main contribution of this thesis is that it proposes an adaptive framework for both algorithms, in which the critical density of the freeway traffic network at bottleneck’s location is estimated on-line. This estimated critical density is used to adjust the controllers’ parameters in real-time.<br/><br/>Three different estimation methods for the bottleneck’s critical density are studied, namely the Parameter Estimation (Parameterschatter) method, the Simple Derivative Estimation (SDE) and the Kalman-Filter-based derivative Estimation (KFE) methods. All three methods focus on the real-time estimation of the derivative of the Fundamental Diagram (FD), in order to produce estimations of the critical density.<br/><br/>A case study is performed to evaluate the performance of the three algorithms. A hypothetical 12 km long freeway stretch is used, which contains two VSLs installations and a lane-drop bottleneck. In the first part of the case study an accident scenario is studied, which decreases the critical density at the bottleneck’s location. The second part of the case study evaluates the three adaptive easy-to-implement VSL algorithms under the assumption of a decrease of the critical density across the whole network, due to bad weather conditions.<br","Traffic control; Adaptive control; Variable speed limit; estimation algorithms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Since no analytic closed-form solution exists, various numerical approaches have been developed. Among all proposed methods, the least square Monte Carlo(LSMC) approach is the most successful and popular. The LSMC utilizes linear regression for the estimation of the continuation values for the option. However, the accuracy of the LSMC is dependent on the chosen basis functions, where no objective strategy exists for the basis function selection process. Recently, it has been proposed to use kernel ridge regression (KRR) with a bundling technique for high-dimensional American option pricing to avoid selecting the basis functions.<br/>The Heston model is an example of the stochastic volatility model, where only limited literature can be found concerning multi-dimensional American option pricing under this model. In this thesis, we reproduce the proposed KRR-based methods. Additionally, we extend the KRR-based methods for high-dimensional American options under the Heston model. We also involve the LSMC method for evaluating the pricing efficiency and accuracy of KRR-based methods. As no reliable benchmarks exist for the valuation of American options under the high-dimensional Heston model, we implement the primal-dual approach and use its result as the reference price. Nevertheless, the obtained benchmarks are biased. Therefore, we can only conclude that the KRR-based methods apply to American option pricing under the high-dimensional Heston model. Moreover, the KRR-based techniques are computationally more efficient than the LSMC method.<br","American Options; Stochastic volatility; Option pricing; Monte Carlo simulation; Kernel regressions; Geometric Brownian Motion; Jump diffusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-12","","","","Applied Mathematics | Financial Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","In the field of structural and geotechnical engineering, a uniform approach to predict and model foundation settlements during the design phase of a high-rise building appears to be missing. In the Netherlands, pile foundations of tower structures underlain by compressible soil layers are challenging to model due to different stiffness and load distribution effects. As a result, the Dutch building code currently used for foundation design, the NEN9997-1, does not include realistic soil-structure interaction (SSI) effects. Instead, the NEN defines a simplified approach for high-rise buildings as the sum of two types of foundation settlements: individual pile head settlements (s1) and pile group settlements (s2) due to compressible layers below pile tip level. <br/><br/>Numerical models were used in this thesis to predict the individual contribution of different soil layers to measured subsidence of tower structures. By running several simulations using Tomlinson’s load spread method and the new embedded beam formulation (EB-I) in Plaxis 3D, it was found that approximately 65% of the total (s2) settlements are caused by the compression of clay layers below foundation level. Moreover, the effects of different pile factors (αs, αp) on the load distribution (more pile shaft resistance versus base resistance) from superstructure to subsurface were investigated. This research concluded that updated pile factors - in accordance with recent pile load tests on the Maasvlakte (Gavin, 2020) - influenced the predicted and modelled pile head settlements (s1) slightly for a Fundex 560 pile. Nonetheless, the change in load distribution due to different pile factors did not affect the vertical effective stresses or resulting (s2) settlements at depth. <br/><br/>Further, to accomplish a more uniform modelling approach for high-rise building settlements, this thesis provides insights for an automated soil-structure interaction mattress methodology as illustrated in Figure 1. A model verification is proposed for the mattress model approach using finite element software commonly used by geotechnical (Plaxis 3D) and structural engineers (SCIA Engineer) in daily practice. In essence, it is based on a simplified (s2) settlement analysis from Plaxis 3D (step 1) and mattress fit model in SCIA Engineer (step 2) consisting of multiple springs with linear stiffness (k_bedding) connected by a plate (E_plate) and a simplified surface load on top. The surface load represents the quasi-permanent building loads. An apparent limitation of the Plaxis 3D model (step 1) was the missing building stiffness or load redistribution within the superstructure due to differential settlements over time. However, a modelling discrepancy of only 1% was found for both the peak and differential settlements between SCIA Engineer (step 3) and Plaxis 3D (step 4) for a theoretical, symmetric high-rise building of 69 m in the North of Amsterdam. Thus, a model verification was accomplished by comparing the settlements from Plaxis 3D with the building on top of EB-I embedded beams (step 4) to the deformations of the fitted mattress model (k_bedding + E_plate) representing the compressible soils underneath the structure in SCIA Engineer (step 3). Altogether, this thesis provides a solid foundation towards a more universal design methodology between multiple stakeholders while including SSI effects for settlement predictions of high-rise buildings in daily practice.<br","PLAXIS 3D; SCIA Engineer; High-Rise Buildings; Compressible Soils; Foundation Design; Settlement Analysis; Soil-Structure Interaction; InSAR; Finite Element Modelling; FEM; Numerical models; Pile Foundations; Mattress Model Approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geotechnical Engineering","",""

Metastatic lymph nodes can be detected with high sensitivity by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). However, 18F-FDG uptake is not only increased in metastasis. For example, inflammation in irradiated regions have increased 18F-FDG uptake obscuring possible residual tumour. Additional imaging might improve the specificity of the 18F-FDG PET images.<br/><br/>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently used in head and neck imaging to provide anatomical reference for the 18F-FDG PET. However, early detection of metastatic lymph nodes based on anatomical MRI is difficult. Physiological MRI uses sequences that allow for the measurement of physiological processes within a tissue. Changes of these physiological processes within lymph nodes might indicate a metastasis. Two types of physiological MRI were of interest for this study, diffusion weighted imaging-intravoxel incoherent motion (DWI-IVIM) and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI. Quantified data from these physiological MRI acquisition might provided added predictive value in head and neck PET/MR for the detection of metastatic SCCs lymph nodes.<br/><br/>For the prospective study, subjects were included between September and December 2022 scheduled for a standard diagnostic PET/MR exam of the head and neck region with (suspected) SCC. The DWI-IVIM and DCE-MRI sequences were additionally acquired during the standard diagnostic PET/MR. Lymph nodes identified by an experienced radiologist or nuclear medicine physician were included for processing and analysis. Metastatic lymph nodes were determined based on the pathology results.

Furthermore, six of the ten non-malignant lymph nodes were suspected based on the standard PET/MR images.<br/><br/>The physiological MRI showed multiple quantitative parameters correlating to malignancy. Moreover, the relatively high number of suspected non-malignant lymph nodes depicts the potential specificity improvement physiological MRI can provide for head and neck PET/MR imaging.

(mentor); Karpel, Moti (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The flight tests which are part of the certification procedure that prove that no flutter occurs within the flight envelope are fraught with risk. To reduce the risk, numerous numerical analyses, wind tunnel and ground tests are performed, which together with the flight tests result in a long and costly test programme.<br/><br/>To reduce the risks associated with flutter flight testing, a new flutter test version of the Parametric Flutter Margin (PFM) method, specifically applied to wings undergoing large deflections is presented. The PFM method adds a stabilising parameter, such as a stabilising mass, to the model such that the flutter velocity is increased. By exciting the stabilising mass in one of the primary (i.e., x, y and z) directions while simultaneously measuring the response in these directions and repeating the excitation in other directions, the flutter margins that are associated with the original model can be determined. To demonstrate the method a wind tunnel test campaign was performed at TU Delft using the Delft Pazy Wing which can exhibit large nonlinear deflection. The wing was equipped with a flutter pod consisting of a shaker and stabilising mass that was placed at the mid-span position at the leading edge of the wing.<br/><br/>During the test campaign, three test series were performed. The first identified the flutter boundary through direct flutter tests, with the flutter onset and offset velocities being determined by actually hitting flutter that turned into an LCO. The second and third test series were the PFM measurements, where both SISO and MIMO PFM were applied to obtain the nominal flutter boundaries without actually hitting flutter. The different PFM results showed a maximum difference of 4.4 % between each other at an angle of attack, α, of 6°, with the difference found to be minimal at α = 0° and increasing with increasing angle of attack, which was as expected. <br/><br/>Compared to the directly measured flutter tests, the MIMO PFM results identified a flutter velocity of 4.8 % lower than the directly measured flutter offset velocity at an angle of attack of 4°, and the SISO PFM results identified the flutter velocity to be 8.2 % lower than the offset velocity at 4° angle of attack. The PFM-identified flutter frequencies showed a difference of less than 2 % compared to the direct flutter test, with the difference in identified flutter frequency between the SISO and MIMO PFM reaching a maximum of 2 %, which was also increasing with increasing angle of attack. <br/><br/>However, even with the successful application, several research areas remain open, and several points of improvement for the performed test campaign have been found. Although besides the points of improvement, the acquired data shows the potential of the PFM method for performing safer, shorter and consequently cheaper flight tests for the certification procedure of new aircraft configurations.","Aeroelasticity; Aeroelastic flutter; Parametric Flutter Margin method; Flexible Wing; Delft Pazy Wing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However, collecting this data is expensive and time-consuming, and ethical concerns inevitably arise because the data often contains personal information. Ortega presents designerly data donation as an efficient and ethical approach that encourages the active participation of users to obtain contextualised data (Ortega et al., 2021). This subtle switch of attitude towards data collection will help designers reduce concerns about budget or invasion of privacy. Designers can build up proper triggers to inspire users to donate their data and provide enough information to enable donors to autonomously participate in their control and choice. While its potential has been defined, there are a few challenges to further integrating this concept in practice. In particular, designers must understand the whole system to plan the right strategies to call for donors, taking the right action at the right time. With this in mind, the main focus of this project was how to deliver the concept of designerly data donation as a design method for designers in practice. A design challenge and related activities were conducted with UX designers of The Valley and the data-centric design lab at TU delft, after which I proposed the initial shape of the DDD toolkit that can be used in practice as a result of this project.","Data donation; Design toolkit; Data centric design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The squeeze film levitates the two surfaces away from each other, hereby reducing friction. Squeeze film levitation between a rigid curved surface and a soft surface is still poorly understood. Also, a proof of concept of a friction modulation mechanism for endoscopes is not yet available in the research literature.

Its geographical location and the fact that it is a delta result in low elevation levels which makes it vulnerable to inundation. This problem will only become bigger in the future due to the effects of climate change. To get funding from organisations like the world bank it is important to propose multiple solutions that are beneficial to multiple parts of society. It is favourable to split<br/>a complex system like the Mekong Delta into subsystems to make it more feasible to build realistic models. The subsystem defined in this report is the Hau River estuary. This area mainly suffers from riverine inundation caused by tidal variation in the South Chinese Sea. The biggest city in the region is Can Tho with 1.3 million inhabitants.<br/><br/>The research question is: Which integrated solutions reduce riverine inundation problems in the Hau River estuary while also considering socio-economical aspects? To answer this research question the following four solutions are proposed and designed.<br/><br/>• Discharge sluice in the mouth of the Hau River to reduce the tidal influence<br/><br/>• Wetland with a double levee system and buffer zones to reduce peak discharge<br/><br/>• Bypass channel to the Gulf of Thailand to reduce discharge during the wet season<br/><br/>• Protection of valuable assets and adaptation of local citizens to the new natural balance<br/><br/>Based on desired discharges and water levels preliminary design parameters of the proposed hydraulic structures were determined. The effectiveness of these solutions was assessed based on their ability to reduce the water level in Can Tho. The reduction that the discharge sluice achieved was determined with a zero-dimensional model, whereas the water level reduction that the wetlands and bypass option achieved were determined by Delft3D models. The discharge sluice performed best in reducing the water level in Can Tho, as it opposes the tidal influence in the Hau River.<br/><br/>To assess the quality of the solutions relative to each other a best-worst multi-criteria analysis is done. In this assessment other factors such as financial aspects, socio-economics and transportation are taken into account. The most important criteria are flood reduction and funding opportunities. According to the assessed criteria, the discharge sluice and the wetland are the best-scoring solutions. These solutions have the most potential in reducing the river inundation problems in the Hau River estuary. This does not mean that the bypass and adaptation solutions should be neglected or are not useful. For a complex problem in a complex system like the Hau River estuary, one solution is not going to solve all the problems. A good balance between different aspects has to be determined by also considering other problems like sand mining, subsidence and salt intrusion.","River inundation; Mekong Delta; River delta; Hau river estuary; Riverine flooding","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","CIE4061-09 Multidisciplinary Project",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Highly accurate time sources, such as Cesium-based or GPS clocks, are the best candidates to provide a correct notion of time, but are too costly and impractical for implementation in every modern digital device. Ubiquitously, (crystal) oscillators are employed instead. To maintain a shared notion of time, the offsets and drift/jitter have to be compensated via the concept of synchronization, divided into time offset equalization and syntonization. Packet-based distribution protocols such as Network Time Protocol (NTP) and Precision Time Protocol (PTP) can provide time offset equalization, whilst synchronous Ethernet can deliver syntonization. To reach high synchronization accuracy, PTP and synchronous Ethernet can be combined into an improved protocol, referred to as White Rabbit. It enhances the one-way delay calculation through fine and coarse delay measurements. These improve PTP timestamps to reach sub-nanosecond synchronization accuracy. <br/><br/>The White Rabbit project has limitations though: it relies on extensive calibration parameter sets that are only available for limited devices and do not account for hardware variability. This is in contrast with the initial project objectives. Secondly, the update cycle of the hardware implementation is slow. Namely, the current White Rabbit switch is based on FPGA platforms from ten years ago. Thirdly, the switch contains costly components and requires full replacement of present network switches upon deployment. <br/><br/>This work opted to define a new switch design, which distributes the synchronization tasks over several smaller FPGAs to provide a low-cost implementation and improve applicability, whilst requiring minimal factory calibration and maintaining sub-nanosecond accuracy between devices. <br/><br/>The new switch concept is based on the smaller and widely applied White Rabbit node design. The proof of concept is based on two interconnected FPGAs forming a 1-port White Rabbit switch. Fine delay measurements, asymmetry estimations and fine delay compensations are applied to reach synchronization between the FPGAs. The Digital Dual Mixer Time Difference (DDMTD) is preferred for the fine delay measurements due to its superior resolution, area and invariance to large clock periods. A three-line asymmetry calculation is introduced and motivated to provide an improved one-way delay estimation. Lastly, the IDELAY element was selected to provide the fine delay compensation due to its process-voltage-temperature (PVT) invariance, negligible jitter addition and area demands. <br/><br/>Whilst both the fine delay measurement and fine delay compensation were thoroughly discussed by means of specifications and simulations, the three-line asymmetry calculation had to rely on a theoretical discussion. As such, measurements have shown that the transmission delay over an added bi-directional link is approximately equal when the clock signal moves from slave to master and vice versa. A large delay variability between other transmission lines is subsequently exposed. The variability leads to inaccurate one-way estimations with a traditional two-line approach. A three-line asymmetry calculation will be conclusively beneficial for the synchronization accuracy. The low-cost requirement of the distributed switch can be maintained through elimination of components in the slave and master node. The reduced switch lowers the hardware costs with approximately 25% by trading off cost-effectiveness with jitter filtering and consecutive performance.","White Rabbit Protocol; Field Programmable Logic Array (FPGA); Time synchronization; Switch; Asymmetry calculation; PTP; NTP; Sub-nanosecond synchronization; Minimal calibration; Low-cost","en","master thesis","","","","","","This project was performed in a conjoint involvement of the TU Delft and Topic Embedded Systems","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Okur, Ö. (graduation committee); van der Leun, Kees (graduation committee); Peters, Daan (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The Dutch government has the ambition to be climate neutral by 2050. An important pillar to realizing this ambition is to place large numbers of wind turbines in the North Sea. The Dutch cabinet decided in 2022 to realize around 21 GW offshore wind capacity in 2030, but the offshore wind demand in the Netherlands after 2030 remains uncertain. Estimations of the future offshore wind range from 38 GW to 72 GW in 2050. The upper bound of 72 GW offshore wind capacity is based on the technical potential of offshore wind in the Dutch part of the North Sea. However, this approach does not take a holistic approach to the energy system. It ignores essential system aspects such as the development of electricity demand, electricity trade, and the deployment of other low-carbon energy technologies. Hence, this thesis aims to answer the following main research question:<br/><br/>‘What is the Dutch demand for offshore wind capacity in the North Sea in 2040 in a decarbonized energy system, considering future electricity demand, electricity trade, and security of supply?’<br/><br/>This research consists of two parts. First, the factors influencing future electricity demand in the Netherlands are examined, and estimations of energy supply in the Netherlands are analyzed. Electricity supply and demand in 2040 are studied by analyzing scenario studies that study the energy transition of the Netherlands. Special attention has been given to the influence of heat pumps in the built environment, electric vehicles in transportation, electrification in industry, and green hydrogen production on the evolution of electricity demand.<br/><br/>Second, the optimal system configurations of the North Sea countries (the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) are analyzed using the PyPSA-Eur model. Twenty-five scenarios are run with net-zero emission targets in 2040, illustrating<br/>the energy system effects. Relevant parameters varied to produce the scenarios include electricity demand in the Netherlands and bordering countries of the Netherlands, transmission system expansion, capital costs of generation and storage technologies, capacities of nuclear power, onshore and offshore wind power, and solar power in the system.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the results of the scenario analysis show that without hydrogen production, the electricity demand of the Netherlands in a highly decarbonized energy system ranges from 177 TWh to 270 TWh. In contrast, electricity demand, including hydrogen, ranges from 177 TWh to 562 TWh. Hence, electrification in<br/>the built environment, agriculture, transport, and industry creates sufficient electricity demand for the lower bound of 38 GW offshore wind capacity. It is unlikely that sufficient demand can be created for the higher bound of 72 GW offshore wind capacity without green hydrogen production in the Netherlands, even if offshore wind power will become the dominant energy generation technology in the Netherlands in 2040.<br/><br/>From the modeling results, it was found that the optimal amount of offshore wind capacity in the Netherlands is negatively impacted by the capacity of other low-carbon energy technologies in the Netherlands and in bordering countries of the Netherlands. Higher electricity demand in bordering countries of the Netherlands positively impacts the optimal capacity of offshore wind in the Netherlands due to its influence on electricity trade. Further, constraining the transmission system expansion leads to higher energy storage requirements in a highly decarbonized energy system, which leads to higher offshore wind capacity in the cost-optimized system. Hence, this research highlights that choices have to be made about the role of the Netherlands as an electricity importer or exporter and whether the Netherlands aims to use its renewable energy to produce green hydrogen domestically or import hydrogen from abroad.","Power system modeling; Electricity demand; Offshore wind; Netherlands; Techno-economic analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The Flying-V is an unconventional aircraft concept showing promising initial results in overall efficiency, outperforming the conventional tube-and-wing aircraft. To prove this gain in efficiency, optimized concepts are desired early in the development process. This requires flexible design tools that explore and optimize the design space. For this, a multidisciplinary design optimization tool is developed, in a Python-based parametric software that uses object-oriented programming and knowledge-based engineering, ParaPy. A representative high-fidelity structural weight estimation method is still missing from this tool, as recently, the parametrization of the outer mold line of the Flying-V has been altered to ensure cabin design flexibility, improve manufacturability, and enable a family concept.<br/><br/>This research contributes to the design of the Flying-V by presenting a framework that combines a fully parametric structure design tool with high-fidelity structural analysis, enabling automatic weight estimation of multiple optimized structural concepts. A structural model is automatically generated in ParaPy, requiring only the outer mold line as input. Optionally, default parameters on the structural layout, like the location of spars or the rib pitch, can be altered, allowing for thorough design space exploration. Next, all elements in the structural model are assigned element properties, the structure is meshed, and boundary conditions are applied. The design problem is defined, and a NASTRAN input file is written. NASTRAN SOL200 is used to perform a structural sizing optimization. The objective of the optimization problem is to minimize the structural weight based on a gust load, with constraints on both yield strength and fatigue. The results are post-processed by the ParaPy application, enabling a feedback system. The entire process is automated and a weight estimate, with thickness distribution, is generated as output. <br/><br/>A design of experiments is performed that shows a success rate of 90 and proves the flexibility and robustness of the framework developed. Moreover, the framework is fully automatic, has seamless integration with the existing multidisciplinary design optimization tool, and enables a full feedback design loop. This shows that the framework is suitable for the analysis of the full Flying-V structure. Furthermore, as the framework requires only the outer shape as input and uses the knowledge base to generate the structure and the finite element model, the framework can be expanded for structural weight estimation and design space exploration of other (un)conventional aircraft concepts. Currently, the main limitation of the framework is the lack of buckling analysis. <br/><br/>The framework is used to estimate the structural weight of the outer wing of the Flying-V. First, multiple concepts that are currently considered in the design of the Flying-V are compared. A Non-Leading Edge Spar design is estimated to be 15% heavier compared to the more conventional wing box structure design. The trailing edge of the outer wing is lightly loaded, and the implementation of a flap is shown to increase the structural efficiency, leading to a weight reduction of up to 20%. Fatigue is the critical failure mode, and the design of experiments shows a weight-saving potential of up to 30% by relocating the spar. The FEM weight of the baseline design is 2400 [kg], such that the final, engineering weight of one outer wing is estimated at 3000 [kg], when including weight penalties for buckling and manufacturing as well. This is 20% lower than the weight as estimated by previous work, indicating a potential reduction in the total structural weight of over 15% compared to conventional reference aircraft. These results are promising and bring the Flying-V one step closer to reality and help bridge the gap to more efficient aircraft.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

An aerodynamically smooth surface was created and used for all dynamic experiments. For exploratory research into the effect of surface finish on the performance of a T-foil in steady state conditions, a second, unfinished but structurally equal, T-foil was made using .15 mm 3D printing layers aligned with the flow.<br/>The hydrodynamic properties were determined by conducting experiments in steady state conditions using conventional towing tank methods. Combining all steady state experiments, the lift and drag coefficient on the foil are expressed as a function of angle of attack, freestream velocity and submergence for a Reynolds number of 1.5·105. The surface finish of the second, raw printed, T-foil resulted in a lower critical Reynolds number of 3.3 · 105 compared to 4.5 · 105 for the aerodynamically smooth foil.<br/>Dynamic flow conditions were simulated in experiments where the setup was subjected to either: sinusoidal pitch motion, sinusoidal heaving motion or waves. As a result of the imposed motions, the static forces on the setup change and inertial forces occur. To compensate for this, a function was made from all static measurements. The inertial forces are compensated by applying a mass/inertia matrix.<br/>Using this new method of towing tank research, the steady state behaviour of a T-foil is described using dynamic experiments. The novel method to determine steady state characteristics includes two angle sweeps, one positive and one negative. The rate of change proves to be sufficiently slow at 0.8 ◦ s−1 for v∞ = 2 ms−1, producing more accurate results while towing tank time can be reduced by 78%.<br/>From the steady state results a model is created. Because this model is limited to Re = 1.5 · 105, it is enriched with a prediction model based on X-foil which is compensated for induced drag, finite foil shape and free surface effects.<br/>The prediction shows good correlation with the results in z-direction for both imposed sinusoidal heaving and pitching motions. During sinusoidal heaving, flow remains attached longer leading to higher and more stable lift and drag at higher absolute angles. In pitching a similar effect can be seen leading to increased fluctuations and slightly higher average lift compared to the prediction models. For both imposed motions, lower drag is measured with respect to both the predictions and the measurement in steady state conditions. An additional component to the drag occurs during a sinusoidal pitching motion. This additional component has a sinusoidal behaviour equal to the imposed motion which suggests that it is caused by induced drag.<br/>When the freestream velocity was increased from 2 to 6 ms−1 in similar waves, it was found that the sinusoidal response of the hydrodynamic forces shifted by ± π rad. Similar to the imposed dynamic motions, predictions show larger values for drag. It was found that the wave height can be related to the drag. When wave height is increased, the drag is reduced.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Results show that the H1126 performs well in terms of muscle geometry and force output. The H1126 muscle moment arms are within a 2 SD margin compared to the literature. The H1126 muscle-tendon length minus tendon slack length and normalized fiber length are within a 10\% margin compared to the state-of-the-art comparison models. Maximum joint moments of the H1126 are also within a 2 SD margin compared to the state-of-the-art torso models and literature. The H1126 is more suitable for predictive simulation than the comparison models as it is computationally faster due to the minimized number of muscle fascicles and the use of purely via points while performing similarly in terms of force output.","Musculoskeletal Model; Simulation; Sit-to-stand; Trunk; Lumbar Spine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); van Stekelenburg, Bram (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Despite the technological improvements in the dredging industry in the last decades, there are components that have not been investigated accordingly. One of them is the bow coupling bend pipe which can be found on trailing suction hopper dredgers. In contrast to most pipelines, the specific bend pipe is not only a means of transport for the dredged material but has a structural role, as well. Currently, it provides support to the subsequent pipes, which have no other connection to the vessel than the bow coupling bend pipe. Moreover, the abrasive nature of the slurry causes severe wear in the dredging pipes, with even more damage in bend pipes. These two factors lead to the relatively frequent replacement of a large amount of material, which also translates to an uneconomical procedure.<br/><br/>The objective of this thesis is to explore the potential of designing a new bow coupling bend pipe, which focuses on the reduction of the replaced material and the extension of its lifetime. This can be achieved by analysing the two aforementioned factors, in order to improve the management of the original material, resulting in an economical solution.<br/><br/>This study does not only analyse the design of bow coupling but also contributes to the understanding of slurry wear in bend pipes. Precisely, the report starts with a thorough explanation of slurry transport, describing also the three mechanisms of slurry wear and the parameters that influence the wear rates in a bend pipe. Furthermore, a literature review on the wear profile of bend pipes takes place in order to determine the expected wear pattern in the bow-coupling bend pipe. A total of five different wear zones are proposed to<br/>describe the wear rates in specific areas in the bend. The lack of research on slurry wear in large-scale bend pipes necessitated the use of assumptions to adapt the literature outcome on the bow coupling bend pipe. The information obtained from that research is used for the development of various concepts, considering also other aspects that contribute to the main goal of the thesis. Several concepts are investigated and compared based on the priorities of the project. The final design is further discussed, proceeding to modifications that improve its performance. The final geometry and materials of the system are defined in the finite element analysis. To do that, company guidelines and related standards were used to define the loads on the system as well as required realistic scenarios in which the design had to prove its structural feasibility. Finally, before providing recommendations for future work, the proposed design is compared with the current one, highlighting improvements in the three aspects of the thesis objective.<br/><br/>In particular, using almost 60% of the material required for the current design, the new solution extends the bend pipe’s lifetime at least three times. That proves the remarkable effectiveness of the new design in the management of the pipe material, which is also directly linked with economic benefit. It is estimated that the capital expenditure of the new system will be twice as high as the current case, while the replacement cost is reduced by about half.","Slurry wear; Bend pipe wear pattern; TSHD; Bow coupling design; Bow coupling loading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","This thesis presents the research to design a successful high-accuracy, sub-millimetric registration method for an autonomous robot equipped to drill bone for cochlear implant (CI) surgery. Its performance, and thus success, is measured in accuracy, workload, usability and trust. While state-of-the-art (STOTA) research lacks the inclusion of human-robot interaction (HRI) related design requirements, this thesis demonstrates its significance. The HRI-focused design led to a successful multi-modal, multi-feedback admittance control, touch-based pair-point bone-anchored fiducial registration method.<br/>A successful high-accuracy registration method is critical for image-guided robotic microsurgery as it contributes directly to its overall surgical precision. The inclusion of HRI-related requirements is concluded to be essential for the success of registration methods for surgical robots due to their inevitable involvement in a hospital workflow consisting of human teams and their lack of autonomous capabilities in all required tasks. <br/>Gaining knowledge through theoretical and empirical research; utilising exclusion and scoring criteria to select the best specific registration method concept; and performing an extensive error- and human-factor analysis to determine the design implementations led to the design of a multi-modal multi-feedback admittance control, touch-based pair-point bone-anchored fiducial registration method. The design allows operators to execute a localisation task in collaboration with the robot. This design concerned a human operator physically guiding the robot end-effector to four bone-anchored fiducials attached to a skull-resembling setup to execute their localisation. The robot control was based on an admittance controller that enables the human to move the robot through the sensed interaction force at the robot’s end-effector. Consequently, if the operator exerted a forwarded force on the robot, it moved in that direction proportionally with the preset admittance parameters. <br/>This guidance control contained five modes of control: (1) translational, (2) rotational, (3) fixed, (4) safety and (5) registration mode. Each mode allows the operator to control the robot as needed to achieve high accuracy, usability, trust, and a low workload. To switch between modes, the human operator utilised a foot-operated interface with several buttons, each dedicated to a specific function. <br/>The translational mode had a fixed orientation and permitted free movements of various speeds along translational axes and was used for correctly arranging the end-effector to the fiducial centre in the x-, y- and z-axis. The rotational mode allowed orientation movement while preserving a fixed translational position and was employed for aligning the end-effector perpendicular to the fiducial centre. The fixed mode included a fixed orientation and translational position and was used for filtering out perturbations presented by the human operator. The safety mode allowed the robot to with-tract to a safety position and orientation in case of operator inactivity and was utilised to ensure patient safety. The registration mode allows for saving the end-effector position, hence localising the fiducials. <br/>The feedback provided to the operator consisted of visual feedback, auditory feedback and a step-by-step graphical user interface (GUI). The visual feedback permitted colour coding of the modes of control and safety thresholds regarding force, torque and workspace. This was used to build operator awareness and control large errors introduced by operator input. The auditory feedback included a sound when localisation of the end-effector was completed and was utilised to form operator awareness and prevent timing errors. The GUI contained safety checklists, workflow guidance and operator performance feedback and was used to minimise operator variations. <br/>To compare and benchmark our design, the baseline included a similar STOTA non-HRI focused single-mode no feedback admittance control touch-based pair-point bone-anchored registration method. This baseline method allowed a human operator to guide the robot end-effector in the translational axis and save fiducial localisation positions in cooperation with a second human operator. The comparison study involved a quasi-experiment of two groups with 13 and 14 participants, respectively. The groups executed repeated fiducial localisation and were compared on their system accuracy, workload, usability and trust. <br/>The system accuracy was measured in fiducial localisation error (FLE) and target registration error (TRE) based on repeated measurements of each fiducial. The workload was estimated quantitatively in average operator force and qualitatively with a NASA TLX survey. Usability was calculated with the Computer System Usability Questionnaire (CSUQ) and System Usability Scale (SUS). The Trust Perception Scale-HRI measured trust. The design achieved the second-highest accuracy from all discovered STOTA registration methods. Furthermore, it reduced the operator workload and improved usability and accuracy compared to a non-HRI-focused design.<br/>This thesis concludes that an HRI-focused symbiotic design provides a successful high-accuracy sub-millimetric registration method for robotic surgery as measured by accuracy, workload and usability. <br/><br/>To a future where humans and machines live together in harmony.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The comparison study in this thesis is performed in agreement with the TU Delft Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC).<br","Human-Robot Interaction; Patient-to-image registration; Medical Robotics; Robotic Surgery; Registration; Admittance control; Human-Robot Interaction Design; Multi-modal admittance control; Multi-feedback robot; Touch-based pair-point bone-anchored registration; Robot registration; Patient registration; Cochlear implant; Bone anchored fiducial; Fiducial localization; Image guided robotic microsurgery; Microsurgery; High accuracy patient-to-image registration; Fiducial detection design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-01-10","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Cognitive Robotics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Lock passage can potentially make up a third of a vessel’s travel time for inland waterway transport and therefore has a large impact on inland waterway and multimodal transport networks.<br/>To reduce the overall environmental and economical impact of transport, there is an increasing interest in inland waterway transport relative to road and rail transport. To keep up with this shift towards inland waterway transport, models are created for the optimal arrangement of multimodal transport and transport on inland waterway networks. Hence, lock operations need to be carefully modelled.<br/>The modelling of lock passage is often based on historical data and generalised for all the locks on the network. However, there are uncertainties in historical data, especially with the prospect of an increasing fleet size and more extreme seasonal changes. Additionally, locks can vary in functionality (e.g. recreational or professional use), operability and strategy (e.g. filling and emptying), structural design (e.g. capacity of lock chamber), and environmental conditions (e.g. water level differences).<br/>These variations impact the passage time of phases in the locking cycle. An overgeneralised validation for a simulation model can result in inaccurate simulations for a specific lock.<br/>Therefore, it is desired to use more lock specific data, which can be achieved by applying vessel specific data in the form of AIS (Automatic Identification Systems). AIS, live location data of professional vessels, is used in waterway traffic management, but is also collected for research purposes. The data is easily accessible for a desired period of time and area.<br/>Literature studies show that analyses and validations of simulation models is a common practice with the combination of GPS based data. Some studies use AIS data around locks, only to find the total passage time of the vessel. A lock passage can be divided in more phases that impact the total passage and waiting time of a vessel, examples are the entering and exiting of the vessel and the<br/>operating time of the lock itself.<br/>The objective of this study is to find a generic method to derive validation parameters for simulation models of locks. Data derived from this study can further be used in the optimisation of lock passages in simulation models. In this way, any desired lock and for any circumstances (e.g. seasonal changes or periods of maintenance) a validation can be performed.<br/>A method was created to translate AIS data to information that is relevant for a lock. This method enabled us to analyse the total passage time and the phases of a lock passage that impact this passage time. Based on the AIS data over a certain time period and considering the geometry of the lock, trajectories of passing vessels were derived. These movements were combined into lock cycles<br/>and therefore the corresponding validation parameters could be identified. One example of these validation parameters was the lock operating time, which is estimated based on the principle that all vessels in the lock chamber stopped moving.<br/>The lock specific data can be used to compare the data with the performance of a simulation model of a lock and period in time. This applies for models that only use the total passage time of a vessel, which in some situations might be sufficient. This also applies to models that consider more detailed lock passage. Since the method is based on positional data, the boundaries of the lock sections can be adjusted to the definitions used in the model.<br/>The method is applied on a cases study of the Volkerak and Kreekrak locks. Firstly, the AIS data translation is performed for a lock to create data sets of the lock passages. Also, data of the water level at the lock is linked to each locking cycle. Secondly, this data is compared to a lock simulation in the same situation. The arrival rates, arrival speed, vessel dimensions and water level difference<br/>are used as input to create a base simulation for various configurations. The lock simulation module of OpenTNSim is used because this is an open-source transport network simulation model developed at TU Delft.<br/>The simulations are compared to the collected data, for a total of 18 segments on the trajectory passing the lock. The segments correspond to the phases of a locking cycle. The average passage time of each segment is compared between the vessels of the simulated and the collected data. Because of the large sample sizes, these comparisons created a view on the overall performance of the simulation for each segment.<br/>The information found in the base simulations was further used to calibrate the OpenTNSim package. The vessel speed was adjusted on the approach and leaving of the lock chamber to match the trajectory of the arriving vessels. Also, the filling time of the the lock chamber was optimised for the simulation.<br/>The Volkerak had a total of 24,446 vessels passing over the time period, this is comparable to the 24,570 vessels that were counted by Rijkswaterstaat in the same period. Three cases were selected to compare the simulation model, one vessel passing without waiting, one vessel passing with waiting and two vessels passing. These resulted in sample sizes of 943, 89 and 561 lock cycles respectively. The case study shows that, with a small sample size of 89 locking cycles, there can be large variability in passage times.<br/>The largest deviations of the simulations relative to the collected data were found in the passage time of the segments between the waiting area and the lock chamber. Another deviation was found in the lock operating time for the case of two vessels passing.<br/>The method used can give a large and useful data set of vessels passing a certain lock. The lock data can be used for statistical analyses. An example includes the number of vessels per locking cycle or the entering time or speed. Also, each locking cycle can be assessed and visualised individually or for a desired time span.<br/>When the data is used for the validation of a simulation model, a large data set is needed to give reliable results. After all there can be large outliers and the performance of the lock is dependent on human interaction, the lock operator and the vessel’s captain. A combination of the AIS based data with other additional data can expand the method.<br/>In conclusion, a highly suitable method was found that enables to use AIS data for the validation of a simulation model of a lock. The method is sufficient for most applications of a lock simulation model, despite being limited to just the movement of the vessels. However, when an accurate simulation of a lock phase like the closing of the gate is desired, other data sources might be more suitable. While this research has a focus on the comparison of the collected data to a lock simulation, the data can also be used for a statistical analysis of the lock when looking at fleet composition, arrival rates and stopping distances.<br","Locks; AIS; OpenTNSim model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Due to this, an n by an array of actuators needs n 2 number of valves. A logic network of valves provides a solution by reducing the number of valves needed to operate such distributed fluidic actuation system. These compliant fluidic networks could have a broad application in different fields such as biomedical, microfluidics, or in soft robotics. An example in the biomedical field is for creating an actuated surface that is controlled by a fluidic logic that goes around a hollow organ. This sleeve could provide support to the organ by externally providing actuation. The main goal of the paper is to design a compliant valve that easily could be integrated into a large fluidic logic network, to demonstrate the network a demultiplexer is built. Compliant is defined as soft material (small E modules) with hyperplastic properties. To get a better understanding of what is already done in the field of distributed actuation systems a literature study is conducted. The thesis will provide information on the design steps of creating a valve and how to integrate them in a fluidic network that is a demultiplexer. The operating principle of this valve is that there are 2 channels on top of each other on a 90-degree angle, one channel will be inflated and will choke the other channel. Different valve designs based on this principle have been built and tested using different shapes and combinations of materials. Using FEM software the closing pressure is calculated. After that prototypes have been built and experiments are conducted. During experiments, the pressure drop has been measured in the channel that will be closed. The next step is to understand how these valves operate in a large network. A Simulink model of a demultiplexer has been built, it was shown that 2.4 seconds to inflate an array of 8 small bellow actuators with a stroke of 5 mm. After simulating a demultiplexer is created. Experimental results show that the best-performing valve completely closes a line with a pressure of 12 kPa with an operating pressure of 26 kPa. As a demonstrator of a large-scale network a demultiplexer is built, unfortunately, it did not perform due to manufacturing problems. To answer the main question of this paper a fully functioning logic network has not yet been achieved however, it could be said that this paper has laid a good foundation for further improvement of the creation of a scalable solution for an actuating surface. It also has to be noted that the valve designs that are discussed in this paper operate on an mm scale instead of an cm-scale which is commonly found in the literature.","Soft robotics; fluidic logic gates; compliant valves; Demultipexer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-02","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

A natural way to represent them is through agent-based modeling. However, this method has two drawbacks: it entails a heavy computational burden and the emergent properties are often difficult to analyze. The purpose of our research is therefore to accurately abstract and explain the dynamics of airport terminal operations by means of computationally efficient and interpretable surrogate models, based on an existing agent-based simulation model. We propose a methodology consisting of two stages. Stage I involves the development of faithful surrogates. A sample is collected according to an active learning strategy, upon which Gaussian process regression, higher-order polynomials, gradient boosting, and random forests are fitted. Stage II then applies state-of-the-art techniques from the emerging field of explainable artificial intelligence to these models. Both model-agnostic and model-specific methods are considered, and their results are synthesized in order to explain the emergent properties. We prove the efficacy of this approach by conducting two case studies on AATOM, an existing <b>A</b>gent-based <b>A</b>irport <b>T</b>erminal <b>O</b>perations <b>M</b>odel. The first case study examines the total expenditure on discretionary activities, such as shopping and dining. A combination of poor staffing strategies and high occupancy rates on certain flights was found to disrupt the terminal journey of passengers on subsequent flights. As a result of these knock-on phenomena, less free time is left for discretionary activities, which has a negative effect on the total expenditure. The second case study examines the throughput of security checkpoints. While throughput increases with passenger numbers, a clear point was observed where the checkpoint reaches its maximum capacity. This leads to longer queues and therefore higher waiting times. It even goes so far as to put passengers at risk of missing their flight, especially with poor staffing strategies. Altogether, we clearly observed the preservation of emergent phenomena in surrogate models, and conclude that their combination with interpretable machine learning is an effective way to explain the dynamics of complex sociotechnical systems.","Agent-based Modeling; Surrogate Modeling; Interpretable Machine Learning; Airport Terminal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Air Transport and Operations","",""

The goal is to investigate the dosimetric impact on proton treatment plans of set-up variation and daily anatomy visualized on CBCT prior to treatment in patient with left-sided breast cancer patients with an indication for locoregional irradiation. Method For 10 patients, proton plans (4.05 Gy in 15 fractions) were made in Erasmus iCycle with a robustness setting of 5 mm and 3% range uncertainties. The CTV included the left breast (n=5) or chestwall (n=5), axillary lymphnodes levels 1-4 and internal mammary chain (IMC). The daily estimated dose was calculated on five CBCT for proton plans of 10 patients treated for left-sided breast cancer with image guided radiotherapy and surface guidance to facilitate DIBH. A workflow in MIM was created to generate virtual CTs by deforming the pCT into the CBCT. Dosimetric parameters were evaluated for four separate CTVs; CTV Breast/Chestwall, axillary lymph node levels L1+L2, L3+L4 and left IMC and included the volume, D98, V95 and V107. For OAR this included the volume, Dmean, D2cc and V5Gy for the heart and V5gy and V20Gy for the left lung. To determine whether there was a significant difference between the DVH parameters and volume between the pCT and the mean estimated dose of five fractions a wilxocon signed rank test or two tailed t-test was used. In addition, contour deformation was validated with the Dice similarity score and mean distance to agreement, and it was tested whether there was a significant difference in DVH parameters for CTV chest wall/Breast, CTV L1-L2, and heart between contours derived by the method and contours manually corrected by an experienced breast radiation oncologist on the CBCT. Results The mean and standard deviation (std) values observed in this study for the DSC and MDA are 0.98 (0.1) and 0.30 (0.2), respectively, which is in agreement with the proposed tolerances for both evaluation tools. Moreover, no significant difference was found in volume and DVH parameters between the semi-automatic contours derived from the method and the manually corrected contours. A significant difference in volume with a small absolute volume for CTV breast, Chestwall and L1-L2 was observerd and no significant difference in any of the DVH parameters for CTV breast, chestwall, L1-L2, L3-L4 and IMC. The cardiac dose did not have a significant difference in DVH parameters, but the left lung had a significant increase in V5Gy[cc] and V20Gy [cc].

However, the Paris agreement forces the sector to reduce its emissions by 90-100% in 2050 compared to 1990. This induces the need for a more sustainable character in the petrochemical industry to produce HVC with net-zero emissions by 2050.<br/>Steam cracking is expected to be still the leading production technique for HVC in 2050. Therefore, this research focuses only on petrochemical clusters containing a steam cracker. <br/>Accordingly, the research question to be answered was: How can existing petrochemical clusters containing a steam cracker be transformed to produce<br/>HVC with net-zero emissions in 2050? This thesis aims to look into the potential of alternative feedstocks and combine them with other decarbonisation options for steam cracking to produce HVC with net-zero emissions by 2050 from a cradle-to-gate perspective.<br/>A base model was created of a petrochemical cluster containing a steam cracker capable of serving the global market (3900 kt HVC/year) to answer the research question. The base model was used to develop six models with different decarbonisation options capable of accepting alternative feedstock. Decarbonisation options were based on carbon capture and storage (CCS), both post and pre-combustion, electrification and hydrogen. The alternative feedstock was sourced from the renewable materials: vegetable oils, animal fats, crude tall oil and lignocellulosic biomass. Also, plastic waste (recycled) and synthetic (FT wax and naphtha) feedstock made from captured CO2 and hydrogen were included. The maximum percentage of HVC produced from alternative feedstock was assumed to be 25% due to uncertainties and limitations in the availability of alternative feedstock. The rest of the HVC was yielded from a mixture of fossil feedstock (naphtha, LPG, ethane, gas oil and butene). Different experiments were performed to estimate the emission reduction potential of separate or combined decarbonisation options with HVC yields originating from alternative feedstock ranging from 0% to 25%. The supply chain and associated CO2 emissions of the feedstock were also analysed. Next to determining the emission reduction, the quantitative data from the models were also used to assess the levelized cost of zero emissions HVC and the geographical and infrastructural limitations of decarbonisation options. One problem was the residual fossil fuel gas from the process, possibly leading to unwanted emissions elsewhere if not appropriately handled. In conclusion, the only decarbonisation options capable of dealing with this problem are CCS and auto-thermal reforming combined with CCS. Together with renewable feedstock, from a cradle-to-gate perspective, these options are capable of reaching net-zero emissions or even negative emissions when fossil and renewable feedstock supply chain emissions are drastically reduced. For future research, it is advised to not only focus on producing HVC with steam cracking but also consider other greenfield production method capable of producing HVC with renewable resources. A comparison with the proposed pathways in this research would provide valuable insights. <br","High value chemical; Renewable feedstock; Steam cracker; Decarbonisation; Sustainable Energy Technology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-05-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Numerical models excel in these areas while compromising<br/>on accuracy. Accurate modelling of cavitation is key to accurately model the suction performance of turbo-pump inducers. This work focuses on the design and optimization of an existing turbo-pump inducer to further improve the suction performance. The main questions in this work focus on the effect on cavitation performance by modifying multiple geometric features present in inducer design. The application of an enhanced Rayleigh-Plesset cavitation model capable of modelling cryogenic thermal suppression effect is investigated using a hydrofoil verification case. Numerical stability prevented the application of this enhanced model on the full-pump and further work is performed using the Zwart-Gerber-Belamri Rayleigh-Plesset cavitation model. A parameter design<br/>study is performed to identify the sensitivity of key turbo-pump inducer design parameters on the suction performance of an excising inducer-impeller pair. Outcome of this study is used to establish an iterated inducer design from the baseline with a predicted ≈ 15% performance increase in pump suction performance. The outcome of this parameter study adds to the current body of literature available on the design of cavitating turbo-pump inducers. The iterated inducer design is materialized for experimental evaluation using a cavitation tunnel developed by Rocket Factory Augsburg (RFA). Suction performance of both the baseline and iterated inducer design are experimentally<br/>evaluated to allow for comparison between numerical prediction. In this work both the numerical prediction results show agreement in predicting the relative improvement in suction performance measured in experiment. Performance increase in suction performance is measured experimentally to be ≈ 14% compared to the ≈ 15% predicted numerically. Yet, the absolute performance prediction of suction performance shows deviations from the observed value of ≈ 13 − 15%. A set of considerations are provided on the implementation of numerical cavitation models and testing of cavitating inducers. These considerations can help improve the accuracy of these numerical models<br/>and increase usability of cavitation testing facilities.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2028-11-09","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In this case, this research aims to understand how the sum of parking areas changed by the modal switch from private cars and bikes to shared micromobility modes. A calculation approach of parking areas will be proposed and applied in an agent-based simulation model mimicking the mode choice of travellers in Delft. Moreover, shared micromobility modes regarding vehicle characteristics (speed and cost) will be differentiated, so their impacts on mode choice and land space will also be investigated.

However, this approach raises concerns about privacy, as it would allow banks to share sensitive financial information with other banks and institutions. A way to allow banks to still detect money laundering using other banks' data, but without having to share the data would be through the use of multi-party computation. In this work we propose a privacy preserving distributed cycle detection protocol which is meant to find short cycles in financial transactions to help detect money laundering without compromising the privacy of the customers at the bank. Finally, we show that our protocol is significantly faster at detecting short cycles in large financial graphs than current state-of-the-art multi-party computation protocols.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Financial Engineering","",""

Along these roads are thousands of overhead objects such as viaducts and traffic sign gantries. It is essential to have recent and accurate data on the clearances under these objects. This data is important for maintenance and routing oversized transports. Obtaining clearance measurements can be time consuming, costly and in involves a lot of manual labor. The aim of this study is to develop a method that automatically estimates vertical and horizontal clearances of highway viaducts and gantries from Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point clouds. The proposed method takes a point cloud of an infrastructure object as input, and as output provides the user with a concise overview of the estimated horizontal and vertical clearances under the object.<br/><br/>A point cloud of a highway viaduct or gantry is segmented into different clusters relevant for determining the clearances. The discrete points in these clusters are then used to approximate their corresponding surfaces with B-splines. Subsequently the minimal clearances can be estimated. These clearances are estimated at certain pre-specified locations according to guidelines from the highway authority, Rijkswaterstaat. To validate the proposed method a case study is performed on two sections of Dutch highway containing a total of 20 viaducts and 50 gantries. For the viaducts and gantries along these highway sections there are clearance measurements available from third-party contractors. After processing the point clouds in the case study, the obtained clearance estimations are compared to the third-party measurements. This comparison gives a quantitative analysis of the estimated clearances and shows that the proposed method produces similar results to the third-party measurements. On average the proposed method overestimates the vertical clearances and underestimates the horizontal clearances. A sensitivity analysis is performed to confirm that the proposed method can produce consistent results. When performing clearance estimations on a different dataset containing point clouds with an up to 20 times higher point density, the estimation differences with the third-party measurements become even smaller. <br","Clearance; Point Cloud; Infrastructure; Mobile Laser Scanning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","Austenitic stainless steels are used in waste gate systems of turbochargers for their good mechanical strength at elevated temperatures. A key component of the waste gate system is the bushing, which guides and supports a rotating shaft under dynamic conditions. In these operating conditions, wear occurs which limits the service life of a bushing. Moreover, high alloyed austenitic stainless steels are used for conventional bushings, which results in high costs. For these reasons, alternative austenitic stainless steel alloys are considered. This investigation, in collaboration with Mitsubishi Turbocharger and Engine Europe B.V, focuses on the material selection of an alternative stainless steel alloy for the bushing application based on wear and oxidation behaviour. <br/><br/>In this work, conventional cast austenitic alloys were compared to alternative wrought austenitic alloys. The oxidation behaviour was determined using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X­ray diffraction (XRD). Wrought materials showed better resistance against oxidation and better thermal stability than cast materials, which was attributed to the formation of a uniform Cr2O3 layer. In contrast, the interdendritic carbides in cast materials acted as sites for oxidation. The wear behaviour was characterized by hardness testing, pin­-on-­disc testing and engine testing. Worn surfaces were analyzed using white light interferometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The presence of interdendritic carbides of the type MC, M7C3 and M23C6 in cast materials resulted in high hardness, which provided better resistance against adhesive wear. However, with the introduction of oxidation in the engine test, wrought materials outperformed cast materials due to the formation of stable layers consisting of oxidized wear debris. This layer acted as a solid lubricant and effectively reduced adhesive wear.<br/><br/>From these results, it is concluded that oxidation can have a beneficial effect on the wear behaviour of austenitic steels. Additionally, wrought alloys are suited to replace conventional alloys, which improves the service life and reduces the costs of bushings in future turbochargers.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-01-01","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","One of the areas of major importance when it comes to weather prediction are clouds, due to their significant impact on the climate and because they are major source of the spread in climate sensitivity in climate models. This paper will focus on the main numerical weather prediction model, HARMONIE, used by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, with the objective to determine whether this model is able to accurately simulate the meso-scale organization and structures of subtropical low marine clouds.<br/>This is done by comparing various HARMONIE simulation outputs with the observed variables obtained from the Barbados Cloud Observatory. To determine how the different processes within HARMONIE are affecting the simulation outputs, several experimental runs are analyzed. Based on the results it can be<br/>seen that HARMONIE cycle 43 does produce a higher amount of low cloud cover compared to HARMONIE cycle 40. This is expected as HARMONIE cycle 43 does contain the additional height variance which was added in order for the model to produce more low clouds. However, it is overestimating the total low<br/>cloud cover, in contrast to the underestimation by HARMONIE cycle 40. It can be seen that when the additional height variance is removed the simulation of the low cloud cover is significantly improved and is comparable to the observational low cloud cover. Furthermore, when the additional height variance and<br/>shallow convection are both removed the amount of low cloud cover produced by HARMONIE cycle 43 also closely resembles the observed low cloud cover amount. When it comes to cloud fraction in the atmosphere, all of the experimental runs are not able to produce clouds that are present above 3000 m. This result was also obtained from simulation outputs of HARMONIE cycle 40. Besides this, also the specific humidity and potential temperature from the simulation outputs of HARMONIE cycle 43 are not accurately modelled.<br/>All of the experiments seem to have a dry BIAS near the surface and a cold BIAS throughout the whole entirety of the atmosphere. Based on these findings it can be concluded that HARMONIE cycle 43 is able to produce meso-scale subtropical marine clouds, however it does not do this accurately but is overestimating<br/>at all times. Moreover, it can be seen that the additional height variance has significant impact on the cloud production and it is recommended it be removed as the simulation outputs more accurately describe the observational data when it is not present. Furthermore there is no major improvement between cycle 40 and 43 in the cloud formation above 3000m. Both cycles are not able to produce any clouds in the simulation outputs. Based on this new understanding of what is the major source affecting the cloud production in HARMONIE, it is possible to further look into them with the aim to improve the overall weather prediction<br/>of HARMONIE.","HARMONIE-AROME; KNMI; cloud cover; barbados cloud observatory","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","13.193900, -59.543200"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2023","The environmental impacts created by human activity have exceeded planetary boundaries, leading to the need for change towards a circular economy (CE) from a linear economy. The CE aims to reduce environmental impact by focusing on responsible production and consumption. It is achieved by avoiding the outflow of materials and reducing environmental impact as much as possible. Analytical tools such as LCA are necessary to map the environmental impacts of different CE alternatives serving the same product system and assist in finding the most environmentally preferable option. It is essential to make credible, transparent and reproducible assessments of the environmental impact of circular strategies compared with incumbent ways of working. Many databases and software programs used to perform LCAs do not explicitly and transparently solve multifunctionality, which can lead to distorted information and inaccurate decision-making. The report emphasizes the importance of a systematic approach to solve and identify multifunctionality within CE-LCA and improve the reporting of LCAs to make them more transparent. While the CE concept, when implemented in practice by designing products, often leads to reductions in environmental impacts throughout product life cycles, this is not always the case. Design decisions should be based on credible, transparent and reproducible assessments of environmental impacts, and not on assumptions. The focus is on how different choices in modelling recycling and identifying multifunctionality are made in LCA literature, and how reporting can be improved. This report investigates the modelling and reporting of recycling loops in LCA studies that address circular economy systems, with a focus on the ecoinvent database.<br/><br/>This study aims to answer the research question ‘How are recycling loops modelled and reported in LCA studies addressing circular economy systems and in the most widely used LCA database ecoinvent; and how can reporting be improved to better and more transparently communicate conclusions of LCAs to product designers?’","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(mentor); Kang, W. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2023","The integration of large-scale battery storage systems can aid the transition to renewable energy and stabilize energy systems for optimization. However, batteries can be cost-prohibitive and unprofitable, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive understanding and modelling of battery degradation. Battery degradation prediction models play a crucial role in battery manufacturing, especially when they can be created using early cycle data. However, a challenge in battery prediction is the lack of diversity for training data, leading to models that are not robust and hard to generalize. Transfer learning can address this issue, as it doesn't require the test and training data to come from similar distributions. This thesis introduces a framework that uses early cycle data to predict battery lifetimes. The framework employs a regularized method, the elastic net, for battery lifetime prediction and Transfer Component Analysis (TCA) for transfer. The major contribution of this thesis is the transfer learning framework that is proposed for battery lifetime prediction, which involves the analysis of various aspects, including when what, and how to transfer. To demonstrate the framework's performance, a dataset based on early cycle data from a real-world case study is used. The results show that the proposed methods outperform existing methods in both the simulation and case study results. Different methods are used for selecting and weighing features before the transfer, resulting in 39 out of 42 improvements in the case study results. In particular, utilizing elastic net coefficients to weigh the features before the transfer yields the optimal approach in 15 out of 21 cases and enhances the RMSE and MAPE compared to not using transfer in 38 out of 42 cases. Additionally, this study, as one of the first studies in this field, provided innovative approaches to quantitatively examine negative transfer. It conducts a comprehensive analysis mainly for univariate distributions, utilizing a robust 2-sample goodness-of-fit test to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between transfer performance and distributional differences.","Battery degradation; remaining useful lifetime; Transfer learning; Transfer Component Analysis; 2-sample goodness-of-fit tests; variable selection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""
