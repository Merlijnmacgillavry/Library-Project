The main purpose of this work is to determine in the laboratory the strength of Bremanger rock fills under low stress. Tests are conducted on rock fills with a finer particle size distribution than that used at MV2. Results obtained cannot be directly used in the design of MV2 project. The influence of the testing equipment, for a given ratio of the equipment size to the particle size, of the degree of compaction and of the particle strength on the strength of the Bremanger rock fill are investigated. The effect of the test boundary conditions is researched by conducting tests with a triaxial cell apparatus, medium and small scale shear boxes and a tilt apparatus. The movement of particles was also studied during medium scale shear box testing to get a better insight into this effect. Emphasis is put on determining the contribution of dilatancy to the shear resistance of the Bremanger sandstone rock fills with respect to the contribution to resistance to rolling of particles. For this purpose, dilatancy is measured during testing and the basic friction angle of the Bremanger rock fill is determined on sandblasted rock discontinuities with a Golder shear box. The basic friction angle controls the resistance to rotation of smooth particles. Test results are fitted using empirical models. The performance of these models at predicting the strength of the tested materials is assessed.","shear strength; low stress; large scale triaxial compression apparatus; medium scale shear box; Bremanger Sandstone; rockfill","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Geo-Engineering","",""

The load and movement history of bridge bearings of the ‘Dintelhavenbrug’ are analyzed by means of a finite element model. In this model the loads caused by traffic en temperature are considered. The traffic loads follow from a fatigue load model with 12 types of trucks, based on the European Standard for traffic loads (NEN-EN 1991-2) and measurements of traffic on the bridge near ‘Moerdijk’. The temperature loads follow from the European Standards (NEN-EN 1991-1-5). For both types of (static) loadings the forces, displacements, rotations and slide paths, which occurs during the lifetime of the different bridge bearings, are determined for each bearing.

A statically balanced system which is designed to counterbalance a mass, is referred to as a gravity equilibrator. The potential energy in a gravity equilibrator is constant, which in most of the times is achieved by mechanical springs. Often helical springs are used, although these springs take a lot of space within the workspace of the mechanism. This paper presents the design of an adjustable gravity equilibrator using torsion bars, which saves space in the working area. Static balancing is achieved with a non-constant transmission (NCT). A new NCT design, and a general method to calculate the design parameters are presented. The stiffness of the torsion bars can be adapted by changing the active length. In this way it is possible to balance different masses with the same system.","static balancing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

Dunea is currently performing research to extend the multiple barrier treatment with advanced oxidation processes (AOP) via UV and hydrogen peroxide. Mostly medium pressure (MP) mercury vapour ultraviolet lamps are used that emit a broad spectrum of light, coinciding with the absorbance spectrum of many substances, which results in a high photolytic capacity. Low pressure (LP) mercury vapour lamps emit ultraviolet light at just one single wavelength (254 nm). Consequently, the direct photolysis of target substances is less effective and the yield of hydroxyl radicals is lower compared to MP lamps. However, LP lamps have advantages over MP lamps such as significantly lower energy consumption and fewer by-products such as Assimilable Organic Carbon (AOC) and nitrite are formed.

(mentor); Plomp, H. (mentor); Deboutte, N. (mentor)","2011","The E.U. mission is to provide pace and stability, safety and security, but also identity and diversity in a globalized world. My research has focused in the last point. In order to understand Europe we have to understand the complexity of the different scales in which Europe is involved. From the really Global scale to the European ones, that means to deal with all the different countries composing the European Union, but also with their regional and local features. Brussels as a Capital of Europe in a way reflect these European features because of its internal divisions: 2 languages, 19 communes, and different ethnic groups due to the highest immigration during the XXth century. The analysis started with a research on the Mundaneum of Paul Otlet, an utopia for a world city of communication in which all the fact of knowledge come together in a global centre and then redistribute this knowledge to all places in the world. According to Michel Serras this is the concept of pantopia, that is the dream of having all the place of the world in one place or each place in all places. The European district in Brussels could embody the pantopia of Europe because of its large amount of European institutional buildings. But nowadays the EU district is just an anonymous office district, comparable to the world trade centre on the north side of the pentagon. These large urban interventions have provoked urban fragmentation, both at the urban fabric level and at the social level. Nowadays urban interventions are characterized by spatial discontinuity. In this sense I compared Brussels to a large archipelago of different island in which each section is working in a mono-programmed way, and this is changing the meaning with the historic city centre. If in the old city the power of one building was directed related to the city boundary, and the public space in front of the building was related to the function of the building (ceremony, games, etc..), in the contemporary city the power of few buildings is related to a larger network of political institutions in Europe. And the public space between these buildings is not directed related to the function of the buildings. I want to conceive a new type of public building, which can refer to a larger network of cultural institutions. The building works as a catalyst of different dynamics. It works as a server of a large number of cultural institutions. The aim is to give to the Mundaneum the opportunity to initiate collaboration with and among European cities and citizens. In turn this work has the potential to establish the mundaneum as a initiator of the European ideas. Here the relation with the mundaneum of Paul Otlet that has been conceived to get and redistribute knowledge from and to different places through technology. The inventio in my concept is to conceive a podium for identity and diversity through arts, to provide positive confrontation between different cultures. My position is that creation, production and representation of the European debate through arts to promote cultural exchange: to take on the ambition of critical reflexivity, to create a public area for forums and debates, to provide freedom of expression, recognitions and access to culture. This means to try to represent, through art performances and expositions, all the dynamics that are involved in Europe nowadays. Thematic exhibitions, festivals, conferences and debate on the European question will take place in the building. But also everyday life activities are crucial. People can use the building as a meeting place, they can find spaces to work, create, rehears, represent themselves or their organization. Local cultural institutions as well as international artistic or cultural institutions can use the building in order to confront their ideas about Europe or to express or denounce new reality within Europe.","Performing Arts Centre","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-02-04","Architecture","Public Building","","Public Realm","",""

We show that the Simple Temporal Problem can be used to find schedules that satisfy the temporal constraints of the scheduling problem. However, when resource constraints are added, the STP is no longer sufficient. The problem can still be expressed using the Disjunctive Temporal Problem but this cannot be efficiently solved. Two algorithms are presented: a zero/one integer linear programming approach and an STP-based approach. In the STP-based approach we start with an STP that describes the temporal constraints. The STP is then iteratively updated until its earliest start time assignment corresponds to a valid solution to the scheduling problem. Experiments show that the ILP method is fast enough to produce optimal base schedules whereas the heuristic method is well suited to updating schedules with little disruption when changes have occurred.","scheduling; resources; stp; stn; ilp","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Algorithmics Group","",""

(mentor)","2011","One of the major challenges in drug development is the development of a drug-screening model that closely resembles the adult human heart. Currently many drugs are rejected in late stages of development and even withdrawn from the market due to possible cardiac tissue damaging side effects. The corresponding delay in drug development is mainly due to a lack in drug-screening methods, to determine these life-threatening side effects. Cultivation of human cardiac cells in vitro could provide such a drug-screening model. Human cardiac muscle cells can be derived from human embryonic stem cells. However, the cardiac muscle cells derived by culturing these human embryonic stem cells into cardiomyocytes (cardiac muscle cells) appear to be immature in relation to cardiac muscle cells taken directly from the adult human body. This immaturity results in a drug-screening model with limited predictability. The hypothesis of the Cytostretch project, a collaborative project between Leiden University Medical Centre and Philips Research, is that in vitro cultured cardiomyocytes subjected to in vivo mimicking mechanical stimuli (stretch), will show enhanced maturation. These mature cell cultures provide a good basis for future drug-screening models. A chip is developed containing a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) thin-film as a substrate for cardiomyocyte culturing. A pressure difference is applied to the membrane to obtain a strained membrane, which with anchored cardiomyocytes will result in cardiomyocyte stretch. In order to stretch cardiac myocytes in vitro, the development of an in vivo mimicking loading protocol is essential. The main goal for the presented study, therefore, is the development of a proper loading protocol for in vitro stretching of cardiomyocytes. To reach this goal two study objectives have been defined; investigation of in vivo cardiac muscle strain during a normal cardiac cycle and the determination of the PDMS thin-film behavior. For the determination of the in vivo cardiac muscle strain, the left ventricle was modelled mathematically. Assumed was a homogeneous stress distribution along the left ventricular wall, corresponding to a fiber direction course along the wall, consistent with anatomical findings. The relation between left ventricular fiber stress and left ventricle pressure showed to depend mainly on the ratio of cavity volume over wall volume. The left ventricle mechanics can be approximated by: Where ?f is the left ventricular fiber stress, Plv the left ventricular pressure. Vlv is the left ventricular cavity volume, Vw the left ventricular wall volume and ??f the natural fiber strain. The outcome of the mathematical left ventricle model led to the conclusion that the absolute left ventricular fiber strain between end systole (reference volume) and end diastole equals an approximate 14.7% for a healthy adult human heart during normal cardiac cycle. The PDMS thin-film behavior is modelled analytically with use of classical thin plate mechanics, considering large deformations. The analytical derived outcomes were subsequently compared with numerical and experimental results. The thin-film mechanics appeared to depend mainly on strain due to the extension of the membrane, and only little on strain related to bending. Moreover, the bending strain could be neglected when a pressure of 3kPa or more was applied to the membrane. It was concluded that an analytical model, simply supported around the edges, assuming a linear elastic homogeneous isotropic material, describes the membrane behavior properly. An analytical model with clamped edges was not able to deal with the small radius curvature at the edges due to the great flexibility of the membrane. The displacement field corresponding with the supported boundary condition was consistent with both the numerical approximation and the experimental data. The results of the analytical model showed that the order of the in plane displacement function u has major influence on the strain outcomes of the model. An in plane displacement function with two terms showe d a great strain variation across the membrane, whereas an in plane displacement function containing 5 terms showed a relatively homogeneous strain distribution, consistent with the numerical approximation. From the results of the analytical model the conclusion was drawn that the pressure-strain behavior of the two membrane configurations (circular and dogbone) differs. In order to obtain a maximum membrane strain of 14.7%, the applied pressure for the dogbone membrane should be 3.725kPa, whereas for the circular membrane the applied pressure should be 5.375kPa. Moreover, on the circular membrane, the transverse strain differs from the radial strain. The radial strain showed to be homogeneously distributed over the entire membrane, resulting in longitudinal equally stretched cardiomyocytes. The transverse strain however decreased from the centre outwards. In the centre section this will result in cells equally stretched longitudinal as well as transverse, however in the edge sections the cells will receive considerably lower stretch in the transverse direction. Some preliminary testing has been performed in stretching beating areas (clogs of cardiomyocytes) in vitro while applying the amount of pressure to the membranes as described above. The first set of experiments showed a maintained cell anchorage to the moving substrate for a long period of time (>120 hours). The second set of experiments showed detachment of the cells at increased pressures up to approximately 7kPa (for both configurations). From this we were able to conclude that a moving substrate has no detrimental impact on cardiomyocyte anchorage. Furthermore, from the detachment of cells at higher pressures than derived we are able to conclude that the pressure protocol will be in a correct range. The fact that the moving substrate has no detrimental impact on the cardiomyocytes indicates the great opportunities for the Cytostretch project.","Cardiac Myocytes; In Vitro","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-02-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Tromp, N. (mentor)","2011","Integration is still a hot topic in Dutch politics. Declining neighborhoods suffer from poverty, neglected social housing and an over-representation of inhabitants with a non-Dutch cultural background. These severe circumstances have had a strong influence on the youngsters that have been raised in these areas. The Ghetto culture has made his entrance in the declining neighborhood: Youngsters wearing coats with fur collars and golden teeth seem to terrorise neighborhoods. A covering term for this phenomenon amongst youngsters is ‘Street culture’. The district Loosduinen is situated in the city of The Hague, the Netherlands. It is an area where the Street culture has led to feelings of unsafety and deprovation amongst the inhabitants. This report presents a research on the social- cultural integration between the Street culture and Society, the Burger culture within the geographical context of the district Loosduinen. A product- service is developed to improve the social cohesion. The neighborhoods Houtwijk and Nieuw-Waldeck are part of the district Loosduinen. These two areas are the main focus within this project. The two neighborhoods are developed forty years ago. The former Dutch horticulturalists live together with families from various ethnical backgrounds. Neighborhoods where Dutch ‘white trash’ and foreign macho cultures are joint. Small social housing, poverty and dislocated families caused youngsters to spend most of their free time on the streets. The Street culture gives them the feeling to belong, to be part of a group. The youngsters reject against their parents, school, politics and society. They feel that society does not accept them. A common sentence used as an excuse for the derailed behavior is “Ze moeten me toch niet”. Stereotyping in the media confirms their exclusion form society. The future perspective from these youngsters is in contrast with their current behavior. They want a family, job and a house: The ‘normal’ life. Aggressive behavior and criminal activities have led to a vicious circle of distrust between the Street and Burger culture. The clash between the two cultures has led to less possibilities for youngsters to develop themselves within society. Youngsters hace difficulties with job applications. Recruiters and and youngsters distrust eachother as well. Derailed behavior and stereotyped valueing of a person feeds this distrust. Unemployment of youngsters makes the path of crime more appealing. This leads to more nuisance in society. A crucial condition to break through the vicious circle of distrust, is to take away prejudices. When less information is available about a person, stereotypes will be used to generate an opinion about someones personality. A good first impression is important to overcome a stereotyped impression. An interaction needs to be designed to give youngsters enough confidence to show who they are, instead of hiding behind their tough behavior. These insights have led to the development of the WorkTag. This Product- Service System (PSS) stimulates youngsters to apply for a job easy and quick, within the familiarity of the streets. The WorkTag consists of two main products; A Smartphone application and a Sticker. Combined, they give location based information about the type of work. Youngsters see the “Ik heb werk voor je” stickers on the streets. They scan the sticker via their application and see a video message with information about the work. When they like the video, they can directly apply for the job through a selfmade short video clip. The application gives instructions on how the youngsters should make the video. The fact that youngsters makes their own video, the application is within the safety of the streets and the application guides the process, enables the youngster to give a good impression. The video message is directly send to the mail Inbox of the recruiter. First qualitative testing has showed that youngsters react positive on the video applications. Important is that, when the youngster and recruiter meet in real life, prejudices are already taken away. A positive esteem on the video makes youngsters already feel more confident. The recruiter sees an individual in front of him. The video has already given a lot of (nonverbal) information about the youngster. The WorkTag is designed to give youngsters the confidence to express their most positive identity. The scientific relevance of this project can be found in two areas. First is that Product Design could be a useful tool in solving societal issues. Where sociologists and antropologists explain, design can change. Next to this is the scientific relevance on the research on video application. The first qualitative researches have a positive outcome. This first research could be the starting point for further research on this topic. It could prove if video application can be used on a large scale.","social design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","IDE","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","When performing minimally invasive interventions, surgeons use grippers to grip and manipulate tissue. These grippers generally rely on their toothed profile and require pinching of the tissue for sufficient grip, entailing a risk of tissue damage. An solution should be found for this risk of damage. An alternative could be to manipulate the tissue without pinching or even touching it. Contactless gripping exists in the industrial field by using the principle of Bernoulli. This study explores the possibility of applying Bernoulli gripping for tissue manipulation during minimally invasive surgery. A medical gripper using the principle of Bernoulli was developed. Increasing the air flow, the radius of the gripper face and the radius of the nozzle has a positive effect on the lifting force. In order to prevent tissue damage, different variants are tested that change the direction of the air flow. In an exploring experiment, a deflector was selected out of seven variants as best solution to prevent damage from the air flow. The Bernoulli gripper was made expandable and collapsible for insertion in the body of the patient with a system of living hinges. The effect of Venturi channels and the position of a membrane for an airtight surface on the lifting force were tested. The lifting force generated on the object during gripping was measured using a tensile-strength tester. Bernoulli’s theory was compared to the results of the experiments and a discrepancy was found between theory and results. This study shows that a Bernoulli gripper is feasible to lift flexible tissue.","Bernoulli gripper; deflector; Venturi channels; tissue manipulation; minimally invasive surgery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-28","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor)","2011","The Amstel oil field is located in block Q13a in the Dutch southern North Sea about 13 km off the coast of Scheveningen. The oil is trapped in an Early Cretaceous reservoir which is informally named Amstel Sandstone. At present, the production license of the field is held by Gaz de France Suez, TAQA Energy has a 10% share. The Amstel field is divided into four blocks (north, east, south and the central + west block, which are connected in the present study). The south, central and north block of the Amstel field are pop-up structures and are heavily faulted internally, thereby sub-seismic faults are likely to exist. The east block is more like an anticline containing few faults. The seismic top reservoir surface and faults are provided by the previous operator and are quality checked, matched to well markers and modified for modeling purposes. The structure of the Amstel field was found to be too complex for Petrel which is why Jewelsuite is used which allows the exact representation of the Amstel structure. The Amstel Member is interpreted to represent a barrier bar complex including barrier bars, tidal inlet channels, a back-barrier lagoon and washovers. The facies and property modeling is performed in Petrel (on a model without structure) and consequently imported into Jewelsuite. Using the truncated Gaussian simulation method, belt models are created for each zone in the Amstel field. The transgressive character of the sequence is modeled with marine distal facies belts to the north northwest and coastal proximal facies belts to the south southeast. Multiple belt models are created and merged to mimic the different transitions between the belts. The belts are filled with facies found in each belt individually and tidal channels are superimposed. Facies and zone dependent porosity distributions are used to populate the model. Net-to-gross and saturations are modeled subsequently. Facies dependent porosity-permeability relationships are proposed and are used in the models. Three static models of the Amstel field are constructed based on the extent in facies belts and the amount of reservoir facies in the back-barrier lagoon. Only one structural model of the field is used and no variation in petrophysical relationships is used. The base case model resulted in a STOIIP of 20.01 MMSTB. The volumes show a reduction of about 20% compared to the previous study which can mainly be ascribed to the difference in structures. Probabilistic STOIIP calculations result in a P90-P10 range of 17.6-24.5 MMSTB. Multiple development scenarios are simulated on the dynamic model. Recovery factors after 7 years range from 35 to 44%, where the lowest recovery is obtained by primary depletion and the highest recovery by the application of artificial lift, a horizontal well and water injection. Because the Amstel oil is light and considerable aquifer support from the flanks is expected, the reservoir reaches high recovery by primary depletion. The application of water injection, a horizontal well and down-hole selectivity is simulated and is considered unviable. NPV and DPI ranking show that minimalistic development scenarios are most viable where the separation and processing of reservoir fluids is done on the P15 facilities. A sensitivity study shows that the low and high case properties are most sensitive to the recovery.","Amstel; Field; Development; Truncated; Gaussian","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Petroleum Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Voordt, D.J.M. (mentor)","2011","Duurzaamheid is een overheersend begrip geworden in de maatschappij. Bedrijven willen steeds duurzamer ondernemen en ook de bouw lijkt hiervan in de ban te zijn. In steeds meer bouwprojecten is duurzaamheid zelfs een van de belangrijkste criteria geworden. Sommige opdrachtgevers beweren zelfs de duurzaamste te zijn. Andere zijn huiverig voor duurzaam bouwen, omdat het nog steeds de naam heeft duur te zijn. Probleemstelling Dit onderzoek is begonnen met de verwachting dat de duurzaamheidambitie duidelijk wordt omschreven in het Programma van Eisen (PvE). De literatuur beschrijft het PvE namelijk als het belangrijkste sturingsdocument in de bouw. Deskundigen beweren zelfs dat een goed PvE een van de succesfactoren kan zijn bij duurzame projecten. Er is echter weinig bekend hoe duurzaamheid in het PvE omschreven kan worden en wanneer dit in het proces dient te gebeuren. Het vroegtijdig vastleggen van de duurzaamheidambitie en aandacht voor de financiële consequenties van deze ambitie zou extra kosten kunnen besparen. Binnen deze ontwikkelingen van toenemende vraag naar duurzaam vastgoed is het interessant om te onderzoeken a) wat de duurzaamheidambitie van opdrachtgevers kan inhouden b) hoe dit wordt geformuleerd in het PvE en c) hoe hierop gestuurd wordt. Daarvoor zal de volgende vraag beantwoord worden: Hoe sturen Nederlandse opdrachtgevers op duurzaamheid in nieuwbouw en wat is daarbij de rol van het Programma van Eisen. Onderzoeksaanpak Het onderzoek bestaat uit drie fasen: De eerste fase bestaat uit een literatuurstudie, de tweede uit vier casusanalyses en voor de derde fase van het onderzoek is een zestal experts vanuit verschillende disciplines geïnterviewd. Op basis van de drie onderzoeksfases is antwoord gegeven op de hierboven genoemde vraagstelling. Het resultaat van het onderzoek is naast het doen van aanbevelingen een model ter verbetering van het proces. Het onderzoek is afgebakend op duurzame nieuwbouwprojecten binnen de utiliteitsbouw in Nederland. De nadruk ligt op het proces van de initiatief- tot en met de ontwerpfase. Er wordt alleen gekeken naar projecten met traditionele contracten. De casusselectie bestaat uit een viertal projecten, waarbij duurzaamheid nadrukkelijk is uitgesproken als ambitie. Wat de duurzaamheidambitie precies inhoud en het effect daarvan kan verschillen per project. Ook kan de rol van het PvE per project verschillen. Er is gekeken naar de ontwikkeling van de duurzaamheidambitie en welke stappen in de initiatief en ontwerpfase zijn genomen om de duurzaamheidambitie te realiseren. Daarbij zijn de volgende vragen beantwoord:  Wat houdt de duurzaamheidambitie van Nederlandse opdrachtgevers in?  Hoe komt de opdrachtgever van ambitie tot eisen?  Hoe zijn duurzaamheidambities en eisen geformuleerd in het PvE?  Hoe stuurt de opdrachtgever op de duurzaamheidambitie tijdens het ontwerp?  Welke invloed heeft de duurzaamheidambitie op het geld- en tijdsaspect? Na afloop van de casusanalyses heb ik hypothesen opgesteld die ik aan de hand van interviews met zes experts heb getoetst. Conclusies Dit onderzoek maakt onderscheid tussen ambities en concrete eisen. In interviews en literatuur wordt het woord ‘ambitie’ te pas en te onpas gebruikt. Men heeft het ook vaak over doelstellingen en concrete eisen. Het door elkaar gebruiken van deze termen zorgt voor verwarring. Het onderzoek spreekt van ambities wanneer een opdrachtgever iets wil bereiken, wat te vaag is om als eis te worden gezien. De ambities kunnen later vertaald worden naar eisen. Dit onderzoek heeft het dan over eisen die concreet en meetbaar zijn. Zo kan de opdrachtgever een ambitie uitspreken t.a.v. de flexibiliteit van een gebouw: “Het gebouw dient flexibel te zijn.” Een voorbeeld van een eis die hier aan verbonden kan worden is “tussenwanden dienen verplaatsbaar te zijn”. Initiatieffase Duurzaamheid is geen eenduidig begrip. Uit dit onderzoek is gebleken dat duurzaamheid op meerdere manieren valt te interpreteren. Het casusonderzoek laat zien dat de invulling van het begrip afhangt per project. Ook de geïnterviewden voor dit onderzoek hebben allen een andere kijk op de betekenis van duurzaamheid. Het blijkt dat opdrachtgevers zich voorafgaand aan het ontwerpproces niet altijd wezenlijk verdiepen in hun eigen duurzaamheidambitie. Duurzaamheid staat dan vaak als een enkele alomvattende eis geformuleerd in het PvE. Men verwijst in zo’n geval vaak naar een label, zoals GPR-gebouw, EPC of Breeam of men noemt termen als ‘Cradle to Cradle’ of ‘de duurzaamste’. Het uitspreken van een duurzaamheidambitie an sich is niet duidelijk genoeg om het ontwerpteam aan te sturen en de juiste beslissingen te laten nemen. De verschillende interpretaties van duurzaamheid kunnen namelijk voor verwarring zorgen bij het ontwerpteam. Vaak wordt de duurzaamheidambitie aangewakkerd, omdat opdrachtgevers waarde hechten aan een duurzaam imago. Dit imago is in sommige commerciële projecten zelfs de belangrijkste drijfveer. De duurzaamheidambitie van opdrachtgevers begint soms met alleen een ambitie op energiereductie en materiaal. Na gesprekken met een adviseur wordt daar soms een ambitie voor een gezond binnenklimaat bij uitgesproken. Door het betrekken van stakeholders van het project en het in kaar brengen van hun ambities, hebben overeenkomstige ambities door samenwerking een grotere kans van slagen. Een gezond binnenklimaat en energiereductie staan op gespannen voet met elkaar. Daarom leidt deze interpretatie van het begrip meestal tot een technische gecompliceerd ontwerp. Geen enkel PvE dat voor dit onderzoek is bestudeerd is, geeft prioriteiten aan, hoewel uit literatuur en interviews blijkt dat dit toch dient te gebeuren. Dit kan het ontwerpteam helpen de juiste keuze te maken wanneer eisen conflicteren. “Het ontwerp blijft een compromis”. Haalbaarheidonderzoek Eisen dienen op het budget te zijn afgestemd. Alleen bestaan er geen kengetallen, op basis waarvan een schatting gemaakt kan worden of een eis financieel haalbaar is. Om die reden wordt de haalbaarheidstudie gebaseerd op ontwerpverkenningen, waarin concrete duurzame toepassingen zijn verwerkt. Het budget kan dan geschat worden op basis van de kostprijs van deze toepassingen. Omdat de duurzaamheidambitie vaak een technische uitwerking tot gevolg heeft, kan hiervoor een technisch ontwerpdeskundige, zoals een installatieadviseur, worden aangetrokken. De haalbaarheidstudie en het formuleren van een weloverwogen ambitie vraagt om extra procestijd in de initiatieffase. Twee onderzochte casussen laten zien dat de opdrachtgever ook kan kiezen om direct aan de ontwerpfase te beginnen zonder eerst de financiële consequenties van zijn duurzaamheidambitie te onderzoeken. De opdrachtgever kan dan de expertise van het ontwerpteam gebruiken om de verschillende aspecten van zijn duurzaamheidambitie te bepalen en deze direct te vertalen naar het ontwerp. Financiële ramingen zullen dan op basis van het ontwerp worden gemaakt. De opdrachtgever loopt zo wel het risico dat of een gewenst ambitieniveau niet wordt gehaald of dat het budget hoger zal oplopen dan verwacht. Ontwerpproces De opdrachtgever stuurt in de eerste plaats op zijn duurzaamheidambitie door het selecteren van een architect waarvan de duurzaamheidvisie overeenkomt met zijn visie of een ontwerpteam dat ervaring heeft met duurzaam bouwen. De rol van het PvE tijdens de ontwerpfase, is afhankelijk van hoe de duurzaamheidambitie hierin is omschreven. Wanneer niet duidelijk uit het PvE naar voren komt wat de opdrachtgever met duurzaamheid bedoelt, kan de opdrachtgever zelf intensief bij het proces betrokken blijven om de duurzaamheidambitie mondeling over te brengen. Hij kan ook een externe duurzaamheidadviseur inschakelen die zijn rol als opdrachtgever overneemt en het ontwerpteam controleert. Een score voor een bepaald duurzaamheidlabel kan het ontwerpteam een richtlijn geven welk ambitieniveau gewenst is. Dit brengt wel een risico met zich mee. De labels meten duurzaamheid namelijk op basis van verschillende aspecten. De aspecten en de waardering per aspect sluiten niet altijd even goed aan op de specifieke duurzaamheidambitie van de opdrachtgever. Wanneer het ontwerpteam de werkelijke ambities van de opdrachtgever uit het oog verliest en zich slechts richt op het behalen van het label, bestaat de kans dat het ontwerp uiteindelijk niet conform de ambities van de opdrachtgever uitvalt. Reflectie De literatuur noemt ‘het aanzetten tot reflectie op de opgave’ een van de functies van het PvE. Het lijkt er echter op dat het opstellen van het PvE in duurzame projecten (twee casussen daargelaten) de opdrachtgever nauwelijks aanzet tot reflectie op zijn duurzaamheidambitie. De term ‘duurzaamheid’ lijkt door veel opdrachtgevers eenduidig gebruikt te worden. De formulering van de duurzaamheidambitie in PvE’s blijft vaak beperkt tot het noemen van een bepaald label, maar een beschrijving van een visie of motivatie blijft achterwege. Leden van de ontwerpteams lijken juist daar behoefte aan te hebben: “het formuleren van het ‘waarom’ is minstens net zo belangrijk”. Ook zal de formulering van ‘het waarom’ de rol van het PvE als communicatie- document verbeteren. Echter zal het PvE in dat geval nooit de gesprekken tussen opdrachtgever en architect kunnen vervangen. Aanbevelingen  Het verdient aanbeveling wanneer de opdrachtgever een afzonderlijke interpretatiefase inlast waarin hij zijn idee van duurzaamheid specificeert. In de interpretatiefase kan hij vermelden wat hij onder duurzaamheid verstaat en welke specifieke aspecten hij belangrijk vindt. Met name dient hij te vermelden waarom hij een duurzaamheidambitie heeft. Deze ambitie kan bijvoorbeeld voortkomen uit de visie van zijn organisatie en samenhangen met de hoofdactiviteiten ervan. Door het moeten formuleren van zijn motivatie, wordt hij gedwongen hierover goed na te denken.  De opdrachtgever dient zijn ambities uit te spreken op die aspecten, die volgens hem bepalend zijn voor de duurzaamheid van het gebouw.  De ambities per aspect kunnen op hun beurt vertaald worden naar een of meerdere concrete eisen. Aan energiereductie, kan een meetbare waarde worden verbonden. Ambities op andere aspecten zijn niet of niet direct in meetbare eisen weer te geven.  Het is aan te bevelen om de ambities van stakeholders in kaart te brengen. Overeenkomstige ambities zouden door samenwerking een grotere kans hebben gerealiseerd te worden.  Het is aan te bevelen prioriteiten aan te geven. Bij conflicterende ambities (hiervan zijn een gezond binnenklimaat en energiereductie een goed voorbeeld) kan men voorwaarden stellen. “Energiereductie dient geoptimaliseerd te worden, onder voorwaarde dat een gezond binnenklimaat gewaarborgd blijft”.  Wanneer men gebruik wil maken van een bepaald label dient de opdrachtgever erop toe te zien dat het label niet het doel wordt. D.w.z. dat men slechts ‘lijstjes’ van duurzame toepassingen afwerkt om een zo hoog mogelijke score te halen. Het label dient juist als middel gebruikt te worden, waarbij het ontwerp in de eerste plaats aansluit op de ambities van de opdrachtgever en vervolgens gecontroleerd wordt op het duurzaamheidnivieau.  Hoe eerder de duurzaamheidambitie wordt vastgelegd, des te meer tijd is er om voldoende middelen(budget) vrij te maken, die nodig zijn om de duurzaamheidambitie te realiseren.  Wanneer een snel proces gewenst is, kan men kiezen om na de ‘interpretatiefase’ direct aan het ontwerpproces te beginnen en een tijdrovende haalbaarheidstudie in de initiatieffase over te slaan. Men kan er dan voor kiezen minder rigide vast te houden aan of het budget of de eis. Conclusie De opdrachtgever kan pas sturen op zijn duurzaamheidambitie als alle betrokkenen begrijpen wat hij onder duurzaamheid verstaat. Ter bevordering van het begrip kan hij in het begin van de initiatieffase een interpretatiefase in lassen, waarin hij zijn idee van duurzaamheid specificeert. Dit kan door ambities uit te spreken op verschillende aspecten die volgens hem van invloed zijn op duurzaamheid. Na het duiden van de financiële consequenties van die ambities en het eventueel extra geld vrijmaken neemt de kans toe dat het gewenste ambitieniveau wordt gehaald. Wanneer de opdrachtgever zijn visie en motivatie opneemt in het PvE, vergroot dit de rol van het PvE als communicatiemiddel en reflectiedocument. Het selecteren van een ervaren ontwerpteam is vervolgens minstens zo belangrijk als een goed PvE.","duurzaamheid; programmeren; Programma van Eisen; bouwproces; opdrachtgever; ontwerpproces; initiatieffase; duurzaamheidlabel; duurzaamheidambitie","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-02-08","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Design & Construction management","",""

Hieruit kwam naar voren dat dit gebouw een stukje stadsuitbreiding werd en het heel belangrijk was om het stedelijk weefsel door te zetten in je gebouw. Verder was voor mij een ambitie dat ik een gebouw wilde maken dat in proportie stond tot de rest van de stad en de menselijke maat.

(mentor); Abbink, D.A. (mentor)","2011","An tele-operation, haptic feedback from the remote environment to the human is often limited, which has been shown to negatively influence the performance and required time of tasks. The conventional research focus is on improving the quality of the haptic feedback (transparency), which may have led to significant improvement, but is still imperfect, with many unresolved issues. The present study presents an alternative approach to improve tele-operated tasks: by offering haptic shared control in which both operator and support system apply the required forces at the input (master) device. It is hypothesized that virtual forces from well-designed shared control will improve required time and accuracy, with less control effort, and that these benefits exist for perfect transparency but even more so for imperfect transparency. In an experimental study haptic shared control was designed to aid operators (n=9) with performing a simple bolt-spanner task using a planar (2D, 3DOF) tele-operator setup. Haptic shared control was compared to normal operation for three types of control: the baseline condition of direct control at the master (perfect transparency), teleoperation with a simple PERR controller, and a PERR controller with feedback gains set to zero (no transparency). The experimental results provided evidence for the hypotheses, showing that all tested tele-manipulation tasks benefit from haptic shared control, for all three levels of transparency. Essentially, the presence of haptic shared control allows for a worse transparency without compromising accuracy or required time, and can even improve accuracy and required time during perfect transparency. Subjective results indicated that the shared control was perceived as helpful and beneficial.","tele-operation; haptic guidance; haptic shared control; transparency; task performance; human factors experiment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-01-26","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","IMS","",""

Users exchange commentaries and report problems about the video content through commenting. Tribler is, however, still lacking of the functionality of commenting. CommentCast is a fully distributed commenting system in Tribler based on the BuddyCast protocol stack. In this thesis, we improve the original design of CommentCast by augmenting different protocols working cooperatively to supply a fast, bandwidth-efficient and reliable commenting service. Then, we elaborate the protocol focusing on fast dis- semination. By comparing with gossip algorithm and flooding algorithm, we de- cide to use LightFlood [14], an algorithm combining pure flooding and spanning- tree broadcasting, to disseminate comments. Our experiments show that Light- Flood is a very fast and cost-effective dissemination algorithm. In order to study the knowledge of user commenting and evaluate our design, we collected the comment history of movie section of Verycd.com, a website providing P2P download resources. Since the movie section of Verycd.com has a similar context as Tribler, we take the collected comment history as a real workload for simulation of CommentCast. Finally, we investigate the performance of the push protocol of CommentCast by simulating the algorithm working under the real-world workload. Our simulation shows that the CommentCast is able to spread comments rapidly to a large number of users. At the same time, the bandwidth consumption is also realistic based on today’s network infrastructure.","dissemination; P2P; commenting; unstructured","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Parallel and Distributed Systems Group","",""

On a big scale we have the so called “Dorsale”, a linear city shaped by the transportation infrastructures, which was the rivers Sambre and Meuse (Maas) before, the railway afterwards and eventually the highway. On the very local scale the territory is obviously characterized by the huge industrial structures remained from the glorious past and the notorious terills, cone-shaped mining waste piles which can reach the considerable height of more than 150 m. The location I chose for my project is the resume of these aspects of Wallonia I introduced. The area is lying on the spine and there is now here an industrial area with the freight logistic Hub of Chrleroi-Chatelet. Moreover we have the biggest terill of Charleroi with 170 meters of height difference and an amazingly big abandoned industrial hall which could be one of the seven wonders of industrial architecture. When I went to visit the place I climbed up the terill and from there it was immediately clear the dichotomy between the city on one side of the Sambre and, on the other side, the hilly countryside of Wallonia. The industrial area is in the middle. It is like a wall separating the city from the river and the countryside on the other side. So I thought why not build up a scenario in which I have to redesign this industrial area and freight logistic hub in a way that is not separating but connecting the city to the river and the other bank of it, integrating it in the landscape, eventually making the infrastructure an architecture. Important to me was also keeping in my project the old industrial hall, not only as witness of the past, but also as a proof that these kind of buildings can be reused and create new quality.","post industrial cities; industrial redevelopment; infrastructural architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architecture","","Public Territory - Territory in Transit","",""

(mentor)","2011","Hoewel steden de mate van belangrijkheid van culturele evenementen voor de sociale cohesie in de stad erkennen, faalt over het algemeen de strategie tot het implementeren ervan in de stedelijke structuur en de stadsagenda. Hoewel de intentie er is om het stadsbeeld te verbeteren en om de straten meer leefbaar te maken (Richards & Wilson 2004, p.932), laat onderzoek zien (Zukin 1991) dat het hoofddoel van de steden toch vooral is om zoveel mogelijk bezoekers aan te trekken en om de stad op de wereldkaart te zetten. (Zukin 1991, cited in Quinn 2005, p.932). De lokale straten en pleinen worden gebruikt voor festivals en evenementen, maar wanneer er geen festival is, veranderen de plekken in zogenaamde ‘non-places’ (Augé 1995). Deze non-places zijn vaak kale en lege pleinen of parkeerterreinen met weinig randvoorwaarden. Wanneer er geen festival is, wordt de plek een publieke ruimte zonder publiek. Het is te eenvoudig om te zeggen: ‘add culture and stir’ (Quinn 2005, p.928). Een plek moet zowel interessant zijn ten tijde van een festival of evenement als wanneer dit er niet is. In dit project is onderzoek gedaan naar de meerwaarde van zowel groot- als kleinschalige evenementen in de stad om te komen tot multi-bruikbare openbare ruimten in de binnenstad. Het doel was te komen tot een flexibele inrichting van een plein en de omgeving, om te komen tot een aantrekkelijke en levendige publieke ruimte in het hart van de stad. De Rotterdamse Binnenrotte staat bekend als het marktplein, maar tevens als een tochtgat, een kaal plein waar niemand komt wanneer er geen markt. Met de komst van de markthal ontstaat er ruimte voor een nieuw ontwerp van dit plein. Belangrijk was om het plein een eigen identiteit te geven welke niet misstaat in Rotterdam en welke aantrekkelijk is in het alledaagse leven, maar welke ook voldoet als festivalplein.","Rotterdam; Binnenrotte; Evenementen; Festivals; Plein; out of scale; openbare ruimte; markt; flexibele inrichting; non-places","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-02-02","Architecture","Urbanism","","Urban Acupuncture","",""

A city experience is reduced to a number of words, images or stills that together create a mental context that collapses reality into a collage of singular biased perspectives. This episodic view of space is transformed and reshaped, reviewing the existing spatial field. A single view subsequently creates several new narratives. Every new perspective retraces previous steps. Within the limitations of personal perspective, space is sensorially presented from singular points at certain moments in time. From the collection of views, smells, sounds etc. we remember certain fragments and ascribe them with a personal value within a spatial context. Portrayed in memory these shreds of space leaves one switching back and forth between perceiving and projecting space. A Coptic Christian minority in Moqattam (garbage city) are Cairo’s informal waste collectors. Because there is no religious objection, they keep pigs that in turn are key in waste processing. Although this social and economic system is counteracted by the city to sanitise the area, these waste streams comprise a high potential. Apart from their financial value they have spatial implications on both an architectural and urban scale, considering the process from dumping to reselling. Similar to a bottle of wine recalling a specific event, the personal value of waste deteriorates when it’s discarded. Being part of a waste stream it ‘decomposes’ into smaller generic pieces, leaving only traces of memory. Spatially analogous to the waste process, these traces elaborate on past events to the point where it’s original shape has become unrecognizable. Retracing their origin allows for personal and speculative interpretations. This design for a waste processing plant in Cairo offers space for the Zabballeen to maintain the current waste system, also taking benefit from it on spatial level. While currently waste is stored within the domestic area, this plant allows families to dump, process, store and sell it again elsewhere.","boolean; cairo; border conditions; memory; mnemonic; waste; perspective; projection; mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Public Building","","Border conditions","",""

(mentor)","2011","Inter-Cultural Exchange Developing an architectural proposal in Ghana as a Dutch architect requires a self-conscious and critical position regarding the obvious socioeconomic disparities between the two countries. To achieve an appropriate architecture, patronizing tendencies of western work should be avoided whilst a realistic perspective into the local building industry should be established. A sensible approach to the geography and climate are also essential. Ultimately, instead of attempting to make a ‘typical’ Ghanaian building the design attempts to emphasize the confluence of Western and African design culture. Urban Acupuncture In response to the plans to destroy and rebuild the market as a Western modeled shopping mall this design proposes an alternative solution for redevelopment. First a series of personal mappings and anthropological work by Gracia Clark and AbduhMalikh Simone identified what important patterns and systems are essential to the markets functionality as well as what structural deficiencies need urgent attention. Based on the research a strategy of ‘urban acupuncture’ is proposed to reach maximum gain with minimal intervention in the market. This subtle intervention is crucial, because informal and social networks are fundamental to the livelihoods of local traders as well as the general supply and distribution logistics that define the market. Furthermore, market traders survive on a daily wage, which is little above the poverty-line. This thesis thus opposes the dislocation of traders, prolonged disruption of the daily routine, or the wholesale formalization of this vivid and dynamic system, and rather seeks to implement a structure that can gradually be built without requiring total transformation. Public Amenities However, while certain positive aspect of the current market are identified, there are serious deficiencies that cause discomfort for traders as well as customers of the market. Bad sanitation, overcrowding, fire-hazard, and bad access, amongst other issues, are part of a daily routine that is far from ideal. Based on interviews, and participation in a daily trading routine, certain problems were identified, and a design brief formulated. The final structure contains an Internet cafe, offices for market officials, a medical and daycare center, a kayayoo (girls that carry groceries) rest-place, a fire- and security post, toilets, and a water storage and acces point. Whilst the design doesn’t attempt to solve all issues and deficiencies, it shows that alternative more delicate strategies can significantly improve life on the market. Architectural Aesthetic Although a very cautious strategy was used for the intervention, the proposal uses architecture as an organizational device to make the generic form of the market more legible. In order to create a strong architectural presence, the main structure is lifted above the ground floor and uses a strong pattern based on Kente cloth to create a contrasting aesthetic with the homogeneous roofscape of rusty corrugated steel roofing. Given that the design anticipates expansion, appropriation and modification a clear modular structure is implemented that has a formal resilience and will remain a legible as an integrated yet autonomous architecture on the Kejetia Market.","market; anthropological; Ghana; Urban Acupuncture; Public amenities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","RMIT","","Studio Ghana","",""

(mentor); Verwaal, M. (mentor); Schipper, I.B. (mentor); Beeres, F.J.P. (mentor)","2011","Introduction Injury of the hand and wrist is a common phenomenon at the emergency department. Adequate treatment is required for proper healing. Unfortunately diagnosing the injury can be difficult. Only a small percentage of the patients visiting a doctor actually have a fracture. Initial standard radiographs are known to not show all fractures, and can provide misleading information due to the low prevalence of true fractures among suspected fractures. Assignment Recent research has shown that the likeliness of a scaphoid (carpal) fracture can be predicted by measuring and comparing maximum torque and range of motion (ROM) of pronation and supination, ulnar and radial deviation and dorso and volair flexion of both hands. In this graduation project a device is created to perform these measurements at the emergency department of hospitals and at the GP?s praxis. The ability to predict a certain type of injury is helpful in finding the optimal diagnostic strategy for a patient?s injury. Both patients and hospitals would benefit from this. Analysis In order to reliably measure torque around the wrist the patient?s forearm and upper arm must be constrained to prevent the patient from influencing the test with his body weight. The maximum torque in pro- and supination is influenced by the elbow angle, therefore this angle must be constrained as well. Torque must be measured with a 20Nm range and 0.5Nm resolution, ROM must be measured with a 120° range and 5° resolution. The amount of feedback patients receive during the test must be controlled, as this strongly influences the test results. Moreover, the device must have a friendly appearance, as patients will be in pain even before using it. Design Wrist torque is measured by four force gauges in perpendicular arrangement, which are build into a cylindrical handgrip. Before performing a measurement the estimated distance between the wrist and the center of the grip is measured, which is needed to calculate the torque in volar and dorsal flexion. During the test the patient?s arm is constrained by Velcro straps. ROM is measured by a 3-axis MEMs gyroscope, which is built into a lean stick. The gyroscope measures angular velocity, which is integrated to time to obtain the wrist?s angular displacement. Every measurement starts from the neutral orientation of the wrist, which is to be judged by physician and patient. Prototype A functional prototype is build. The measurements are performed using a LabVIEW application. This prototype can be used by researchers at the LUMC to validate the predictive power of ROM and Torque measurements in triaging injury of the hand and wrist.","diagnostic; hand; wrist; carpal; scaphoid; injury; fracture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master specialisation Medisign","",""

Therefore combining HTTP and BitTorrent is a candidate solution for dealing with phenomena like flashcrowds. But how to merge the HTTP and BitTorrent protocols?

(mentor); Van de Meer, J.D. (mentor)","2011","This graduation thesis is carried out for the company Johnny Loco. They started the brand Johnny Loco 5 years ago. The inspiration to start this brand came from the brand management strategy developed by Rijkenberg (1998). The brand Johnny Loco can be seen as a lifestyle brand that communicates a philosophy. Rijkenberg (1998) assumes that this philosophy will attract consumers who feel attracted to this philosophy. Johnny Loco started the brand with the development of bicycles. Nowadays they have extended the brand portfolio by sunglasses and bags and are developing an electric moped. The assignment of this graduation project is to develop a launch strategy of the Johnny Loco E-scooter that fit the brand philosophy. Therefore, the brand philosophy is analyzed internally and externally and the e-moped market is analyzed. These results concluded in a list of requirements for the launch of the Johnny Loco E-scooter. Brand image research is done. From the results it is concluded that some aspects needed to be improved by the brand identity. An improvement of the brand philosophy was made. The reviewed brand philosophy of Johnny Loco can be described as: Johnny Loco believes that a healty dose of self-willingness makes you more enjoy life. We live in a busy society in which there is a risc that you will get stuck in everyday routine. By making your own plans, you get somewhere, you will explore more and you will feel more relaxed. Johnny Loco believes that life needs more “Johnny Loco”: Don’t go with the flow, go Johnny Loco. This will attract a group of consumers, called followers, that can be described as: “A group of people that is getting tired of their busy lifes and are looking for moments to reflect their lifes and relax”. The electric moped market is in the introduction phase of the Product Life Cycle. Currently, only local brands have entered the market. Between 2011 and 2014, the A-brands will enter the market. The (electric) moped market is highly seasonal, most mopeds are sold in spring and summer. Therefore the Johnny Loco E-scooter will be launched in spring 2012. Both Johnny Loco and Wu’s Tech, the manufacturer of the Johnny Loco E-scooter, have no experience with an e-scooter. Therefore it is chosen to start with a specific testing phase. Only ten potential consumers will take part of the testing phase of six months. During this testing phase it will be analyzed if there are some flaws in the desgin and if the Johnny Loco E-scooter will fit consumer expectations about the brand. This testing phase will also be used as a marketing tool. It will be communicated to consumers as an exclusive opportunity. Participants will be treated as VIP’s which will stimulate rumor araund the brand and the product. The testing phase will start in spring 2011 and end in autumn 2011. This will give Johnny Loco the opportunity make some improvements to the Johnny Loco E-scooter before officially entering the market in spring 2012.","branding; launch strategy; Johnny Loco; E-scooter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-01-24","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

However, current underactuated grasp mechanisms suffer from an intrinsic stability problem which disables them to obtain a pinch grasp, hence they fail to grasp small objects. In an attempt to solve this problem joint locks are applied to an underactuated pulley-tendon driven hand. Joint locks might also have an effect on the power grasp strength. Therefore the effect of joint locks on the pinch grasp performance and power grasp strength of underactuated hand prostheses is investigated. This effect is quantified by two grasp performance metrics: the ability to pinch and the ability to hold. To find the optimal joint lock configurations for pinch grasp performance and power grasp strength, the effect of different joint lock configurations on both performance metrics is calculated using a static grasp model. The results of this model are validated by measurements on a prototype. Both the model and the measurements showed that joint locks do not have a significant effect on the pinch grasp performance when only the range of object sizes for which a pinch grasp equilibrium exists is considered. However, the measurements showed that a pinch grasp is more easily established with joint locks. Additionally, both the model and the measurements showed a significant increase in the power grasp strength.","underactuated prostheses","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-02-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

Between 1998 and 2001 alone about 300,000 jobs in heavy industry were lost. Job reduction results in a gradual loss in population. The older industrial areas and their affiliated housing estates are viewed today as the complicated regional heritage.

(mentor); De Lille, C.S.H. (mentor); Kistemaker, N.J. (mentor)","2011","This project aimed at figuring out how the user-centered design agency Muzus can adapt their way of working towards the needs and the approach of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Context research A context research was executed in order to map out the current development processes of both Muzus and product developing SMEs. Interesting findings were that some SMEs are not aware about involving users in the fuzzy front end of their design process and some SMEs are not aware of the added value of user-involvement at all. Also hiring external design agencies in their process is a big step. Muzus has troubles to surprise the SMEs with new insights, because the SMEs have so much prior knowledge about their target group and their product. Finally, Muzus has to reuse their tools and techniques, but without loosing the personal touch in the project. Design vision Based on the findings of the context research, the following design vision was formulated: “I want to design an SME tool that facilitates a product development process in which Muzus and the SME collaborate, in order to enable and enthuse the SME to use the tool independently afterwards.” Tool development The design vision was taken into account during the tool development. In the end, the tool development resulted in the Connect&Go approach. This approach consists of eleven steps, divided in three phases: Focus, User-insights and Concepts. These steps should be completed by following a structure that is based on four workshops. During the workshops, Muzus and the SMEs wrap up a previous phase and start a new one. By means of this structure, the client of Muzus is actively involved in these decisive moments of the approach. The work in between the workshops can be carried out in three different scenarios. In the first scenario, it is Muzus who carries out the major part of the work. In the second scenario, Muzus and representatives of the SME carry out the work together. In this scenario Muzus will transfer their knowledge towards the SME and thereby this approach has an educational character. The third scenario is available for experienced SMEs, who can carry out the work themselves and only need Muzus for some coaching. A set of techniques is compiled for every step of the approach. Muzus and the SME can select the techniques that are most suitable in a certain situation. Depending on the different scenarios, the SMEs are more or less involved in this selection procedure. Finally, seven types of support tools are developed to facilitate and visualize the Connect&Go approach. Some of the support tools consists of some support tools that are primarily meant for Muzus and other support tools that are mainly meant for the SMEs. Conclusion To conclude, the SME approach for Muzus lives up to the following guiding principles. The Connect&Go approach enables Muzus to reuse successful tools and techniques, without limiting Muzus’ the freedom to make every project unique. On top of that, the SMEs are enabled to work on their problem with an almost tailor-made approach, but not for a tailor-made price. The overview of techniques stimulates Muzus to use other techniques than only the traditional contextmapping technique, to anticipate better to the situation of their client. The Connect&Go approach aims at giving the SME insights in the process. Because of the active involvement of the SME, the entrepreneur gets the chance to contribute to the outcomes of the project. The three scenarios enables SMEs to make a long-term investment, by educating their employees. This enables Muzus to build a long-term relationship with their clients. In the end, it is this saying of Confucius that describes the collaboration between Muzus and their clients, as it is facilitated by the Connect&Go approach: “Tell me and I will forget, show me and I may remember, involve me and I will understand.” [Confucius]","SME; contextmapping; tool; design agency; Muzus; approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

The pressure on the leg influences the sailors performance while it causes muscle fatigue, inner tissue damage and overall discomfort. The Olympic thighpads consist of four layers; a supportive lining, protective layer, pressure reduction layer and connection layer. A - The inner lining is constructed without seams, a soft top layer and smooth edges, all to reduce friction and leg deformation. B - A canvas layer protects the battens from sticking into the leg. C - The tapered glassfibre battens effectively reduces pressure by spreading it over the entire leg surface. D - The outer lining supports the thigh. The pads are connected to the suit by Velcro, keeping them securely in place during the race.

(mentor); Davarynejad, M. (mentor); Vrancken, J. (mentor)","2011","Financial forecasting in general, and exchange rate prediction in particular, is an issue of much interest to both academic and economic communities. Being able to accurately forecast exchange rate movements provides considerable benefits to both firms and investors. This research aims to propose a decision support aid to these firms and investors, enabling them to better anticipate on possible future exchange rate movements, based on one of the most promising prediction models recently developed within computational intelligence, the Support Vector Machine. The economics of supply and demand largely determine the exchange rate fluctuations. Calculating the supply and demand curves to determine the exchange rate has shown to be unfeasible. Therefore, one needs to rely on various forecasting methods. The traditional linear forecasting methods suffer from their linear nature, since empirical evidence has demonstrated the existence of nonlinearities in exchange rates. In addition, the usefulness of the parametric, and nonparametric, nonlinear models, has shown to be restricted. For these reasons, the use of computational intelligence in predicting the Euro Dollar exchange rate (EUR/USD) is investigated, in which these previously mentioned limitations may be overcome. The methods used are the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The ANN, more specifically the Multilayer Perceptron, is composed of several layers containing nodes that are interconnected, allowing the neurons to signal each other as information is processed. The basic idea of the SVM is finding a maximum margin classifier that separates a training set between positive and negative classes, based on a discriminant function that maximizes the geometric margin. The model selection for the prediction models was chosen to be based on the bias-variance dilemma, which denotes the trade-off between the amount of variation within different estimators on different values of a specific data set (variation) and the difference between the estimator’s expected value and the true value of the parameter being estimated (bias). Experiments on the Mackey-Glass dataset and on the EUR/USD dataset have yielded some appropriate parameter ranges for the ANN and SVM. On theoretical grounds, it has been shown that SVMs have a few interesting properties which may support the notion that SVMs generally perform better than ANNs. However, on empirical grounds, based on experimentation results in this research, no solid conclusion could be drawn regarding which model performed the best on the EUR/USD data set. Nevertheless, in light of providing firms and investors the necessary knowledge to act accordingly on possible future exchange rate movements, the SVM prediction model may still be used as a decision-support aid for this particular purpose. While the predictions on their own as provided by the SVM are not necessarily accurate, they may provide some added value in combination with other models. In addition, users of the model may learn to interpret the predictions in such a way, that they still signal some sort of relevant information.","support vector machine; artificial neural network; financial forecasting; currency market; foreign exchange; computational intelligence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Section of Information and Communication Technology","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Lo, A.C.C. (mentor)","2011","Mobile voice service is already considered a necessity by many, and mobile data, video, and TV services are now becoming an essential part of consumers' lives. The number of mobile subscribers is growing rapidly and bandwidth demand due to data and video services is increasing. There is a need for capacity to increase in order for mobile broadband, data access, and video services to engage the end consumer. Device-to-device (D2D) communications underlaying cellular networks entails the ability of a cellular network to allow devices to communicate directly with each other in the operating (licensed) spectrum of the cellular network. With the application of specific rules and strategies, D2D communications offloads the mobile network and increases the spectral efficiency. In this thesis we developed a method for the application of D2D communication, controlled by a cellular network. By deriving the theoretical upper bound on the interference we have analytically derived equations describing the minimum distances to be maintained between simultaneously operating links, to achieve a given minimum SINR. We devised a strategy to group and schedule links which fulfill these minimum requirements, so that multiple links may operate simultaneously. We describe a power optimization method to minimize the number of groups to further improve the efficiency of the occupation of resources. Finally we performed simulations for various D2D scenarios, including a scenario representing a realistic urban environment, to illustrate the potential of this grouping and scheduling strategy.","D2D; Device-to-Device; Cellular Networks; Interference; Spectrum Sharing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-01-24","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Wireless and Mobile Communications","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","In opdracht van IMd Raadgevende Ingenieurs heeft Elise Bilardie, student Building Engineering van de Faculteit Civiele Techniek en Geowetenschappen van de TU Delft, haar MSc thesis naar de duurzaamheid van het herbestemmen van monumentaal industrieel erfgoed verricht. Hoofdgedachte van het onderzoek is door de mogelijkheden van monumentaal industrieel erfgoed goed te onderzoeken en te benutten ontstaat een zeer duurzaam gebouw. Het rapport beschrijft de hoofdzaken betreffende het herbestemmen van monumentale industriële gebouwen. De hoofdzaken reiken van kennis van de historie van het gebouw, regelgeving van toen en nu en de vele gebouwgebonden aspecten die van invloed zijn. Daarnaast is met behulp van het DuMo-rekenmodel van een drietal case studies uit de projectportefeuille van IMd Raadgevende Ingenieurs de duurzaamheid in kaart gebracht. Het DuMo-rekenmodel is ontwikkeld in opdracht van de Rijksgebouwendienst en heeft een Greencalc+ achtergrond. Met het model kan door middel van een LCA de belasting van het gebouw aan het milieu worden berekend. Evenals in Greencalc+ maakt het programma onderscheid tussen de materiaal-, energie-, en watergebonden milieubelasting, uitgedrukt in jaarlijkse milieukosten. Het model biedt daarbij inzicht in de duurzaamheid van het gebouw onder invloed van een herbestemming/renovatie doordat er een berekening van voor en van na de ingreep gemaakt kan worden. Bij twee van de drie case studies was de DuMo score in overeenstemming met de verwachting voorafgaande aan de berekening. Echter, bij één case studie, waarbij er sprake was van leegstand voorafgaande aan de herbestemming, was de DuMo score vele malen lager. Het model rekent de leegstand zeer zwaar mee in de berekening hetgeen resulteert in een zeer lage duurzaamheid. Dit correspondeert echter niet met de gevoelsmatige duurzaamheid van het gebouw. Een scenariostudie naar de duurzaamheid van het herbestemde gebouw in vergelijking tot nieuwbouw is als laatste toegevoegd aan het onderzoek van de case studies. Belangrijkste conclusie uit dit deel van het onderzoek is dat het herbestemmen een zeer grote materiaalbesparing oplevert. Deze conclusie sluit goed aan bij de gedachte dat een constructief ontwerper er altijd naar streeft om een zo efficiënt mogelijk constructief ontwerp te maken, daarbij het materiaal en de eigenschappen ervan zo goed mogelijk te benutten. De conclusies van het onderzoek zijn samengevat in drie thema’s: Kennis, creativiteit en ambitie. Per thema worden er richtlijnen beschreven die relevant zijn voor de groep constructieve ontwerpers die zich bezig houdt met herbestemmen van monumentaal industrieel erfgoed. De belangrijkste conclusies per thema worden vervolgens beschreven. KENNIS: Een gedegen inschatting van de kwaliteit en de draagcapaciteit van een casco en een fundering leidt tot een efficiënte benutting van het bestaande. Daarbij is kennis over de rekenregels van toen (T.G.B. 1949) en de rekenregels van nu (NEN 8700) noodzakelijk zodoende de bestaande constructie zo veel mogelijk te behouden en hergebruiken. CREATIVITEIT: In het MSc. thesis rapport zijn diverse projecten belicht waarbij op een creatieve wijze een nieuwe gebruiksfunctie in een bestaand bouwwerk is gerealiseerd. Deze creativiteit komt tot uiting door constructieve oplossingen evenals klimatologische ontwerpoplossingen. De constructieve creativiteit komt niet alleen tot uitdrukking door complexe oplossingen maar juist door eenvoud. Bijvoorbeeld door zo min mogelijk wijzigingen aan te brengen in de bestaande krachtsafdracht. AMBITIE: Om een herbestemmingsproject op een duurzame wijze te realiseren en ook daadwerkelijk te laten slagen is naast vakinhoudelijke kennis, ambitie een relevante factor. Een belangrijke ambitie zou moeten zijn het ‘niet bouwen’ gaat voor ‘het bouwen’.","duurzaamheid; monumenten; industrieel erfgoed; herbestemmen","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

The combination of these two topics intends to satisfy the Master’s theses of Civil Engineering at the Delft University of Technology and Quantitative Finance (Econometrics) at the Erasmus University Rotterdam. The first part relates to the Delft University of Technology, the second to the Erasmus University Rotterdam. Both parts are interrelated but can be read separately. Part A develops a model for APM Terminals to estimate costs of new terminals investments. Present-day estimates of APM Terminals insufficiently incorporate risk. Therefore, the study formulates and analyses six (new) estimation models. Differences in the model include the use of error distribution function or the incorporation of interdependency. The analysis subjects the models to various constraints and selects the most appropriate model for APM Terminals. The selected model requires little input information, uses normally distributed error distributions and accounts for shocks. Moreover, the study points out shocks are of great importance in the estimation of costs. Shocks increase expected costs and mainly determine cost uncertainty. The change of estimation model and occurrence of shocks implies that APM Terminals changes its estimation process. The new approach requires an estimate of both expected cost and uncertainty to estimate construction costs. Part B studies investments of projects subjected to cost uncertainty. Prior to construction investors have an idea of the value but not of the costs. Academic research assumes that cost uncertainty is composed of technical and input uncertainty (Pindyck (1993)). Technical uncertainty covers the physical difficulty to complete the project and is only known after completion. Input uncertainty relates to the pricing uncertainty of the required commodities to complete the project and is known beforehand. This study adds shocks to uncertainty because of the significant contribution to uncertainty (Part A). The research argues that shocks are a special form of technical uncertainty. Shocks occur after investing and complicate physical completion. But where technical uncertainty can accelerate construction, shocks solely delay progress. The study uses option theory to examine investments subjected to the different types of uncertainty. The analysis defines optimal investments and shows shocks increase the aversion to invest.","cost estimation; probabilistics; real options; investment under uncertainty; shocks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-20","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Het Science Business Centre is een inspirerende ontmoetingsplek tussen de science van de TU en de Business van Technopolis. Het ontwerp van het Science Business Centre borduurt voort op het ontwikkelde masterplan van Technopolis in Msc 3, waarin het Mekelpark doorgetrokken wordt tot de Thijssevaart. Het Science Business Centre staat in het Mekelpark, waarbij het wandelpad van het Mekelpark door het gebouw heen loopt. De patio’s en de transparante plint benadrukken de relatie met het Mekelpark. Het concept voor het gebouw is een tranparante, toegankelijke plint met daarin een aantal volumes. Deze volumes zijn gematerialiseerd met materialen die ook in het Mekelpark voorkomen wat de relatie met het Mekelpark versterkt. Eén volume stijgt op en wordt een toren die zowel vanaf de A13 als vanuit het Mekelpark zichtbaar is. Vanuit de toren heb je zicht op natuurgebied Midden-Delfland, de skyline van Rotterdam, Technopolis en de TU-wijk. Aan de zuidzijde grenst het SBC aan de Thijssevaart, waardoor er een sterke relatie met het water is. De plint heeft een industrieel karakter door de grote hoge entreehal met daarin de leidingen in het zicht. Net zoals de aula van de TU ligt het Science Business Centre niet geheel zichtbaar aan het Mekelpark. De toren is deels zichtbaar, maar de plint ligt verscholen achter de heuvels en bomen in het Mekelpark.

The need to assess this new strategic function of RWS originates from the fact that RWS lacks a tool to measure its purchasing performance. To what level has RWS professionalized its purchasing processes and activities? This question is quiet important since RWS strongly announces to become a professional and leading principal in the road infrastructure section.

(mentor)","2011","The main topic of this thesis is the business strategy of new Corporate Ventures, the so-called in our research Market Entry Strategy. We tried to find out how the Corporate Ventures formulate and implement the business strategy to enter new markets. The phenomenon of Corporate Venturing, the differences of Corporate and Independent Ventures, the factors that influence the strategy formulation process, the role of the parent organization in the stategy formulation and venture development in general, are the research questions we adressed during this study. We had the chance to observe the strategy formulation process in person by conducting an internship in Voltea's premises, a new venture owned mainly by Unilever. Voltea is developing a desalination technology, the Flow-through-Capacitor (FTC) techology, and currently is looking for commercial applications in order to enter into the market. We examined two markets and tried to formulate the optimal strategy based on a model we developed that assesses the market attractiveness, the corporate venture and the parent organization, namely the analysis of the resources and the skills that venture managers have at their disposal. Furthermore, it is analyzed the CEO personality and the corporate fit of the new venture with the parent organization, i.e. the operational relatedness and the strategic significance. We ended up with useful conclusions about the way corporate ventures operate and formulate their strategy. Undoubtedly, the most significant finding of this research is that business strategy for new corporate ventures should not be the first priority. On contrary, it is the structure and the organization of the new venture that has to be flexible and agile, that will lead the venture to the path of success.","corporate ventures; market entry strategy; flexibility and agility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Management","","MSc Management of Technology/Technology, Strategy & Entrepreneurship","",""

(mentor); Mulder, J.A. (mentor); De Croon, G.C.H.E. (mentor); De Wagter, C. (mentor)","2011","Today, there is an increase in the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's), for applications that can be considered dull, dirty or dangerous when compared to those applications of conventional aircraft or helicopters. To further increase the use of UAV's, their navigation filters must be robust and reliable. The trend in current autopilot development is defined by the ever decreasing size of vehicles leading to the creation of miniature Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) with low cost, low grade sensors. Small flying vehicles have fast dynamics requiring higher control rates and higher dynamic ranges with minimal available onboard computational capacities. Sensor and processing limitations have consequences for the achievable navigation performance. This in turn poses limits on the minimal vehicle stability, weather conditions and trajectory smoothness. The most important aspect and thesis goal is to guarantee the navigation filter solution robustness during all flight maneuvers. A navigation filter is an integration algorithm that provides a navigation solution on the vehicle's state vector from sensor data. This thesis focuses on one UAV platform in particular, namely small fixed-wing UAV's. One of the main challenges with designed navigation filters is that they can be theoretically stable but the outcome can sometimes not be used. In practice, the navigation filter outcome can give a diverging solution while theoretically stable. The goal of this thesis is to define the minimal requirements of sensors and other hardware for an INS such that the stabilization requirements posed by the vehicle dynamics and size can be satisfied. With the requirements stated, smaller and more dynamic fixed-wing UAV's can be stabilized based on the integrated navigation solution. The developed observability analysis tool is able to provide a quantitative analysis on the state observability that can be used to analyze different systems or sensor configurations. The observability matrix is composed of the system and observer dynamics. The system dynamics is based on the Inertial Measuring Unit (IMU) prediction of the system states, the observer equations correspond to the observer dynamics. A non-linear local observability analysis has been performed to calculate the observability matrix. The traditional Singular-Values Decomposition (SVD) algorithm provides the singular values of an observability matrix in a decreasing order and indicates the rank of the system. The rank of the observability matrix corresponds to the number of observable system states, the SVD can however not directly link the singular values to the system states. To overcome this problem a different matrix decomposition is used that is able to directly couple the singular values to the system states. This developed matrix decomposition algorithm is based on the QR factorization, called QRsvd. With this algorithm it is possible to quantitatively indicate the observability (degree) of each system state. An analysis into the physical properties of fixed-wing aircraft kinematics resulted in new insight into the movement of flying vehicles. Based on the derived kinematics together with the coupling of an IMU, GPS receiver and fixed-wing aircraft kinematics this resulted in new physical insight. This resulted in three angle correction (AC) equations that can be used as additional attitude/heading angle observers to the conventional IMU/GPS integration. With these three additional observers, the three orientation angles become instantaneously observable. Without the AC equations, a rotational rate constraint is always present to integrate the IMU with GPS. GPS receivers and IMU are separate, self-contained subsystems with different updating frequencies and processing times. Resulting clock differences are called time synchronization errors and result in filter estimation problems. A time synchronization requirement is derived, which is a function of changes in vehicle accelerations and filter innovation. The time synchronization requirement is proportional to the magnitude of the change in vehicle accelerations a and negatively proportional to the magnitude of the identification filter innovation. Vehicles with fast dynamics, like fixed-wing UAV's, can have larger changes in vehicle accelerations magnitude, resulting in a more stringent time synchronization requirement. Based on performed simulations and verification with flight test data, it can be concluded that the improved IMU/GPS filter with AC equations can provide a stable long-term navigation solution with accurate short-term performance, by using (Iterated) Extended Kalman filters. During the performed simulations the position states give the largest source of error, due to the large GPS position uncertainty. For the three orientation angles, the heading angle has a larger identification error compared to the pitch and roll angle. For the orientation angles, the influence of atmospheric wind on the identification performance is minimal except for the heading angle due to the presence of a side-slip angle beta. Coordinate transformations between the Earth, North-East-Down (NED) reference frame F_E and the body-fixed reference frame F_B can be performed using a rotational transformation matrix R_BE. The antisymmetric matrix R_BE holds special properties that can be utilized and fits in the category of Special Orthogonal Lie groups with a dimension of three, called SO(3). Based on SO(3) group properties, a non-linear complementary filter can be constructed that uses this matrix as a single state. The non-linear complementary filter on the SO(3) group, can be used as an alternative to conventional Kalman state identification filters. For (I)EKF the heading angle is the largest source of error of the attitude/heading angles, this is also the case for the SO(3) filter. Differences between the SO(3) filter and (I)EKF are due to two aspects. The SO(3) filter uses constant proportional and integrator gains, where Kalman gain matrices include process and observer uncertainties. The other source of differences can be found in the strong coupling between the individual attitude/heading angles for the non-linear SO(3) filter compared to (I)EKF.","UAV; IMU; GPS; Kalman; filtering; identification; observability; Lie groups","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-06-01","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Simulation","","","",""

(mentor); Westgeest, G. (mentor); Rocco, R. (mentor)","2011","In this work I investigate, what I have called ‘the paradox of urbanization’, through the case of Rio de Janeiro. The paradox of urbanization is a process in which the qualitative impulses - improvements of urbanization, such as public infrastructure and facilities - are planned and implemented in central neighborhoods, while the quantitative rate of urbanization - the strongest growth of the city in terms of residents - takes place in the peripheries of the city. In Rio de Janeiro the paradox of urbanization has resulted in a divided city, in which rich and poor neighborhoods are separated, and exist as closed and partially autonomous communities. The prosperous central neighborhoods were facilitated with parks, pavements, and public buildings, while the peripheries were developed with private means: residents paved their own sidewalks, and companies provided collective buildings and facilities. Based on the work of Ananya Roy, I propose a role for architects and planners that I shall indicate as ‘the aesthetization of urbanity’. I propose that architects and planners should create spaces for public functions, with a substantial urban qualitity that transcends the interest of a particular community, and adopt the common norms of society as a standard for their representation. The aesthetization of urbanity is a response to community based, self-help projects: using similar architectural means in the peripheral zones as one would use in the centre, to give the peripheries a qualitative impulse that trancends local interests, and make the peripheries an integral and established part of the city. The qualitative improvements in the peripheries should be of substantial architectural quality as a mean of representation of state interest in the poor peripheries, should be in the interest of society as a whole and not only a local community, and should create opportunities for residents in the peripheries of the city through public means.","paradox of urbanization; Rio de Janeiro; Brazil; aesthetization of urbanity; informal architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-02-02","Architecture","Architecture","","Explore Lab","",""

(mentor)","2011","Het onderzoek Het gebied ‘polder Westzaan’ is een uniek brakwatergebied in Europa en dankt zijn bijzondere flora en fauna aan het brak oppervlaktewater. Sinds de Zuiderzee in 1932 werd afgesloten en het IJsselmeer ontstond, wordt nog hoofdzakelijk zoet water in het gebied ingelaten. Het gaat om een gebied van circa 900 ha in de natuurgebieden Guisveld en De Reef. Door het inlaten van het zoetwater vanuit de Zaan, menging van het water met meststoffen en de afbraak van laagveenvegetaties is het water in polder Westzaan onnatuurlijk voedselrijk en troebel geworden. Dit heeft gevolgen voor zeer zeldzaam brakwater vegetatie en bijbehorende aquatische fauna. De oorspronkelijke natuurwaarden van het gebied staan onder druk door de verzoeting van het gebied. De doelstelling van dit onderzoek is het ontwikkelen van maatregelen in het waterbeheer voor het verbrakken van de noordelijke deel van polder Westzaan. Onderzocht wordt, hoe het chloridegehalte van het openwater van polder Westzaan kan worden gehandhaafd op het voor de ecologische systeem gewenste niveau van 2000 mg/l, zonder dat dit leidt tot problemen voor de waterkwantiteit zoals hogere peilen en wateroverlast. Om de bovengenoemde doestelling te behalen is er een model ontwikkeld waarbij het water ingelaten wordt vanuit het Noordzeekanaal. Onderdeel van het onderzoek is daarom in eerste instantie het bepalen van een tracé van het Noordzeekanaal naar het noordelijke gedeelte van de polder. Hierbij wordt water uit diepere lagen van het Noordzeekanaal als brakke bronstroom gebruikt. Methodologie Voor het verkrijgen van inzicht in het waterhuishoudkundig functioneren van het watersysteem van polder Westzaan en van de te ontwerpen maatregelen, is gebruik gemaakt van het Sobek instrumentarium met de modules Channel Flow (CF), Rainfall Runoff (RR), Water Quality (WQ) en Real Time Control (RTC). In eerste instantie is het huidige watersysteem geanalyseerd. De huidige dimensies van de watergangen en kunstwerken zijn bepaald op basis van de gegevens van het Hoogheemraadschap. Het nieuwe tracé met benodigde kunstwerken zijn in een veldbezoek bepaald. Dit tracé is in overleg met het Hoogheemraadschap van Hollands Noorderkwartier en de Dienst Landelijk Gebied definitief gemaakt. Op basis van de randvoorwaarden en de uitgangspunten zijn de benodigde afmetingen van nieuwe watergangen en kunstwerken zoals stuwen, duikers en sifons doorgerekend. In het hoofdstuk Methodologie is verder ingegaan op deze randvoorwaarden en de uitgangspunten. Voor de berekening van de benodigde dimensies van watergangen en water kunstwerken is gebruik gemaakt van het door de DLG ontwikkelde berekeningsmodel Water SF. Deze ontwerpgegevens van watergangen en kunstwerken zijn, samen met de bestaande watergangen en kunstwerken, vervolgens in het SOBEK model ingevoerd. De maatvoering van het nieuwe tracé is verder verfijnd in SOBEK door steeds de resultaten met gewenste resultaten te vergelijken. De gebiedsregeling voor zowel waterkwantiteit als waterkwaliteit is geprogrammeerd in het programma Matlab. Door de afstemming tussen SOBEK en MATLAB is het eindresultaat van het model bereikt. Resultaten Voor de modelberekeningen is uitgegaan van 3 scenario’s. De scenario’s zijn zodanig gekozen dat er voor een korte droge periode (15 dagen), een lange periode(een jaar) en nat, en een lange periode(een jaar) en droge situatie berekeningen worden uitgevoerd. Als scenario 1 is gekozen voor een korte droge periode (eerste helft van april 2009), als scenario 2 voor een nat jaar (1998) en als scenario 3 voor een droog jaar (2003). De gewenste waterpeilen worden niet overschreden bij enkele gevallen na tijdens een natte periode in 1998. Het gewenste chloride gehalte van minimaal2000 mg/l wordt bereikt met uitzondering van enkele dagen in 1998 in verband met zeer natte omstandigheden. De gemalen functioneren goed voor alle scenario’s. Na een week inlaten van water zijn de effecten van de verbrakking te zien in het gebied. In een nat jaar als1998 wordt een chloridegehalte van 2000 mg/l na een maand bereikt. Door het ontwikkelde meet en regelsysteem kan dit in stand worden gehouden.","verbrakking","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-05-04","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor); Vrijling, J.K. (mentor); Van Gelder, P.H.A.J.M. (mentor); Van Lint, J.W.C. (mentor); Taale, H. (mentor); Wiggenraad, P.B.L. (mentor)","2011","In hydraulic engineering it is known that for the evaluation of the performance of a system, a probabilistic approach is preferable to a deterministic one. The essence of such a probabilistic approach is that random variability/uncertainty is explicitly taken into account. In this graduation project, this probabilistic way of looking at a system is applied to the traffic system, in the context of analyzing (ways to alleviate) traffic congestion. Basically, the mechanism behind traffic congestion can be described as a process of interaction between the traffic demand and supply on a road network. Both this traffic demand and supply show a significant level of temporal variability, which makes the resulting traffic conditions variable as well. Traditionally, in evaluations of the effectiveness of proposed congestion relief measures this variability is taken into account only in a limited or simplified way, or even not at all. Often simply a kind of ‘representative’ situation is calculated. The main objective of this research project was to reveal what kind of new insights can be obtained if we actually do explicitly/systematically take into account the variable nature of daily motorway congestion. After a comprehensive study into the sources of the variability in the traffic conditions, and the selection of appropriate performance indicators, a quantification model was developed. The main principle of this model is that a large number of traffic simulations are performed for varying traffic demand and supply values. Subsequently, the desired performance indicators are computed from the combined set of simulation results. In order to explore the (potential) new insights obtained by explicitly considering the variability, the developed model was applied to a reasonably sized real-life motorway network. From the results it is clear that a ‘representative’ calculation (in which all demand and supply variables are taken at their ‘representative’ level, which for example could be the mean or median value) does not give a good impression of the performance of the traffic system. It underestimates the congestion in certain respects, and – obviously – does not provide information on the uncertainty in travel times (which is an important factor in the societal costs of traffic congestion). The research has shown that if the variability in traffic is explicitly considered, new insights can be obtained into the relative importance of different (variable) influence factors. This was demonstrated by ‘deactivating’ these influence factors in the model (one at a time). The results of this demonstration indicate that the capacity variations due to the intrinsic randomness in human driving behavior play a central role in (peak period-related) congestion. Such information yields important insights into how traffic congestion can be remedied most effectively. By considering the example of a rush-hour lane, the research has shown that new insights can also be obtained into the effectiveness of specific measures that are proposed to alleviate traffic congestion. It turned out that the ‘traditional’ way of evaluating may actually result in a significant underestimation of the benefits of a measure. The precise nature and extent of the additional/revised insights will be highly context and measure specific, however. Of course, these new insights are not necessarily all positive in nature. Some more negative aspects of a measure could be brought to light as well. The above implies that in practice more systematic attention should be given to the variability in traffic, when evaluating the effectiveness of measures that are proposed to alleviate congestion. Because of the complexity involved, this would have to be done by using a model in which the different sources of variability are explicitly accounted for, such as (a further developed version of) the model developed in this project.","traffic congestion; variability; probabilistic; measures; evaluation; performance; traffic demand; traffic supply; variable; representative; randomness; stochasticity; stochastic; effectiveness; alleviate; traffic conditions; motorway; variation; variations; evaluations; simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering / Transport & Planning","","","",""

The absence of social cohesion among neighbors also disrupts their willingness to intervene on behalf of the common good. Phenomenons like social control and keeping the neighborhood clean are not common in this neighboorhood. It is therefore desirable to focus on the ability of self regulation: if inhabitants are willing to solve problems in the neighborhood by themselves, without intervention of formal authorities such as the police, the livability of the neighborhood will grow and so will the social cohesion. Thus the assignment in this project was formulated as follows: Develop a product or product/service combination that will strengthen the social organization of the Afrikaanderwijk.","social design; DfI; Implication Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Desgin Aesthetics","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

For this reason, it is beneficial to prevent structural failure to occur at all in a worst case scenario. Many countries around the world incorporate the Rijkswaterstaat fire curve (RWS curve) as a worst case heat loading scheme on the lining. The RWS curve is the result of research on large hydrocarbon pool fires in tunnels (e.g. due to an accident with a 50m3 gasoline truck).

It needs a solution at young age to prevent these problems. The current eating behaviour of families has to be changed, since this is one of the main causes of these problems. From birth, taste have to be developed by experience; therefore, families need to be encouraged to eat more variedly. Context study shows that the family’s current eating habits are less varied-, routine based- and convenient eating patterns. This is a result of the parents’ desire to avoid the struggle which dinner can be because children do not like the new tastes. This vicious circle originates from the interaction between both parents and children. The product service ‘Groenten Gekkies’ is developed in order to stimulate varied eating of vegetables. It consists of a weekly changing box that can be bought at the vegetable section of Albert Heijn. The cardboard box contains of four different vegetables, each with an evaluation sticker. Four easy recipes are printed on the box. Families can buy the box and decide to follow the recipes printed on the box. The other necessary ingredients can be bought separately. Once at home the box will be an unpacking experience for the children. Before dinner the parents can cook the recipes and children can be involved with the suggestion on the recipe. The recipe can be placed in front of a webcam in order to see some funny and interesting facts about the vegetable. After dinner children can rate the recipe, by placing the sticker provided with the vegetable on the recipe card. When scanning the recipe with the webcam it gives an online ratings and you can see the rating of other children. The product fits the buying routine of families that go to the grocery shop once a week. Next to that it improves the social elements of dinner by cooking, eating, and talking together with the children. This makes it rewarding for parents to use. The reason why families would buy the product is because it is convenient: you do not have to think what you will eat during four days and you will have ingredients at home to cook new dishes. It is persuasive because children will ask for it. Children enjoy the product because they can explore the box and the vegetable, physically and digitally. They like helping to cook and it is rewarding to rate the recipe and to compare the rating with other children.","children; food; eating behaviour; supermarket; families","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-01-07","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Meyer, V.J. (mentor); Molenaar, W.F. (mentor); Waals, J. (mentor)","2011","The flood defence in the historical town centre of Dordrecht is situated in the Voorstraat, which is a busy shopping street. The dike itself is too low at some places, but with a system of flood stop logs in the doors of buildings along the street some extra height can be reached. The reliability of the stop log system is doubted however, so plans for strengthening the flood defence are needed. One important issue for strengthening the flood defence is the climate change. Warming of the earth would lead to sea level rise and higher river discharges. The rate of climate change is unsure however and various scenarios have been made which range from minor to major changes. The water level at Dordrecht is determined by both the sea level and river discharges, so climate change could have severe consequences for the safety against flooding of Dordrecht. When the advice of the Delta Committee is followed, the safety standards of the dike rings should be heightened and much higher water levels have to be expected. Also the plans for the Rijnmond-Drechtsteden area are important for the strategy of strengthening the flood defence in the town centre of Dordrecht. A system of barriers in this area could protect Dordrecht against flooding, but it is also possible that strengthening the flood defence in the town centre of Dordrecht is still needed. Strengthening the flood defence in the Voorstraat is difficult. Therefore also a new flood defence through the part of the town centre which now lies outside the flood defence is considered. Various alignments are possible, of which a flood defence along the river, which protects the entire town centre against flooding has been elaborated. This new flood defence will consist of an automatically floating barrier in the quays. Under normal circumstances this barrier is invisible and when the water level rises the barrier automatically floats up. At one part of the alignment buildings stand with the facades directly along the river. Here a boulevard through the river will be made, separated from the buildings. By integrating the floating barrier in the structure the boulevard can be kept low. Inside the flood defence there is place for a marina and a swimming area. At five places in the alignment a harbour has to be crossed. For this purpose at four places a flood gate will be made, which under normal circumstances lies at the bottom, so it is not visible and ships can pass. When a flood is expected the gates are closed. At one place, at the largest harbour crossing, a multi-functional barrier will be made. This barrier consists of two gates which stand horizontally when retaining a flood. After the flood the gates are lifted and rotated to form a bridge and viewing platform over the harbour. Because of the floating barrier the largest part of the new flood defence will not be visible under normal circumstances, so it will have little impact on the historical town centre. Therefore it is a good and sustainable solution for protecting the entire town centre of Dordrecht against flooding for a long time.","flood defence; Dordrecht; Voorstraat; climate change; floating barrier; barrier","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","With the advent of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, it becomes possible to use these vehicles to acquire photogrammetric images in a more cheap and flexible way compared with conventional photogrammetry from a full-sized airplane. A big factor in costs and resources in conventional photogrammetry is signalling and measuring ground control points, which are necessary to determine the location and attitude of the photos. Eliminating the need for ground control points would make the photogrammetric process much less costly and labour intensive. A UAV contains navigational sensors (a GPS receiver and a Inertial Measurement Unit) for it's own navigation. The output of these sensors can also be used for the orientation of the photographs. However, the accuracy of these sensors, especially low cost off-the-shelf sensors, is limited. This thesis concentrates on determining the accuracy of low-cost navigational sensors and the effect of inaccuracies in these sensors on the result of the photogrammetric product: a Digital Terrain Model. Using a UAV developed by the company Heering UAS, founded by Pieter Wijkstra, the effects of inaccuracies in the GPS receiver and the IMU in the UAV on the outcoming Digital Elevation model has been tested. First the theoretical effects of inaccuracies of navigation sensors on the final product is investigated, using the photogrammetric collinearity equations. To validate the theoretical results, a number of tests has been carried out using an available platform with an off-the-shelf camera and dito navigation sensors. A first test, using flight data and photos taken at the unfinished A4 highway site just south of Delft, shows the sensitivity of the final model to errors in the navigational sensors. This test did not give enough data though to give enough insight in the effects of navigational sensor errors. Therefore a second test was carried out using a larger photoblock flown at the dyke of the river Lek at Ammerstol. This test showed that the errors in the terrain model caused by errors in the on-board GPS receiver follow the results of the theoretical simulation. However, because at the time, the UAV did not contain a reliable IMU, the effect of IMU errors could not be tested. So a third test was conducted, using an off-the-shelf IMU combined with a high accuracy GPS receiver to asses the effect of errors in the IMU on the resulting terrain model. The results show that off-the-shelf navigation sensors are not accurate enough to produce a reliable end result. Therefore eliminating ground control points would result in a final product which is not accurate enough. Using the available navigation sensors it is possible to reduce the amount of ground control points.","UAV; photogrammetry; accuracy; GPS; Inertial Measurement Unit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Optical and Acoustic Remote Sensing","","Msc Geomatics","",""
