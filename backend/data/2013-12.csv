(mentor); Spanjers, H.L.F.M. (mentor); Kleerebezem, R. (mentor); Zhang, X. (mentor)","2013","The marine/ brackish recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) is a sustainable and environment-friendly cultivating system to meet the increasing demand of aquatic animal protein for the human consumption. However, the increasing amount of aquaculture waste becomes problematic for further application and demands much research attention on it. To solve this problem, a project “emission minimization of marine/brackish aquaculture recirculation systems “ was proposed, which aims to minimize the emission of brackish RAS and improve bio-energy yield as well as recovery phosphorus in the form of struvite. The current thesis working is a part of this whole project. The objectives involved here could be divided into four main parts : (1) to investigate the performances of CSTRs at different organic loading rates (OLR) and under different mixing regimes; (2) to investigate the effect of inorganic coagulants on methane potential of saline sludge and to investigate the effect of compatible solutes on methane potential of saline sludge, (3) to investigate effects of compatible solutes and shear forces from biogas recirculation on phosphatase activity (PA) (4) to investigate variation of particle size distribution of struvite at different Mg/P molar ratios, at different temperatures, or at different pH levels. To achieve goals described above, three similar CSTRs were setup in lab-scale and operated for almost one year. Reactor performances were monitored by weekly analysing of essential parameters, including TSS, VSS, tCOD, sCOD, TN, TP, etc. Some batch or jar tests were also carried out during experiments. (1) The steady state was obtained in all three CSTRs with inoculum adapted to high salinity already. A higher OLR could cause an increase in specific CH4 yield. The impeller-stirring enhanced the specific CH4 yield compared with biogas recirculation. (2) Methane potential of saline sludge was improved 5% at the presence of 0.5g/L trehalose, whereas it was inhibited 18% and 5% by addition of PAS at 2.4gAl3+/L and FeCl3 at 6.0gFe3+/L, respectively. (3) Addition of 0.5mM or 1mM trehalose enhanced acid PA in saline sludge during the digesting period of 0.25h-72h. A high level of shear stress from biogas recirculation could stimulate both acid and alkaline PA during the digesting period of 0.25h-12h. (4) The optimum conditions in synthetic brackish solution for harvesting more struvite with large sizes and obtaining a higher P-removal efficiency were that Mg/P molar ratio approached to 1, and pH was maintained at 8, and temperature was kept at 25 or 35°C. However, the conclusion referring to Mg/P was not applicable to the filtrate from R2, and more research would be required to verify the application of other conclusions to the filtrate of digestate.","anaerobic digestion; brackish RAS; CSTR; methane potential; phosphatase; struvite","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

Nowadays, a major problem that the Dutch building industry is facing is the high vacancy rate of office buildings. The available solutions for the vacant offices are transformation or demolition. Transformation is the best solution but it is not always possible due to the high costs. On the other hand demolition leads to a big pile of concrete debris which can be processed and recycled. It is a sustainable solution but it still demands a lot of energy. Another issue that is caused from the building industry is that the manufacture of new elements leads to the depletion of raw materials and increases global warming. It is possible to further reduce the energy used for recycle and minimize the environmental impacts of producing new elements by reusing existing elements. Furthermore it is a smart solution since the technical lifetime of a concrete element is approximately 200 years. In order to identify the technical obstacles of reusing structural elements the whole reuse process was analyzed. The analysis was made with extended literature research, discussions with experienced professionals with different specialties and final with a detailed analysis of a case study.","reuse; concrete elements; vacant office buildings; sustainability; deconstruction; Amstel III","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Building Technology & Physics","",""

(mentor); Van Duin, J.H.R. (mentor); Cunningham, S. (mentor); Pronk, M. (mentor)","2013","Corbion-Purac is an expert partner in technology- and application development for Poly Lactic Acid (PLA) and the worldwide market leader in Lactic Acid, Lactic Acid derivatives and Lactides. From five production locations products are distributed over the whole world. To manage the logistics of the Supply-Chains, forecasts of the demand are used extensively. The challenge for this master-thesis project is to support Purac in improving the forecasting performance. Forecasting performance is defined as the efficiency of the forecasting process. This means that besides the forecast accuracy, the required effort is also important. If less effort is required to get the same accuracy, this is seen as a better forecasting performance. First, a thorough analysis of the forecasting practices at Purac was done. This lead to a list of nine measures that can help to improve the forecasting performance of Purac. Seven of the nine measures concern statistical time-series forecasting. So, there is a strong focus in this list on statistical time-series forecasting. The reason is that the process that leads to the judgmental forecasts was found to be quite well organized. It has the right incentives, checks and balances and the people that have the most knowledge of the client and market are ultimately responsible for forecasting. Explanatory models have also been left out, because these are more difficult, currently not used and require different data. The list of nine measures was shrunk down to a smaller set of five promising measures. This is done with the following two selection criteria: ease of operation (use and maintenance) and ease of implementation (in ICT-system). For each selection criterion a questionnaire was made. The combined end-results of this lead to a reduction of the list of nine measures to a shorter list of five measures: totally freeing the t-2 forecast for products with a KPI based on the t-1 forecast, optimized parameters for forecasting models (Moving Average and Single Exponential Smoothing), selecting optimal forecasting method, optimization based on the fixed period of a product and using alternative loss-functions for optimization. For these five measures a quantitative analysis is done. The five measures were tested on 85 products for which already a statistical forecasting method is used at Purac. The increase of the accuracy of the statistical forecast by totally freeing the t-2 forecast is estimated to be around 1,5%. The effect on the final forecast is estimated to be 2,3% for the Alif (?) and 1,6% for the S?n (?) region. Using optimized parameters for the forecasting methods can considerably improve the forecast accuracy of the statistical forecasts. For the products for which the Moving Average (MA) method is used, this is estimated to be 20% and for the Single Exponential Smoothing products around 5%. Optimizing the forecasts on the fixed period does not have any effect on the accuracy. For the other tests the results were inconclusive. To gain more confidence in the wider applicability of the results detailed testing was done regarding: the optimized models compared to judgmental forecasting, the relative performance with different loss-functions, the relative performance of three alternative forecasting methods (MA, SES, best fit method) and the effect of freeing the t-2 forecast on the accuracy of the statistical forecast. For this a dataset was selected in a specific way. Five Strategic Product Groups (SPGs) were selected that have a relative high volume and low accuracy. The idea was that for these products there is more potential to improve the accuracy, because of the current low accuracy and that it has a big effect overall, because it has a relative high volume. From the detailed testing, some important conclusions are drawn. Instead of just focussing on the exact numerical results, the conclusions are summed up here:  The effect of freeing the t-2 forecast is bigger than in the previous tests. This is now estimated to be around 2%. This effect is smaller for the currently used statistical methods and bigger for the alternatives.  It is better to report the median forecast accuracy alongside the average forecast accuracy when measuring the accuracy over multiple months. The reason is that the average forecast accuracy is sensitive for outliers. If a forecasting method has overall good results, but in one or two periods very bad results, the average accuracy will be low. But the median accuracy will hardly be affected by this. Both statistics together give a completer picture.  The selection method that was used to find SPGs for which the statistical forecasting methods were supposed to have a high accuracy compared to the judgmental forecast, is actually not a good one. The main reason is that with this method especially the less-smooth products are selected, which are the most difficult to forecast with statistical methods.  Statistical forecasting cannot be applied blindly to every product. Segmentation is needed on the item hierarchy level instead of the SPG level.  A sigma of 1,5 gives an additional increase of the accuracy of about 1,5%-2,0%. A period of 12 months is used for fitting. This gives good results for both MA and SES. A maximum for the N of the MA-method (or a minimum for the ? of the SES) is not used, as this gives conflicting results and does not have a big impact.  MAD is the only loss-function among the tested four, which gave good results for the MA and SES method for both datasets.  Among the three fitting methods, the SES method gave here the best results and the MA method the worst. In the previous test, the SES-method was the worst. In both cases the best-fit method had the second best results. That is why it is decided to use the best-fit method to work out the implementation. Finally, implementation alternatives were worked out for two regions as an example. The implementation alternatives concern how to segment the products and use the combination of a statistical and judgmental forecast for each segment. None of the proposed segmentation alternatives leads to the ability of identifying products for which the statistical forecast leads to a better forecast than the judgmental forecast. Among all the implementation alternatives volume segmentation is the most preferred. Using volume segmentation leads to a consistency of the accuracy among the segments (A segment has a higher accuracy for the statistical forecast than the B segment etc.) and the number of products and volume stay stable over the years. Besides, the important products are differentiated from the less important ones based on the volume. This can help the planners to focus on the right products. Based on this it is proposed not to use a combined volume-accuracy segmentation (which would lead to nine segments), but only volume segmentation (which leads to three segments). Using two dimensions would make it unnecessarily complex without much additional benefit. Three sub-alternatives have been worked out that are used in combination with volume segmentation. The first two concerned the type of forecast to use for the C-segment. For these sub-alternatives, like currently for the A and B segment judgmental forecasting is used. Sub-alternative 1 and 2 are the easiest to understand. Because of this, these are expected to be easier to implement. From these alternatives it was also concluded that for the C-segment an accuracy increase/decrease of 1% has an overall effect in the order of 0,1%. The C-segment makes up more than 50% of the items. Sub-alternative 3 gives a specific forecasting strategy for each segment. It results in the end in the highest accuracy and a focus on the most important items. Sub-alternative 1 and 2 can be used as intermediate steps towards this final solution. The following is proposed for the end-implementation: 1. A-segment: use the statistical forecast as a reference and comparison to the judgmental forecast. It is recommended to have an intensive contact with the customers of these products and gain as much as possible information that is of importance for the forecast. 2. B-segment: use the statistical forecast as the standard, but thoroughly check it and make judgmental adjustments. 3. C-segment: use the statistical forecast as the standard and only make changes when felt necessary. The forecast accuracy of this group is not that important, because it does not have much effect on the overall forecast accuracy. So this group should be given the least attention. The details regarding the implementation can be found in appendix I. Through the research recommendations are done regarding how to improve the demand planning process and increase the forecast accuracy. These are summed up together in the chapter “Conclusion and recommendations” (p.81).","forecasting; statistical forecasting; demand planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","TLO","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor)","2013","Despite their high degree of reconfigurability and friendliness to technology scaling, traditional ADPLL-based frequency synthesizers tend to come at the price of increased power consumption at their feedback path, compared to charge-pump based solutions. The main power consumption bottleneck is the TDC that operates at the high output frequency rate. A modified version of the ADPLL architecture, that applies phase prediction and aligns the input and output clock edges by means of a digital-to-time converter (DTC), allows the operation of the phase detection entirely at the reference clock rate. To demonstrate the potential of the low-power phase prediction ADPLL architecture, two ADPLL test chips were designed, comprising a 2.5-5 GHz ring DCO and a wideband 10-16 GHz LC-DCO respectively. The two chips make use of the same DTC-TDC pair that consists identical delay generic cells for matched DTC and TDC gain values. The ADPLLs target multiple standards of wireline communication interfaces. At its typical configuration, the ring DCO ADPLL is expected to exhibit a power consumption of 3.9-5.3 mW resulting to a FoM of -164 dB, lower than any other reported ring-oscillator-based fractional-N PLL. The LC-DCO ADPLL power consumption varies from 10.2 to 13.8 mW and is the first fractional-N synthesizer among those targeting wireline communication for this range of frequencies. Additionally, this work introduces a cyclic DTC-TDC pair that can be rotated randomly in order to apply dynamic element matching of its elements and alleviate mismatch-induced spurs at low offsets of the spectrum in near-integer operation. The structure also allows dithering of the DTC control code in order to reduce quantization-induced spurs.","ADPLL; phase pPrediction; DTC-TDC; fractional-N; frequency synthesizer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-12-20","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","ELCA","",""

(mentor); Tuijthof, G.J.M. (mentor)","2013","Abstract - When surgically drilling blind holes in bone using a Water Jet (WJ), control over the resulting depth is a challenging issue of paramount concern. This thesis was part of a project aimed at replacing the awl and mallet technique used in traditional microfracture procedures with an arthroscopic high-pressure WJ instrument is capable of accurately drilling 2–4 mm deep holes in subchondral bone. The focus of this paper was to develop, analyze and evaluate concepts for ensuring the depthwise accuracy of a microfracturing WJ. Research was performed on both WJ systems and the microfracture procedure, and a thorough problem analysis detailing all concerning requirements and parameters was set up. It was determined that due to the strong non-uniformity of human bone, both spatially and between subjects, a WJ capable of monitoring the depth and implementing a closed-loop control system was needed to ensure safe and accurate drilling. To measure the depth of the hole and allow for feedback control, a flexible Nickel Titanium probe concept was devised and tested. The concept featured a 3D printed nozzle with built-in WJ orifice and depth probe, which could be extended down the hole made by the WJ by an ex-vivo actuator featurimg load and displacement sensors. When the load sensor detected a sudden rise in extension resistance, bottom contact was assumed and the hole depth was calculated based on the displacement of the probe. A proof-of-concept experiment showed the viability of using a flexible probe to measure the depth. Additionally, the algorithm produced for calculating the depth was shown to be robust against the hysteresis and backlash exhibited by the setup. When probing holes with depths of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mm and bore diameters of 1, 1.5, and 2 mm drilled in solid PMMA, the prototype managed an error mean of 0.00 mm with a SD of 0.19 mm. To test the probe in holes shaped as expected during microfracture surgery, a virtual interference experiment was carried out using mCT scans of WJ-drilled bones and simulated probes of varying diameters. Seven scans were probed from 4 different angles each; the results suggested that a probe with a 0.2–0.3 mm diameter was optimal in terms of traversing the hole without blockages and without risking over-penetration. Moreover, this thesis produced recommendations on carrying the project further, towards a fully integrated system capable of drilling accurate blind holes in human bone, in a closed-loop depth-controlled manner.","water jet; bone; drill; microfracture; depth control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-12-20","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Van der Lei, T. (mentor)","2013","The Netherlands has an excellent infrastructure, it is one of the main points of entry and hub for goods into Europe. Other countries in Europe are expanding their industry and infrastructure to overtake this position, that is why it is very important for the Netherlands to maintain its position by investing in new industry and infrastructure. Over the last decades some large infrastructural projects were performed or were planned. During a lot of these projects many problems arose just before, during and after construction, think of cost overrun, safety problems, construction problems, political discussions, environmental problems, etc. The Port of Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe, located in the city of Rotterdam, Netherlands. The Port of Rotterdam has a large petrochemical cluster that processes crude oil into numerous end products. As the future supply of crude oil may be at risk due to depletion, high energy prices, conflicts in production area’s which will have a huge impact on the Netherlands and Rotterdam. Industries that are heavily dependent on fossil fuels will increasingly have to look for alternative fuel sources to be able to continue in their business. A possible solution to cope with these challenges is the creation of synthesis gas (syngas) cluster. The aim of this research is to find out how actor analysis can contribute to the prevention of project failure due to stakeholder issues. In the thesis the construction of a syngas cluster on Maasvlakte 2 in the Port of Rotterdam is used as a casus. The planning and construction of infrastructures like the syngas cluster involves many organizations with conflicting interest and control over issues. Insufficient communication and support between actors may cause problems at a later stage. To find the opinion and attitude of these stakeholders the policy maker has to perform an actor analysis to gather this information. An actor analysis or stakeholder analysis is a process of systematically gathering and analyzing information of actors to identify the key actors. This analysis can be used to generate knowledge on the behaviour, intentions, positions, interrelations, agendas, interests, and the influence or resources these actors have. This gives the stakeholders the opportunity to react and interact more effectively (Schmeer, 1999). In this thesis transactional analysis is used to investigate the multi-actor-decision-making process. Transactional analysis (TA) is based upon Coleman’s social theory which takes micro-economic thought as a starting point and translates it to social systems. TA can be described as the negotiating process, in which agreements are reached on exchange of control over issues. So the idea is that actors exchange power and control over issues instead of money for products. This exchange takes place within a social or political system (Timmermans and Beroggi, 2004). The objective of transactional analysis is to determine the ‘best’ collective decision within the multi-actor decision making process. For this purpose TA calculates the optimal division of control and interest over the issues for all involved parties. The optimal division of control and interest is a clearing of all excess control that actors have over certain issues. So this excess control is traded for more control over issues in which the actor also has interest but low amount of control (Van der Lei, 2009). Transactional Analysis is a theoretical tool, but when used properly it can enhance the decision making process. Timmermans (2004) performed an experiment on the influence of an informed (TA results) selection of decision makers on the negotiating process. The results of the experiment show that transactional analysis has a positive contribution on multi-issue and multi-actor decision making process.","transactional analysis; policy analysis; stakeholders","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2016-12-12","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","","",""

Company Innovation System (CIS) is the network of stakeholders in a firm for the generation, adoption and use of innovation within companies. CIS is developed building on three existing state-of-the arts. Josef Schumpeter’s idea that says innovation is a process characterized as a set of new combinations. The concept of Innovation Systems that lists National, Regional, Sectoral & Technological factors that influence the creation, diffusion, development and use of innovations. And, Business Ecosystems, defined as a network of actors around a core technology, who depend on each other for their success and survival. In this exploratory, qualitative research we first define the company innovation system and systematically list its elements and characteristics. Seven elements (agents, resources & capabilities, input/output, interaction mechanisms, knowledge & learning, process & projects, and, rules & governance) are identified from the state-of-the-art and are given unique attributes since they cut across Nations, Regions, Sectors, Businesses and Technology Innovation systems. We show how elements and characteristics need to be identified, combined and recombined to lead to higher innovativeness by drawing attention to the linkages and interaction within the innovation system of a company. We then proceed to check the applicability of the concept by testing it in a case study at an IT services company. As a services company, innovation is fundamentally different than product firms. Innovation in services companies may not take place in linear ways, but as interactions between various parts of the business and customers, hence making innovation more complex to understand and manage. The need for this research is to translate the innovation systems concept at the level of the company and holistically integrate, identify and increase innovativeness of a company.","innovation; company innovation system; ecosystem; strategy; systems theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-12-20","Technology, Policy and Management","Management of Technology","","Technology Strategy Entrepreneurship","",""

(mentor)","2013","The dynamic response of coupled structures is influenced by the mechanical joints connecting the individual substructures. The friction induced by the interfaces causes non-linear and dampinglike effects, which need to be taken into account when applying Experimental Dynamic Substructuring techniques. The traditional techniques impose compatibility of displacements at the interface between the substructures, enabling a rigid connection. This MSc. thesis proposes a compliant interface model in the framework of substructuring, in order to account for the influence of jointed connections. The proposed compliant interface model characterises non-linearities and damping effects of the interface connection as a function of the interface force and motion directly, rather than modelling it as a separate phenomenon. In fact, by making the interface force a function of a frequency dependent stiffness and damping term, all kind of interface behaviour can be modelled. As such the model fits into the Lagrange-Multiplier Frequency Based Substructuring method. In addition, the concept of complex power is adopted which allows to identify the dissipation levels being a function of the damping present in the structure. Also, it enables to isolate the contribution of the interface from the overall dissipation and characterises the effect of damping as such.

(mentor)","2013","Solar energy is expected to play a great role in the grid’s future infrastructure as a distributed source. The expected high penetration of photovoltaic (PV) power into the existing electricity grid demands a more detailed study and analysis of the interaction between PV systems and the grid, to enable safe and reliable operation. Until recently, in the case that an electromagnetic transient software package was used for a PV system study, a PV generator model had to be developed by simulating a complex block-circuit using several control demands and elements. Thus, the need of implementing a less complex model for enhancing not only less simulation time but also showing the electrical behavior of PV generators is essential. In this project a circuit-based simulation model of a PV generator by Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP) is proposed. The equivalent circuit of the generator is based on a linearization process using the Newton-Raphson algorithm, in order to uncouple its current and voltage quantities. The simplified model is represented by a dependent current source in parallel with a variable conductance. The association of the proposed generator model with RLC circuits is simulated and the results are compared with measurements results, proving that the model can successfully predict the nonlinear performance of the PV generator. The model is also combined with a single-phase grid-connected system, of which all the components are also developed in EMTP. The evaluation and modeling of the PV system is performed with data from real PV modules. Interfacing the EMTP-based model of the PV generator with Simulink is demonstrated with four case studies, using an already validated three-phase grid-connected hybrid PV/battery model. The case studies simulated prove the expandability of the proposed PV generator model in three-phase systems and the adaptation potential in large-scale systems.","photovoltaics; EMTP; PV system; electromagnetic transients; distributed generation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Electrical Power Grids","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Reedijk, J.S. (mentor); Broere, W. (mentor); Jonkman, S.N. (mentor)","2013","An ambition is that in the near future more inflatable dams can be applied as storm surge barriers. Hence, the main objective of this study is to investigate the applicability of rubber storm surge barriers at larger scales than currently applied. To achieve this objective the inflatable barrier concept (inflatable barriers applied as storm surge barriers) is further improved. The barrier of Ramspol in the Netherlands is taken as a reference point for this study in order to improve the inflatable barrier concept. Based on the knowledge and experience derived from the Ramspol barrier, the following issues should be addressed in order to make further improvements to the inflatable barrier concept:  Increase the reliability of inflatable dams;  Gain more knowledge about the limits of the dimensions of inflatable dams;  Improve the geometry of abutments;  Improve the storage of the sheet of the inflatable dam. In this report two inflatable barrier designs are presented for the case study: Bolivar Roads, Galveston Bay, Texas, USA. This location requires a very large barrier due to its large width (± 3000 m) and water depth (15 m). Design 1 This design is based on Ramspol, but has been improved and scaled up to allow the application for the location Bolivar Roads. The inflatable dam of Bolivar Roads has the shape of an ellipsoid above the abutment and the middle part of the dam is like a ‘normally’ shaped inflatable dam. Design 2 The second design is innovative and based on large scale conditions. Since a 100% closure is not demanded for the Bolivar Roads barrier application, an inflatable dam without (a connection with) abutments was chosen due to the favourable force transfer. Each inflatable dam has the shape of an ellipsoid in the end parts, and a ‘normally’ shaped inflatable dam in the middle part. In both designs the previously mentioned issues were addressed. The first two issues (reliability and limits of the dimensions) are identical for both designs, whereas the last two (geometry of abutments and storage of sheet) are not. The most important measure for increasing the reliability of the barrier is to chain multiple smaller length (<100 m) inflatable dams instead of one long dam. Long inflatable dams (>100 m) are not desired, because a collapse of a long dam can cause flooding downstream. More knowledge about the limits of the dimensions of an inflatable rubber barrier is obtained by scale enlargement of the Ramspol barrier (2.3 times higher). Proven by this case study it appears that large dimensions (height: 19 m) are feasible for inflatable barriers. In both designs folds and peak stresses in the sheet are reduced significant compared to Ramspol. However, design 2 results in even more reduction of folds and peak stresses in the sheet than design 1, due to the absence of the connection with the abutments. Also design 2 has a higher reliability due to the larger number of inflatable dams. Therefore, design 2 was the chosen option for the final design of the barrier of Bolivar Roads.","inflatable dam; membrane; barrier; Ramspol; Bolivar Roads; rubber","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

A user-centered approach to design the service was needed and a change in the mindset within the company was needed. The aim of the project was to enable Dorel to transform the UX of the event of a broken Dorel product in a positive one by a service. A company and consumer research were executed. In the company research was discovered that services are locally organized and a more user-centered mindset is needed at the company. The home delivery service concept was considered as most suitable service proposition for Dorel. The home delivery concept has a multifaceted consumer journey. Since the overall performance curve of a service is important, the whole journey needs to be mapped. Moreover, it became clear that for changing the mindset and implementing the service through Europe, a tool for the European service manager needed to be designed. In the consumer research the UX at the event of a broken product, the UX at the current repair service, and the evaluation of services in general were studied. This resulted in the identification of the desired UX, which is represented by six principles. For establishing a positive UX, the tool should enable Dorel to apply the six principles. In the design phase the service structure was formed. It is a pattern of principles on the different phases of the consumer journey of the home delivery proposition. Different ideas for the tool were generated. Finally a workshop kit for Dorel’s service manager is developed: The Repair journey kit. In the workshop the service manager makes the touchpoints for the repair service together with the local employees. The advantages of the Repair journey kit are: Touchpoints are locally adapted Commitment is created by working together on the journey Consumer-centered thinking is accomplished by showing video testimonials of consumers to the employees. The principles are integrated in the service structure which is generically applicable The evaluation of the Repair journey kit showed that thinking from the consumer perspective generated innovative touchpoint ideas. With the tool Dorel can differentiate itself from other players in the market.","service design; toolkit; contextmapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

Is it groundwater or surface water? Is it natural variation or caused by human interference? In this thesis a method is developed to obtain reliable data on mass change from GRACE and address the mass changes using different satellite data sets and ground measurements. In a step-wise approach mass changes of lakes, snow, natural groundwater variation and groundwater pumping are indicated and quantified. From the results can be concluded that more than half of the total mass variations is caused by lake mass changes and more than twenty five percent by natural variation. The large influence of natural variation could mainly be linked to fast groundwater discharge from karstic aquifers and shows the sensitivity of the groundwater system to dry periods.","GRACE; remote sensing; TRMM; rainfall runoff; lake volume","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-09","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Geohydrology","",""

(mentor); Molenaar, W.F. (mentor); Terwel, K.C. (mentor); Van Meurs, G. (mentor)","2013","Multifunctional use of the flood defences is as old as the flood defences themselves. Historically infrastructure, housing and livestock are located on the flood defences. Over the years, the cities along the rivers became bigger and bigger. With the still increasing demand for spatial development it is inevitable to also start combining other functions with the flood defences. The underground space of the flood defences is not yet used. Constructing a structure inside a dike is a solution to create more space. With multifunctional use of the flood defences are a lot of different parties involved with each its own interest and purposes. This results in a difficult and devious design process. The technical difficulties are researched in the master thesis in order to optimise this design process. The Dutch guidelines for flood defences as well as the Eurocodes are relevant for the design of multifunctional flood defences. Dealing with the hydraulic loads on the structure leads to uncertainties for the reliability of the flood defence. Applying partial factors on forces resulting from design water level with already a very small exceedance probability seems to introduce excessive amount of reliability into the calculations. A case study is performed to research the issues during the design process of a multifunctional flood defence. The Grebbedijk is chosen as location for the case study because of the demand for spatial development as well as the demand for flood safety. The Grebbedijk is a relatively small dike protecting a relatively large area with a high economic value. The Grebbedijk is often named as a possible first Delta dike. Together with the demand for parking close to the city centre of Wageningen, this location meets both criteria for a multifunctional flood defence. The assessment of the design made for the Grebbedijk confirmed the idea that the forces resulting from the water level are treated in a too conservative way by applying partial factors over design water levels with already small exceedance probabilities. This effect is obtained in the calculations for the failure mechanisms overall stability and structural strength. In order to analyse the reliability of the multifunctional flood defence, first order reliability method (FORM) analyses are carried out. Three failure mechanisms are considered: horizontal stability, overturning stability and strength of the wall. The failure probability of each failure mechanism is calculated. All three failure mechanisms have a lower failure probability than the required failure probability. The partial factors used in the semi probabilistic approach are calibrated in order to find the correct partial factors. The calibrated partial factors for the force related to the water level showed a variation equal to the proportionality of the force to the water level. The partial factors are in this case not useful. The exceedance probabilities of the design water levels resulting from the FORM analyses are very similar and in the same order as the failure probabilities. This resulted in the conclusion that using a design water level with an exceedance probability equal to the failure probability introduces enough reliability into the calculations. The partial factors for the forces not related to the water level were all very close to one. Resulting in the conclusions that using partial factors of 1.1 for unfavourable force and 0.9 for favourable force, would be sufficient to obtain the target failure probability. The applicability of these partial factors is not unlimited. The water level is the most important parameter in these calculations. Other forces might become more important in other cases. Further research has to be carried out to say something about the extent to which the partial factors are applicable.","multifunctional flood defences; probabilistic design; reliability analysis; FORM analysis; partial factors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Spekkers, M.H. (mentor)","2013","Introduction For several years it is known that as a consequence of climate change rain patterns will change in the future. Winters are becoming wetter and summers are becoming drier. Especially in summer period extreme rainfall will more often occur. Extreme rainfall may lead to ' water in the street ' and 'flooding '. ' Water in the street ' is defined as a water level that is higher than the local ground level or drain cover level. ' Flooding ' is defined as ' water in the street ' where nuisance to local residents and users of the public space occurs. When flooding takes place, there is the possibility that victims report this to the administrators and/or owners of the public space (province, local municipalities and water boards) or civil society organizations. It is also possible that flooding results in people submitting insurance claims. Research Data registered in registration systems is often incomplete or unusable. The registered data from three municipalities has been studied and is used to investigate the manner in which the current registration methods can be improved, so that the data collected (building blocks) better contribute to a more efficient management of the sewer system. The efficiency of the report registration procedure is determined by the data quality of the building blocks, the registration system and the person who evaluates and uses the registered information. A notifier can pass the message on through a number of channels. The channels are the ""inputs"" that make it possible to reach the public authority. The following (main) channels are differentiated: 1. Channel telephony 2. Channel internet (e-form) 3. Channel email 4. Channel mail 5. Channel desk Conclusions and Recommendations When all notifications (100%) are registered by the channel desk this results in the highest efficiency, followed by the channel internet. Since it is not realistic that all contacts take place through the channel desk, because many municipalities will reduce the contact by desk in the future, the use of the e-form will become more and more important. A well developed, easy to use, comprehensive and reliable e-form is essential in the future. Damage claims, arising from a bad or slow handling, can be prevented if a proper registration system is used (System), the registration procedure is well organized (procedure) and the user of the information uses the data properly (man). The risk of damage claims is high as the efficiency of the registration process is low or the information of the registration system is used not correct or incomplete. A practice situation, in which the data quality parameters of the channel internet is at least equivalent to the current parameters of the channel desk and an increased use of the internet channel, is preferred in future.","registration procedures","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

Eventually, with the model, the probability of water levels in the Nhat Le River (Quang Binh Province, Vietnam) can be estimated, which are needed for calculation of the embankments height along the Nhat Le River. In the beginning of the project this thesis had another research question. But at the start of the assignment the provided documents did not suffice due to missing and/or wrong drawings, wrong calculations and lack on key input. Some information should be bought and the newly presented documents never came or came too late. Although it didn’t work out as planned, a lot about the Vietnamese culture and organizational structure has been learned. The new research question was originated around the calculations of the newly proposed embankments along the Nhat Le River. The provided documents calculated the levels of the embankments with the old regulations. These calculations were based on the old Vietnamese regulations, which are not sufficient anymore. The new regulations require a one-dimensional model to estimate the highest water level in the river with different frequency floods. Due to the short period of time, the model is not yet ready for implementation. However some recommendations for optimization and further use of the model are given. The one-dimensional model is made with the computer software HEC-RAS. The Water Resources University Hanoi provided the required data, including boundary conditions and cross-sections. Data in Vietnam is not easy to obtain. It took a long time to get the proper information and support from different parties. Although, this assignment is a good first start of modelling the one-dimensional model. In order to establish the final one-dimensional model the following steps should be conducted: - More cross-sections along the Dia Giang and Kien Giang river branches in order to determine the correct slopes of the river branches; - Development of the Dia Giang and Kien Giang river branches with wider cross-sections, including floodplains and storage areas; - Calibration of the Dia Giang river branch; - Calibration of the whole Nhat Le river Branch; - Implementation of the My Trung sluice in the Kien Giang river branch; - Data of different frequency floods in the Dia Giang and Kien Giang river branch to estimate the different high water levels in the main of Nhat Le river in different scenarios; - Clearness about the positions of the newly constructed embankments.","Nhat Le River; Vietnam; one-dimensional model; Asian Development Bank; Dong Hoi; River Engineering","en","student report","","","","","","","","2013-12-20","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The impact of the introduction of grid-connected distributed energy resources is expected to receive growing attention in the near future. Power electronic equipment is now indispensable part of the electricity generation and distribution; however apart from its benefits, it may affect the grid adversely as well. Power quality and reliability are the challenges that grid operators face, because of fluctuating loads and penetration of decentralized electricity generation. The use of power electronics has the potential to enhance the energy management and enables grid operators to make smarter use of their grid. The Flex Power Grid Lab (FPGL) in Arnhem provides an ideal testing and research environment for advanced power electronics. Businesses and universities can make use of this excellent facility to study how locally generated energy, such as wind turbines, solar cells, CHP plants, can be safely integrated into the grid. The lab facility is capable of generating both static and dynamic voltage phenomena and creating test conditions, such as harmonic distortion, voltage dips, frequency and voltage fluctuations. As a result, equipment involved in decentralized power generation can be tested under “bad grid” conditions, prior to its actual connection to it. The intent of this Master Thesis is to model the FPGL using certain software in order to ultimately be able to predict the performance of the lab. MATLAB/Simulink environment is used for the purposes of the project. The modeling starts from the 50kV substation in Kattenberg. A transformer steps down the voltage to 10.5kV. FPGL along with other labs of DNV KEMA is connected to the 10.5kV bus-bar, which is located in the Business Park, Arnhem. Two three-phase and three single-phase temperature dependent transformer models have been developed. Special attention is paid to the modeling of the grid-connected 4Q, 1MVA, AC/DC – DC/AC converter, which consists of two three-level neutral-point clamped PWM converters. Different control scheme is applied to each of these converters. The grid-side converter is controlled in the rotational reference frame, using proportional-integral (PI) controllers with ultimate goal to keep the DC-link voltage stable. Park transformation (dq0) is necessary to transfer the system to the rotational frame. In contrast, the load-side converter is controlled in the stationary reference frame using proportional-resonant controllers (PR). This innovative control strategy stabilizes the plant by state-feedback, while ten available resonant controllers ensure zero steady-state error for up to nine harmonics. Both control schemes are developed in the z-domain to take into account the effect of the Digital Signal Processor. Ultimately, the model is validated through several lab tests.","power quality; three-level converter; resonant controller; vector control; dq transformation; simulink; validation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor)","2013","Space debris poses a significant problem for the space sector. This problem relates to potential collisions of debris objects with active satellites, which in many cases will lead to catastrophic damage. Due to the absence of natural decay mechanisms in the higher regions of space, debris objects in these regions have very long orbital lifetimes. In order to assess the hazards posed to active satellites, it is relevant to be able to predict how the orbits of these debris objects behave on long timescales. A simulation code in C++ has been created for this thesis project, capable of efficient propagation of space debris trajectories over long periods of time (typically a century or more), while taking into account various relevant perturbing forces. The simulation code can be applied to simulate the orbits of debris objects with a wide range of area-to-mass ratios, from intact satellites to tiny flecks of paint. The results produced with the simulation code have been verified to be consistent with results presented in recent research papers on space debris. An extensive performance comparison has been made regarding the efficiency of different computational methods for carrying out accurate, long-term integrations of space debris orbits. Both traditional integration methods and symplectic integration methods were tested, the latter of which are interesting because of their energy conservation properties. All methods were also combined with different formulations of the equations of motion. Of the methods tested, the Dormand-Prince 8(7) integration method combined with Gauss' form of Lagrange's planetary equations in modified equinoctial elements was found to be the most efficient. The performance of the symplectic integration methods was markedly less for this application than for the integration of completely Hamiltonian systems, though it was certainly acceptable. The simulation code was also applied to predict the long-term orbital evolution for debris objects in GEO and GNSS graveyard orbits. While proposed GEO graveyard orbits were found to be safe, graveyard orbits in the GNSS region were found to be susceptible to resonances induced by the luni-solar perturbations, and hence, require a careful selection of the initial orbital parameters. In all cases, debris objects with high area-to-mass ratios were determined to be dangerous to active satellites, regardless of the initial conditions of the graveyard orbit.","space debris; astrodynamics; numerical integration; orbital perturbations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Astrodynamics and Space Missions","","","",""

(mentor); Smets, A.H.M. (mentor); Han, L. (mentor); Tan, H. (mentor)","2013","The commercial efficiency of a c-Si solar cell is ~18% although the thermodynamic limit is ~95%. This indicates a good scope for improvements. The major loss mechanism in a solar cell is spectral mismatch which is contributed to by non-absorption of low energy photons and thermalization of high energy photons. In this thesis, it is sought to reduce the loss that occurs through thermalization of high energy photons. For this purpose, the concept of down conversion is used. Silicon being relevant to the semiconductor industry, being abundant in nature and having been proved to exhibit down conversion in the form of spherical particles in the nm size range through space separated quantum cutting is opted. However, the down conversion efficiency of these is low owing to their indirect bandgap which leads to higher absorption within the material than enhancement in the number of photons through down conversion. In order to reduce the absorption within the material, it is sought to enhance the rate of radiative decay through the use of plasmonics exhibited by metal nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles are used for our purpose as they exhibit resonance in the visible region of the spectrum and have the lowest absorption among different plasmonic materials. The silicon nanoparticles (quantum dots) powders are fabricated through the expanding thermal plasma chemical vapor deposition route while the silver nanoparticles fabricated through wet chemical synthesis are purchased from the market as powders. The silver nanoparticles are also deposited as metal island films in-house. Optimal deposition parameters for the deposition of quantum dots are arrived upon by depositing samples using different parameters and analyzing the results. A configuration for the down conversion layer is arrived upon based on simulations and analysis of design. The powders are then dispersed in ethanol for the purpose of spin coating. The dispersions are then spin coated on glass substrates. The quantum dot dispersion is also spin coated onto the metal island film substrate as per the chosen configuration. The silver nanoparticle samples are analyzed for plasmonic behavior, quantum dots for their absorption characteristics and the combination for enhancement in transmission through down conversion from their reflection and transmission spectra. To confirm the interaction between the silver nanoparticles and quantum dots, the enhancement in the photoluminescence spectra is checked. From the results, it is observed that there is agglomeration in the spin coated silver nanoparticles resulting in a loss of plasmonic behavior. The quantum dots are also agglomerated due to which an enhancement in the transmission spectra was not observed. However, the interaction between the quantum dots and the silver nanoparticles could be observed through the enhanced photoluminescence of the quantum dots. The enhancement is found to vary from 9 folds to about 50 folds which are high compared to similar results in the literature. Keeping in mind that this down conversion layer has not yet been optimized, even higher enhancements may be possible. This indicates the potential for the combination of silicon quantum dots and silver nanoparticles for application in solar cell down conversion layers.","solar cell; down conversion; silicon quantum dots; plasmonics; silver nanoparticles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-12-20","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Hegyi, A. (mentor); Van Noort, M. (mentor); Wiggenraad, P.B.L. (mentor); Liu, S. (mentor)","2013","Stops en route are a main concern for cyclists as they want to travel in the most comfortable fashion possible. The braking and acceleration at traffic lights cause losses of kinetic energy and make the trips of cyclists more strenuous than they would have been without stops. By reducing the number of stops for cyclists, the attraction of the bicycle as transport mode could be increased. This research will focus on the reduction of stops by implementing a speed advice for cyclists that will help the cyclist to arrive at intersections when the traffic light is green. The design of a system that can reduce the number of stops is presented for the situation with a fixed time controller and an vehicle actuated controller. The design for the fixed time controller consists of a speed advice that is given once to the cyclist approaching the traffic light. The cyclist can approach the traffic light with this speed to arrive at the intersection with a green light. The advice is given by a road side sign that can be read by the cyclist. Reductions in the fraction of stopped cyclists are in the order of 10-20%. The actuated controller asks for a more flexible structure of the speed advice in which the cyclist should adjust its speed dependent on the state of the traffic light controller. The speed advice system must be implemented in a way that the consequence of the state of the controller for the advice of the cyclist can be distributed to the cyclist at the moment this change of state occurs. The flexible appearance of the system allows it to adjust its speed advice to the preferences of the user. This is done by a score function that takes into account the probability to catch the green light and the sacrifice the cyclist has to make in his desired speed to end up at the green traffic light. The reductions in fraction of stopped cyclists are largely dependent on the chosen values for the attributes in the speed advice system. The tested scenarios indicate a maximum reduction of stopped cyclists of 45%.","cyclists; traffic control; speed advice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-20","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport and Planning","",""

(mentor); Oey, M. (mentor); Verburg, R. (mentor)","2013","In this thesis, process models for innovation in complex large-scale financial organizations are contrasted with models in literature. As a result, elements which should be included in process models for innovation to increase the innovative capacity of these organizations are presented. To illustrate this, research was conducted at the ING Customer Experience Center, part of ING Operations and IT Banking. ING, a premium bank in financial services is subject to specific dynamics in its environment that affect the innovative capacity of the organization. The structure of the organization proves to be very complex (i.e. a system with multiple interconnected elements and different ways of operations) which complicates institutionalization of processes models. Core competence of these premium banks in current society is trust and for this reason the organizations are highly risk-averse in delivering new products, services and business propositions Specific enablers and barriers in the organization are present that affect the innovative capacity of the organization. Coordination mechanisms that evaluate on output prove to be perverse tools for innovation and operational excellence within organizations should be integrated thoughtfully with innovation to reduce the lead-time for delivery. A process model can only be successful if a culture, divisional climates and resources are created that allow for innovation. Leadership in the organization has to envision innovation and create room for corporate entrepreneurship, only then will a process model for innovation function and can the innovative capacity of an organization increase. In addition, a process model should have a spiral character that emphasizes the continuous and evolutionary effort of innovation. No beginning or end of the process is present and failures may lead to success in other environments. When focusing on early problem structuring and determining objectives, organizational strategies and potential futures, progress and substance of the endeavor is believed to be achieved. Uniform, adaptable, flexible phases and process steps are required to allow for feedback and feed forward and quickly evaluate on feasibility of the effort. In this way the model can be fit to specific contexts, environments and project scales. A note is that radical innovation is not likely to be linked to organizational strategies and core competences, and thus will not likely flow through models. A process model for innovation can only be supportive if innovation is institutionalized in the genes of the organization. Hence, innovation should be supported and facilitated by top management directly. Differences between modeling of innovation in practice and theory is the fact that models are subject to specific organizational and environmental dynamics. A design of the elements which a process model for innovation should include, is constructed and in this model it is important that the continuous and evolutionary character of innovation is emphasized. By performing transparent decision-making and involving business management teams, external knowledge partners and employees; it is believed that the complexity of the process for innovation will be clarified and the effectiveness and efficiency of the endeavor will increase. Moreover, a culture for innovation should be created and a process model should not be coordinated on output, but on throughput. This requires proper knowledge capturing tools which should in addition focus on increasing collaboration with external knowledge partners to further integrate the external and internal environment.","process innovation; modeling innovation; financial services","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-12-19","Technology, Policy and Management","Systems Engineering","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor); Dekker, M.C. (mentor)","2013","Konings & Kappelhoff design agency is a product design agency with expertise in designing juvenile products, among others. Because of their expertise, network and some unfinished work requiring attention, they expressed the wish to investigate design opportunities in the area of child transportation. The graduation assignment that followed means twofold: ‘Explore possible product opportunities in the field of child transportation’ and ‘elaborate one of the resulting product opportunities into a viable concept’. In order to do this, the project was split into three phases. Phase 1: Analysis In this phase a situation sketch was made depicting all aspects of the process of transporting children. The target group consists of parents in its broadest sense: people who (recently) had a child and value safety and comfort for their child above all. The environment consists of various different starting points and destinations, transport solutions and competing consumer products, for example strollers or car seats. Because of the focus on children’s products, regulation (i-Size) and standards apply. Also, user research was done aiming for the opinion of parents concerning the current situation of children’s mobility (products). Phase 2: Synthesis In the second phase the results from the first phase are synthesized. This is done by means of a ‘customer journey’, a timeline depicting the typical travelling process of various parents with their children. When linking all research results to this journey, it shows if and where there are gaps in the current situation, leading to various product opportunities. Together with Konings & Kappelhoff, the choice has been made to pursue two mutually reinforcing product opportunities: a revolving Child Restraint System (CRS) that is easily accessible and one that features a detachable lightweight infant carrier and a base seat with all necessary safety features. Phase 3: Conceptualization In the third phase, the two product opportunities have been elaborated into one idea: ‘Develop a new type of i-Size child restraint system that enables parents to comfortably transport their child towards and from the car and enables them to easily install it in the car.’ This concept improves current product features of handling and accessing a CRS: - The concept provides an easy infant carrying solution - The concept provides an easy-access CRS - The concept provides additional safety for the occupants A physical model has been built and tested to show to what extend the concept satisfies the design goal. The concepts handles enable parents to transport a child of up to 1 year comfortably towards their car. A carrying strap enables them to transport a child of up to 2 years over the same distance. Various recommendations have been made for further improvement. The concept has been elaborated up to a conceptual level. This enables Konings & Kappelhoff to market the concept as an idea, allowing the participation of third parties in a intended future joint design process.","child restraint system; i-Size","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-12-19","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2013","Dutch company Ven & Vogel is a shoe company which launched it first shoe in November 2012. This first model is called SuperKoeien, a hairy leather shoe, completely produced in Kenya, from cow to shoe. Because Ven & Vogel communicated many stories to its consumers, the main reason why people bought the shoes is hard to pinpoint and therefore they are worn by many different people. This report describes the process of designing a brand identity with a clear brand story for Ven & Vogel to create a brand community, carried out as a graduation project of Industrial Design Engineering, Master program Strategic Product Design, at Delft University of Technology, in cooperation with Ven & Vogel. From a company analysis, the main brand elements of Ven & Vogel are determined. These led to four brand identity elements. The consumer analysis analysed the existing consumers of Ven & Vogel and of the resulting groups, a target group is chosen. To create a strategy that fits with the defined brand identity and the new target group of Ven & Vogel, case studies are done for existing companies to find best practices. The final brand story to combine the brand, the consumers and the company is called ‘Modern Explorer’, to communicate the feeling of exploring and seeing something new every day. This story is enlarged by naming the products of Ven & Vogel after real explorers of the 19th century who went to Africa. A implementation strategy describes how this brand story can be communicated through online and offline channels to the consumers to create a brand community. With the communication through the main channels defined, the overall strategy to start the brand community will be to organise a measure meeting where Ven & Vogel tests its new products on its consumers by receiving extensive feedback on their experiences via WhatsApp. This creates a very direct communication band between the consumer and Ven & Vogel. In this communication, the consumers are asked to send photos of themselves with Ven & Vogel shoes, with a game element attached. This creates an album of photos that not only is creates a strong bond between Ven & Vogel and the consumer, but also shows the outside world the Ven & Vogel’s brand community. Together with the clearly defined brand identity, the new brand story and communication channels, this strategy is a strong fundament for Ven & Vogel to expand its consumer base by creating a large brand community.","brand community; strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-12-19","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2013","After the turn of the millennium a global consolidation in the beer industry started. In 2012 the top 4 players in the market – including Heineken - represent 41% of the global market. In order to maintain the position of an independent market leader in this turbulent market, Heineken initiated a companywide improvement program called Total Productive Management (TPM). Heineken’s TPM program is based on Efeso’s World Class Operational Management (WCOM) and aims to develop Heineken’s operations into a world class supply chain. The implementation of this program is divided in three sequential stages, respectively called Bronze, Silver and Gold. Due to the challenges of an internal free market model, Heineken’s flagship Brewery at Zoeterwoude is highly motivated to improve the operational performance faster than other Breweries. To realize this faster improvement the Zoeterwoude Brewery has the ambition to be one of the frontrunners in the TPM program. Therefore, in 2003 the Zoeterwoude Brewery was amongst one of the first Breweries to start the implementation of the TPM program. In February 2013, Zoeterwoude has finished the Bronze phase. This first step took 10 years instead of the intended 3 to 5 years. Although Brewery Management does not directly consider exceedance of the prescribed implementation period as a failure, it is conceived to be a problem that the intended implementation duration was far exceeded. Now the Brewery is on the verge of starting the Silver phase, Brewery Management has stated the need for a more controlled implementation. Therefore the objective of this research is to analyze and improve the TPM implementation process...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-19","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

This thesis focused on using the Ensemble Optimization method to improve the NPV (Net Present Value) as the objective function of waterflooding a reservoir with an L-shaped sealing fault under constraints. The optimization controls are injection rates for the input-constrained optimization and valves opening for the output-constrained optimization. The constraints are field injection rate for the input-constrained optimization and field production rate for the output-constrained optimization. Three Matlab optimization methods were tested, of which the SQP (Sequential Quadratic Programming) method performed the best. For dealing with the constraints, it is better to let the optimizer handle them instead of the simulator. Two ways to help the optimizer to have a better constraint adherence are by using the constraint scaling and improving the quality of the gradients. Having too many variables may lead to a lower objective function due to the approximate gradients’ inaccuracies. Regularization (smoothing) can help to improve the objective function in this problem.","constraint; optimization; ensemble; gradients; life-cycle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kosack, C. (mentor)","2013","Petrophysical analysis of reservoir rocks constitutes an integral part of hydrocarbon exploration and production. Properties such as porosity and permeability greatly influence decision making in all phases of planning and execution of oil and gas activities. Furthermore, the industry and academia are equally interested in the in-depth investigation of pore network properties of porous rock in order to advance studies on flow and solid-fluid phase interaction. Typically, petrophysical analysis is conducted through ‘analog’ testing of rock samples using equipment that derive the aforementioned properties through direct physical interaction. Such methods share limitations derived from a non-integrated, non-standardized overall methodology, manifesting as variable error of measurements. The present thesis proposes a digital image based petrophysical analysis method that aims to mitigate such limitations through detailed monitoring. Through the application of an integrated scan-to-measurements process, 3D X-Ray images of five core plugs originating from a Dutch gas offshore field are thoroughly analyzed. Petrophysical properties such as porosity and permeability are quantified, but the methodology also assesses and quantifies pore network features such as grains, pores and pore throats. All steps of this process are thoroughly described, along with - where applicable - alternate relevant approaches. The results of this image based petrophysical analysis are compared to measurements obtained through the use of conventional core analysis methods, as well as relevant literature. The outcome of this comparison illustrates the strengths and areas of improvement of the proposed methodology. Conclusively, the reasoning for transitioning from ‘analog’ to image based petrophysical analysis is validated, and a future outlook is also presented.","petrophysics; micro-CT; image analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2013","To realize optimum performance, SiGe HBTs are typically designed with heavily doped implanted collectors. For practical circuits operating at either high collector current density (Jc) or high collector-base voltage (Vcb) avalanche multiplication is an important effects that must be accurately measured and modeled. For example in digital applications, the avalanche multiplication factor (M-1) determines the breakdown voltage, which in turn determines the maximum power supply for stable logic operation. In critical RF circuits such as power amplifiers (PA) and low noise amplifiers (LNA), the base-collector junction avalanche multiplication degrades the linearity of the circuit because of the resulting strong non-linear feedback from the output (collector) to input (base) is particularly the case for state-of-art high-performance transistors featuring high collector doping. Therefore the accuracy of avalanche multiplication models in different operational conditions is critical to devices design of high linearity LNA and PA circuits. In this thesis, the temperature dependence of the avalanche current in Mextram compact model is addressed through extensive DC measurements over temperature on advanced industrial SiGe HBTs, it was discovered that the current local-electric field based avalanche current model in the Mextram model is incapable of describing the avalanche current as a function of device temperature.This setback is the key motivation behind the work in this thesis. By employing the simplified energy-balance equation, the impact ionization rate was expressed in terms of the carrier (electron for NPN HBT) energy or temperature (Te). Here a triangular shaped electric field distribution corresponding to the normal forward operation regime was assumed. Taking the integral of the electron temperature dependent ionization rate over the epilayer yielded the non-local multiplication factor. The product of the multiplication factor with epilayer current gives the non-local avalanche current, which takes non-local avalanche effects into account. The compact formulation of this non-local avalanche current model was derived and implemented at Delft University of Technology in the in-house version of Mextram compact model. An extended experimental verification of the new compact model for the non-local avalanche current implemented in Mextram was carried out for different advanced SiGe HBT technologies; and the results are presented in this thesis. Verification results showed that the non-local avalanche current model can accurately describe the avalanche current as a function of temperature for different SiGe HBTs (both NPN and PNP). These results implies that the observed setback in Mextram model with respect to the temperature dependence of the avalanche current can be fully addressed by taking non-local avalanche effects into account.","mextram; SiGe; HBTs; non-local avalanche; compact Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","MSc Microelectronics","",""

(mentor)","2013","Shells are thin-walled curved structures that have great potential for multistability. However, there does not yet exist a general model that can be used to predict the stable equilibria of an arbitrary shell; this model would have to capture the complex interplay of (initial) geometry, material parameters and (local) prestress. In this thesis we focus on developing such a model for the inextensional deformation of shells with zero Gaussian curvature, based on minimisation of the potential energy functional. We propose a novel parametrisation for the curvature relations, which allows us to capture all circular cylindrical and circular conical configurations that a shell may take. These relations are applied in three different models. Firstly, there is the single segment model, that assumes that the area influenced by the prestress field has a circular conical of circular cylindrical shape. This model is applied to a simple bistable shell with a cylindrical and conical stable configuration, and indeed predicts two stable equilibria. Second, we adapt this model such that it can also capture configurations for which the cone vertex lies inside the material, which allows us to approximate the shape of a developable cone. This second model is able to capture the stable equilibria of the bistable D-conical shell and even predicted yet undiscovered stable equilibria. In the third model, we use multiple circular conical and/or circular cylindrical shapes to approximate more complex configurations. As we increase the number of segments used to approximate a certain shape, the model converges towards a steady potential energy value. By comparing the converged potential energy value with the value obtained for a single segment, we finally develop a way to measure the error of a single segment approximation.","Modelling; Multistable Shells; Differential Geometry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Benndorf, J. (mentor); Manning, S. (mentor)","2013","The aim of this research project was to introduce and evaluate an optimization approach for sublevel stope mine optimization using the AMIRA Stope Optimizer that includes grade-risk quantification and can be used by Boliden engineers for future mine planning and economic assesment. It has long been realized that mining simply every part of an orebody with a grade higher than 0 is not economical and will not lead to a successful mining operation. By selecting a cut-off grade it is decided what part of an orebody is economical to extract. In its most basic form the cut-off grade is a break-even grade which makes sure that each block of ore pays for its own mining, processing and refining cost resulting in zero gains and losses for a tonne of ore containing this grade (zero profit). As the aim of most mining companies is to maximize the Net Present Value of its mining projects it becomes clear that the break-even grade in many cases does not accomplish this goal. Research in the field of cut-off grade optimization has proven that a relationship exists between the selection of a cut-off grade and project NPV. Although mathematical equations exist to optimize the cut-off grade and prioject NPV, they contain several simplifications of reality. The mathematical equations are therefore difficult to apply in real world problems and as a result the underground mine planning process is still a mainly manual time consuming process. Boliden Mineral AB (Boliden) is a Swedish mining company that invested in the development of the AMIRA Stope Optimizer. The stope optimization software assists in the optimization of underground stopes at user defined cut-off grades and was developed to accelerate the time consuming underground optimization process. The AMIRA Stope Optimizer was evaluated to define its capabilities and limitations and it was concluded that the software is very valuable in strategic mine planning studies. The stope optimization software was implemented in the mine optimzation process and succesfully applied to optimize a project strategy for one of Boliden’s mineral deposits (Älgträsk). It was found that the optimum gold cut-off grade for this deposit is 1.8 g/t, resulting in a project NPV of 31MSEK. This is a 35% increase in project NPV compared to the break-even grade of 1.6 g/t. The spatial grade uncertainty was identified as a major risk in underground stope design and therefore the optimization process was further extended to account for grade risk in mineral resources and subsequent stope optimization. Grade risk can be assessed by comparing estimated block models of a mineral resource (e.g. Kriging) with stochastic simulated block models of the same mineral resource. Because the simulations provide equally true, but different, interpretations of the mineral resource it is possible to quantify grade risk involved in Kriging estimation model based optimized mine designs. The optimization process was adapted to account for grade risk early in the design process. Instead of optimizing the mining project at a certain cut-off grade based on the estimated model only and subsequently back-analyze the optimization outcome using the simulations, the simulated block models are used in the optimization process itself. By the application of a target confidence level to the desired cut-off grade, the underground production areas are designed to meet the cut-off grade in the estimated model, as well as a percentage of the simulated models. This will reduce the risk of a stope not meeting the cut-off grade which would result in a loss of money. By optimizing the mining project at different confidence levels (eg. 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%) the project economic risk can be quantified and used in decision making.","resource estimation; resource simulation; cut-off grade optimization; stope design optimization; mine design; life of mine scheduling; cash flow analysis; grade risk assessment; economic risk assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-14","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Resource Engineering","",""

The Level of Detail of current state of the art city models (LoD2) is not sufficient for accurate environmental simulations like noise, the solar potential of windows and other types of analyses. An LoD3 building model represents the full architectural exterior of a building with balconies, windows and so forth. The generation of these models needs to be automated as it is otherwise infeasible due to the required high amount of manual labour. In the architectural world, detailed building models are created in IFC format. This thesis shows that it is possible to automatically generate valid and semantically rich CityGML LoD3 building models directly from IFC models. Also an initial investigation is done on the possibilities for the conversion of IFC models to CityGML LoD4. For the conversion the semantic and geometric validity requirements are determined for CityGML. A methodology for the conversion is developed and a prototype implementation is made to prove the effectiveness of the conversion. The conversion consists of three parts: 1) The extraction and mapping of IFC semantics to CityGML semantics; 2) A geometric generalization which extracts the exterior shell using a transformation based on Boolean and morphological operations; 3) Semantic and geometric refinements which optimize the model for analyses. The developed prototype is able to successfully convert IFC models to CityGML LoD3. All the resulting models were geometrically validated according to the ISO19107 standard, and semantics were checked manually. Few improper semantics occur in the output due to missing semantics in IFC. For example, there are no semantics for balconies or dormers in IFC. Recommendations are given to improve the alignment between the two formats. For IFC additional semantics are recommended whereas it is important for CityGML to specify how certain aspects are to be modelled. The research presented in this thesis can be used as the foundation for future work on the interoperability between Architecture and Geomatics.

(TU Delft Aerospace Engineering)","van Bussel, G.J.W. (mentor); Schmehl, R. (mentor); De Breuker, R. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2013","The objective of this research is the simulation of aero-elastic behaviour of Makani’s large airborne wind turbine. This tethered wing operates in crosswind motion, and is equipped with on-board wind turbines. The tether-bridle system attaches the energy generating system to the ground station. It is likely that the structure of this, 28m span, carbon fibre, high aspect ratio wing, will deform considerable under aerodynamic loads. In the worst case scenario, static and/or dynamic aero-elastic e_ects cause destructive failure. The aero-elastic simulation program ASWING is used for the analysis. This program uses a fully nonlinear Bernoulli-Euler beam representation for structural modelling in combination with a lifting linerepresentation for aerodynamic modelling. Linearised unsteady analyses are derived for the Eigenmode analysis. Since the tether-bridle system cannot be modelled in the current program version, an additional, ASWING compatible, module is written. The tether is modelled as a spring with user defined characteristics for the spring sti_ness, mass and aerodynamic drag area. The bridle lines are assumed massless and perfectly rigid. The tether and bridle forces are dependent on the wing flexibility, and wing position and orientation. The tether-bridle module is verified against analytical expressions and by using MATLAB. A wind tunnel test validates the dynamic aero-elastic responses. For the Makani wing, divergence, aileron e_ectiveness and reversal, and flutter behaviour is analysed. Divergence and aileron reversal are no critical modes. However, aileron e_ectiveness is critical. The requirements state a minimum aileron e_ectiveness of 75% at 95m=s flight speed. The program calculated this minimum aileron e_ectiveness at 92m=s flight speed. These problems can be resolved by a 10% increase in the wing’s torsional sti_ness or a 10% increase of lift force increment with aileron deflection. The Eigenmode results showed a critical flutter mode at flight speeds higher than 90m=s, whereas the design flutter speed is equal to 120m=s. This susceptibility to flutter can be resolved by (1) a 50% increase in torsional sti_ness, (2) a 50% increase in in-plane-bending sti_ness or (3) a 10cm upstream shift in center of gravity. A 50cm upstream shift of bridle-wing attachment location increases the flutter speed to 110m=s. It was found that the e_ects, of tether aerodynamic drag and tether weight, are negligible for the aero-elastic behaviour. Also, in the analysis for the Makani wing, the tether spring constant does not contribute to the static and dynamic aero-elastic e_ects. The position of the bridle-wing attachments influences the twist angles and tip deflections of the wing. These results are useful in case maximum twist angles and/or wing tip deflections are critical. For the dynamic aero-elastic behaviour the wing-bridle attachment positions can be adjusted to decrease the susceptibility to flutter.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-27","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Since vehicles are not equipped with a uCAN yet, the uCAN data is emulated. For this emulation, the traffic simulation model Fosim is used. With the emulated uCAN data, the minimum percentage of vehicles equipped with a uCAN that is necessary to accurately estimate the traffic speed is determined. This minimum percentage is equal to the minimum percentage for which the corresponding estimator for the traffic speed satisfies the accuracy requirement of NDW. The obtained percentage is applied to practical settings to generalize this result from a road section to the highway network of the Netherlands. Since the estimator for the traffic speed, based on data from inductive loop detectors, that is used nowadays does not satisfy the NDW requirement, the necessary minimum percentage of vehicles with a uCAN is also determined for two weaker requirements. The results based on these requirements are also generalized to the Dutch highway network. All three obtained necessary minimum percentages of vehicles with a uCAN for the three requirements also hold in the practical settings.","uCAN data; estimator; Fosim; traffic speed; Rijkswaterstaat; inductive loop detector; in-vehicle data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","Statistics","",""

(mentor)","2013","The goal of this research was to develop a concept of a derotator for ATRON. The derotator is a device that counters the rotation of the field of view due to the rotation of the earth. The image of the European-Extremely Large telescope rotates around it’s own axis due to the diurnal motion of the earth. Because of the low signal to noise ratio of the detector it needs a longer integration time, so the image needs to stay still to prevent smearing of the image. The rotation of the image needs to be counter rotated by an optomechanical de-rotation. Because the measurements are done in the infrared spectrum the instrument is placed inside a cryostat with a temperature of 80 K and a pressure of 10-6 bar. The initial idea of ASTRON was to build a passive system where the mirrors and the housing were aligned manually. This proved an impossible task due to the desired accuracy (12,6 µrad for rotation and 5 µm translation RMS values). To get more insight in the optical configuration a study is done on how the rotations and translations of the mirrors and the derotator effect the science beam. With the use of this study, two concepts are devised and graded on their properties. A conceptual test setup is designed to test the main properties of the system and to test the feasibility of the concept. In this study it appeared that almost all the degrees of freedom influence the science beam. It was discovered that a rotation, of the derotator around a specific point had no significant influence on the science beam. With this discovery a big simplification could be applied to the design of the derotator. Within the concept study two concepts where compared. The first concept was actively steering the two degrees of freedom that came from the optical configuration study. The other concept was compensating the error with the chopper. One of the main reasons for choosing the first concept was that there would be a dedicated system to compensate the error. Compensation with the use of the chopper would create extra requirements on the chopper. A test setup was designed to test one degree of freedom on feasibility of the concept. The discovery that the error can be compensated by using the three rotations helped in simplifying the design of the derotator and it was designed as a pendulum. The feasibility was tested and proved to work within specifications.","cryogenic; derotator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2013","Koninklijke de Vries Scheepsbouw (KDVS) vormt samen met Royal van Lent (RVL) en De Voogt Naval Architects (DVNA) een samenwerkingsverband voor de ontwikkeling, productie en verkoop van luxe megajachten. Dit samenwerkingsverband gebruikt de merknaam Feadship is een gerenomeerde naam in het exclusieve segment van de luxe megajachten. Voor Koninklijke de Vries scheepsbouw wordt een werkwijze gehanteerd vastgelegd in een operiationeel excelleren (OE) plan. In dit plan is de ontwikkeling van luxe megajachten verdeeld in de fases „Sales‟, „Design Development‟ (DD), Definitief ontwerp (DO), Detail engineering (DE), Werkvoorbereiding (WVB) en de Productie fase. Dit onderzoek is gestart omdat er problemen werden ervaren tijdens de Definitief ontwerp fase. Door de werkwijze van Koninklijke de Vries scheepsbouw met behulp van de „Delft Systems Approach‟ te analyseren zijn er verschillende problemen geconstateerd. Door de onregelmatige verkoopmoment en de „front end loading‟ doelstellingen in het OE plan fluctueerd de gevraagde capaciteit voor de DO fase sterk. Doordat de DO fase voor het grootste deel door DVNA wordt uitgevoerd zijn er beperkte mogelijkheden om met deze fluctuerende belasting om te gaan. Naast deze sterk wisselende belasting zijn voor veel processen onvoldoende richtlijnen en normen opgesteld. Door het niet opstellen van deze normen en richtlijnen is er vaak veel onduidelijkheid. Dit uit zich in frustraties over bedachte oplossingen, die of niet goed genoeg zijn, of juist niet binnen het budget passen. Ook beperkt dit de mogelijkheid om gebruik te maken van de ervaring die KDVS heeft. Nieuwe medewerkers kunnen alleen via overleg gebruik maken van de ervaring van medewerkers die al langer in dienst zijn. Na deze analyses zijn er twee richtingen waarmee de problemen kunnen worden bestreden waarvan een andere mogelijkheid om invulling te geven aan de flucuterende ontwerp en engineering capaciteit verder is onderzocht. Een andere oplossingsrichting is een verbeterd informatie systeem. Door de flucterende belasting niet alleen door DVNA te laten invullen, maar het werk flexibeler te verdelen over alle ontwerp en engineering capaciteit van KDVS ontstaan een systeem dat beter om kan gaan met de fluctuatie. Daarnaast zou een dergelijk systeem de nu zo belangrijke maar beperkte kennis overdracht tussen verschillende partijen kunnen verbeteren. Om inzicht te krijgen in de gevolgen van flexibelere inzet van de ontwerp en engineering capaciteit is een simulatiemodel ontwikkeld. Hiermee is vastegesteld of de effectiviteit van de totale vaste capaciteit in de verschillende scenario‟s kan leiden tot een verbetering van die effectiviteit met meer dan tien procent. Omdat de kosten voor het ontwikkeltraject maar beperkt aandeel hebben in de totale kosten van een megajacht is het ook nodig om vast te stellen of het ontwerp en engineering traject dan ook betere producten kan leveren. De resultaten van de simulatie geven aan dat een verbetering van de effectiviteit van de vaste capaciteit zestien procent kan bedragen in het scenario waar alle engineering en ontwerp taken voor alle te ontwikkelen megajachten verdeelt over de volledige capaciteit van KDVS. Een verbetering van twaalf procent is te realiseren als per te ontwikkelen megajacht een „vast‟ team wordt gevuld met medewerkers van alle partijen binnen KDVS. Naar aanleiding van deze resultaten wordt aanbevolen om op korte termijn het scenario met de overkoepelende teams te implementeren. Daarnaast is het nodig om de informatie-voorzieningen te verbeteren om de overige problemen verder op te lossen. Dit kan er toe leiden dat op termijn ook het nog flexibelere scenario gebruikt worden. Hoe de verbeterde effectiviteit van de ontwerp en engineeringscapaciteit gebruikt moet worden is een beleidsvraagstuk dat nog beantwoord moet worden. De mogelijkheid om een grotere vaste capaciteit beter in te zetten geeft de beste mogelijkheden om de exclusiviteit van Feadship te behouden.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-17","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Van Paassen, L.A. (mentor); Hicks, M. (mentor); Scarpas, A. (mentor)","2013","This research deals with the evaluation of earthquake induced liquefaction susceptibility of carbonate sands, used as hydraulic fill. Existing evaluation methods are based on in-situ penetration tests (CPT, SPT etc.) and on seismic case histories at sites where silica sands are predominant. These methods cannot be implemented on carbonate sands, due to their crushable nature. Very limited experimental research has been done to evaluate the seismic performance of this type of sand which is abundant in seismically active regions (e.g. Central America). A series of isotropically consolidated undrained cyclic triaxial tests were conducted using a carbonate sand from Central America. The tested Central American carbonate sand is a poorly graded clean beach sand with highly angular grains. The performed test program was set to simulate a typical hydraulic fill structure. For this reason the carbonate samples were tested at three relative densities (20%, 50%, 80%), three effective confinements (50kPa, 100kPa, 150kPa) along with three cyclic loading scenarios represented by the cyclic stress ratio (CSR=0.2, 0.28, 0.32). The evaluation of the liquefaction susceptibility was based on the excess pore-water pressure development during cyclic loading. Cyclic strength curves were generated by plotting the cyclic stress ratios (CSR) with the number of loading cycles until liquefaction (Nf ). These curves were compared to those reported in the literature concerning both silica and other carbonate sands. Overall, the Central American carbonate sand was shown to be less susceptible to liquefaction than silica sands. While both density and confinement had a meaningful effect on its cyclic strength, the former was more influential. Furthermore, compared to Toyoura (silica) and two other carbonate sands, the density effect was less pronounced, whereas the effect of confinement was significant for all carbonate sands. No particle crushing effects were observed, due to the low imposed confinements encountered in a hydraulic fill mass.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""

(mentor)","2013","For the development of a space qualified, 7 degrees of freedom, haptic arm exoskeleton a brushless DC motor with high torque production, power density and efficiency was selected. However, the attraction of the rotor magnets to the stator teeth introduces an additive, position dependent, torque disturbance on the motor shaft called cogging torque. In haptic applications this disturbance impacts the realism of the force reflection and limits control fidelity during master-slave teleoperation. This thesis investigates possible solutions within the constraints of the envisioned application. Due to volume, torque production and efficiency requirements the chosen motor is not to be changed. This rules out the use of motor design based cogging minimization techniques. For this reason only control-based methods are considered. Two methods to identify the cogging waveform were developed. This data was used to do feed-forward compensation using a lookup-table approach and a Fourier series approximation. For comparison, a PID feedback compensation and hybrid approach were also tested. Identification of the cogging torque and testing of compensation methods is done using a custom build measurement setup. A reduction of the RMS cogging of 39% was achieved using the feed-forward approach, while the PID feedback loop resulted in a 46% reduction. A combination of these two methods in the hybrid approach resulted in a reduction of 75%.

(mentor); Oey, M.A. (mentor); Pruyt, E. (mentor)","2013","Organizations are in ever changing environments which results in the need for constant adaptation of business processes and structures. Continuous business process improvements can result in cost savings as well as higher efficiency and effectiveness. In some cases business process improvements can be realized through experience and competent management. However, in more complex processes, decision makers may require some form of decision support. A popular decision support method is business process simulation (BPS) One of the most commonly used applications of BPS is Discrete Event Simulation (DES). This application is also used at ING for business process management purposes. DES can be a very powerful method in case much data is available in the target system and the process is transparent. However, if a system contains deep uncertainties, a different approach is required. Deep uncertainty exists in business processes in case process analysts and other stakeholders do not know or cannot agree upon the structure of a process, the value of key variables in a process, and the valuation of desired outcomes. A possible approach in dealing with deep uncertainty is Exploratory Modeling and Analysis (EMA). EMA can be used to explore possible futures based on simulation models. Existing methods for dealing with uncertainty in discrete event simulations are largely limited to variations in input variables. Hence, it seems undesirable to use DES in highly uncertain environments. However, based on promising applications of EMA in other modeling fields (system dynamics and agent based modeling), the questions arises whether or not it is possible and if so, desirable to apply an EMA approach on DES studies. So far, no attempts have been made to apply an EMA approach on DES studies, resulting in the central research question for this thesis: How can an Exploratory Modeling and Analysis (EMA) approach be applied on Discrete Event Simulation (DES) in order to help decision makers design business processes and develop adaptive polices under uncertainty? To answer this research question an approach is proposed based on traditional DES modeling from an EMA point of view. This approach is tested in a case study at ING Arrears Management where there is a need for decision support during the development of new processes in an uncertain environment. Hence, the main objective of this thesis is to experiment with applying EMA on DES in an uncertain business process environment and to elicit the basic methodological principles for doing so. Uncertainties are identified at ING Arrears Management, aggregate simulation models are used to produce large databases with thousands of scenarios depicting a solution space full of plausible future scenarios in terms of business process performance at ING Arrears Management. This solution space is explored through an EMA methodology called scenario discovery. In scenario discovery, the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM) is applied to find danger zones in the solution space. PRIM is essentially a bump hunting algorithm that identifies areas in the solution space that contain a high density of cases of interest. These high density areas are interpreted as danger zones that could jeopardize the achievement of business objectives at ING Arrears Management. The application of the proposed approach towards applying EMA on DES resulted in the identification of several danger zones that form a starting point for the development of adaptive policies at ING Arrears Management for the purpose of avoiding the identified danger zones. Furthermore, bottlenecks were identified as well potential capacity issues in various sub-processes. However, numerous potentially dangerous scenarios remain unexplained through the application of PRIM analysis. Therefore, based on the case study, it can be concluded ING Arrears Management was partly helped in designing efficient new business processes in an uncertain business process environment. Even though the case study at ING Arrears Management was not completely solved through the application of the proposed approach, it can be concluded that the approach shows great potential compared to a traditional DES approach. Not only in the appropriate use of tools and techniques for EMA, but also in the application of an iterative approach in practice that resulted in helping decision makers at ING Arrears Management in identifying gaps, risks and weak spots in their proposed business processes. Considering the added value of an application of EMA at ING Arrears Management, it can be concluded that a partial proof of concept for the proposed approach has been acquired. However, the (partial) proof of concept is based on a single case study. For this reason, extrapolation of conclusions towards business processes under uncertainty in general must be done with great care. Considering the proof of (partial) proof of concept provided in this research is only valid for the case study presented in this report, the most important recommendation is to apply an EMA approach on DES on other cases where business processes under (deep) uncertainty can be identified. When choosing case studies for future research, it is recommended to select case studies in which an attempt can be made to study identified methodological obstacles including probabilistic information in DES models, application of other data mining and machine learning techniques, and further development of integrated technical tools for applying EMA on DES.","Business Process Simulation; Discrete Event Simulation; Exploratory Modeling and Analysis; Deep Uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Systems Engineering","","Systems Engineering","",""

(mentor); Koussios, S. (mentor)","2013","A good structural health monitoring system on a composite repair can improve the understanding of the life of such a repair. Currently, overwrap repairs are considered to be temporary in nature due to the unknown life expectancy. Using finite element modelling, a model was created of a pipe with a repaired defect and a composite overwrap. This model was then validated by testing pipe specimens that have the same defect and the same repair. In these models and test specimens an initial (100%) repaired damage is present which was increased to a 150% initial defect. A comparison between the 100% and 150% shows the ability of detecting the increase in both the model and the specimen for axial and hoop strain. Further damage is researched by implementing delaminations at the edges (ingress points for water/corrosion) and in between the edge and the initial repaired defect. The conducted tests revealed strain transfer problems on a (composite) surface containing voids/defects. The main issue however is that damage (and damage growth) is quantitatively detected in both the model and the test specimens. Other tests included the comparison of adhesives that are used to apply the optical sensors to the pipe. This in order to rule out any errors in measurements between the surface of the composite repair and the fibre Bragg grating itself. The result was that there is no difference between adhesives in the conducted fatigue test. Also some material characterization was attempted but these results are not reliable due to the voided nature of the used cured composite. The other aspects of a structural health monitoring system are of course the system used to detect strains. A close look at the available optical systems, such as Brillouin and Rayleigh scattering, shows that fibre Bragg gratings are the most suitable in this project. Deeper investigation into critical and less critical parameters shows that the design of such a sensor system is not trivial. Consideration to coatings, temperature, fatigue limits, optical losses, cost etc. has to be given as these can influence the final resulting sensor system. The harsh environment the sensors operate in has to be researched in more depth in following reports since they are critical to the performance.","FBG; optical; SHM; OPTONDT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-12-19","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","Design and production of composite structures","",""

However, for the majority of western people, the Chinese language, especially the Chinese symbol: characters are something that is interesting but unreachable. From the designer’s experience, it seemed that there is a huge iceberg standing in between westerners and Chinese characters. This project is therefore initiated to identify the common difficulties that westerners have when encountering with the Chinese characters and to explore how design can help encouraging westerners to get to know it. “What is the “ice” for western learners in learning Chinese and how to break it?” was stated in the beginning of this project. Literature and observation studies were performed to analyze the current situation of Chinese as a foreign language (CFL). Besides, an in-depth user research including interviews and group session with inexperience westerners and experienced Chinese learners was conducted in order to answer the research questions. Then, the findings guided to define the specific design goal of the project, which is to design a product that inspires westerners to get to know Chinese characters by creating a new writing experience. A list of design criteria, together with the feedback received from users, was used for idea generation and final concept development. LikeChinese, the final design, offers users a new way to meet the most spoken language in the world: Chinese. It includes an inviting flyer, a website and a mobile application. The application as the main design outcome of this project uses users’ initial impression of the Chinese language to let users explore characters in a creative and artistic way. LikeChinese is based on the 214 most frequently used ‘components’ of characters, instead of focusing on thousands of full characters. The meanings of these parts of characters are used to frame the stories that Chinese characters tell and thereby reveal the common sense behind the characters. The application also allows users to create their own stories (with their own made-up characters), which makes the user build connection with characters and shares their thinking through the Chinese language. Users can share their invented characters and the stories they created to whom have the same interests through an online platform. It will create a sense of belonging and inspiring. The design was evaluated based on the user testing. The results showed that the design made users realize they knew more about Chinese characters than they originally thought and unconsciously feel closer and more fascinated with Chinese characters. That is to say, the design goal has been reached.","interaction design; user experience; App design; Chinese characters; Chinese as a forgien language","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

To translate the two-dimensional information about the rectangles to three-dimensional information about the cylinders, an inverse relationship between the bivariate probability density function of the height and squared half-width of a rectangle and the bivariate density of the height and squared radius of a cylinder is established. The former density is estimated by a bivariate modified Gamma kernel density estimator, and the relationship between the two densities is used to numerically transform this estimator into an estimator for the latter density. For the selection of the bandwidth parameters of the kernel density estimator, both a method based on the Integrated Squared Error of the kernel density estimator and a method based on the Integrated Squared Error of the transformed estimator are considered. The estimator for the height and squared radius of a cylinder is constructed for the underlying density of an example data set as well as for the underlying density of an experimental data set. These bivariate estimators are used to construct an estimator for the marginal density of the squared radius of a cylinder and the density of the volume of a cylinder.","Bivariate density estimation; Oriented Cylinder Model; Kernel density estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","Statistics","",""

(mentor)","2013","Renewable Energy Technologies (RET) are the most promising way of covering the (present and future) energy demands all over the world in a sustainable manner and they have a big potential for being the energy leader in a few years. Until recently RET have supplied between 15 and 20% of the energy world demand and this will be possibly increased up to more than 20% in 2020, according to the Kyoto protocol that introduces at least 20% energy supply by RET and 20% less CO2 emissions by then. The European Union countries, considering the fossil fuel reserves’ long-term depletion and their negative impact on environment, aim to meet these goals and move towards renewable energy solutions that combine both technological development and economic viability. However only a small part of the RET potential is efficiently implemented, since there are many different barriers that pose a threat to the transition to renewable technologies. These barriers to RE promotion include mainly the lack of cost effectiveness, market competition (from conventional energy technologies), technical, institutional, political, social and environmental barriers. In this Thesis the economic-financial barriers will be examined mainly in a more elaborated scale but also the rest of the barriers will be analysed always considering their economic aspects and impacts. These obstacles are responsible for keeping the world locked into an insecure, inefficient and high-carbon energy system unwilling to adopt new alternative energy technologies, a situation that is well known as lock-in system. The big challenge is to inform and educate people according to certain standards and find economic policies and instruments so as the renewable technologies to get locked-out. In order to create such a framework with both the obstacles stopping the alternative methods’ further development and the measures that could be implemented to solve this problem, it is necessary to select a certain renewable technology in a certain region. Therefore the fuel cell technology in Europe (as immature technology being strongly locked-out) will be examined as an example to identify its technical characteristics and history over the years, the economic barriers stopping its promotion by comparing different EU countries and finally define the economic policies that could help its further development in the less developed of them (Greece).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Economics of Innovation","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Kleinsmann, M. (mentor)","2013","Today, making business, and more importantly, staying in business is becoming more and more complex for companies. Organizations are aware that if they want to survive they have no longer the option of carrying on doing today what worked yesterday. Innovation seems to be the shared answer among companies for responding to the fast-changing environment that we live in, and following that promise, many companies embark in the journey of pursuing innovation. This project was done in a similar context for the company Dimensys, an IT consulting company. A group within Dimensys decided to pursue an innovation initiative over a year ago, aiming to cope with market challenges like the maturity of their software solution, the saturation of their target market and the reduced new projects due to the financial crisis, among others. However soon after they began they noticed they had not been able to bring everybody on board, starting by the senior colleagues who showed opposition and the rest of the colleagues who remained neutral and did not seem enthusiastic to get involved. The approach to the problem was made with the design thinking methodology. The complex problem as perceived initially was framed as an unshared need for innovation and for the vision of innovation. The problem of different perceptions in regards to innovation seemed to be exacerbated by the age gap between the newer or younger personnel (around 30 years old) and the personnel who had more experience in the company (around 50 years old). These groups not only had different personal and professional interests to keep learning and innovating, but they also had different perceptions of the competitive world in which Dimensys operates. A vast research was performed to grasp the problem, using as pillars the innovation theory and organizational behavior. To support understanding the problem various research methods were followed, a literature review, an external analysis of the best practices, an internal analysis of possible organizational barriers related to norms and practices or employee’s behaviors, and a participatory session with the employees. Several internal barriers were detected such as the unawareness of their own issues existing among employees and impeding collaboration, a lack of understanding of the vision of the company and its input for innovation, and intergenerational barriers to collaborate, among others. By the end of the project the aim was to provide Dimensys with strategic advice on how they could build a culture that fosters innovation. For that goal, the knowledge and insights gained throughout the project research were used as input for creating something that fit the situation of Dimensys. A step approach was formulated to provide Dimensys with guidance on the practices that they could work on to overcome their barriers. Design tools were selected to be the means that Dimensys could use for further working on addressing their internal barriers because they provide a way to understand abstract situations and provide tangible means for people to express their ideas better. A participatory approach was also recommended to Dimensys to as a way to integrate employees in the ideation and some extent of the decision making to generate more involvement and ownership of the improvements to their practices. The logic behind the proposal is creating new practices that actively show that innovation is a priority of the company, so that individuals and groups can undergo the process of learning what are the expected behaviors and norms for working in Dimensys. Gradually, with discipline and leading by example, the norms and behaviors of people are expected to align to the new designed norm to become the new organizational culture.","innovation; organizational culture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

The fast particle system approach has not yet been used to model inflatable beam structures. The goal of this research is to investigate if the bending behaviour of inflatable beams can be modelled accurately by a particle system approach and how such a model affects the computational costs. The inflatable tubular beam is segmented into a number of discrete elements which are connected by rotational joints which include rotary springs. A cluster of 6 particles interconnected with 13 spring forces in the shape of a pyramid was introduced to approximate each discrete beam segment. The reaction moments in the rotary springs were translated to reaction forces on the particles of two connecting pyramids. The simulation was programmed in a Java based particle system environment which uses the implicit Euler integration method for its stability properties. The required Jacobians of the proposed rotary spring reaction forces were derived analytically. The bending behaviour was defined accurate when the tip-deflection deviated less than 1mm with respect to a reference value. A clamped beam with linear stiffness was modelled and compared to Bernoulli bending theory. An inflatable beam with non-linear bending stiffness was then built and compared to a function that was fitted through experimental data of inflatable beams subjected to a tip-force. Accurate bending behaviour was achieved for both test-cases. The computation costs were measured by counting floating point operations in one iteration of a simulation. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the floating point operations induced by adding normal springs, rotary springs, particles, pyramid elements and iterations in the solver. It was found that the rotary springs are roughly 30 times more expensive to compute than normal spring forces. The real-time computation limit was tested by adding multiple beams to the simulation environment. The model proved computationally heavy as the computation time was bounded by the floating point performance of the hardware. Equations describing the computational costs in the particle system could roughly predict the computation time. A simulation of 17 beams comprised of approximately 350 particles, 50 rotary springs and 900 normal springs can run real-time on 2.4 Ghz computer using Java.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy","","","",""

Screening of disease associated genes will aid the diagnosis of disorders with a genetic component. The diagnosis of cancer is of particular interest due to its variety and prevalence. The obtained mutations provide clues about underlying biological properties that could be used for classification. Classification of a tumour as a particular type of cancer is an important step towards treatment. But currently no method exists that can directly classify cancers using next generation sequencing derived mutations. We have developed a classification method in which tumours are modelled as bags of annotated somatic mutations. Our method uses a machine learning approach to identify and select the relevant mutations and subsequently train a classifier for each type of cancer. The selected mutations result in an interpretable model that sheds light onto which biological properties are important to separate one cancer type from the others. We compare the proposed method to two other approaches. First a gene based approach in which the mutations are reduced to a mutation count per gene. Second a distance approach that uses all the available mutations, but returns a model that is hard to interpret. We show that the proposed method performs equally well when compared to the first approach. Our method achieves performance close to the second approach, while it yields a model that allows for biological interpretation.","cancer; multiple instance learning; somatic mutations; classification; machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-02","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Pattern Recognition & Bioinformatics Group","","M.Sc.

(mentor); Rusak, Z. (mentor)","2013","The graduation assignment is defined as follows: design a low cost bicycle for both male and female students in The Netherlands. Investigate what factors can decrease the costs by researching the entire supply chain and material costs. Determine which parts need to be redesigned and which parts will remain standard. Investigate what the possibilities are for self-assembling. The bicycle should be stripped from all the components which are not essential for cycling. The user should be able to assemble the bicycle by him- or herself with the use of basic tools which are present in an average household. The project started with an analysis phase. A market, user, product and literature research resulted into a list of requirements. The most important requirements are: the usual dealer margin must be eliminated by using a webshop (1), the assembling costs usually take up 25% of the total price, this must be reduced by letting the user assemble the product (2), the bicycle must have a selling price under 100,- (3), the bracket axle, steering head and wheels need to be pre-assembled (4), the frame needs to be redesigned will maintaining enough strength and stiffness(5), the tariff duty on transport costs need to be decreased by transporting the product into loose parts, the assembling of the bicycle may not take longer than 90 minutes and needs to be finished in less than 25 actions. After the analysis phase the idea generation started. An individual brainstorm as well as a group brainwriting session have been conducted to generate ideas. This resulted in three different concepts, which are all based on a redesign of the frame that can be self-assembled by the user. The first concept is based on a sheet metal frame produced by pressing it into shape. The second concept is based on a frame which uses a constant extrusion profile and is connected by simplistic sheet material parts which are lasercut. The third concept is based on a frame made out of sheet material produced by stamping creating a “truss-like” structure. Based on the weighted criteria method, the second concept was chosen to develop further in the embodiment design phase. The detailing of the concept involved researching the production process of aluminum extrusion for the frame elements and lasercutting for the connection pieces. A complete CAD model has been developed for simulating extreme user scenarios to validate the strength and stiffness of the design. This resulted in several innovative solutions for the bracket axle, front fork and seat adjustment. The design is called “ALEX”” derived from the production process being aluminum extrusion. ALEX is designed so that it can be assembled with a Wrench 10 and an Allen key 5. Also a analysis of the aesthetics, packaging and transport has been done. All these analyses were used as an input for a detailed cost estimation. The estimated selling price is 85. A full scale prototype has been developed to validate the self-assembling features of the design. A user-test with four persons has been conducted in order to investigate if they could assemble ALEX by themselves with the help of a provided manual. Some recommendations are given and the entire project is concluded and evaluated in the last section with the list of requirements. ALEX has four unique selling points: it is low cost, able to be self-assembled by the user, has an innovative design and can be delivered right on the doorstep in a box as big as a 28” wheel.","bicycle; low cost; self-assemble; bike; extrusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-12-13","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","Product Engineering","",""

To this end, multi-rotor UAVs, such as the Aerialtronics Altura V2, offer accurate, automated, suspended flight, with minimal user engagement. The project investigated into whether such devices can be used effectively for sailing knowledge and skills development. Current video capture methods in use by the Dutch Olympic sailing team are bound to the water surface and thus do not deliver stabilised footage, which could be used for evaluation and valuable feedback. The Altura V2, which was the basis for this project, is not fit for use in such harsh conditions due to risk of water damage and vehicle loss. Marine applications also bring on operational issues relating to launch, control and landing, all done from aboard a 6 meter Rigid Inflatable Boat. The Aqualtura prototypes assisted in Olympic sailing training and helped capture footage of the Nacra 17 World Championship in the Scheveningen Bay. The autonomous features of the UAV (position-hold, follow-me) allow the coach to deploy and focus on his coaching tasks without absorbing his attention in piloting the device. The recorded footage is made available on the water, allowing for instantaneous feedback sessions with the athletes. Based on 2 prototypes, 35 flights (17 at sea) with 4 pilots and 2 water landings, the process revealed numerous design considerations. These can be used as guidelines for the further development of a waterproof UAV suitable for other marine applications, such as search-and-rescue or inspection of oil-rigs and wind turbines.

(mentor); Dehli, S.R. (mentor); Christiaansen, G. (mentor)","2013","Philips offers a range of mother and child care products under the name of Philips AVENT. As Philips AVENT is the company’s brand for baby feeding, Philips Design sees a potential link with innovation opportunities for optimizing nutrition and partnering with families in the NICU and strengthening the business of Philips AVENT with a market expansion towards the hospital. The goal of this project is to identify opportunities and solutions for Philips AVENT to enter the hospital market, and it specifically focuses on parental involvement and optimizing nutrition in the NICU. Parental Involvement The attachment process between parents and their child is important for the wellbeing of both parties. The prematurity of the infant and the fact that it brings a period of hospitalization hamper the development of this bond. Designing interventions to support the establishment of a durable bond between parents and infant asks for a definition of bonding and an analysis of the process. Identification of positive influences and possible opportunities creates room for interventions. The NICU, the environment where the bonding process takes place, is a facilitator for parents to learn about their child. Comforting the parents gives them room to observe and learn. The NICU-nurses are an important precondition in the parent-infant attachment process. They educate, show, involve and support the parents in their journey from birth to discharge. The nurses need the knowledge, knowhow and time to focus on the emotional and psychological needs of parents in this process. The NICU needs to be designed to facilitate the parents to spend time on the bedside of their child and gradually develop their skills. Optimizing Nutrition Nutrition is an important part of care. It is necessary for the infant to grow and develop, and as it develops, its nutritional needs change. With every new method of feeding, the nutrition changes, the tasks for the staff changes and the role of the parents changes. Technological inventions serve the needs of the staff to feed the baby, put the parents are an often forgotton subject of research for innovation. Even despite their important role, especially of the mother. Breast pumping has always been subject of innovation, but their role in optimizing nutrition is more than that. Design direction 1: Education & training The design direction education & training is based on the insights from parental involvement and the issues that were gathered during the workshop with the NICU staff. The role that Philips AVENT can take with this design direction is the role of the guiding hand for the parents and the staff. Parents have no knowledge or experience most of the time they enter the NICU. There is a need for educating support to assist and train parents of ill, hospitalized preterm infants. Nurses are in a powerful position to influence parents’ ability to cope with stressors and to parent effectively. Design direction 2: Parental support & motivation The design direction parental support & motivation focusses on all the issues that parents have during their dilemma of home versus hospital when their child is hospitalized. It focusses on developing solutions for care while not being together, the emotions that come with separation of mother/father and child, the issues that the logistics of travelling between different contexts brings and the support for the activities that parents can and have to perform in the first months of the life of their child. The role of Philips AVENT in this design direction is the role of the bridge between hospital and home. Facilitating the parents when they are in the NICU, and supporting them with communication tools, webcams or other equipment to feel involved when they are at home are opportunities to support parents during this period. Design direction 3: Developmental support of the baby The design direction of developmental support of the baby focusses on the technological innovation possibilities to support and stimulate the natural development of a premature infant. The competitive advantage that Philips AVENT can achieve with this can give its hospital market strategy a valuable boost. The strategy for Philips AVENT 1. Philips AVENT has to deliver the highest technological standards to compete with established brands. This applies to the development of similar products, such as a professional breast pump, but it is also applicable on the introduction of technology that is new to the NICU market. 2. Philips AVENT has to maintain the unity in their product portfolio and increase the interchangeability of their products. They have to show the connection between different contexts, activities and their products to clarify the value of their propositions. And by designing the context of their propositions as well, the value for the users will increase. The two different contexts of hospital and home can become connected through Philips AVENT product propositions. Keen for the strategy of Philips AVENT must not be the endorsement of a specific product, but the endorsement of an activity that has to be performed. 3. Philips AVENT has to distinguish itself from its competitors with the design of their products. The current offer of consumer products in the hospital market is designed for the hospital. When Philips AVENT designs its products with a look that is more appealing to the consumer, it will differentiate the product from its competitors and add value to the context of the NICU as well. The NICU is a place where parents and children should feel at home. The design of the new propositions can contribute to this feeling. 4. With their product propositions for the NICU market, Philips AVENT has to focus on the combination of physical wellbeing and mental wellbeing. This will add new features and requirements to their product propositions, but it will fulfill the needs of the NICU stakeholders and stimulate the unity in the product portfolio of Philips AVENT. Philips AVENT, for the best start in life.","neonatology; integrative; developmental; care; strategy; design directions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-12-13","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

He started a promotion campaign for an Open Government and ordered government data to be made available as Open Data. In essence, Open Data is data published online which can be used and republished without restrictions from mechanisms of control. It is believed that most government data can be leveraged as fuel for innovation. A survey by TNO for the Dutch policymakers concluded that Open Data, including government data, has big economic value. The motivation and intuition behind our research is that the publication of large sets of (linked) Open Data may lead to unforeseen breaches in data sensitivity and privacy. Therefore, we conducted interviews with policy makers who are responsible for the publication of Open Data. From the interviews, we conclude that there is no clear view on the possible issues surrounding the publication of Open Data. The data publishing task is usually delegated to institutions such as Statistics Netherlands(CBS). Moreover, a literature survey demonstrated that current research focuses solely on data privacy, ignoring other forms of unwanted publication such as data sensitivity. The unclear view on possible issues and the focus of literature on data privacy have motivated us to propose a new data publishing process, supported by an automated decision support tool.

(mentor); Rietveld, L.C. (mentor); Baars, E. (mentor); Olsthoorn, T.H. (mentor)","2013","Calcium carbonate pellets are produced as a by-product in the softening process. In The Netherlands, these pellets are applied as a raw material in several industrial and agricultural processes. The sand grain inside the pellet hinders the application in some high potential market segments such as paper and glass. Earlier work showed that it is technologically possible and in some cases economically feasible to replace sand grains with commercially available calcite grains obtained from limestone (e.g. in Italy or Germany). ). In order to further increase sustainability by reduction of transport, it might be possible to grind and sieve the pellets and reuse this grinded Dutch calcite as seeding material for pellet softening process. The goal of this research was to determine the possibilities of the use of grinded Dutch calcite as an alternative for the use of garnet sand as seeding material in the pellet softening process. A comparison between grinded calcite and garnet sand is made based on the five key performance indicators (K.P.I.’s): quality, quantity, costs, reliability and sustainability. Pilot scale tests were conducted at Weesperkarspel (Waternet) during the winter period. The produced calcite pellets were dried, grinded and sieved calcite as seeding material (0.5 mm) by grinding and sieving the Dutch calcite pellets (1 mm). The produced calcite grains were applied as seeding material in a fluidized bed softening reactor (? = 30 cm; height = 6 m; velocity = 60-80 m/h). The effect on sustainability was based on a life cycle analysis (LCA) performed in SimaPro. An FMECA was carried out to identify possible risks failures for the fullscale implementation. The grinding and sieving experiment showed that an overall yield of 40 % of grinded calcite pellets with a diameter of 0.4 – 0.6 mm, could be reached. The pilot pellet softening experiments showed that the softening performance of the Italian calcite and the grinded Dutch calcite scenario, in terms of water quality parameters (total hardness, turbidity, pH, NaOH dosage), were comparable from the garnet scenario. The results of the modeling in Stimela showed comparable results with the pilot plan experiments. The LCA concerning the Weesperkarspel plant and its pre-treatment showed a score of 215,250 EcoPoints (Barrios et al., 2008). The scenario of grinded calcite seeding material results in a decrease of about 3824 EcoPoints, 1.8 %, due to reduced transportation of garnet. Usage of grinded pellets in Dutch industries (compared to imported calcite) results in a total decrease of 10.640 EcoPoints, 5%, mainly caused by the reduced transportation. The business case showed that costs of the seeding material will be lower due to the reuse of the grinded pellets as seeding material. Due to the improved pellet quality the pellet turnover will increase. The worst-case scenario showed a possible cost reduction for the WPK plant of  38,000 (1.8%). For both treatments of Waternet a costs reduction of  120.310 (1%) can be achieved. The scenario study for the full-scale implementation showed that a transition, of all eight reactors at the treatment facility of WPK, from garnet sand to calcite as a seeding material introduced the fewest risks for water quality and reliability. The FMECA showed that for the full-scale implementation the hygiene of the seeding material is an important factor.","pellet; softening; calcite; garnet; drinking water treatment; Waternet; reuse; grinding; seeding material; FMECA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

(mentor); Lopes, G.A.D. (mentor); Fechner, U. (mentor)","2013","Rising demands in energy consumption necessitate the development of low-cost renewable power generation. A Kite Power Sytem (KPS) is a novel approach to harvest wind energy with kites at higher altitudes than is possible with conventional wind turbines, at a lower cost. In this thesis, an approach to improve the winch controller of a KPS will be proposed in order to increase the power output. Measurements of the test system revealed an especially poor performance during the reel out phase, where the tether force was constrained to a maximum. It was found that a propagation delay is present on the system input. A force tracking controller for the reel out phase therefore needs to be developed, which accounts for the system’s propagation delays. A nonlinear KPS model that can be used in control algorithm design was presented. To control the nonlinear system across its full operating region, a gain scheduled feedback controller was proposed. It was found that the stability of the modeled original system was compromised when the system delay is high enough. By extending the system with a compliant element, a larger delay can be allowed before instability occurs. Within the boundary conditions of the nonlinear KPS model, by applying gain scheduled feedback control with integral action and extending the system with a compliant element, the winch controller can asymptotically track a force reference across its operating region in case of system delays. Given that the correct force reference is supplied, this will increase the power output of the KPS.","kite power; airborne wind energy; gain scheduling; winch control; compliant element","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-04","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","DCSC","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Brand, D.I. (mentor); Schouten, R. (mentor)","2013","Currently we live in a world where design defines. Before we focused on pure functionality in terms of technology, whereas today we want to realize an emotional function. This functionality of expression is reflected by the world of yachting as well. The experience a superyacht offers has become almost more important than the object itself. These personal experiences are related to lifestyle and culture. The effect of the change to lifestyle object is a superyacht should have a personality on its own with the ability to evoke emotional responses. This change has lead to a culture where yachts have become sculptures with form as the emotive expression. But form is often defined by excessive ornamentation, which has a negative effect on the longevity and expressed quality of the object. With the need for a more expressive aesthetic, it is important to define a philosophy on design. Without a strong vision, more expressive designed yachts could lead to consequences for the brand image, since the yachts out there are a reflection of the brand. Feadship, the world’s number one custom yacht builder, is known for its high quality and therefore quality should always been expressed by the object, not only in terms of manufacture but also in terms of design. The aesthetic communicates and therefore it is important to being aware of the story communicated by form while creating it. Since a boat is communicating its identity first foremost from the outside, its appearance is an important factor to take into account. To add the emotional layer to the object, creating just perfect surfaces is not sufficient. Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder where design must focus on the meaning of these surfaces; the associations created by the object. Yacht designers get too soon in the practical level of design. The higher more abstract levels are so important, because the foundation – the basis for emotional bonding - is created at these abstract levels. Custom design is more than custom made. Next to practical wishes, custom design is the translation of the owners dream to an object that will arouse an imagination associated with that dream. Design for emotion is not about the object, but about the relationship between user and object. Defined by gesture and product character, a strong product personality with the power to express a one sided message is the communicator for this association. Like any product, yachts express product personality as well, but not all having a strong personality. A strong product personality is required to communicate a strong message. The approach to evoke emotional responses, together with taken into account the importance of expressed quality and longevity of the yacht, has resulted in a novel designed yacht. The final design proposal is based on minimalistic design, yet having an expressive spirit.","lifestyle; custom design; association; product personality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Langendoen, K.G. (mentor)","2013","In recent years, there is an increasing interest in the scientific community for development of algorithms targeting large-scale networks. In addition to their sheer size, these networks also exhibit various topology dynamics -- nodes join and exit at high rates (churn), are mobile and are not always reliable. Such extreme properties make centralized algorithms unsuitable in a lot of practical situations. %Moreover, the majority of distributed algorithms require a coordinated starting condition. When execution ends (e.g., leader is elected), the entire procedure needs to be restarted thus leading to a lack of responsiveness to internal and external dynamics. Our goal is to find algorithms that run continuously and are based on local rules only (i.e., decisions based on information exchanged through 1-hop interactions). If designed correctly, these algorithms are highly scalable and robust. However, identifying the local rules is a very difficult task with no clear discovery methodology. The heuristics we introduce in this thesis represent a so-called ""global-to-local compiler"" -- designed to search for a mapping between global system requirements and local interaction rules. We test search methods such as Hill-Climbing, Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search. Additionally, we develop custom heuristics such as GG (Generation Gap) Tabu Hill-Climbing, GG Tabu Simulated Annealing and an implementation of GOMEA, named GOMGP. We perform thorough benchmarking in order to find the optimal parameter configuration. For the identified parameter combinations, the heuristics vastly outperform state-of-the-art heuristics. We discover new algorithms for the problems: ""distributed maximal independent set formation'' and ""event localization using graph spectral theory'' with good results and insights. Finally, we improve existing algorithms for the ""node failure rate estimation'' (FailDetect) and ""churn rate estimation'' (ChurnDetect). The improvements consist of lower estimation variance at network nodes.","Genetic Programming; Large-Scale Systems; Distributed Algorithms; Algorithm Discovery; Scalability; Wireless Sensor Networks; Optimization Heuristics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Software","","Computer Science, Software Technology Track, Parallel and Distributed Systems Specialization","",""

(mentor); De Gijt, J.G. (mentor); Bakker, K.J. (mentor); Everts, H.J. (mentor)","2013","This thesis has as subject the shielding effect of piles on the front wall of quay walls. The reason for writing this paper is to find an answer to the difference between field measurements and design calculations of stresses and deflections in the front wall of a special type of quay wall in the Port of Rotterdam. The relevance of this issue concerns the optimization of a quay wall with relieving structure to investigate the behavior of this construction and possibly to reduce costs. Focus is on the behavior of prefabricated concrete bearing piles and MV-pile anchors below relieving structures. This thesis has been prepared for obtaining the degree Master of Science in Civil Engineering at the Technical University in Delft. The purpose of this research is to analyze and quantify the shielding effect of piles on the front retaining wall of quay walls. From measurements on the extension works for the EKOM quay wall in the Port of Rotterdam it can be concluded that the design calculations and field measurements do not comply. The calculated maximum front wall deflections are higher than the measured values and also the maximum calculated bending moments in the front retaining wall are higher than measured. These findings have been used in the design of a more recent quay wall project in the Amazonehaven by applying bending moment reduction factors for the front retaining wall. This research focusses on how the prefabricated concrete bearing piles and MV-pile anchors contribute to lower deformations and bending moments in the front retaining wall. For this research a literature study is conducted to determine the design aspects of an existing quay wall in the Amazonehaven in the Port of Rotterdam. Furthermore the recommendations of the handbook Quay Walls, design guidelines for horizontally loaded piles, behavior of arc forces in soils and recommendations for shell factors in soils have been studied. For the research an analytical method based on Van IJsseldijk - Loof and Begemann – De Leeuw and also a finite element method (FEM) using Plaxis 2D have been applied. The results of the analytical method have resulted in an initial input on the shielding effect of piles on the front retaining wall of quay walls. The method makes use of simplified models and ground data. Horizontal soil stress reductions near the combi-wall over the Holocene soil layers of 20% is considered maximum feasible. The method based on FEM is prepared to make a comparison with the analytical method and to use sophisticated models and soil data for more details. The comparison shows that the horizontal soil stress reductions near the combi-wall corresponds well, but that the bending moments and pile wall deflections differ between both methods. The conclusions reached with the FEM method has led to a shielding effect of the piles on the maximum field bending moments in the combi-wall of 13%. The MV-pile anchors have a small to negligible influence on the shielding effect. As conclusion it can be said that for the design of quay walls with relieving structures the shielding effect of piles on the front retaining wall is part of the design. Reductions of 13% are achievable according to the FEM analysis. It is advised to design quay walls with relieving structures with FEM. This provides a better picture of how relieving structures work and the shielding effect of piles can be modeled in more detail. It is also recommended to conduct more field research to determine the shielding effects for different quay walls designs.","quay walls; relieving effect; shielding effect; Finite Element Method; plaxis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

Desired pore and cell diameters can be obtained throughout the film thickness by choosing the right voltage profile.

It is found that a chirp signal can be used to estimate the TOA at a sufficient accuracy. The errors caused by the distance-estimation method used, occur if the microphone and loud-speaker on a phone are not co-located. The error is only present when the different phones have different orientations. In the best case, the microphone positions can be estimated at accuracy less than five millimetres. A direct relation between the maximum error and the distance between the microphone and loudspeaker on the phones is found. In a computersimulation the error only exceeds an average of 5 centimetres when 10 or more phones are used, placed at random locations and orientations.

Passengers respond to this by creating isolated cocoons in which the passenger experience privacy and comfort. This behavior is stimulated by airlines who provide mentally passive stimulation, e.g. listening to music or watching a movie. Since the passenger is only on the receiving end, their energy level during a flight drops, resulting in a feeling of extreme tiredness. KLM feels responsible for solving this ‘problem’, since they create the unnatural inflight environment. The aim of the project was to investigate the possibilities to increase the energy level of passengers on long-haul flights and develop a more dynamic product with the acquired knowledge. During the first phase of the project the possibilities to increase the energy level are linked to inflight environment. It appeared that individuals have quite some tricks to change their mood and therefore their energy level. A general used method for changing mood is consuming something, this something can be anything from a cup of coffee, to a piece of chocolate. By regulating this consumption individuals are in control of their own mood The possibility to self regulate mood is exactly what is lacking in the inflight environment where passengers have only limited control on their consumption. It would be time consuming to make a tailor made inflight consumption system, plus this is not one of the expectations of KLM passengers. But passengers’ feedback showed that there is something to win during the finishing of the consumption moment. The consumption moment is appreciated by the passengers, since it offers the possibility to do something useful. During eating, passengers follow the rules but in a playful manner, it provides the option to do something your own way. Though, one thing that is missing in the current experience is the option to properly finish the meal and do this in your own pace. The Beyond Blue tray gives this freedom back to passenger, resulting in personally finishing an appreciated moment. After finishing the meal the passenger can lean back and take his time to relax and digest the food, instead of rushing to finish the meal in time. By closing the meal at your own pace the energy level, that increased during the meal, gets the time to slowly reduce resulting in a calm and relaxed passenger.","reversal theory; design; energy; food tray","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

As requirements become more demanding, new techniques of flow control are investigated and developed. With effective flow control it is possible to reduce fuel consumption of air and ground vehicles as well as increase efficiency of wind energy devices such as wind turbines. This research focuses on the fundamental operation of the NS-DBD plasma actuator, an active flow control device. It has been documented to be able to reattach leading edge separated flow, however, the exact mechanism by which this is achieved is not clear. Experimental investigation took place on flat plate flow in order to characterise the effect of the actuator on the natural development of a laminar boundary layer. Hot wire and Schlieren measurements were carried out in order to observe the spatial and temporal behaviour of the boundary layer under the influence of the actuator. Hot wire provides temporal resolution while Schlieren is aimed in keeping track of shockwaves and thermal effects. The experiments confirmed that the main mechanism of nteraction of the actuator with the boundary layer relies on thermal effects. The actuation results in the expansion of a heated volume of gas that propagates downstream and which creates an interface between regions of different temperature along which an instability forms. If the energy introduced by the actuator is large enough, the disturbance has been seen to trigger turbulent spots. The appearing waveforms have been characterised in terms of velocity and wavelength.","ns-dbd; plasma actuator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics","","","",""

A port layout is developed based on a fictional cargo forecast. In the interest of port adaptivity, this layout is kept flexible as possible. The design is subsequently checked with regard to wave penetration and morphology. The wave modelling shows that it is possible to achieve a sufficiently calm wave climate inside the port, by making use of the interaction between waves and the port’s approach channel. Morphological analysis indicates that a large amount of maintenance dredging will be required to keep the channel at guaranteed depth; this negatively influences the feasibility of the port development. The port layout is based on guidelines and design rules. It features a container terminal, a multi-purpose terminal, three dry bulk terminals and a liquid bulk terminal. The bulk terminals are located downwind of the other terminals. Due to long cargo dwell times, large terminal areas are required. The layout can be expanded step-wise and most terminals can be converted or re-purposed. The breakwater layout is optimised; it extends into the sea beyond the closure depth, preventing immediate bypassing of sediment. The approach channel is designed as a one-way system with a guaranteed depth of -17 m MSL. This depth necessitates a very long dredged channel; the channel length is more than sixteen kilometres. The channel is designed completely according to PIANC guidelines. The main part of the channel is orientated in the dominant wave direction. Near the port entrance it bends and then enters the port at an angle of 55° with the dominant wave direction. The channel shows unexpected interactions with the long swell waves: the waves attune on the channel edge and are subsequently focused on the port entrance, enhancing wave penetration. This interaction is related to wave refraction. The refraction modes depend strongly on the critical wave angle; which is related to changes in water depth. The wave-channel interaction is thoroughly investigated. This investigation leads to measures which can reduce wave penetration.","approach channel; deep-sea port; adaptive port planning; swash wave modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

By building marinas on strategic locations along the coast, sailing times can be reduced significantly. However, building marinas bordering the North Sea is expensive due to the lack of sheltering from waves. Hook of Holland is such a strategic location, located at a distance of 30 kilometers of Stellendam and 20 kilometers away from Scheveningen. The realization of a marina at Hook of Holland will lead to season lengthening, differentiation of the beach function and creates a boost for the local economy. In addition, it will be a stepping stone for creation of a network of marinas along the Dutch coast which will enable day trips from marina to marina, boosting the economy further. Waves in the marina basin will lead to damage to the yachts if the significant wave height Hs is higher than Hs =0.6 m. The design storm for the marina has a return period of 200 years and will lead to waves with a significant wave height up to Hs = 4.3 m at the project area. Also it will lead to a water level rise up to 4.2 m above NAP. To reduce the waves in the basin, a large breakwater is needed which is expensive. An entrance of the marina along the Nieuwe Waterweg is cheaper but politically unachievable. A previous study for a marina with the entrance along the Nieuwe Waterweg did not make it to realization due to this factor. A marina is mostly financed with real estate development and funding of the government. Real estate development at the project area is difficult to realize due to the nearby Natura 2000 area ‘Solleveld & Kapittel duinen’ and its associated strict nature legislation . Land reclamation is a possibility to make real estate development possible. However at the moment this is not attractive due to the prices for land reclamation are higher than inland development of these functions. Also the real estate market is in a downward state due to the economic crisis. A marina at Hook of Holland needs to be on a small scale and well integrated in the surroundings without a large land reclamation project, such a marina will cost around 50 million euro. A marina at Hook of Holland is technically feasible and has a positive effect on the required coastal maintenance. However the direct revenues are much lower than the construction costs.

This question is in the form of integrated contracts, in which design, construction and/or maintenance are clustered. In projects contracted with the contract form Design (D), Built (B), Finance (F) and Maintain (M) the contractor is responsible for the design, construction and maintenance of the asset in question. This market approach results to freedom and responsibility for contractors. Firstly, a contractor has the freedom to make LCB considerations. Secondly, contractors become responsible for the delivery of performance during construction and maintenance. Currently, several Dutch DBFM infrastructure projects are in the pipeline. The government intends to spend the upcoming years more money on projects with the contract form DBFM. The construction has high failure costs with costs are 8-10% of the total contract value (SBR, 2013). A study by USP Marketing (2011) indicates that the failure costs consist in 21% by limited exchange of information. The information exchange is with 2% of the total contract value the biggest factor for failure costs. There is a freedom to make LCB considerations and responsibility for the provision of services for new contractors. This includes the exchange of information in order to make and give meaning to the agreed performance. How do contractors organize the exchange of information with freedom they get for LCB considerations and responsibility for delivering performance? The core issue in this research is that contractors make limited use of information for LCB considerations from various information carriers in practice which determine the life cycle costs. This information is available within the organization, but information on system characteristics and behavior are insufficient exchanged between the design team and the carriers during the design phase. The purpose of this study is to determine whether effective exchanges of information takes place when making design choices and to do recommendations for effective information exchange. The conclusion is that there is insufficient effective exchange of information (1) within Dutch DBFM infrastructure projects. Therefore there is enough untapped potential (2) for a more effective exchange of information. Contractors in Dutch DBFM infrastructure projects do not work according to Systems Engineering (SE) as ideally prescribed by literature. SE is an approach in which information is created by through processes. Following the SE standard leads to Structures in which information can be recorded, stored, shared and recalled Information is structured data that can be recorded on a computer. (Examples are) such as functions, risks, requirements and objects. To determine whether this information exchange is effective, there are conditions established where information must meet. In this study the conditions are based on the problems of LCC analyses. This study defines effective information exchange when information is relevant (1a), available (1b), punctual (2), explicit (3) and traceable (4). To test the conditions for effective exchange of information in practice, the conditions are processed into questions. These questions are part of interviews. Another part of the interviews are the DBFM contract requirements. Within a DBFM contract the requirements should be central to several teams of a contractor. For the interviews are relationships between Requirements and Functions (a), Requirements and Organizations (b), Requirements and Locations (c), Requirements and Stages (d), Requirements and Objects (e) and Requirements and Risks (f) tested. The results show the candidates find information relevant, but the information is not always available. In addition the information available is not on time, not explicitly or not traceable. The differences between theory and practice in information exchange have been identified for five of the six tested relationships. Only the relationships between the Requirements and Organizations (b) are in accordance with the criteria that more than 50% of the respondents are satisfied with all conditions. This relation satisfies the conditions for effective exchange of information, but is debatable. This is debatable, since this relation is the only satisfied relationships between requirements and other Structures. Therefore there is missing information for context and coherence. Contractors think that by allocating requirements on parts of the organization is sufficient for working with SE. Contractors experience SE in practice as a form of managing the requirements, imposed by public clients. In addition, in practice, the focus is located on the requirements of the design and the construction and not in the maintenance. This does not in accordance for LCB considerations. The main recommendation is to send in information exchange, whereby one central information management system (ON-1) is needed that addresses the processes of employees in the project. A second recommendation is a change of working and vision of contractors. SE is contractually obliged for contractors by a client. A contractor should see SE more as a chance. SE can be used as a tool for information exchange. A contractor should do SE as an opportunity. To take this opportunity the different recommendations need to be done for effective exchange of information: execute the processes (ON-2), interpret the ISO15288 together (ON-3) and capture the generated information in Structures (ON-4). Then information can become more timely, explicit and traceable. With these changes effective information exchange can take place and contractors can make LCB considerations according to the agreed performance. Upholding the freedom and responsibility can lead to a reduction in failure costs through more effective information exchange.","GWW; DBFM; consortium; LCB; faalkosten; effectieve informatie-uitwisseling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Construction Management and Engineering","",""

With Learning from demonstration (LfD) a robot can learn new tasks from human demonstrations, without requiring programming skills. This thesis investigates a novel representation of actions that can be learned by using only a 3d camera and an object tracker. The action representation is objectbased so it is independent of the morphology of the robot. The actions are represented using the average and standard deviation of multiple demonstrated trajectories with six degrees of freedom. The standard deviation serves as a weight factor for the required accuracy of the recognized or synthesized trajectory. Three novel methods proposed in this thesis aim to reduce variances in the demonstration that are not specific to the action. First the demonstrations are aligned in time using a novel action signature and a novel time warp algorithm. The time warp algorithm can approximate the alignment of multiple multidimensional signals in quadratic computing time. The third novel technique is a dynamically optimized choice of reference frame so variations in start and end position have little influence on the variance in trajectory. This method has been tested on a database of five actions repeatedly demonstrated by six subjects. The results show that it is possible to have a 90 percent action recognition rate with only three demonstrations in the database. It is also shown that a robot can use this action representation to synthesize four out of five actions with varying object positions.","learning from demonstrations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-02-12","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

Even though it offers many benefits, the high initial device costs are still a major hindrance for many consumers. Packaging can account for up to half of the total device price, offering high potential for cost reduction. In this thesis, novel silicon wafer level packaging (WLP) concept and development platform are presented. The proposed packaging platform consists of silicon chips connected with neutral bending plane based flexible interconnect. Each chip contains an etched reflector cavity with wire bonded LED. The polyimide encapsulated flexible interconnects offer the benefit of folding the package into a 3D geometric shape. The space around the reflector cavity could be used to integrate active components and the backside { for passive components of the SSL driver circuit. The design, fabrication and characterization of the package is presented. A novel method to interconnect the front and backside of the chips is also incorporated into the process flow. After fabrication, packages are completed by adding LEDs, applying phosphor color conversion and release from substrate, followed by characterization of electrical, mechanical, thermal and optical performance. The developed packaging platform offers potential for future functional expansion by means of heterogeneous integration, possibly leading to a smart WLP package for SSL.","wafer level packaging; WLP; solid state lighting; SSL; LED; integration; more than moore; flexible; polyimide; LED package; heterogeneous integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-12-09","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","ECTM Electronic Components, Technology and Materials","",""

The phenomenon of spectral broadening is observed when a single frequency sound wave passes through a free shear layer. Inside the turbulent shear layer the wave interacts with the turbulence, which leads to broadening of the tone in the frequency domain. The spectrum of a single frequency tone measured with a microphone will not only include the peak but also two shoulders containing the broadened frequencies, one on each side of the peak. Spectral broadening does not only a_ect single microphone measurements but also has a detrimental e_ect on acoustic array measurements. The distortion caused by the shear layer will reduce the coherence between the microphones in the array. This limits the size and thus resolution of the array. This spectral broadening is particularly problematic when examining objects which produce a tonal noise, e.g. open rotors, sharp edges.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

(mentor); Menenti, M. (mentor); Van De Ven, F. (mentor)","2013","Effective urban water management requires certainty about surface conditions such as the surface infiltration capacity (SIC). A SIC map of an urban catchment area could be a useful input for evidence-based urban design of water-sensitive/low-impact neighbourhoods and multitiered water management schemes for reducing flood vulnerability. Methods for mapping SIC are underdeveloped. Typically, infiltration rates are derived from topographic or urban extent maps. Instead, if a land cover map can precisely identify hydrologically relevant land cover classes, then a more accurate SIC map can be derived. The research explored whether an accurate SIC map could be derived from VHR multi-spectral imagery of Amersfoort, Netherlands, using specific hydrologically relevant land cover classes and segment-based land cover classifiers to achieve meaningful object resolution. The impact of different similarity metrics, rule sets, and data types on classification accuracy were explored. In particular, the impact of lower class specificity (generic classes) was tested. The SIC map was assessed based on impact in a pluvial flood model. Results indicate a high degree of spectral and textural confusion between impermeable and semi-permeable surface types in land cover classification. The analysis of the SIC and land cover maps illustrates that with generic classes the SIC is under-predicted for the catchment area despite a higher overall accuracy in land cover classification. Generic classes also reduce object resolution (detail). Using specific classes produces a less accurate land cover map but improves SIC prediction. In a pluvial flood model, the generic classes increased runoff volume and reduced peak runoff time, validating the conclusion that class specificity and object resolution plays an important role in mapping SIC.","remote sensing; image segmentation; land cover classification; VHR imagery; urban water management; texture features; permeability map","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Blom, C.B.M. (mentor); Vergoossen, R.P.H. (mentor); Rots, J.G. (mentor)","2013","An unpublished study by Prof. A.W. Beeby shows the differences in strength capacity between a reinforced concrete beam without shear reinforcement and the same beam with a cut-out section at the middle of the span. The cut-out section exists at the bottom part of the beam while the reinforcement still remains. It remarkably turns out that the strength capacity of the beam with the cut-out section is 1.6 times larger compared to the reference beam. The reference beam fails by a flexural shear crack which does not arise in the beam with the cut-out section. On the occasion of Beeby’s experiments and the lack of a simple physical model for a flexural shear crack this thesis has the objective to clarify the difference between a beam and a truss mechanism and the failure due to flexural shear cracks. The study is based on a simple supported beam without shear reinforcement subjected to a oncentrated load with a three point bending test with a slendernessratio of 2.45 and a reinforcement ratio of 0.89%. An analytical study describes the difference between the beam and a simplified truss mechanism. Linear analyses show the differences in stress distributions and deflections. The study shows the same difference in strength capacity as the experiments of Beeby. In addition quite a difference is revealed in the displacements of both mechanism. The truss mechanism shows a larger deformation compared to the beam mechanism. Finite element modelling with DIANA has been used to gain better insight in the difference of the strength capacity. The models use a total strain fixed crack model. The Hordijk-curve describes the tensile properties and an ideal relation describes the compressive properties. The decrease of the poisson ratio and the shear resistance around a crack have been taken into account by a damaged based shear retention model and a damaged based crack model. The finite element models show differences of the strength capacity within the same level of Beeby’s experiments. The force mechanism in both systems is different before the flexural shear crack arises in the beam. After a flexural shear crack occurs both mechanism seems to change into a similar truss mechanism, but detailed analyses show important deviations from this expectation. Variation of the cut-out dimensions shows that a too small gap results in a flexural shear crack and a too large gap in the failing of the cantilever part. Gaps between these limits all change into a truss mechanism which reaches the same level of failure load as the basic truss. The decrease of stiffness of the beam results in more compressive stresses in the truss mechanism preventing the occurrence of the shear crack. If the shear crack does not occur in the beam it results in a higher strength capacity. A dedicated shaped beam which has initially exactly the shape of a shear cracked beam without the concrete part below the crack, has a different strength capacity compared to a regular shear cracked beam. The dedicated shaped beam proves that the crack shape itself has no influence on the ability of converting into a truss. It turns out that in the regular beam it is impossible to develop a perfect truss mechanism after a flexural shear crack due to the concrete that is still present beneath the crack. The concrete beneath the crack causes a different stress distribution in the top of the beam compared to the dedicated shaped beam without this concrete. A hypothesis is given for the failure of the shear crack. The acquired knowledge of the influence of the concrete beneath the crack and the stiffness of the beam allows other design possibilities. It is possible to design a concrete truss, if among other, the yielding of steel, crushing of the concrete and the deformation capacity of the truss are taken into account. Further research is for instance possible for unbonded reinforcement and beams with a descending height.","shear; shear capacity; Beeby; concrete; DIANA; cut-out section; flexural shear crack; shear crack; finite element model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

Environmental awareness in The Netherlands is growing and society and politicians gradually change their stance on the necessity of oil and gas. This study is aimed at understanding the dynamics behind the interaction between actors in societal debates in order to understand changing support. The Dutch societal debate on shale gas was used to study these dynamics. It was investigated how unintended and intended events can explain changes in discourses (ways to view the world) over time. The software package T-lab was used to identify discourses and discourse developments in Dutch newspapers. T-lab uses linguistic and statistical tools to find meaningful patterns in text. Besides that, eleven semi-structured interviews were conducted to validate and supplement the results. Three major discourses were found: ‘Safety and Environment’, ‘Utility and Necessity’ and ‘Procedural Justice’ (Table 1). The content of these discourses changes as a result of external impact, which is amplified by feedback from actor’s responses and from changing discourses. The influence of events on a societal debate can be summarised in five important effects; ‘Amplify’, ‘Abate’, ‘Polarise’, ‘Broaden’ and ‘Trigger’. The case of the shale gas debate has shown that the course of events can lead the debate to reach polarised levels. At these levels, actors tend to reflect less on ‘their discourse’ and more extreme positions are taken. In other words, it impedes stakeholder learning. Therefore, it is important to prevent a debate to reach high polarised levels. The Dutch societal debate on shale gas provides several learning moments on how to prevent this.","societal debates; public support; stakeholder engagement; shale gas; discourse analysis; media analysis; ebn","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-12-09","Technology, Policy and Management","Ethics/Philosophy of Technology","","Management of Technology","",""

This environment will implement a DC electricity infrastructure with the main voltage level inside the buildings, being 380V. This innovative power system requires the development of new power electronics that can be used to such a grid and contribute to its high performance and reliability. The first test container is meant for testing this electricity system and the relative equipment. This project proposes a buck conversion method with inrush current limiting circuit designed for connecting the test container’s energy consumers to the 380V DC main bus, in order to achieve optimum operation, in terms of near peak efficiency and safety. Within the framework of this study, the “Femtogrid” system, which is the electricity system used by the test container, is explained and simulated. Additionally, the operation of the buck (step-down) converter and the boost (step-up) converter, that are the main elements of “Femtogrid” system, are studied and their control methods are analyzed. Moreover, some common electronic devices are tested with DC and AC input voltage, revealing important information regarding their behavior in normal and standby mode. An even better performance of some devices when running on DC is observed. The experiments showed high inrush currents due to the charging of the input capacitors during turn-on. Therefore, an inrush current limiter (ICL) is necessary in order to protect the system components from damage. The buck converter topology proposed in this project is the LLC resonant buck converter topology, which holds features like very high efficiency, isolation and small number of components. The ICL consists of a MOSFET in combination with some passive elements that can drive the MOSFET in such a way that the inrush current of the circuit can be limited by controlling the gate charge characteristic of the MOSFET. A prototype was simulated, built and tested. The simulations showed that the ICL should be able to limit the inrush current at a very low level.","converter; inrush current; power electronics; sustainability; direct current","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Radiation Science & Technology","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor)","2013","To allow structural designs with lower mass, it is necessary to have access to accurate failure prediction theories for composite plates with holes subjected to arbitrary loading conditions. For design purposes, however, the most accurate failure theories require a considerable amount of computational resources which is often not available. Additionally, current theories allowing less computational resources are unfortunately only valid for a specific load, material, hole or specimen size and their reliability is still questioned. The purpose of this work is to examine the existing methods to estimate stress and failure in composite plates with holes and subsequently join or modify them to provide an analytic tool for a quick and fairly accurate estimation of the static failure load. The plate is represented as a two-dimensional structure containing arbitrary loaded/unloaded holes and edge force boundary conditions. From a literature study, it is decided that an analytical model based on the method by Xiong and Poon [2] is used for the determination of the stress field. A new general failure criterion on the basis of Kweon [3] is constructed to determine failure. The stress and failure theories are implemented in a software package, verified by hand calculation and validated with finite element analysis and experimental data. The performance of the new failure theory was also compared to the performance of the in-house Point Stress Criterion at the company where the work was performed. The stress field methodology is able to accurately determine the stress field in two-dimensional plates with holes. The performance of the new failure criterion is better with respect to the in-house criterion and has a maximum discrepancy of +20% which is acceptable for design purposes. Unfortunatley, due to issues with the assumption of the stress boundary conditions for loaded holes, the method is restricted to laminates with a directionality lower than 1.13. Once these issues are resolved, the method will be generally applicable.","composite; stress; analytic; strength; static; lekhnitskii","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","Design and Production of Composite Structures","",""

(mentor); Rozendaal, M.C. (mentor); Van de Garde, B. (mentor)","2013","Gamification in the work environment has been extensively researched and implemented successfully by integrating game elements (such as competition, challenge or exploration) in a work environment. The Persuasive Game Design (PGD) model explains the effect of gamification by differentiating the Real World (RW) from a Game World (GW). A game designer can gamify a user’s actions which causes the user to feel fun and immersion in the GW. Once the user is in the GW, he can be persuaded to change his behavior. The behavior in the workplace context exits of engagement, enjoyment and efficient (better teamwork). The objective of this research is to find out what effect gamification has on people’s perception of gamified activities ranked on the RW- GW continuum. The effect of gamification becomes visible when comparing the ranking of the gamified activities on the RW-GW continuum to the same activities before they were gamified. This quantifies the effect of gamification, and shows what type of activities have a greater effect than others depending on their ranked position before gamification. Furthermore, the research intends to discover a common understanding of the RW and GW and create possible player profiles depending on the individual differences of these understandings. The work environment to measure the effect of gamification is the greenhouse agriculture. The different types of work are analyzed and structured into activities. The greenhouse employees were asked to place those work activities, along with daily life activities, in a rectangular space that represented the RW-GW continuum. After this, the employees were interviewed to find out their reasoning for their ranking of the activities on the RW-GW continuum. The descriptions of RW and GW that were connected to explicit activities were detached from those explicit activities. The descriptions were reformulated into a survey to test the RW-GW description’s value as common understanding of the RW-GW continuum. A group that was not related to greenhouse work was used in the survey. Next, the greenhouse work environment was gamified for one week by targeting six different work activities by five different gamifications. After playing the gamifications, the employees were asked again to place the work related activities on the RW-GW continuum. After the gamifications had ended, the employees were interviewed again and they were shown their perceptions of activities on a RW-GW scale before and after participating in the gamifications. There is a trend of the movement of the perception of gamified work activities towards the GW. The work activities that were initially perceived as more RW showed a larger movement towards the GW than activities perceived more towards GW. Based on the interviews with greenhouse employees a list of RW-GW description and description categories was created. Some of those descriptions were validated as common understandings of RW and GW, such as obligation for the RW and engagement and escapism for the GW. The rest of the descriptions were different for separate groups of participants, which can be described as player profiles. The high amount of effect of the RW starting positioned activities were based on gamifications that had a slower adoption period by the employees, and involved gameplay that focused on creativity and player initiative. The gamifications that were adopted quickly had a smaller effect on the RW-GW scale, and existed of facilitated and less social gamifications.","Gamification; Persuasive Game Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

(mentor)","2013","Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radars achieve improved performance by the simultaneous transmission and reception of waveforms from different locations. Orthogonality of the transmitted waveforms is a requirement for allowing waveform separation at the receiver. In addition, signals with a large BT- product (e.g. coded signals) could be transmitted to achieve high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) due to pulse compression. This helps to radiate a larger amount of average power as a result of which range resolution (larger bandwidth) and detection capability improves. These techniques are indeed combined in Space – Time coded active antenna systems, where multiple codes are simultaneously transmitted through the different elements or sub-arrays of an active antenna. My thesis, ""Waveform generation for a MIMO Radar"" involves the design and implementation of the Arbitrary Waveform Generation (AWG) Block for a multi-channel transmitter of such a MIMO radar test bed. The 8-channel AWG block is developed on an FPGA platform. Besides the AWG, there are the RF and antenna blocks in the multi-channel transmitter. The synchronization of the multiple transmitters is the essential pre-requisite to develop the system. Similarly the individual channels of the system need to be characterized by measuring the errors within the system. The test-bed will be used as a platform for generating and testing different waveforms (binary codes, multi-phase codes, complementary waveforms, etc.) that can provide the radar with required resolutions in range, space, velocity.

(mentor)","2013","The bulk of catchment science literature consist of ‘unique’ case studies describing the complex interaction of soils, water, vegetation, topography and geology at individual sites. Yet, the uniqueness of individual sites makes it difficult to transfer findings to new locations and facilitate understanding and prediction in other catchments. In this thesis we use a comparative approach by searching for general behaviour among several hundred catchments located across the contiguous United States to develop transferable theories and facilitate understanding and prediction at other sites. The thesis consist of an introduction to elucidate the use of the comparative approach. Subsequently we present three chapters that use this comparative approach to test multiple hypotheses. (I) We search for appropriate model structures to facilitate improved precipitation-streamflow simulations at the catchment scale. Results indicate that several catchment properties can support the choice for appropriate model structures but choices are associated with large uncertainty. (II) We develop an analytical framework to organise the seasonal partitioning of water for a wide range of settings and show how this framework can facilitate in synthesising understanding of catchment functioning for a wide range of time-scales. (III) We expose how snowfall influences the partitioning of water at the annual time-scale. Results indicate that the projected precipitation shift from snowfall to rain, due to global rising temperatures, may significantly decrease the annual streamflow of catchments that currently receive a large fraction of their precipitation as snowfall. Finally, we conclude that although findings of the individual chapters are valuable, physical understanding is lacking. Additionally there is no common framework to organise the findings within the context of other studies. Both aspects hamper practical and scientific progress to effectively handle many water-related challenges.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-12-31","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

(mentor); Van Den Toorn, A. (mentor); Broere, W. (mentor); Ter Haar, G.J. (mentor)","2013","Introduction While the world moves towards modern renewable energy sources, these sources are not always available which makes them unreliable. At the same time, problems of balancing the daily peak-demand is still performed with expensive fossil fueled units. Sitting perfectly in between supply and demand is a solution with the potential of solving both problems: energy storage. Analysis The available large-scale energy storage technologies are analyzed and specifically their suitability for the Netherlands. The choice has fallen on Pumped Hydropower Storage (PHS); a proven technology. The exclusivity of hydropower for elevated countries is challenged with alternatives for PHS in the Netherlands. These alternatives are grouped according to their favor for either surface size with Storage Islands, or towards the depth with Underground PHS’s. Due to the uncertainty and low suitability for Underground PHS, the Storage Islands are preferred. Among the alternatives is a silt depot in the Maasvlakte which is losing its purpose, named the Slufter, which outperforms others in a cost-benefit analysis due to the low primary investment and highly suitability for this application. Transforming the Slufter from a silt depot to an energy storage system is worked out technically. The analysis of the Slufter consists of modeling major failure mechanisms using two finite-element method packages, solving the main technical and constructional issues, checking feasibility with a construction method and planning, mapping the risks and providing a strategy for integration within the power grid. Results Energy storage is realized by making a high reservoir of the Slufter at a level of +39m NAP that is enclosed by a 17 m upgrade to the current dams at +23m NAP in which the contaminated silt of 78 million m3 can be maintained. It was found that fast lowering the reservoir level (10 meters in 6 hours) is normative for dam stability and that a core helps in providing this stability. The profitable system generates power during the day and stores it in the night with the interaction between the high reservoir and the lower North Sea. The performance is similar to a medium plant with a peak power of 470 MW and storage capacity of 2.16 GWh; generation lasts 6 hours at maximum capacity. The system satisfies the peak-balancing needs of Zuid-Holland, Zeeland and largely Noord-Holland, while providing enough wind power balancing for Zuid-Holland till 2025. Using the imbalance between daily and nightly power prices, the system annually benefits 20 million from power trade and saves 8 million fuel costs. It confirms its potential with a competitive unit price of 54 /MWh and a pay-back period of 30 years. The Slufter as a storage system fits the Port of Rotterdam’s ambition, offers a clean alternative to the current gas-fueled peak-generation-units and potential for the future power market in which variable renewable energy sources play a large role.","pumped hydropower storage; PHS; hydropower; hydro-electricity storage; Netherlands; Slufter; Maasvlakte; energy storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

A Packaging Design Guide for the BRICS Countries","Van Wulfften Palthe, F.Q.H.","Mugge, R. (mentor); Hultink, E.J. (mentor)","2013","This thesis is about the influence of culture in packaging design in Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa (BRICS) and the United Kingdom. Previous research showed that culture influences communication styles. In addition, research by van den Berg-Weitzel (1999) showed that the communicative value of packaging design is likewise influenced by culture, but that this differs per product category. For this research, packages of the top ten brands of five different product categories (vodka, beer, water, tea, cigarettes) from the six different countries (BRICS + UK) have been collected. These have been analyzed by fifteen experts on eighteen different design elements, such as color scheme, logo size or graphical layout. The results in research show that packaging designs from the six different countries differ significantly from each other. The character and strength of these differences however depends on the product category. In addition, it seems that the differences between packaging designs can be less easy explained by culture than fourteen years ago, which might be due to globalization. Especially the presentations of Vodka and Cigarettes seem quite uniform. For cigarettes, this is according to expectations, because van den Berg-Weitzel (1999) researched this category as well and found similar results. In addition, the results found for bottled water in this research are quite comparable to those of van den Berg-Weitzel. At last, the largest differences in packaging designs have been found for beer and tea. After critically reflecting these results, Design Guides have been created, that explain on which design elements emphasis should be put when designing the respective packagings for BRICS-countries and the UK. Based on these Design Guides, three designers were briefed to design these five differently targeted (at Brazil, Russia, India, China, SA) beers called ‘Brics’, while the target-country was unknown for them. Hence, the only input the designers had was the briefing based on the Design Guide for beer. Each designer made five different Brics-designs and since one designer proposed two different directions in answering the briefing, this resulted in a total of twenty different beer designs with the brand name ‘Brics’. In order to verify whether working with the Design Guide is an effective way to target the BRICS markets, the designs have been independently tested in two ways:  The designers were asked about their experience with working with the Design Guide.  Project managers were asked to match the different Brics-beers to their target-country. The results of these tests showed that the designers had a positive experience with working with the Design Guide and that these guidelines can indeed be used to target a brand to a local market. Recommendations for improvement are that the guidelines could have been more specific and that some experience with evaluating or designing beer presentations is required.","Packaging Design; Culture; BRICS; Hofstede","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor); Vuik, C. (mentor)","2013","Extreme and isolated eigenvalues are known to be harmful to the convergence of the iterative solver. These eigenvalues are produced by strong heterogeneity in the underlying physics. We can improve the quality of the spectrum by ‘deflating’ the harmful eigenvalues. In this thesis, deflation is applied to linear systems in reservoir simulation. We show that large, sudden differences in the permeability produce extreme eigenvalues. For small cases, the number and magnitude of these eigenvalues is linked to the number and magnitude of the permeability jumps. Two deflation methods are investigated. Firstly, we show that harmonic Ritz eigenvector deflation, which computes the deflation vectors from the information produced by the linear solver, can improve convergence. The computational cost of this method, however, is relatively high and the method cannot be implemented in parallel. Secondly, we test a physics-based deflation algorithm that constructs the deflation vectors a priori. The method is shown to improve the performance of the linear solver. We compare manually constructed deflation vectors to a partitioner algorithm, which automatically identifies large permeability jumps and constructs the deflation vectors using the subdomain-levelset method. Automatic (parallel) physics-based deflation works well for small cases, but we also show that the partitioner algorithm is not robust in large, realistic cases. We make several suggestions for improvement, such as assigning deflation vectors only to regions where flow occurs. For cases with well-defined permeability jumps of a factor 10^4 or higher, we believe that physics-based deflation has a large potential.","deflation; linear solver; preconditioning; GMRES; CPR; Harmonic Ritz; subdomain levelset; porous media flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Numerical Analysis","","","",""

Het eiland ALPHA zal dienen als een “stopcontact” voor de windparken voor de Belgische kust. Het doel is om de ontwerpcomponenten die van het belang zijn bij het ontwerp van een kunstmatig eiland vast te stellen en één of meerdere van deze componenten uit te werken. De eerste fase beslaat een studie naar het ruimtelijk ontwerp van een kunstmatig eiland op zee. Gestart wordt met een voorstudie, waarin literatuur over kunstmatige eilanden geanalyseerd wordt en referentie projecten gebruikt worden om een beeld te vormen welke aspecten van belang zijn voor een ontwerp voor zoiets. Omdat in deze fase het volledige programma van eisen van de opdrachtgever ontbreekt, wordt er een systeemanalyse uitgevoerd waarin dat programma samengesteld wordt. Vanuit deze voorwaarden/aannames volgt een ruimtelijk ontwerp voor het eiland. Dit ontwerp heeft een haventoegang aan de oostzijde van het eiland met binnenin een haven waar onderhoudsschepen beschut kunnen liggen. Er is voldoende ruimte voor het OHVS van 60m x 30m, de helikopterlandingsplaats en eventuele uitbreidingsfaciliteiten. In de tweede fase is er wel een uitgebreid programma van eisen van de opdrachtgever beschikbaar. Het ontwerp zoals dat geschetst is in fase 1 staat op zichzelf. De golfbreker die ontworpen zal worden zal aansluiten bij de visie van de opdrachtgever, die uiteindelijk vooral in schaal afweek van het ontwerp in fase 1. Het maatgevende schip had niet een lengte van 21m, maar een lengte van 150m en de beschikbaarheidseis van de haven was zo dat een dergelijke beschutting van de haven, zoals in het eerste ontwerp, niet noodzakelijk was. Voor het eiland met deze strengere eisen wordt een golfbreker ontworpen die een insteekhaven zou kunnen verdedigen in het geval van de 1/250jaar storm.","kunstmatig eiland; België; Vlaamse banken","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-12-02","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The dam is 32 kilometers long and 90 m wide, with an initial height of 7.25 m above sea-level and a slope of 1:4 (original slope, now 1:3.6) on each side (Rijkswaterstaat, 2009). After 80 years of successful performance, expected changes in boundary conditions and an increase of safety requirements make necessary to think of an adaptation of the structure, so it can perform its function in the future. Rijkswaterstaat has decided to adopt an overtopping resistant solution which provides the required protection until the year 2050. This project is aiming to define and propose a new non-typical Dutch dike configuration which needs to comply with Employer’s Requirements. As a starting point, an existing cross section from the Afsluitdijk is used. Mean Waddenzee bottom elevation at the Afsluitdijk is between -4.0m to -5.0m, NAP referred. For every possible new configuration, -5.0m is adopted trying to perform a representative design. In the intermediate design, several non-typical Dutch solutions have been defined trying to cover a wide range of options. Twelve feasible alternatives have been evaluated during the Intermediate Design. Then, a comparison among them is done by means of a multi-criteria analysis, together with cost estimations. As a result, the two more favourable alternatives, design 4 and design 10, were selected. In the final stage, further studies were done for both selected alternatives, which were contrasted with Rijkswaterstaat adopted solution (OverTopping resistant solution). Design 10 is the most advantageous of the proposed solutions. However, current politics dominant way of thinking is directly influencing Rijkswaterstaat standards and procedures. Consequently, possible solutions should be the less expensive ones. As a major conclusion, this report is proposing Rijkswaterstaat to think over the whole life cycle of the structures. This could lead to introduce more flexibility and adaptability into the designs (robust designs including future planned adaptation). Finally, is up to the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment to decide whether providing advantages to future generations is worth a larger investment.","Afsluitdijk; revetment","en","student report","TU Delft, Department of Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""
