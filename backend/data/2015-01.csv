(mentor)","2015","Finding one's way in complex indoor settings can be a quite stressful and time-consuming task, especially for users unfamiliar with the environment. There have been several different approaches to provide wayfinding assistance in order to guide a person from a starting point to a destination, ranging from traditional maps and signposting systems to the most recent developments of navigation systems displaying direction information on a mobile device screen. However, so far none of them has emerged to be efficient enough in order to act as a uniform solution for the wayfinding problem in indoor environments. Moreover, referencing to landmarks is not widely employed by wayfinding assistance systems despite the fact that landmark-based navigation is the most common way for people to navigate themselves through unfamiliar environments. The aim of this work is to propose a new wayfinding assistance method for indoor environments that makes use of the landmark concept. The method to achieve it is by translating the main principles of an already existing outdoor system named Junction Network System, which applies successfully for providing guidance to cyclists in The Netherlands. The most important parameter of the system is that assistance is provided to users where they actually need to make a directional choice. The first step is to automatically define the locations, i.e. the decision points, where wayfinding assistance is needed in indoor settings and the second is to supply them with a special type of landmark which will have the form of a signpost that provides all the necessary information. A graph based representation of the indoor setting is generated in order to extract the decision points and create the network of all possible routes in the environment. The conceptual framework for the determination of the decision points is implemented in two case studies: GeoFort main building and the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment (BK) of TU Delft. Two different building cases are used in order to gain an insight on how the system can be applied in different indoor environments. The part of the navigable indoor space where movement mainly occurs when people are in search of a destination was subdivided according to a geometric criterion (Constrained Delaunay Triangulation) while also the semantics of the space were taken into account in order to determine the decision points. By connecting all the decision points and the destinations a network of all the possible routes is created. A route is followed by referring to the sequence of numbers corresponding to the nodes of the network. The proposed system was verified based on a human-based survey. The proposed landmark-signs were installed at part of the faculty of Architecture and users were asked to find their way in the building relying only on them. The time to reach the destination and the number of detours were counted, while a questionnaire-based survey was used in order to further investigate the feelings and views of participants regarding the effectiveness of the system. The findings of the experiment are quite promising, as the performance of the participants in both measures was very good. Additionally, the results of the questionnaire indicate that users consider the system simple and comprehensive and they are in general satisfied by the provided assistance. However, further implementation and testing in more indoor space cases is needed in order to draw an indisputable conclusion about its effectiveness. Nevertheless, an important contribution of the research is the generation of a conceptual model in order to automatically determine the decision points in indoor environments that this can be applied invariable to other wayfinding assistance systems.","indoor wayfinding; indoor navigation; landmark; decision point; Constrained Delaunay Triangulation; network; route graph","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor)","2015","Recent Spanish legislation has enacted a complete reform of the energy sector in efforts to balance system costs with revenues and reign in the accumulating tariff deficit. Under the new legislation, wind energy and other renewables must compete against traditional thermal and hydro plants, yet are not allowed in the ancillary services market for grid stability. As Wind was the number one source of energy for Spain in 2013, and as any practical future which is dependent on renewables will necessitate them to provide ancillary services, there has been a growing interest to determine the consequences of allowing wind generation into the Secondary Reserves Market (SRM). This research is conducted from a single agent perspective with the intention of answering if the investment costs necessary to participate in the Secondary Reserves Market will be outweighed by the revenue a wind producer is likely to receive. Additionally, if true, this thesis aims to parameterize under what conditions it will be beneficial for a wind producer to participate in the SRM and investigates possible strategies a wind agent could pursue. As provision of Secondary Reserves would likely require a wind agent to change from a marketclearing schedule to that which would allow for the maximum amount of band offer, this change must be managed by participation in the Intraday Market and may constitute an additional cost. Thus the final calculation of revenue considers Primary Effects or the direct revenues from participation in the SRM, and Secondary Effects or the costs/benefit from bartering power in the Intraday Market. Revenue calculation, denoted as the Estimated Capturable Income (ECI), is subject to some uncertainty. Thus to give different perspectives on possible revenues, three methods of ECI calculation have been developed: a conservative estimate, a probable estimate, and an optimistic estimate. The investment costs assumed in this research are taken from previously conducted technical studies which proved that wind farms acting in clusters can provide Secondary Regulation within reliability criteria. These costs were socialized across a test-bed of 488 MW of installed wind capacity and constitute a unitary investment cost of 3,053 per MW. Therefore the principle conclusions from the analyses performed throughout this thesis is that a wind producer could expect to earn between  762 to  1,238 per MW of Installed Wind Capacity through participation in the Secondary Reserves Market. When applying this to an existing case, the Huéneja cluster of 254 MW of wind capacity, wind operators/owners could expect to gain between  193,753 to  314,712 annually and could recoup investments within three years. The thesis results indicate that maximum benefit can be derived by participating in the SRM in those hours which experience a Capacity Factor of 41% or greater. Further investment analysis based upon ten years of simulated inflows imply that the necessary investment for such a cluster would experience an IRR between 35%-56% and constitute an NPV between  1.1 –  2 Million for an initial investment of  523,174. In an industry with economic scopes of 20 years or more with the expected regulated rate of return for wind installations at 7.5% according to The 2013 Energy Reform Details, the results indicate that participation in the Secondary Reserves Market for wind producers would be both attractive and economically feasible.","Wind; Ancillary Services; Secondary Reserves; Economic Feasibility Analysis; Investment Analysis; Wind Energy; Single Agent","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Partnership with Universidad Pontificia Comillas - EMIN","","Engineering and Policy Analysis (EPA) - EMIN","",""

(mentor); Colombo, F.F. (mentor)","2015","The dynamics of the contemporary world has ruined the dream of permanence which dominated the field of planning for decades. The increasing amount and frequency of unpredicted urban transformations that take place in today’s cities have led to a state of urban development where planning and reality seems to be poles apart (Urban Catalyst, 2013). This reflects on the (re)development of modern cities and highlights the fragility, temporariness, vulnerability and inclination to constant change of the urban spatial forms. Within this context the traditional planning approaches of the past does not seem to be adaptable and flexible enough to bridge the gaps between the large-scale, long-term urban strategies and local, urgent needs (Urhahn, 2010; Bishop & Williams, 2012; Pfeifer, 2013). In order to deal with this issue the philosophical belief that “the only certainty is that everything changes” is adopted as a starting point of this design project. It focuses on formulating new, innovative, highly flexible modes of urban transformations, which can be an appropriate urban regeneration approach in 21st century. In particular, the developed method relies on morphogenesis approach, spontaneous urban growth and temporary land-uses that are operationalized within the context of Turin (Italy). Through the executed design experiment this project explores the practical application of the aforementioned concepts and provides a critical reflection on the current models of spatial (re)production.","morphology; urban regeneration; Spontaneous Urban Growth; temporary urbanism; Turin","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Urbanism","",""

(mentor); Bakker, C. (mentor)","2015","Now the detrimental consequences of human consumption become apparent, companies search for ways to extend the product life cycle. Refurbishment is an accessible and cost-effective strategy to regain value from used products and contributes to a more circular consumption model. Driven by a growing commercial interest in refurbishment, this research provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing consumer acceptance of refurbished products, and in specific mobile phones. A qualitative approach using in-depth interviews with actual consumers is adopted to gain rich insight into the motivations that influence the consumer response to refurbished products. The research demonstrates that consumers express a primarily positive initial reaction to refurbished products as a purchase alternative. However, as a consequence of a multiplicity of different obstacles experienced throughout the decision making process, it is often rejected. In the orientation phase, external barriers prevent the refurbished product to enter the consumer consideration set. In the evaluation phase, consumers perceive a negative balance between risks and benefits. Furthermore, this research discovers the importance of product related factors in relation to consumer acceptance of refurbished products. Finally, the gap between current academic literature and commercial application of refurbishment is addressed by providing a framework of guidelines for increasing consumer acceptance of refurbished products. Three categories of measures are presented: product optimisation, barrier reduction and shifting the risk-benefit balance. Increasing consumer acceptance demands an integral approach, in which different stakeholders work together on the development of high value refurbished products, scaling up and recognition of refurbished products as a worthy alternative to new products. This application to practice is illustrated by translating the research conclusions into a strategy for increasing acceptance of the refurbished product assortment of the company Leapp. This project provides valuable insights that serve as a starting point for further exploration of consumers’ perception of refurbished products. In this way, this study gives an impetus to work towards a more widely spread consumer acceptance and use of refurbished products, and ultimately a more circular economy.","Refurbishment; Consumer acceptance; Consumer behaviour; Consumer; Mobile phones; Circular economy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

Flooding of Shanghai can be caused due to the following three factors: storm surge by typhoon, high tidal levels and sustained higher water levels in the Yangtze River and the Huangpu River as a result of the higher tide in the mouth of the river during the rainy season. Typhoons moving towards Shanghai not only bring high storm surges but also heavy rainfalls and strong winds to the area. In response to the potential floods caused by typhoons to Shanghai city, China, several proposals emerged to protect the region in the first design level. By using Multi Criteria Analysis, one of them is selected as the protection system. A challenge for this 15 km long barrier system is to cross Yangtze Estuary, including two islands and three channels at the Yangtze River mouth.

The studio believes that buildings for healthcare are amongst the most urgent design tasks for an architect. For patients, the interior of a care institution becomes a replacement of the whole outside world. Therefore, the focus of the studio is to give priority to the experience and quality of space, above the technical, organizational and financial issues The program of my choice is a cancer counselling centre for children combined with a Ronald McDonald house. The cancer counselling centre is a place where children can forget that they are sick but also can get support when they need it. It is (besides their home and the hospital) a third place in their daily lives. For the parents it is ideal to combine the counselling centre with a Ronald McDonald house. When their own home is too far from the hospital the Ronald McDonald house offers the solution. De Baan is located in the city centre and I’ve chosen this site because of the urban context and its easy accessibility. Besides that, the Erasmus Medical Centre is very close and the area contains several schools. Partly due to the location I choose to design the cancer counselling centre specially for children. The program of the building and the location fit well together although it also raises questions. Most of these questions are about the privacy of the patients and how the urban context can contribute to the wellbeing of the patients. The design is a well-functioning care centre that meets the desires of the different user groups. It provides the neighbourhood with commercial spaces and sport facilities, the patients of the Erasmus Medical Centre with a place for children with cancer to get support and it provides a home for their family members.","care centre","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Interior","","","",""

(mentor); Smits, J.E.P. (mentor); Bilow, M. (mentor)","2015","This thesis examines the additive manufacturing (AM) of concrete, its possibilities, feasibility and advantages over existing techniques. The first part generally focuses on the characteristic properties of concrete that are important and how they relate to an AM method, for instance aggregates and reinforcement. After this extensive introduction in the field of concrete and AM, the current situation regarding additive manufacturing of concrete is described. On the basis of literature resulting products are shown and discussed. Their characteristics are compared to detect a match or mismatch between the AM technique and the produced elements. The outcome of this evaluation is used to describe improvements which are elaborated in the second part. This design part consists of a roadmap that shows a future vision. Concrete is a new material in the field of additive manufacturing. Since it is one of the materials that hardens by a chemical reaction, considerable attention needs to be paid to the workability of it in an AM process. Traditional processing techniques are adapted to these characteristics but concrete does not let itself dictate how to behave. The roadmap envisions how the technique has to evolve in order to implement the characteristic properties of concrete. The possibilities for products made with an additive process are endless, but just replacing existing production methods with additive ones is impossible. Although improved freeform production techniques are still the aim of this research, this does not mean that more freedom in form is by definition the largest improvement that AM can offer at the moment. From another point of view the implementation of additional functions in traditional products can be of great value. Product ideas and an evaluation of the techniques shown in the vision are related to the developments to achieve an increase in speed, surface quality and strength in the AM production technique, next to the requirements that have to be set regarding a matching fresh concrete mixture. These essential aspects of the process lead to the important conclusion that in the AM of concrete, both material and production technique have to be matched precisely. Next to matching process and material it is important to match process and product. Concrete is widely used and not all products should be made using an AM process. Simply copying standardized elements does not add the added value layered fabrication methods can achieve if used adequately.","Additive Manufacturing; AM; 3D-printing; Concrete","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Al-Ars, Z. (mentor); Hofstee, H.P. (mentor)","2015","Big Data systems have been used for multiple years to solve problems that require scale. A framework takes care of scalability and resiliency issues, and allows the user to focus on relevant computation, in the form of map and reduce functions. In these Big Data systems, we currently see a shift from the traditional use of the Hard Disk Drive (HDD) towards in-memory computation. In this thesis, we have theoretically evaluated these two generations of Big Data systems, as well as two implementations, being Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, in combination with Flash technology. We have also evaluated the possible use of Flash technology in these Big Data sys- tems, by performing two experiments. Our first experiment exam- ined the performance of Apache Spark versus Apache Hadoop for a representative iterative algorithm, and the performance degradation of Apache Spark under memory constrains. We have found that, for the chosen algorithm, Apache Spark performs equal-or-better compared to Apache Hadoop when data has to be loaded from the HDD, such as is the case of the initialization phase of a program. For the iterative part of our program, we have seen an overall speedup of 30, and a speedup of 100 for the map and reduce phases. In our second experiment, we evaluated two ways of using Flash, in particular using the IBM FlashSystem 840 connected to a Power8, in Apache Spark. We have first evaluated Flash technology with a mounted file system, and used this setup to replace the HDD as default spill loca- tion. We have found that this was not valuable, as the possible performance improvements were negligible compared to the overhead generated by data aggregation and system calls. We then shifted our focus to CAPI connected Flash, and modified Apache Spark to spill intermediate data directly to the FlashSystem using key value pairs. In our experiment, while limiting the memory to a fixed amount to force spilling, we were able to remove 70% of the overhead caused by spilling. This was mainly overhead of Operating System (OS) involvement. In our future work, we will address the overhead caused by data aggregation, as we can write smaller amounts of data, because we are writing in key value pairs. We believe that, once this overhead is removed, Big Data systems can benefit from Flash technology, and especially CAPI Flash technology, as one can use a system with a limited amount of expensive DRAM and a large Flash backend, to solve larger problem sets while maintaining a performance equal to in-memory computation.","Apache Spark; Apache Hadoop; Big Data; IBM Power Systems; Flash; CAPI Flash","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Kobus, C.B.A. (mentor)","2015","This graduation project aims to make smart charging acceptable and valuable in the EV charging practice. The Dutch government estimates a strong increase in electric vehicles (EV’s) in the Netherlands in the coming decade. The current estimation is 200.000 EV's in 2020 towards 1 million EV's in 2025. This will have a big impact on the electricity grid. To balance peakloads and fluctuating energy supplies a new EV charging market model is proposed, including a smart charging system. Until now, the EV driver's story misses in this system. The purpose of this graduation project is to find out how smart charging can be introduced in the EV driver's charging experience. This project uses a practice- oriented design methodology approach, based on social practice theory in design methodology, allowing for a more comprehensive view to research and design. The value of flexibility for smart charging can best be integrated in the EV charging experience in the following two ways: -Providing relevant EV information in time and place. Supportive EV information is grouped in ‘state of charge’, ‘micro- location’ and ‘charge point information’, supplemented with a service platform. The state-of-the-art practice of EV charging and planning offers more relevant information, becomes more comprehensible and is therefore more valuable for an EV driver. In this better organized practice, smart charging can be introduced without adding complexity. -The EV driver needs support in becoming aware of not always needing full mobility. The EV driver is offered a choice about his mobility right after the charging practice, when walking away from the EV. A mobile interface brings best of two worlds: a close relationship with the EV driver and customizability of the interface. Within the service platform the EV driver will be persuaded by offering a limited amount of choices with a reward for his immobility.","EV; smart grids; smart charging; social practice theory; practice-oriented design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","This research proposes an algorithm for the generation of realistic plant distribution for both existing and future areas using spatial data. The main motivation for this research is to be able to generate realistic plant positions for the 3D visualization of existing and future natural environments. Current techniques for determining plant positions are limited. Plant detection techniques from the remote sensing domain are only able to detect positions for large plants using high-resolution imagery and LiDAR data. Often, the plant type of each detected position is not known. In addition, imagery and LiDAR data are not available for future areas. This research demonstrates that spatial data for future can be generated by using dynamic ecological models. These models can produce height, biomass, and coverage maps for future areas. The proposed algorithm must be able to translate data from existing areas as well as data produces by ecological models to a realistic plant distribution. A realistic plant distribution can contain plant positions for small and large plants with their corresponding plant type. To be able to realize this, an algorithm is proposed that integrates concepts of procedural generation and ecological modeling. Different spatial datasets can be provided as input and are analyzed to obtain information of where certain plant types can or cannot be placed in the target area. The algorithm was tested on both an existing area and a future area generated by an ecological model. The results were validated with statistical and expert validation methods. The statistical validation showed that algorithm is able to map the spatial data input correctly to a plant distribution. The expert validation showed that the generated plant distributions were in general judged realistic and that most issues in each plant distribution were because of missing data input or due to low data quality. In the future, the algorithm could be used for different applications and research. One possibility is to improve the current plant detection technique by providing additional information about the positions of small plants and by providing information about the plant type for each point with this algorithm.","plant; plant distribution; vegetation; spatial data; plant detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","Geomatics","",""

The RCP controls the amount of oxygen the perishable product has available inside the package so this is just enough for the product to survive but not to start its natural degradation process. In other words, the products enter into hibernation or “Sleeping” mode. The result is that shelf-life is extended and the products arrive fresher and last longer at consumer’s house.

(mentor); Broere, W. (mentor); Hoving, J.S. (mentor); Müller, B. (mentor)","2015","Artificial ground freezing (AGF) has been applied over 150 years for mining, and was adopted for civil engineering purposes more than 30 years ago. AGF is used as a construction method to provide structural support and to exclude groundwater. Due to 9 percent volumetric expansion of pore water during freezing, soil experiences primary heave. In fine-grained soils heave due to formation of distinct ice lenses may occur. This secondary heave may contribute significantly to the total heave. After thawing, favourable effects of the freezing process may turn into unfavourable soil conditions due to reduction in strength properties and thaw settlements. The primary thesis objective is investigating one-dimensional ice lens growth and its influence on physical and mechanical properties and deformation of a silty soil. To focus on important aspects only, three secondary objectives were formulated, being establishing an overview of literature, designing test equipment and performing lab tests on frozen soil. Freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) consist of three phases: initiation phase, preservation phase and degradation phase. In the initiation phase a temperature gradient is introduced, initiating heat extraction. The temperature within the sample starts to drop now. At the end of this phase thermal equilibrium is established, which is maintained during the preservation phase. Between the frozen and unfrozen zone lies the frozen fringe, which is partially frozen soil with reduced permeability. Water from the unfrozen zone can flow through this zone, until it freezes. Here ice crystals may form distinct layers, known as ice lenses. The lens thickness can increase as long as the frozen fringe supplies groundwater. Two theories exist regarding moment of ice lens initiation: a pressure- and a temperature-based theory. During thawing phase, pore ice melts and water is released by the thawing soil. In fine-grained soils, drainage of excess pore water is limited by the permeability, resulting in excess pore pressure. Therefore, effective stress and shear strength may be reduced after thawing. Soil tends to reach a residual void ratio that is approached after a number of FTCs. The result is densification of loose soils and loosening of dense soils. Remarkably, the particle rearrangement always causes an increase in permeability. With regard to changes in mechanical properties after thawing, different conclusions were found, sometimes even contradictory. This may be because of different researchers studied different soils and applied different test conditions. A lack in study is recognised on the difference between natural and reconstituted soils, between the same soil at different densities and between soil types. During FT tests on natural clay the inter-particle bonding was damaged and disappeared after five FTCs. As laboratory-prepared samples lack particle cementation, they are not as affected by FT damage. Triaxial test data for this project was not accurate enough for determination of undrained shear strength and permeability. By frost heave observations useful data was obtained. For the frost tests Illite and K122 was used, given their high potential for ice lens formation. Frost heave progresses non-linearly, starting rapidly, but slowing down after a while. This is probably because of temperature boundary effects of the setup. With decreasing cold-side temperature, the frost heave increases. This is partially the result of a larger frozen zone, as seen on ?CT scans. With this non-destructive method the internal rearrangement of the soil particles was monitored, revealing vertical cracking and expansion of existing cracks. Numerical test results show a linear relationship between sample height and frost penetration height and thus primary heave. The secondary heave is not height-related, as lens growth is a distinct process dependent on time. Other test results show a non-linear relationship between sample height and time to establish thermal equilibrium.","ice lens formation; soil freezing; CT scanning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor); Diehl, J.C. (mentor)","2015","Worldwide, roughly five billion people do not have the funds for purchasing an electric washing machine or the means (piped water and an electricity connection) to operate one. As a result, mostly housewives are left washing their clothes by hand. This is a labour-intensive and time-consuming task, commonly taking place on a daily basis. Not only is this a large-scale waste of time and resources, the used cleaning methods are a common cause for physical problems and often harmful to garments as well. Since household chores in lower social classes are so time-consuming, housewives face much resistance in their progression to becoming more self-empowered and emancipated. From a combination of these factors, the idea of developing a fitting solution to the current laundry situation in the form of a human-powered washing machine has sprung. In order to design this product so that it fits the targeted context, extensive research was performed in the Indian state of Gujarat. Countless household and laundry situations were observed and numerous interviews were conducted. This graduation project has resulted in the design of a bucket-like, hand-operated washing machine. Primitive rather than sophisticated, the working principle of this product is kept as simple as possible to optimize the endurance and to keep its price low.","human power; washing machine; BoP; MoP; India; Gujarat; laundry; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","","23.022505, 72.571362"

(mentor); Tenpierik, M.J. (mentor)","2015","This report describes the development of a multifunctional building and the research that supports the design. The question was “what are the characteristics of a multifunctional exhibition hall of which the structural design is integrated with the variable acoustical design and of which the acoustic properties are used as decisive factors in the visual appearance of the design?” Combining acoustical shapes with structural design can lead to intriguing forms. Using computer analysis, literature studies and case-studies a concept design was developed. As a foundation for the design the existing exhibition complex WTC expo Leeuwarden was used. The new hall replaces an existing hall and thus it has to be an addition to the functionality of the building, rather than a replacement. This has been done by not creating a hall only functional as an exhibition hall but as a concert (amplified music) hall, acoustical music hall and speech hall as well. Especially the acoustical music hall should meet very specific acoustical properties. The other functions have different acoustical properties. The exhibition hall requires an empty floor plan, which results in a challenging structural design scope as well. To minimize the amount of materials needed for the structure the aim is to integrate the acoustical shape and materialisation with the structural design. Literature study explains the relation between sound waves, frequencies, reflections and how they contribute to the experience of the audience in a concert hall or auditorium. Important elements for the experience of the receiver of the sound are envelopment, reverberation, clarity and loudness. Envelopment depends on the sound direction as perceived by the receiver. A larger variety of sound directions results in a better envelopment, which is desirable for music related functions. Reverberation time, clarity and loudness can analysed objectively. The current shapes of concert halls are derived from optimization of either view or envelopment, but not both. The rectangular and hexagonal shaped concert halls are the most successful in combining a good view and envelopment. Folding techniques have been inventoried. By folding the roof or wall, a surface is created which can diffuse the lateral sound reflections and create a better envelopment. The angle of the folds and direction of the surfaces strongly influences the envelopment. They function best when the folding lines are parallel to the main sound direction. The exhibition building in Turin, designed by Nervi, shows how a structure with a large span can be reached with a minimum amount of material. Nervi also designed the UNESCO conference building in Paris. This building is an example how structure can be combined with the acoustical shape of a hall. While these projects where used as an inspiration, ‘de Spiegel’ in Zwolle is an example how moving elements and changing volumes can change the reverberation time and clarity of a hall. Based on the literature study and case studies, a concept was developed where a folding technique is used to create the wanted diffusion in the concert and acoustical music hall. While the folding technique also allows the structure to change its shape volume and floor surface. This way the amount of unneeded area is minimized, which reduces the climate demands. The dynamic exterior fits the changing function of the building and results in a dynamic interior as well. To create the dynamic exterior a pattern combining X- and V-folds was used. This pattern is mirrored over the centre of the hall to form the second part, resulting in a three-hinged span. Research shows that, without any additions to the structural design, the best envelopment, clarity, loudness, reverberation and echogram is reached by using 16 of the folded ribs, which have a width of 10 meter when they are unfolded. The folding shape is also a strong structural shape. Glass fibre reinforced plastic is a lightweight material with high tensile and compressive strength and was used to create a structural shell. Due to its poor acoustical insulating properties the material rigid polystyrene foam, which is a common material in sandwich panels, was not used as insulation on the inside of the panel. A hard rock wool, which has a good sound absorption property, was used. Calculations have shown that a thickness of 260 mm was needed to reach a Rc-value of 6 m²K/W. This results in a theoretical Rw-value (sound resistance) of 97 dB. The hinge used for the connection of the composite panels is a longitudinal composite fabric hinge developed by Vosmaer. This hinge is easy to fix on the building site. The hinge does not use any thermal insulation, therefore profiles are added to the outside of the structure to minimize sound leakages and thermal bridges. The side walls of the structure change shape as well. To close off the wall triangular composite panels are sliding over each other. When the structure changes shape, the wall is able to move along. These panels and the structural composite panels can be produced in a large hall using molds. Because of the location of the WTC expo, the composite panels can be transported by ship to the building site. If the structure would be built on a different location, the elements should be made in smaller parts and joined on the building site. The acoustical music hall and the speech hall are designed to be the smallest configuration of the hall. The speech hall has a reverberation time of 0,78 seconds and a clarity (C50) of 2,0 dB. The acoustical music hall has a reverberation time of 2,28 seconds and a clarity (C80) of -0,8 dB, these results are desirable. The transformation between these two functions is achieved by flipping the panels of the internal wall. These panels function as doors at some locations, but their main purpose is to contribute to the acoustical design, as one side of the panels is perforated and functions as an absorbing surface while the other side reflects most of the sound. Panels can be added to the side of the entrance doors to absorb sound as well. When the hall is used for a speech related function a reflector is placed above the stage, to reflect sound more directly rather than diffuse. The back side of the reflector is an absorbing surface as well. Because the panels behind the stage can be flipped to reflect or to absorb sound, a large variety of reverberation can be created between 0,78 and 2,28 seconds.","Acoustics; Multifunctionality; Structural design; Exhibition hall","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","","",""

However, for economic reasons better usage of the current road capacity should be performed. Therewith, the intersection density in road networks has increased nowadays. One of the consequences is that the way of controlling a certain intersection influences the traffic state at another intersection. Therefore, traffic controllers should be connected when controlling traffic at individual intersections. In this thesis a subnetwork flow controller has been designed. A road network which is controlled in a hierarchical setting by a main controller can be split up in several subnetworks. By controlling the perimeter flows between the subnetworks, the traffic state of each subnetwork can be controlled. In this thesis, only traffic signals at intersections have been taken into account as the control units. The designed subnetwork flow controller had to contribute to three main objectives: 1. Maintaining a constant shaped MFD, 2. Optimizing internal flows, 3. Provide desirable perimeter flows. The subnetwork flow controller algorithm has been based upon a back pressure algorithm which belongs to the coordinated traffic responsive control strategies in existing traffic controllers. A back pressure algorithm has been chosen due to the property of balancing queues which should result in homogeneity of traffic conditions within a subnetwork. The back pressure algorithm determines pressures for every individual intersection and every traffic phase consisting of several traffic streams. For every traffic stream the downstream queue length is subtracted from the upstream queue length and multiplied with the turn ratio at which traffic can go through the intersection at that specific traffic stream. The pressure of a phase is calculated by adding up individual pressures of traffic streams which are part of that specific phase. Due to the property of balancing queues by the back pressure algorithm and the assumption that homogeneity in traffic conditions might improve internal flows, some adjustments had to be performed only in order to provide desirable perimeter flows. A maximum deviation factor has been set up which allows a certain deviation of the actual perimeter flows with respect to the desirable perimeter flows which have been set up by the main controller. When the deviation exceeds a certain value, traffic streams have to be blocked when the actual perimeter flow is too high or have to get right-of-way when the actual perimeter flow is too low. By reducing the available phases from which the subnetwork flow controller can choose, the perimeter flows can be controlled. In order to evaluate the performance of the designed subnetwork flow controller, simulations have been performed in VISSIM where the subnetwork flow controller (written in Matlab) has been applied. Simulations with an applied vehicle-actuated controller and basic back pressure controller have been performed first in order to derive a most desirable size of the subnetwork layout and get reference results for evaluating the performance of the subnetwork flow controller. Simulations have been performed with subnetworks consisting of four, eight and sixteen intersections and different applied demand patterns. It turned out that a subnetwork consisting of sixteen intersections controlled by a vehicle-actuated controller or back pressure controller provides a MFD with the lowest scatter size, determined by the standard deviation of the absolute scatter deviation with respect to the constructed running median of the MFD. This low scatter resulted also in a constant shape of the MFD independent of the applied demand pattern. Therewith, with increasing size of the subnetwork the back pressure controller was able to control the traffic in the subnetwork better when evaluating total delay and internal production. This is caused by the result that gridlocks can be postponed by the back pressure controller. When applying the designed subnetwork flow controller on a subnetwork consisting of sixteen intersections, different maximum deviation factors have been applied. It turned out that there was no significant difference in performance on all three objectives between the applied deviation factors. Moreover, it turned out that the subnetwork flow controller was able to control perimeter flows at intersections with two adjacent intersections better as three adjacent intersections. Therefore, some extra simulations have been performed with an additional value of the maximum deviation factor and different desired perimeter flows for perimeter flows at intersections with two or three adjacent intersections. The subnetwork flow controller designed in this thesis has been proven to work properly according to the simulation results. When the subnetwork flow controller provides the desired perimeter flows (under certain circumstances), a constant shaped MFD can be maintained. However, another result is an increase in delay and thus less optimal internal flows compared to the performance of a vehicle-actuated controller. Therewith, a non constant shaped of the MFD was the result of some simulations caused by the influence of setting up the values for the desired perimeter flows and maximum deviation factor. No optimal values for the maximum deviation factor and restrictions on setting up the desired perimeter flows have been found in the algorithm of the subnetwork flow controller. It is therefore recommended to perform extra simulations in order to derive these aspects before the subnetwork flow controller is suitable in a hierarchical control structure. It is also recommended to perform extra simulations with more different kind of demand patterns and different control time intervals. Furthermore, future research is recommended on clearance times, the measuring way of queue lengths, applying more heterogeneous subnetworks, applying different kind of dynamic traffic management (DTM) measures and evaluating method of scatter size.","MFD; subnetwork traffic control; perimeter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport","",""

The novel method uses a send wave which will generate a second harmonic. This wave is then compared to a second wave, which contains the same spectrum as the second harmonic generated by the first wave. The applicability of this method is studied by using a KZK simulation to see if the method can work in a pulse echo configuration, where the echo’s come from a small sample placed in water with scatter points closer together than the wavelength of the send wave.

(mentor); Bulten, N. (mentor)","2015","The use of azimuth thrusters as main propulsion device and for manoeuvring of ships is increasing over the past decades. However, the understanding of hydrodynamic loads acting on such devices in oblique inflow conditions is still an interesting area of research as it is generally believed that such loads can be partially responsible for the failure of parts of power transmission system to the thruster. A deeper understanding of such loads can provide critical mechanical design considerations for the parts involved in transmitting power such as bevel gears, bearing and seals as well the parts of thruster housing. Thus, the aim of this research is to provide an insight into the behavior of hydrodynamic loads of a pulling open type steerable thruster particularly the steering moment, including extreme oblique inflow conditions at various ship speeds and power absorption. A numerical investigation of steering thrusters is performed for various conditions. For this a turbulence model is used and for simulating manoeuvring tests transient conditions are used where as open water tests are simulated using quasi steady conditions. These simulations are based on RANS method for solving the flow with standard k-epsilon model with a high y+ wall treatment around an azimuth thruster system. A commercial code of Star CCM+ is used for performing the simulations. Post processing results give an insight into the critical flow regions and contribution of loads and moments of the system. Validation is done with available model scale data, tested at MARIN institute at Netherlands. The results showed an acceptable agreement to do further analysis of the steering moment behaviour at various steering angles and advance ship speeds. Behaviour of various hydrodynamic loads is discussed in the results section. In general, the various hydrodynamic forces were found to be increasing with increase in steering angles and symmetrical for mirrored conditions. As numerical simulations provide the feasibility of studying loads on individual components, the contribution of individual parts of the thruster for different forces and moments was also analyzed. The side force moment created by the propeller side is balanced mainly by anti moments created by the skeg and the remainder is taken up by the steering motor torque to keep the thruster at a particular steering position under such external hydrodynamic loads. Detailed asymmetrical flow fields are discussed which arise due to oblique angle and spinning of fluid due to propeller rotation. Finally, the pulling thruster under study was compared with a ducted pushing thruster for hydrodynamic loads and the results are discussed in detail. The steering moments in both cases rise very steeply with steering angles and are significant at higher steering angles. Also, in case of a pulling thruster there is a fluctuating steering moment present even in straight inflow conditions unlike the pushing unit, which can be of interest when comparing these two type of configurations.","Hydrodynamics of Steering Thrusters; Turbulence Modeling; Numerical Modeling of Thrusters in Oblique inflow; Transient behavior; Pushing v/s Pulling Thrusters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Energy Technology/Fluids chair","",""

(mentor)","2015","The Maasvlakte port area in Rotterdam is located in the Netherlands. There are 14 container terminals and empty container depots located within this area, some are existing and some will be built in the near future. At container terminals containers are being transhipped between different modalities. At empty container depots, empty containers are being stored for a certain time. The container terminals are sharing the same customs facility and empty container depots. Transport between the container terminals and these facilities has to be organised. It is also possible that containers arrive at one container terminal, but have to depart from another container terminal. This transport between different terminals and depots is called Inter Terminal Transport (ITT). This ITT has to be organized in the future. The main question of this research is: Which transport system is most appropriate for Inter Terminal Transport between the terminals and depots at Maasvlakte 1 and 2 in 2030 and why? Previous studies were performed to determine the most appropriate transport system for ITT. This study includes a new simulation model to compare the ITT systems, in which the most up-to-date information can be used for the generation of new ITT container demand scenarios. The minimum percentage of on-time containers is set as a constraint, which was not done in previous researches. In this way a fair comparison can be made of the ITT systems and they can be evaluated using multiple criteria. In this research the AGV, ALV, and MTS will be compared. The AGV and ALV are automated vehicles, have a capacity of 2 TEU, and are expected to drive with a speed of 40 km/h in 2030. The ALV is able to load and unload containers by itself. The MTS is a manned vehicle, has a capacity of 10 TEU, and is expected to drive with a speed of 30 km/h in 2030. These ITT systems will be compared for three different economic growth scenarios (defined by the Port of Rotterdam): low growth, high oil prices, and European trend. An existing container generator (which is made in an earlier project) is used to create a table with containers. Each containers has the following properties: start time, origin (terminal/depot), delivery time, destination (terminal/depot), and size in TEU. The amount of generated containers for ITT differs per economic growth scenario: - Low growth scenario: 0.70 million containers/1.17 million TEU per year - High oil prices scenario: 0.78 million containers/1.29 million TEU per year - European trend scenario: 0.99 million containers/1.66 million TEU per year The list of containers from the generator is used as input for a simulation model. For this research a dynamic, discrete-event stochastic model has to be built. Multiple simulation software packages exist that are able to build such kind of model, but a choice has to be made. Based on the availability of the programs at the university, the costs, and the user friendliness, Simio is chosen. Containers arrive at the terminals using their start time and origin property. Containers are labelled as urgent when their latest departure time (delivery time minus the expected loading, unloading and transport time) is within 1 hour, otherwise the containers are labelled as non-urgent. The containers are sorted in different waiting areas; for each destination a separate waiting area is created. Those waiting areas are divided in two parts: the urgent part and the non-urgent part. The containers are virtually sorted by means of their latest departure time; the containers that must depart first are in front of the waiting area (FEFO). The containers are loaded on the ITT vehicles using the terminal equipment (except for the ALV). Each terminal has its own type and number of terminal equipment. Only (urgent and/or non-urgent) containers with the same destination are loaded on the same vehicle. The ITT vehicles depart when they are fully loaded or when a certain time limit is reached. A dedicated road for ITT vehicles will be constructed. 3-way crossings and crossings with rail or public road are located within the ITT network, where vehicles can be delayed. When vehicles arrive at their destination terminal, the terminal equipment unloads the vehicle (except for the ALV). For each terminal this is the same terminal equipment that is also used for loading the ITT vehicles. After unloading, the ITT vehicles are empty again and determine their next transport assignment. It is checked if there are containers waiting at the current terminal or another close terminal (using a predefined list of terminals), starting from the closest to the most far away terminal. If there are urgent containers waiting, the vehicle drives to that terminal (and takes non-urgent containers from the current terminal with that terminal as destination if possible). If there are no urgent containers waiting, all the terminals are checked to see if there are non-urgent containers waiting, starting from the closest terminal (the current terminal) to the most far away terminal. If non-urgent containers are found, the ITT vehicle drives to that terminal. If no containers are found, the ITT vehicle waits and repeats the process of searching containers. It is by far the most important task to deliver the containers on time. Therefore a minimum percentage of 95% on-time containers is used, to get a fair comparison between the ITT systems. The number of vehicles is changed as input, until the minimum number of needed vehicles is found to achieve 95% on-time containers. This minimum number of needed vehicles per ITT system per scenario is shown in Table 0 1. Table 0 1: Needed number of vehicles per ITT system per scenario to reach 95% on time containers AGV ALV MTS Low growth 34 AGVs 24 ALVs 14 MTS-trucks, 90 trailers High oil prices 39 AGVs 27 ALVs 16 MTS-trucks, 105 trailers European trend 53 AGVs 34 ALVs 20 MTS-trucks, 130 trailers The AGV needs clearly the highest number of vehicles, then the ALV, and the MTS needs the lowest number of vehicles. The difference between the AGV and ALV can be declared by the fact that the ALV has the ability to load and unload itself. The capacity of the MTS is 5 times as large as the capacity of the automated systems. This is a clear advantage, because it needs less vehicles than the automated systems, though, the MTS has a lower vehicle speed and has to wait longer during loading and unloading. The automated systems can reach percentages of on-time containers close to 100%, but the MTS can reach only approximately 97%, because of its long loading and unloading time due to its high capacity. The output of the simulation model is used for a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA). The MCA is used to evaluate the different ITT systems, based on two criteria: total costs and sustainability. The total costs of the three ITT systems are very comparable. For the low growth and high oil prices scenario the total costs of the AGV and MTS are equal. The total costs of the ALV are 4% higher than for the AGV or MTS. For the European trend scenario the MTS has the lowest costs. For this scenario the costs of the AGV are 6% higher than the costs of the MTS, and the costs of the ALV are 7% higher than the costs of the MTS. The vehicle costs of the MTS are much lower than the automated systems, but the personnel costs are on the other hand much higher. The sustainability of the ITT systems is measured by the electricity usage. The electricity usage of the automated systems is 99% to 166% higher than the electricity usage of the MTS. The ALV uses approximately 25% more electricity than the AGV. Independent on the weighing factors of the MCA the MTS would have the highest score. The MTS has the lowest costs for each of the scenarios and is the most sustainable ITT system. The difference between the MTS and the automated systems is relatively small looking at the total costs but there is a significant difference looking at the sustainability. The difference between the score (of the MCA) of the MTS and the automated systems depends on how important sustainability is considered by the decision makers. The higher the importance of sustainability is considered, the higher the difference of the score between the MTS and the automated systems will be. Eventually, the MTS will receive in all cases the highest score. Therefore the MTS is considered as the most appropriate ITT system for each of the economic growth scenarios. The input data did not contain large flows from and to empty depots, but in reality these flows will be present. This causes that the amount of ITT flows will be larger, which probably causes that the MTS scores better on total costs, because the MTS scores better on total costs with the highest volume of ITT in the European trend scenario compared to the other two scenarios. Next to this, the MTS is probably a safe option to choose, because for the AGV and ALV large developments are assumed according to the vehicle speed in contrast to the MTS. It is recommended that future research will be done on different fields. It is interesting to see what happens if the ITT flows are divided differently over the ITT network, and if the large flows from and to the empty depots are taken into account. It is interesting to model multiple years instead only 2030, to find out at which moment it is best to implement a new system. It can be investigated if combinations of ITT systems are more appropriate. Another dispatching method can be used to see if a decrease in the number of vehicles can be reached. It is important to know if there are important decision criteria (and their corresponding weighing factors) missing in the MCA, according to the decision makers. This can have an influence on the results of a MCA. It is also interesting to see what the amount of extra costs is to achieve percentages of on time containers close to 100%. It can be considered if the extra on time delivery of the containers can outweigh the extra costs.","Inter Terminal Transport; containers; Europe Container Terminals; simulation model; Maasvlakte; Simio","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-01-29","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport and Planning","",""

Blended Wing Body (BWB) concept has been researched on and studied in various forms over the years as an efficient alternative to the conventional transport configurations. Past studies have concluded that of the podded and embedded engine configurations, the BWB architecture is particularly suited to flush mounted embedded engines, as the balance requirements already place them near the aft of the airframe. Despite the benefits, effect of BLI on engine performance is also known to be detrimental because BLI increases pressure distortion and reduces total pressure recovery at the engine fan face. Most of these drawbacks are caused by secondary flow losses (vortices created due to boundary layer separation) due to an adverse pressure gradient in the S-Duct and a non-uniform mass flow ratio. An improved inlet design becomes necessary to reduce these limitations. The aim of this research is to design an inlet embedded on a BWB that ingests significant amount of fuselage boundary layer and produces minimum pressure loss and distortion in the process. Two major consequences of BLI are vital in this regard namely, loss of total pressure recovery and increased total pressure distortion at the Aerodynamic Interface Plane (AIP) or the engine fan-face. Hence the inlet performance is measured by the total Pressure Recovery Factor (PRF) and Distortion Coefficient (DC60). Therefore, this research work aims to design an embedded inlet on a BWB that produces maximum value of PRF and minimum DC60. An extensive literature study was carried out in order to understand the effects of BLI on inlet performance and research work conducted in the past to minimize the losses associated with BLI. Many of these studies focus on S-Ducts ingesting boundary layer and minimization of the losses using flow control techniques. Few studies have focussed on design of a novel inlet configuration that produces best results in terms of PRF and DC60. This thesis has focussed on the design of the inlet based on computational analysis of different inlet configurations to achieve an optimum design. The framework of this report first follows description of criteria and parameters for embedded inlet design. This is followed by an elaboration on the numerical methodology and approach to be used for the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The CFD simulations and analyses conducted in this thesis are divided into 2 main stages. The first stage deals with the computational analysis of a BWB in clean configuration (without engines) to obtain velocity profiles over aft fuselage, where the inlets will be embedded. The second stage comprises of the main inlet design. Three main geometrical parameters are chosen for the geometrical design of the inlet, namely inlet aspect ratio (ratio of inlet ellipse major axis length and semi-minor axis length), duct length and duct height. A number of tests are conducted to find out the influence of these parameters on the inlet performance. Few other inlet configurations are investigated, which can produce improved results and finally the design of the internal nacelle lip concludes the design of the inlet. Since the BWB in this research operates at cruise conditions (at M=0.82), initially pressure losses were high. Testing of different inlet aspect ratios with constant length and height of duct showed that an aspect ratio of 1.75 performs best with a PRF of 97.01% and a DC60 value of 41.59%, which was quite high. Further tests regarding variation in duct height showed most optimum results for the lowest height of duct due to reduced secondary flow losses. The duct with a height of 0.3m performed best with PRF=97.7% and DC60=28.45%. Finally length of duct was varied keeping previously obtained aspect ratio and height and the shortest duct length (4.85m) performed best with PRF=97.7% and DC60=28.45% (previous variations in duct height and aspect ratios were conducted using the same length value, hence the results for duct height are similar). Therefore, the inlet obtained from the testing concluded the design as an S-Duct inlet with AR=1.75, L=4.85m and H=0.3m with PRF=97.7%, DC60=28.45% and Mach number at the AIP as 0.6. After investigating other configurations like the reverse s-duct, double gradient duct, zero-gradient duct and zero-height duct, the zero-gradient duct (duct with flat bottom wall for boundary layer and no separation inside the inlet, L=4.85m, AR=1.75, H=1.615m) showed best results with PRF=98.04% and DC60=20.55%. The internal nacelle was designed using a contraction ratio of 1.04 and a lip major-to-minor axis ratio (m/n) of 2. The final design of inlet was a zero-gradient duct with L=4.85m, AR=1.75, H=1.615m, CR=1.04, m/n=2, PRF=98.04%, DC60=20.55% and Mach number at the AIP = 0.538. The same final design model was also tested using ParaPy (a high level Python language) and results showed a zero-gradient duct with L=4.85m, AR=1.75, H=1.615m, CR=1.04, m/n=2, PRF=98.3%, DC60=20.14% and Mach number at the AIP = 0.539. A podded inlet configuration of L=6.46m and area-ratio=1.37 with same mass flow rate and fan-face Mach number as that of the embedded engine was also analysed to compare BLI case with no-BLI. The results showed a pressure loss of nearly 10% for the podded case and a larger wetted area. But the DC60 value was significantly lower (2.6%) in comparison to embedded inlet. Follow up studies can be conducted to improve the results using flow control techniques.","Boundary Layer Ingestion; Blended Wing Body; Embedded Engine; Distortion; Pressure Recovery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-01-29","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","Groundwater is an important natural resource which is used all over the world. For a sustainable groundwater use it is important to know how groundwater systems are affected by human interventions. There are several modelling tools that can be used to analyse the influence of interventions on a groundwater system. Time series analysis is a tool that can be used to analyse the influence and contribution of external stresses on a measured time series (e.g. the effect of precipitation on groundwater heads). In the Pre-Defined Impulse Response Functions in Continuous Time (PIRFICT) method for time series analysis (von Asmuth et al. 2002), impulse response functions are used to characterize a groundwater system. Groundwater flow modelling is another approach that can be used to analyze, predict and quantify changes to a groundwater system. A groundwater flow model often contains parameters that represent physical properties of the subsurface such as the transmissivity and the storativity. It is difficult and expensive to measure these parameters, while it is much easier to measure, for example, the head. Therefore these parameters are often obtained with a parameter estimation method by adjusting the model to simulate measured heads. Parameter estimation for a transient groundwater flow model is an iterative method in which many runs of a transient groundwater flow model are used. This makes it impractical to estimate parameters of transient groundwater flow models when one transient run takes a significant amount of computation time. In this study two new parameter estimation methods for transient groundwater flow models are analyzed that do not use transient model runs. One method uses moments of the impulse response function as calibration targets, while the other uses observed groundwater heads. The methods are referred to as the moment matching and the head matching method, respectively. Both methods are based on the principles used in Bakker et al. (2008a and 2008b) and use the properties of an impulse response function to estimate parameter values for groundwater flow models. The performance of the new methods is tested with a synthetic model with varying configurations. All factors influencing the parameter values are known in the synthetic model. The results of the tests show that both new methods yield accurate parameter estimates for linear models. The performance of the parameters estimation methods for models with a spatially distributed recharge can be improved by using a spatially averaged recharge. The new methods are faster than methods using transient model runs, and their performance is independent of the time step size used in transient model runs. The performance of the moment matching method is tested in practice using a part of the existing Azure model; time constraints did not allow calibration with higher order moments. An elevated part of the Azure model (the Veluwe) is used because this system, which has a slow response to precipitation, is difficult to calibrate with current parameter estimation methods. The application of the new method to a part of the Azure model is complex. A linearized version of the Azure model is created to enable the use of the new method. This version is referred to as the “submodel”. Only the zeroth order moment is used for the parameter estimation of the submodel. ? The time series analysis is conducted using observed head and recharge time series. The results from time series analysis are reasonable but can be improved by using a more realistic recharge series and a longer observed head time series. The parameter estimates obtained with the moment matching method improved the match between the average observed heads and the average heads modelled with the modified Azure model. This is a promising result and a positive first step for further application of the new parameter estimation methods in practice.","groundwater flow models; iMODFLOW; parameter estimation; calibration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-01-29","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Geohydrology","","52.0058050, 4.37042700"

(mentor); De Gijt, J.G. (mentor); Romeijn, A. (mentor); Peters, D.J. (mentor); Thumann, V. (mentor)","2015","As the LNG market continues to grow internationally, Floating Storage and Regasification Units (FSRU’s) have become an increasingly important component as governments and private companies strive for faster, cheaper and more flexible means of re-gasifying. In order to have a FSRU mooring system which is equally fast deliverable, standardization is considered. In this study standardization of the civil structures is investigated for a jetty-type mooring system on exposed locations, more specifically standardization of the breasting dolphins. The considered dolphins consist of a simple steel mono-pile which transfers the mooring loads to the sub-soil and a pile-head which connects the fender to the mono-pile. It was concluded that standardization of the mono-piles is only possible to a certain extent, namely in a conceptual design phase. In this report a standardized work approach is presented regarding the design of the mono-piles. Additionally, multiple pile designs are conceived for varying conditions. In an early design stage, when very little information is available, already some insight can be gained regarding the dimensions and the costs of these piles. In this thesis, also, the pile-head concept is presented which is most suitable for standardization purposes. This is achieved by a Fiber Reinforce Polymers (FRP)-composite, floating structure with a slide-bearing sliding system. The application of composite has some major advantages as it is fatigue resistant, low maintenance, light weighted and corrosion resistant. The form of the pile-head is also optimized for its application so that the fender loads are transferred in the most efficient manner to the mono-pile, while the slide-bearing allows smooth sliding along the pile’s shaft. Next to standardization of the civil structures, the loading conditions are investigated. Since the FSRU is permanently moored at exposed locations, this issue cannot be treated with ‘normal’ mooring of traveling ship, but must be calculated with the aid of numerical software where the relation between the environmental conditions and the load conditions is critical. The application of such software, however, is considered time-consuming for early design stages. An assessment tool is therefore conceived that calculates the design fender loads in a quick and analytical manner. This report shows that this assessment tool can generate rather accurate results, but that its application is limited.","Floating Storage and Regasification Unit; jetty-type mooring system; mono-pile dolphins; standardization; LNG","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-01-28","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The aim of this thesis report is to identify which mitigation strategies are most suitable for a network of uncontrollable satellites. Furthermore, the aim is to set-out a method to determine the collision probability for a network of uncontrollable satellites, and identify the parameters that influence the collision probability. These methods are applied to the QB50 mission; to find a scenario where the collision probability is lowest. An alternative method is developed by the author to calculate the Gaussian probability, which is applicable for small satellites. As the size of the satellites decreases relative to the error ellipsoid, the probability at a certain moment in time becomes more equal to the probability at the center of the combined sphere (assuming spherical satellites). Now, instead of dealing with a cumbersome volume integral through the combined error ellipsoid, the collision probability can be approached by a line-integral times the area of the combined satellites’ bodies. Four ideal deployment angles for the QB50 mission were found located in a plane of zero pitch and at yaw angles of 34?, 146?, 248?, 326? measured from velocity vector of the upperstage.Deploying at zero pitch has the effect that the phase between the cross-track and radial separation is half the orbital period. This has the consequence that, when either the cross-track separation is zero, the radial separation has its maximum and visa versa. This can also be identified as (anti-)parallel alignment of relative eccentricity and inclination vectors. Synchronization of the motion at times where the deployment is half or equal to the orbital period should be avoided. For these satellites the amplitude radial and cross-track separations are small. Furthermore, the relative perturbations between these satellites is large, decreasing the offset of the radial motion. This causes the radial and cross-track separation reach zero at equal time. Synchronized satellite increase the collision probability significantly. Both Patera’s method and the line-integral method are applied to a full-scale simulation for the QB50 mission. Multiple scenario’s are chosen for the full-scale simulation. The two scenario’s with the lowest probability are sequential deployment at one of the ideal angles and alternating deployment between two opposite ideal angles. These fall below the threshold value of 10?4, a value used by the German Space Operations Center (GSOC).","collision; analysis; mitigation; qb50; patera; gaussian; satellites; distributed space systems; space; space engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Flight","","Space Systems Engineering","",""

For the coast of Iquique a seismic gap with a return period of 111 ± 33 years is present. Since the last big event in 1877 only 20 % of the accumulated seismic slip is released. The configuration of Iquique is such that a large future earthquake and subsequent tsunami would generate a serious impact in terms of loss of life, economical andmaterial damage and post-event disruption of the society. In this research an answer is given to the question how to reduce the impact of a major tsunami. First the size of the impact is assessed with a high resolution numerical model, NEOWAVE. Various possible scenarios are analysed. Governing parameters are flow depth, flow velocity and the arrival time of the wave in city. The worst case tsunami scenario predicts significant inundation on three locations, the port, the commercial centre Zofri and the popular Cavancha region. The port is outside of the scope of this research. Detailed analysis of the Zofri and Cavancha areas give relevant information for future disaster mitigation. In Zofri, the natural barrier at the shore is overtopped, after which the hinterland, including the Zofri mall, is inundated. The topography of this area shows a hollow profile therefore a ’bathtub’ effect is present. After 60 minutes 50 % of the area is inundated with a maximum of flow depth 2,5 meters and a runup of 4.7 meters. The total inundated area is 760.000m2 In the Cavancha region the water enters 17 minutes after the earthquake event, mainly from the north side,inundating the hinterland. After 5 additional minutes, the Cavancha peninsula is cut off, creating an island. The numerical results give a maximum flow depth of 5mand flow velocities between the 3 and 5 m/s and the runup reaches 6.8meters. The total inundated area is 700.000m2. As the size of the impact is determined, the mitigation of the impact is assessed. A method of developing and assessing mitigation measures is put forward. Essential to this method is the framework, in which elements of existing calamity frameworks are captured. The used framework addresses the phase to which the disaster has evolved (strategies), techniques that can be applied with respect the the event (methods) and the concept of safety ensured on multiple levels. The use of the framework ensures the development of a multilateral complex solution. Sub-research questions corresponding to the stages of analysis, design and validation are introduced to guide the process of obtaining the answer to the main research question. In the analysis stage a short list of mitigation measures, specifically suited for the Iquique areas, is derived. In the subsequent design stage, the methods, derived in the framework, are used to compose three possible systems of mitigation. The first system focusses on retaining water at the coastline, preventing the hinterland from being inundated by the use of a Dyneema tsunami barrier. In order to secure safety, mitigation measures related to escaping the water are implemented. Since the system also has to reduce impact related to possible post-disaster disruption,also the method preparing for the aftermath is employed. The second system evolves around the concepts of delaying and diverting the incoming water. In order to do this, an submerged breakwater and flow channels integrated in existing infrastructure are introduced. Similar to the first system, this system makes use of measures related to escaping the water and preparing for the aftermath. The third system focusses completely on the concepts of escaping the water and preparing for the aftermath. A new evacuation protocol and the design of a public vertical evacuation building are proposed. The systems are validated on their effectiveness and their side effects are evaluated. At this point, the three complex solutions are evaluated on the impact criteria. All the systems can be implemented in Iquique and will reduce the impact of a future tsunami. When mitigation measures for Iquique are considered the systems proposed in this report are a guidance for the possibilities and scale of impact reduction","Chile; tsunami; flood risk","en","student report","TU Delft, Department Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering - Watermanagement -Geotechnical Engineering","","","","-20.217665, -70.152190"

(mentor); Klein, T. (mentor)","2015","This master thesis examines the possibilities of creating a decentralized hybrid ventilation system with a heat recovery system. Natural ventilation is more commonly used as the main ventilation principle and has the advantage to lower the energy costs of a building. One of the downsides of the natural ventilation system is the lack of heat recovery. By combining the heat recovery abilities of a decentralized mechanical ventilation system with driving forces of natural ventilation, a new decentralized ventilation system is created. This ventilation system will be located at a typical 70’s office building in the Netherlands. The main boundary condition for a natural ventilation system is the driving force. This can be buoyancy or a wind induced principle. The wind induced ventilation principle generates the largest pressures and velocities in comparison with buoyancy based ventilation. The wind direction will have a large influence on the wind velocity at the façade. Average wind velocities of 2.4 m/s are measured during simulations for wind perpendicular to the façade. In the simulation, the manual heat load calculations are used for the input. These simulations showed that by using two ventilation systems per office, each having a capacity of 50 m3/h, will meet the requirements of 100 m3/h of fresh air for the office. The Fiwihex system used for the heat exchangers will recover enough heat in order to reduce the need for additional heating to almost zero. The final design consists of an integraded box in the façade. This box will have a wind cowl inlet and a venture shaped outlet at the outside of the façade in order to generate a sufficient air flow. Due to the small size of the box, 150x300x1200mm (d x w x h), its location on the façade can vary. The system can be used in an enclosed office area as well as an open plan office. Due to the high efficiency of the heat exchanger and the use of wind as a driving force, energy savings of 5% of the total energy use of the building and even higher can be achieved.","natural ventilation; hybrid ventilation; heat recovery; wind around buildings; office ventilation; energy consumption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","Building Technology","",""

(mentor); Coelho, R. (mentor)","2015","With the increasing popularity of open-source version control platforms like GitHub, developers get more feedback on the changes they make. A common tool in version control systems is the highlighted difference view of the source code. This enables reviewers to quickly view the changes made. A missing feature is comparison of the test coverage. Since more and more projects develop a test suite to ensure quality, it is worth looking into how a change affects the test coverage of the project. In this thesis, a tool called Operias is proposed and implemented. Operias is a tool which accepts two versions of a project and calculates the difference in both source code and in statement coverage. The tool generates a HTML site, which developers can use to quickly review the changes. It is possible to run Operias as a service and to connect it to GitHub. This way, a report is automatically generated for every pull request that is opened. This helps reviewers to determine whether to accept the pull request or not. The main contributions of this thesis is the generic description of how the tool Operias works and the actual implementation of the tool. The tool is available on GitHub, and with the tool we conducted a real life evaluation with three open-source projects on GitHub to determine the usefulness of the tool. We found that in many cases Operias can help developers and reviewers during the review process.","pull request; github; coverage; code review; co-evolution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Software Technology","",""

(mentor); Zwaan, J.A. (mentor); Bakker, K.J. (mentor)","2015","This thesis discusses the use of 3D finite element method (FEM) in deep excavations, especially the simulation of sequential excavation method in 3D FEM model. It is an independent research project based on the Spaarndammertunnel project in Amsterdam. This thesis only focused on the excavation part of the tunnel project. Soil parameters used in models were derived from in situ soil investigation. Cone penetration tests and boreholes were carried out along the tunnel location. The soil data was compared with Amsterdam North-South metro line database as well. The excavation plan, retaining structure and building material were developed from the preliminary design of this project. The data for soil investigation and preliminary design were provided by CRUX Engineering BV. The research focus was to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of applying 3D FEM modelling for deep excavations. Since the construction of Spaarndammertunnel starts after the completion of this graduation project, no field data was available for verification. Instead, 2D models were made for comparison and verification purpose. The soil and building material parameters were first tested in 2D spring model and 2D FEM model. The deflections of sheet pile walls in both 2D models were at similar level. The 3D FEM model adopted the model set-up tested and adjusted in 2D FEM model. Parametric study was done in order to investigate how the domain and mesh set-up influence the results in 3D FEM model. Certain geometry (50m * 18m) of excavation section was determined so that the results from 3D FEM model and 2D FEM model were comparable. The excavation method applied in 2D and 3D FEM model was normal staged excavation. The excavation was designed to be dry excavation. After the comparison between 2D and 3D FEM model, the sequential excavation method was implemented into 3D FEM model. Different excavation rates, excavation directions and lateral support design were tested in order to optimize the sequential excavation model. The responses of sheet pile walls as well as surrounding soil were recorded and compared with results from normal 3D excavation model. The parametric study of 3D FEM model showed that the geometry of the excavation zone and the mesh set-up has great influence over the response of sheet pile wall. If the excavation section was longer than 50m, the whole domain can be considered as plain strain, so that the results in 2D and 3D FEM models were almost the same. If the section length was lowered from 50m to 30m, the bending of sheet pile wall could be reduced by 20%. This is because the sheet pile wall can benefit from the corner effect in 3D scenario. It is advised to apply 3D FEM model when dimensions and shape of the excavation zone allows the model to maximize the corner effect. The mesh set-up is also crucial to 3D FEM model. Coarse mesh leads to low accuracy results that certain stress points receiving much high stress than it should. Refine mesh requires a lot more time for calculation. For future research, it is still advised to perform field test for verification of 3D FEM models. It is also recommended to test how lateral support like struts and wailing beam influence the performance of sheet pile wall, especially the corners of excavation section. For the sequential excavation method in this project, the main benefit was to control the settlement of surrounding area. The effect of limiting the deflection and bending moments of sheet pile wall by using sequential excavation was very limited. It is recommended to carry out the sequential excavation when the surrounding area is very sensitive to settlement that control of settlement is of high priorities. But for Spaarndammertunnel, the road near the tunnel is outside the influenced zone even if normal staged excavation is used. The modelling of sequential excavation requires a lot of time and effort, the execution requires even more time and effort. So the disadvantages of applying sequential excavation method in Spaarndammertunnel outweigh the advantages.","3D FEM model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""

(mentor)","2015","Traditionally, maintenance of conveyor belts is performed using corrective maintenance. This means that maintenance to conveyor belts is only performed if the belt fails or severe damage is detected to the belt. Visual inspections to the belt are carried out to detect defects to the belt before the belt fails. Once a belt fails or a defect is detected, maintenance is performed. The amount of maintenance to a system of belts heavily depends on the failures and defects detected. So during a period with little detected defects, the workload is low while the opposite also is true. This leads to a very uneven work load for the department or company performing the maintenance to the belts. Because maintenance is only performed once severe damage is detected or the belt has already failed, the system reliability is lowered. The reliability of the system and the spread of the work load can be improved by using preventive maintenance instead of corrective. Preventive maintenance is performed before severe damage to the belt is present. But how do you know when to perform the preventive maintenance. Performing the maintenance too early will lead to an increase of the number of maintenance actions over time. Performing the maintenance too late and the corrective maintenance has already taken place. Developing a method to determine when the maintenance has to take place, the so called maintenance interval, is the main focus of this research. To determine the optimum maintenance interval a model has been developed. The model has been designed with conveyor belts into mind but can easily be used on every component that requires preventive maintenance. The model is developed using the Bayesian Belief Network (BBN). Belief networks are graphical representations of models that capture the relationships between the model's variables. The variables that interact directly are identified and are limited to the variables to which they are directly connected. Belief networks may use directed or undirected graphs to represent a dependency model. The directed acyclic graph (DAG) provides a better representation than the undirected graphs. The DAG is also more flexible and is able to represent a wider range of probabilistic independencies. An undirected graph is one where the edges have no direction meaning (A, B) is equal to (B, A). The BBN is a specific type of causal belief network. As for any causal belief network, the nodes represent stochastic variables and the arcs identify direct causal influences between the linked variables. The fundamentals of the Bayesian methodology is too enable prior knowledge of a certain event to calculate the posterior probability of a hypothesis based on the probability of the event. One of the challenges of the BBN method is incorporating information with a large number of possible values. The thickness of a conveyor belt for example changes of its lifetime because of wear. To take this type of information into account in the model, fuzzy logic is introduced. Fuzzy logic is used to assign a degree of membership to an event. By assigning the thickness of the belt a number of ranges instead of thickness in millimetre, the amount of variations for this node is limited to the number or ranges. The BBN model is created by using both historical data as the knowledge of experts concerning the part where the model is used for into account. The historical data provide the basic information necessary for the model. The expert opinion can be used to check the information supplied by the historical data as fill in missing data. By introducing reliability of the data and information to the model, the usefulness in practice can be increased. Data for the model determined by a large number of sources and checked by an expert can be considered as reliable. The opposite is also valid and by looking at the reliability of the outcome of the model, the influence of the model on the decision making process can be described. Another factor that is taken into account in the model is the spread in the output. The output of the model will always have an uncertainty that is translated in a spread. This spread can be influenced by the reliability of the model and for example a safety factor for the maintained part in question. The developed BBN model can provide a boost in both the reliability of the system the part is present in as reducing the fluctuations in the workload for maintenance operations. The workings of the model have been proven with the usage of a test case at the company Tata Steel although the output was not accurate enough to use in practice. Further research is necessary to increase the accuracy of the model to enable the industry to use the method during normal operations.","Conveyor belts; Preventive maintenance; Bayesian Belief Network; Fuzzy logic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor)","2015","The purpose of this study is to investigate the asymptotics of a first order auto regressive unit root process, AR(1). The goal is to determine which tests could be used to test for the presence of a unit root in a first order auto regressive process. A unit root is present when the root of the characteristic equation of this process equals unity. In order to test for the presence of a unit root, we developed an understanding of the characteristics of the AR(1) process, such that the difference between a trend stationary process and a unit root process is clear. The first test that will be examined is the Dickey-Fuller test. The estimator of this test is based on Ordinary Least Square Regression and a t-test statistic, which is why we have computed an ordinary least square estimator and the test statistic to test for the presence of unit root in the first order auto regressive process. Furthermore we examined the consistency of this estimator and its asymptotic properties. The limiting distribution of the test statistic is known as the Dickey-Fuller distribution. With a Monte Carlo approach, we implemented the Dickey-Fuller test statistic in Matlab and computed the (asymptotic) power of this test. Under the assumption of Gaussian innovations (or shocks) the limiting distribution of the unit root process is the same as without the normality assumption been made. When there is a reason to assume Gaussianity of the innovations, the Likelihood Ratio test can be used to test for a unit root. The asymptotic power envelope is obtained with help of the Likelihood Ratio test, since the Neyman-Pearson lemma states that the Likelihood Ratio test is the point optimal test for simple hypotheses. By calculating the likelihood functions the test statistic was obtained, such that an explicit formula for the power envelope was found. Since each fixed alternative results in a different critical value and thus in a different unit root test, there is no uniform most powerful test available. Instead we are interested in asymptotically point optimal tests and we will analyze which of these point optimal tests is the overall best performing test. By comparing the asymptotic powercurve to the asymptotic power envelope for each fixed alternative we could draw a conclusion on which fixed alternative results in the overall best performing test. On the basis of the results of this research, it can be concluded that there does not exist a uniform most powerful test, nonetheless we can define an overall best performing test.","autoregressive; unit; root","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","","",""

An unpronounceable name for a megacity that has become so addictive to growth that it will become uncontrollable. The municipality will be left incapable in effectively managing the dramatically enlarged city. Stopping the urban sprawl will mean that the city center, known as DKI Jakarta, should increase its density; both in its inhabitants as in floor space, in order to be able to house the majority of the expected growth for all income classes.

This study concluded that on a global scale, people’s concerns for unauthorized secondary use and improper access of their personal information have increased, and that for a general/student population in a general/online context the overall concerns for information privacy have increased in the US. A follow-up study into the antecedents of people’s concerns for information privacy concluded that MacKenzie’s certainty trough applies also to people’s knowledge of personal data collection and usage, and concern for information privacy. A significant conceptual model was developed to further explain this relation with respect to other determinants. Several relations between demographics and CFIP were found, for example between the highest level of education, financial stability and household income per household member and the CFIP construct. Several human values also seemed to be of significance with respect to the CFIP. A final study tested the extent to which these findings can be explained by the spheres of informational justice theory. Evidence was found that the theory only applies to the governmental, medical and educational spheres and not to the commercial and financial spheres, indicating a clear discrepancy between the public and private domains. The salience of sub-spheres and the influence of the consequences of an exchange of personal data on its perceived appropriateness were also proven. This study led to the conclusion that public and especially private organisations should take steps to address the increasing concerns for information privacy to mitigate any adverse effects.","concerns for information privacy; spheres of informational justice; information privacy; privacy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-01-27","Technology, Policy and Management","Ethics/Philosophy of Technology","","Management of Technology","",""

New applications based on these data are rapidly being developed and can help to solve societal problems. One of these new applications to solve societal problems, is to use energy data to quantitatively help decision makers in the urban energy planning. As a result lowering the carbon emissions of cities. One of these developments is implemented in the EU TRANFORM project, where they develop an energy decision support tool (DST) based on actual city data. However in the energy domain the available open data is limited and highly valued datasets, such as fine grained consumption data and building information, are often unavailable as open data. Therefore this research focussed on the barriers that energy data owners experience to release their fine grained energy data. Based on these barriers recommendations were formulated to the European Union on how to improve the number of available datasets. To investigate these barriers, three actor groups in the TRANSFORM project have been examined, using six cities as case studies. In total six European Distribution System Operators (DSO) and five European municipalities were interviewed for this research, as they were identified as owners of highly desired data. Furthermore, two knowledge providers were asked to share their experiences regarding re-using open energy data. The respondents were asked to share their barriers to release their energy data as open data. From the respondents it became clear that many feared privacy issues, but also the costs proved to be a major hampering factor. Further we found that the competitive market also prevented many actors from sharing data. Between the cases we found that in Amsterdam the DSO as well as the municipality have a positive attitude towards sharing data. For Copenhagen, Lyon and Genoa this was not the case and we found a misalignment in their vision, and the DSO was unwilling to share energy data as open data. Based on these findings five mitigation strategies were made for the European Commission. From a small analysis two policies were chosen as most effective. First, we recommend to create guidelines to energy data owners on what they can release. Second, we advise to create a knowledge sharing platform where data owners can learn from others how they can release data.","open energy data; open data; barriers; energy data; recommendations open energy data; quantitative decision support tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","","",""

(mentor); Venkatesha Prasad, R. (mentor)","2015","The 60 GHz frequency band promises very high data rates { in the order of Gb/s { due to the availability of large amounts of bandwidth. High free- space path loss at the 60 GHz frequency band makes it necessary to employ beamforming capable directional antennas to confine signal power in the desired direction. When beamforming is used, the links are sensitive to misalignment in antenna directionality, due to the movement of devices. To identify and circumvent the misalignments, we propose to use motion sensors (i.e., accelerometer and gyroscope) which are already present in most modern mobile devices. By finding the extent of misaligned beams, corrective actions are carried out to reconfigure the antennas. Motion sensors in mobile devices provide means to estimate the extent of misalignments. We collected real data from motion sensors and steered the beams appropriately. The results from our study show that the sensors are capable of detecting the cause of the error as translational or rotational movements. Furthermore it is also shown that sensor data can be used to predict the next location of the user. This can be used to reconfigure the directional antenna to switch the antenna beam and hence avoid frequent link disruptions. This decreases the number of beam searches, thus lowering the MAC overhead.","60 GHz; wireless network; multi-Gbps; beamforming; sensors; mobility; prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Systems","","Embedded Software","",""

Most of these transactions are (part of) normal behaviour. On the other hand, some transactions are considered to be out of the ordinary. These anomalous events occur relatively infrequently (less than 10 per day). Employees, that try to find these anomalous events, combine the transactions data, historical knowledge of the anomalous events and their expertise to detect and quantify them. Several types of anomalies are considered to be interesting and so they are labelled. These anomalies need to be detected, so they can be prevented in the future. The employees try to find events similar to known anomalies. Characteristics of anomalies change over time and employees also need to detect this slightly changed, but similar, behaviour. It is not our goal to detect completely new types of anomalies. In this thesis, the focus lies on finding events similar to the known anomalies. In order to assist these employees, a model that uses the transaction data and incorporates known anomalous events is built. Our model is able to score new incoming transactions and use these to update the model parameters. The scores can be returned to the employees to assist them in finding transactions that are similar to a particular type of anomaly. The AdaGrad algorithm with diagonal matrices is used. Also, l1-regularization is used on the parameter to create a more sparse solution.","machine learning; supervised learning; online learning; AdaGrad; Adaptive Gradient Descent; l1 projection; fraud detection; anomaly detection; anonimized data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","Statistics","",""

Non-verbal communication between humans and robots has the potential to raise the current interaction level to a next stage. This study is a contribution to the field of emotion expression in robotics. Several parameters are known for influencing the emotional content of a movement in humans. In this study the influence of a changing virtual gravity parameter is investigated. Simulations were created of a virtual arm executing various daily tasks. Each task was executed under three different virtual gravity conditions: gravity vector pointing down, no gravity and gravity vector pointing up. On a website, a user study was created for people to rate the videos of the movement of a robotic arm in terms of its emotional content. The robotic arm performed ten different tasks. Two response tools were used for the participant to rate the videos: the AffectButton and the Self-Assessment Manikin. A total of 275 participants took part in the user study. The overall effect of gravity on the emotional content of the arm movement was found to be rather limited. However, in a number of cases a small significant effect was measured. Gravity had a small significant effect on dominance measured in the AffectButton: the arm movements, when the gravity vector was in the up and downward direction, were rated with a higher level of dominance than in the situation of no gravity. Also, gravity had a small significant effect on pleasure measured in the Self-Assessment Manikin: downward gravity resulted in a higher level of pleasure than in the neutral and upward case. The overall effect of task was generally more significant. When comparing individual tasks, significant difference were found on the ratings of the three variables pleasure, arousal and dominance, in both the AffectButton and the Self-Assessment Manikin.","Movement generation; robot motion; emotion; gravity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor)","2015","Annually over 60.000 people die and another 3.7 million get injured in car accidents in the United States and Europe combined. Automation of vehicles can reduce the number of accidents by 90%. Therefore, it is of great interest in academia and industry. For the automated vehicles that are being presented in industry however, proofs of safe performance are generally not found. Therefore, this thesis investigates approaches to automatically assess automated vehicle controller performance such as deviation overshoot and obtained lateral speeds. More specifically, this thesis studies so-called formal verification of the performance of a highway lane change controller. Because of its robustness properties, a Sliding Mode Control (SMC) strategy is selected and in this research several variations are designed. The availability of a lower level controller was assumed to generate the required steering torque, which results in a third order linear vehicle model. Nonlinear vehicle models with higher order dynamics were considered as well but showed to be too complex for the verification approach. Due to the switching nature of SMC, the closed loop system is modelled as a Hybrid System and as such verified using multiple verification packages. The abstraction based environment HSolver can provide full formal guarantees that account for intervals of parameter uncertainty, in this case initial deviation and lateral speed. However, in comparison with simulations using the Matlab Toolbox Breach–which only propagates distinct values and cannot provide formal guarantees for entire intervals–it suffers from a large over-approximation. Still, for a limited initial interval, HSolver analyses show that a SMC variant called Quasi Sliding Mode Control (QSMC) results in a safe lane change in terms of deviation overshoot. More advanced controllers show promising performance in Breach simulations. This suggests that techniques to reduce the over-approximation in HSolver, or developments in similar tools, can be very interesting to verify safety for more general situations in future research. Alternatively, other performance criteria or different parametric uncertainties could be formally verified as well.","formal verification; sliding mode control; autonomous vehicles; automated driving; lane change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","DCSC","","","",""

Due to its capability to provide very detailed three-dimensional information on the structure of forests and individual trees it is very suitable to detect changes in forests. However, current change detection methods in this field often cannot exploit the full potential of the information. The increasing gap between the ability of these methods and the information available in increasingly denser airborne laser scanning data has led to this research. Therefore a three step approach is developed that aims to use the full three-dimensional information in the data to detect harvested and fallen trees in forests. First, differences in the repeated data are obtained through an adapted cloud-to-cloud comparison, such that the data can be reduced to the changed points only. Secondly, from the changed points the individual changed objects are extracted and finally classified as either removed trees or other objects. The findings show that harvested and fallen trees can be detected with an overall accuracy of up to 94% and an omission error of 0%. The results further indicate that smaller trees and changes below the canopy can be identified, although with lower success rates. All in all, it can be seen that the potential of the three-dimensional nature can be better exploited by considering each individual point of the data.","airborne laser scanning; lidar; change detection; forestry; harvested trees; segmentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","Geomatics","","51.942470, 4.524091"

(mentor); Ashrafi, B. (mentor)","2015","Recent advances in nanocomposites based on conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have led to investigations of using CNT networks as strain sensors. When CNTs are incorporated into a polymer matrix to form electrical networks, the developed conductive nanocomposite becomes sensitive to strain, thus a linear correlation can be found between strain change and electrical conductivity change (i.e., piezoresitivity). To produce reliable nanocomposite sensors, environmental effects, such as humidity, have to be considered. Humidity is one of the most significant environmental factors, because it is present in most environments. Furthermore, polymers and especially epoxies are known to absorb moisture, which affects the electrical conductivity of developed nanocomposites. Humidity therefore can have a larger effect compared to strain on the electrical conductivity, reducing the reliability of the strain sensor. The present study focuses on the understanding on the effect of the humidity and strain on electrical conductivity of CNT-modified epoxy. Experiments were performed and a mathematical model in Matlab was developed to predict these effects. When compared, a conclusion can be drawn about the usefulness of CNT-modified epoxy as humidity sensors or as a strain sensor outside a controlled environment. An aerospace-grade epoxy (EPON 828) and Multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) were used for the fabrication of nanocomposites. Experiments involved measuring current while nanocomposites specimens containing different amounts of MWCNTs were exposed to humidity. Similarly, nanocomposites with the same weight percentages of CNTs were subjected to strain while electrical conductivity was monitored. Results suggested that a 2nd order polynomial relationship between humidity and resistance existed, and a linear relationship between strain and resistance. A comparison between experiments and modelling suggest a good agreement as the magnitude of change in conductivity was in the same order of magnitude. Also, a comparison between the results of the humidity and strain suggest that the resistance increase of the nanocomposite due to humidity was four times higher than the resistance increase due to strain. If designed properly, the sensitivity of the electrical resistance of the nanocomposites developed in this study can be used for humidity sensing applications. However, the application of such nanocomposites for strain sensors is limited to the cases in which the correction to humidity change is applied to the sensor.","CNT; epoxy; humidity; strain; experimental; numerical; Matlab","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-23","Aerospace Engineering","Mechanics, Aerospace Structures & Materials","","Structural Integrity","",""

In this procedure catchment scale evaporation is related to some form of potential evaporation, determined with point scale meteorological data. The main criticism is that the potential evaporation is not representative for the catchment and that spatio-temporal dynamics in vegetation cannot appropriately be expressed with the time-invariant, spatially lumped model parameters in the above mentioned procedure. Using remotely sensed observations, catchment scale estimates on evaporation and vegetation dynamics can be derived. It is hypothesized that by integrating remotely sensed evaporation estimates and additional information on vegetation dynamics in conceptual rainfall-runoff models, we can get more insight into the realism of the modelled evaporation flux and the role of vegetation dynamics. With a more realistic representation of evaporation, the water partitioning can be modelled more accurately, eventually improving our understanding of the catchment behaviour. The way the evaporation estimates can be used depends on the spatial and temporal resolution and the reliability of the products. The hypothesis is tested in the well studied Ourthe catchment, located in Belgium. The climate is Atlantic temperate, the streamflow is characterized by a quick response. Vegetation dynamics in both space and time are investigated in a principal component analysis on multi year MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. Areas with similar temporal dynamics are distinguished. The most important temporal dynamics are related to phenology and agricultural growing reasons. Areas with an increasing trend in NDVI are identified as well, but the spatial extent is too small to be relevant for hydrological applications. In a validation study three remotely sensed evaporation products are examined in terms of their reliability and applicability in conceptual models, namely EARS (daily, 4km x 9km), WACMOS (daily, clear days, 1km x 1km) and MOD16 (8-daily, 1km x 1km). EARS and WACMOS are surface energy balance models, based on land surface temperature observations. MOD16 uses the Penman-Monteith equation, with distributed surface characteristics and a Jarvis-like approach to calculate the surface resistance. The remotely sensed products are validated with ground measurements of evaporation from five eddy covariance towers and - if applicable - with a multi year water balance analysis. Mainly based on the water balance analysis, we concluded that the EARS product gives relatively accurate evaporation estimates and can be used in the last step of the research. WACMOS (SEBS) was shown to have an extremely poor correlation between the remotely sensed evaporative fraction and the evaporative fraction determined from eddy covariance measurements and was not further considered. MOD16, often criticized for not taking into account soil moisture constraints on evaporation, did deviate from EC measurements in the growing season, but this was shown not to be related to limited soil moisture. The main drawback of MOD16 in relatively moist climates such as the Ourthe catchment, seems to be the application of constant canopy conductance and the large scale of the meteorological input data. Catchment scale evaporation appeared to be slightly underestimated, which may be attributed to the fact that interception is neglected in this version of the product. In the last step of the research, i.e. confronting a water balance model with the ancillary data on vegetation dynamics and remotely sensed evaporation, the hypothesis is further specified. Lead by the spatio-temporal resolution of the EARS product, EARS evaporation (ERS,EARS) is used as forcing of a daily lumped conceptual model. Disadvantage of the coarse spatial resolution and the lumped modelling approach, is that the link between vegetation dynamics and evaporation cannot be made. This is left for further research. In a comparative modelling approach i) the realism of the conventional procedure to determine evaporation is examined, and ii) we investigate whether by imposing ERS,EARS on the model, a more realistic representation of the water partitioning can be simulated. Three models are compared: FLEXEp with the conventional procedure to determine evaporation, FLEXEp,RS also forced with potential evaporation, but determined from the catchment average net radiation, and FLEXE, forced with RS,EARS. The hypothesis is that especially the seasonal dynamics in streamflow generation can be better simulated by FLEXE. This was not the case. It was shown that the evaporation modelled with the conventional conceptualization of the evaporation flux (FLEXEp), is fundamentally different from the EARS remotely sensed evaporation estimates (ERS,EARS). Yet in terms of streamflow simulation, FLEXEp outperforms (FLEXE), especially in spring and autumn. Furthermore, parameter identifiability was shown not to be better for FLEXE than for FLEXEp. These results indicate that either the EARS product is not as accurate as we expected, or that the lumped conceptual model does not represent the dominant processes occurring in the catchment. Assuming the latter, this can be explained by i) a too complex model with too many degrees of freedom as the limited parameter identifiability indicates, ii) an erroneous representation of the dominant processes or a wrong hypothesis on the occurring dominant processes and iii) the level of aggregation of evaporation and other hydrological processes is too high and the model too simple to be representative for the heterogeneous catchment. To look further into the latter, we suggest the combined use of topography driven semi-distributed models and the patterns in vegetation as derived by the PCA analysis. Although we assumed the EARS product to reliably estimate the catchment scale evaporation, there are some unexplained issues. Forest evaporation seems te be overestimated by the EARS product, whereas in the water balance analysis the catchment scale evaporation appears to be in the right order of magnitude. If the overprediction indeed is the case, somewhere in the catchment or at some time evaporation is underestimated. Furthermore on clear days in winter, evaporation tends to be zero according to the parametrization of the EARS product, which is not observed by the eddy covariance measurements. It is recommended to further look into the parameterization of the EARS algorithm especially during the changing seasons.","evaporation; remote sensing; hydrological models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-03-09","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Hydrology","",""

(mentor); Martin, C.L. (mentor)","2015","If we look at the energy consumption of a household we see transport is number one. Open areas in a downtown area are not easy to find, which explains the long travel distance people make. Old harbors are located in the center of a city on the other hand are mostly wasteland. The rea- son is that the area has a high flood risk because it is located outside the dike.To develop housing in such areas they need to be built in a climate adaptive way that overcomes the problem of flooding. Urban The urban plan had a few criteria that were taken into account. Minimizing the size of jetties, maximizing the number of houses, creating parking places and making the plan fire proof were the main points. Fitting as many houses as possible in the plan would make the financial aspects more convincing. Ensuring the fire safety of the plan means there are always two ways to escape, hence the circular infrastruc- ture. This plan brings all aspects together to provide a stable and realistic base for the architectural design at the meso scale. Climate The house is using the sun and the water to regulate the indoor climate during all seasons. There are active and passive en- ergy systems integrated in the design. The active energy system are PV cells integrat- ed in glass, PVT panels, heat recover y units, floor heating/cooling, rainwater collectors and in the bottom of the concrete box is a system of pipes positioned to transfer heat and cold with the ambient water. The passive energy systems contributed to the shape and orientation of the design. Thermal mass on the North side for cool- ing during summer, thermal mass on the South side for absorbing deep penetrat- ing sunlight during winter, wind cowls, thick insulation and good crack sealing are the main passive aspects.The green roofs lead to a gradual discharge of rainwater, provide better isolation, increase rooftop protec- tion durability, provide compensation for lack of green in cities and help purify from fine dust. Another great passive aspect is the incoming light which is reflected from the water to the ceiling what gives a beau- tiful visual experience. Construction The homes are composed of 3 elements: - The concrete box functions as the float- ing part -The timber frame lowers the center of gravity - The glasshouse is used for regulating the climate These three elements together lead to an architecturally, technically and aesthetically interesting design.The elaboration of the details proved that the design could be constructed flawlessly. The homes are designed as two-under- one-roofs.After being transported independently to their location they will be connected to increase the stability and decrease the obliquity. The main goal “Designing a climate adaptive, energy efficient and sustainable house” has been achieved because of the good integration between the macro, meso and micro scale in this design.","Climate; construction; Design; Adaptation; Floating; Energy; Efficient; Urban; Jetty; Rotterdam; Rijnhaven; Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","S.W.A.T.

(mentor)","2015","“Zen Play“ is a graduation project that has been conducted to create a feedback system within the back-end part of a serious game, developed by Clicks and Links, to grade the energetic behavior of the users inside their houses. Its functioning comes together with the installation of a Smart Meter inside the residence. The aim of the “Zen play” project, through the support of the Serious game, is to involve and engage the player towards a better sustainable energetic behavior, by giving to the user a clear objective to reach every week including an active real-time feedback. Existing games and old theses proved not to work correctly when the aim was to calculate the scored points from a player, especially when connected to Smart meters like in this case. The main reason for this shortcoming is the multitude of variables that are not considered during the measurements. The energetic consumptions in a house can be divided in two groups: “HVAC”, which stands for “Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning“, and non-HVAC. The non-HVAC are the ones that are principally affected by users’ decisions and they represent the focus of this project. The huge majority of past years researches and improvements were made with HVAC appliances, since the biggest savings can be done with them. The consumption of these appliances depend both on the characteristics of dwellings and on their inhabitants’ behavior. The initial idea of this project, was to focus on changing the energy related habits of householders and, as long as the energy consumed with non-HVAC group is mainly affected by inhabitants’ actions and choices, focusing on these elements is the best way to teach people to have a more sustainable lifestyle. Within this second group, two factors proved to affect the consumption next to people behaviors: the number of inhabitants and the efficiency of the appliances. These variables are being translated into correction factors ranging from 0 to 1, defined as normalization, to help creating a fair score among the different users when they consume energy and interact with the game. The most efficient appliance will have a correction factor of 1, while the least will have a correction factor bigger than 0. The score is made by the relationship with the distance between an average consumption and the consumption perceived by the system, together with the distance between the same average consumption and the optimal consumption. The player is provided with a standard score and a one where the correction factor is applied. The Mpare system divides the analyses in single appliance or multiple appliances, and for this second group, the score is calculated through a weighted mean. The final score is calculated by adding the total consumption of the labeled and standard appliances, multiplied by the percentage of impact, minus the energy used during stand-by mode by all the appliances considered by the system. The aim is provide tips to optimize or correct the use of appliances grading the overall consumption and showing the daily, weekly or monthly CO2 footprint.","serious game; domestic appliances","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","Building Technology","",""

(mentor); Kotsonis, M. (mentor); Winkel, R. (mentor)","2015","An experimental study aimed at the influence of different barrier materials on the energy deposition of nanosecond pulsed dielectric barrier discharge (ns-DBD) plasma actuator was carried out. Additionally, the direct effect of the discharge of an ns-DBD plasma actuator on a low velocity laminar boundary layer was investigated. Three barrier materials were selected for this study. These were Kapton polyimide tape, silicone-rubber and fine polyamide PA2200. Schlieren imagery in quiescent conditions were conducted to visualize the effect of the thermal energy deposition. Particle Image Velocimitry (PIV) was used to obtain the induced velocity fields by a flush mounted ns-DBD plasma actuator with a two layer Kapton barrier in a laminar boundary layer. A backward-time backward-space finite difference discretization of the compressible continuity equation was proposed to quantify the density field disturbance by ns-DBD plasma actuator. Results of the barrier characterization study indicated that a thinner barrier of the same material will allow more thermal energy to be deposited to the air per discharge pulse. A comparison between disturbed density field area and electrical energy usage per pulse, showed that an ns-DBD plasma actuator with a Kapton barrier is the most efficient tested barrier for coupling electrical energy as thermal energy to the near wall volume of air. Additionally, both the structure of the density disturbance in the quiescent air and the plasma discharge structure itself (Figure 1) are strongly dependent on the barrier material. Results of the PIV tests on the effect of discharge by ns-DBD plasma actuator in a laminar boundary layer indicated the presence of small body force. This body force was directed from the grounded exposed electrode to the high voltage covered electrode. Moreover, this body force induced a vortex like disturbance in the boundary layer. Additionally, independent of the streamwise orientation of the ns-DBD plasma actuator electrodes, an increase in energy input results in a local decrease in density. A larger area of density field disturbance was observed for the results were the body force was directed opposite to the freestream flow. It can be concluded that a barrier used in an ns-DBD plasma actuator should have a low thickness, high electrical volume resistivity, low thermal capacitance and low heat capacity in order to efficiently deposit heat to the nearby air. Additionally, based on the density field disturbances in laminar boundary layer flow, the orientation of the ns-DBD plasma actuator (thus the direction of the body force) is able to enhance the impact of the thermal energy deposition through better distribution through the boundary layer.","thermal energy deposition; ns-DBD; plasma actuators; PIV; Schlieren","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics and Wind energy","","Aerodynamics","",""

And in particular, how to build the resiliency of urban environments to the effects of climate change and increased urbanization? This is one of the main challenges that urban planners are dealing with today. The relevance of this issue is reflected in the large number of cities around the globe that have recently developed climate adaptation strategies. These plans set out policies to build the capacity of vulnerable areas to withstand and bounce back from external disturbances; build their resiliency. In Delta cities the particular focus lies on improved water management and limiting the negative impacts of increased flooding. The study observes the actions public and private development actors are currently taking in New York City (NYC) in the United States, and the Dutch port city of Rotterdam. What policies have the planning authorities of these two cities adopted to stimulate the building of flood resiliency of in the process of area development? And how do these policies affect behavior of actors in development areas along the waterfront? The motivation behind the international comparison is to examine the effect that factors of the socio-political environment, the institutional landscape, have on the workings of these policies. In both NYC and Rotterdam a case study is conducted on a particular waterfront area. In addition to the literature study and document analysis, multiple semi-structured interviews have been conducted with planning and water management experts, city authorities and local actors. This has resulted in valuable insights in the process of development and incorporation of flood resiliency measures. The findings of this study contribute to the body of knowledge regarding this process of adaptation and, more specifically, building urban resiliency. Outcomes provide understanding in the influence of the institutional landscape on building this flood resiliency in the process of urban area development. Findings point to several aspects of the institutional landscape that affect the effectiveness of public policies. Insight into these aspects can help urban authorities to increase the effectiveness of their policy instruments. The findings furthermore allow for the formulation of recommendations for improving policy effectiveness. The recommendations are aimed at city authorities in both NYC and Rotterdam, as well as other cities that are trying to build their resiliency.","Flood resiliency; Institunional Landscape; Urban area development; Planning Policy Instrument; Comparative case-study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Master Real Estate & Housing","","Urban Adaptation Strategies","",""

In this thesis we research robustness in Partial Order Schedules, which represent sets of solutions for instances of the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem. They can be generated using a greedy procedure called Chaining, which can be easily adapted to use various heuristics. We use an empirical method to gain understanding of robustness and how the chaining procedure adds to this. Based on the findings of an exploratory study we develop three models, each capturing aspects of robustness on a different level. The first model describes how a single activity is affected by various disturbances. The second model predicts how structural properties of Partial Order Schedules can reduce the effect of these disturbances. The third model describes how heuristics for the chaining procedure can influence these properties. Using experimental evaluation, we found that the model is not complete. Experimental results did conform to the expectations set by the third model, but not of the second model. We therefore suspect that it is too simplistic for accurate predictions, but since it does match earlier observations we believe it is a good starting point for further understanding.","scheduling; RCPSP; robustness; Resource Constraint Project Scheduling Problem; project scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","Information Security is an important aspect of decision making in organisations today. Organisations use Information Security Risk Management to assess, respond to and monitor risk to its information systems. Information systems are complex technical systems and the management of Information Security depends on technology, processes and people. Incident Response Teams are set up to manage cyber incidents. However, the increasing trends in incidents reported, indicate that these controls are failing to achieve their goals, because, these controls primarily focus on information available after the occurrence of an incident. Despite the efforts in Information Security Risk Management, organisations are unable to implement effective Information Security controls based on dynamic information. In order for organisations to effectively mitigate risk, there is a need to also focus on incident prevention along with incident response practiced today. Therefore, in this research, we assess the Technical, Institutional and Process aspects of risk management and incident response process, using TIP Design for socio-technical systems. This is a systematic, design-oriented way of analysing the current state of organisation’s information system security. We conclude that the process is retrospective and unable to proactively prevent incidents, thereby Information Security controls lag incidents. Furthermore, precursors, i.e. information available before the incident occurs, are not effectively used to prevent incidents. The research goal, “How can an incident prevention process be developed to proactively use information available to complement Information Security Risk Management in organisations?” will be answered in this research. We structure this research using the Design Science Research Cycle. With the various requirements, generated from the analysis of the risk management and incident response process, we generate design ingredients. Firstly, we use precursors to determine the information available before the incident. Secondly, we use the concepts of trigger, template and twitch from Vigilant Information Systems and extend it with tweak, to interpret the information. Finally, this research proposes to establish “The Incident Prevention Team” to bridge the gap described in Information Security Risk Management. In this research, we use the Incident Response Lifecycle and extend it by developing the incident prevention process followed by the Incident Prevention Team in the preparation phase of this lifecycle. The Incident Prevention Team assesses the current Information Security status of the organisation using information affecting external organisations. The Incident Prevention Team scans and then prioritises the most relevant information for the risk assessment process. It then performs an Information Security risk assessment of the information system affected and finally recommends control strategies to the management. The incident prevention process was evaluated using two scenarios and by an interview with an Information Security expert. The validation encourages us to conclude that the proposed Incident Prevention Team and the incident prevention process provide a proactive method to achieve Information Security in organisations. The main limitation of this research is the lack of empirical testing, which is an opportunity for further research. Organisations can easily incorporate the Incident Prevention Team to fulfil both its strategic and operational requirements of Information Security Risk Management. By establishing the Incident Prevention Team, it creates an agile and structured process within the organisation to understand the risk to both the internal and external environment proactively. Therefore, the Incident Prevention Team will transform the organisation’s incident response process from being reactive to proactive, thereby making the organisation resilient against potential cyber incidents. This research contributes to the existing field of Information Security research, with the focus on Incident Prevention by scanning for precursors. We further combine, the elements of “trigger”, “template”, “twitch” and extends it by “tweak” to structure incident information. This also offers new ways for Information Security professionals to interpret information.","Information Security; Risk Assessment; Incident Response; Incident Prevention","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

The question is if there is a place for a collection of kitchen utensils that could serve its purpose in the kitchen, as well as on the dining table. It is not uncommon that people use their kitchen utensils for serving. But nobody really appreciates the aesthetics of their current kitchen utensils. They are seen as purely utilitarian and do not contribute to the mood of the dining table. The graduation project results into two product proposals: Gravity and Spin. Gravity is a collection of six kitchen utensils and a holder. The design language is inspired by the old works of Koninklijke Van Kempen & Begeer. It is made from assorted materials and has different lengths corresponding to the functionality of each utensil.

(mentor); Taneja, P. (mentor); Slinger, J.H. (mentor); Rijks, D.C. (mentor)","2015","The world population is growing. Together with the population, the need for resources is growing, as is the need for the transportation of these resources. A significant part is carried out through marine transport, directly relating to the increasing need for port development. All over the world, a shift increasingly occurs towards applying sustainable measures. The combination of these events, results in the context of this research: Sustainable port development. This research entails the search for an implementation strategy for sustainable port development: An 'ecosystem-based port design approach' is devised. This approach is applied working top-down, with a division on three levels; system, construction and material level. The focus of this research is set on the implementation of sustainability in the design-phase of a port development, targeting sustainable measures at the system level. The ecosystem-based design approach (EBDA) is based on existing philosophies (e.g. Building with Nature) and adopts theories from a PIANC-report on Sustainable Ports [Vellinga et al., 2014]. Ecosystem services are used for the evaluation of the approach. The approach consists of five steps: (1) Understanding the system, (2) Designing alternatives, (3) Modelling alternatives, (4) Evaluating alternatives and (5) Final design. In order to develop and test the approach, a case study is executed. The port development project at Tema, Ghana is selected as most suitable to serve as a test case for the application of the approach. Steps one through five are applied to the case and this thesis shows the difficulties, challenges, strengths and opportunities that are encountered along the way. For the case study, potential measures are developed during a brainstorm session. Five measures are investigated by means of analytical studies and a hydrodynamic model (Delft3D). The focus is set on one measure: the beneficial re-use of dredged material from the port basin and approach channel. Using the dredged material, a nourishment is redesigned to maximise its lifetime and to minimise the sediment transport rates. The sediment transport rates are predicted using Delft3D and by inter-comparing the ecosystem-based nourishment design to the design as proposed by Boskalis, a revision is proposed. The reclaimed area is enlarged and the lifetime doubled. The final design for Tema consists of a revision of the nourishment, includes possibilities for lagoon development, contains open possibilities for the development of a so-called 'plastic trap' and proposes to use the Building with Nature seabed landscaping technique in the offshore dredging activities. The measure that entailed preventive dredging of a scour hole is dropped, as model results show small sediment transport rates over the breakwater into the port area. The potential gain consequently diminished and the measure is excluded from the final design. In the evaluation, the ecosystem-based design is compared to the traditional design that is used as the starting-point for the approach. Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges are compared in a so-called SWOC-analysis, wherein the ecosystem services are used as indicators (economy, ecology, society). For this case study, the ecosystem-based design shows improvement on all aspects of the ecosystem. The application of the EBDA at Tema, Ghana results in a more sustainable port. The process of applying the EBDA is also evaluated and lessons learned are derived. Finally, the approach itself is evaluated. Concluding this research, the ecosystem-based design approach is considered to be an effective approach to reach a more sustainable design in the initial phase of port development. For future applications, great potential is expected in the development of sustainable ports. Further development of the EBDA can be achieved by structurally applying the approach to different phases of port development, in different areas over the world, for varying functionality of ports and for different users. By comparing differences and similarities, a generally applicable approach can be developed. Eventually, a practical framework can be constructed, containing sustainable measures that are applicable to specific port development projects.","sustainable port development; ecosystem-based design; Delft3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Ports & Waterways","",""

(mentor); Verstraete, H.R.G.W. (mentor)","2015","The acquisition of high resolution images is essential for the early detection of eye diseases. To acquire such high resolution images, it is necessary to correct for monochromatic aberrations introduced by the imaging system and the eye itself. Currently, adaptive optics systems are used to correct these aberrations and thereby achieve a higher resolution. Most of these adaptive optics systems make use of a Deformable Mirror (DM) for wavefront correction and a Shack Hartmann (SH) sensor for measuring the wavefront. The use of such a complex setup has some disadvantages. Firstly, a part of the light beam has to be diverted to the SH sensor, which decreases the signal-to-noise ratio and increases the chance of introducing extra aberrations. This can result in correcting aberrations, which are not present in the imaging light path or vice versa. In this thesis a novel low-cost optical system with a developed toolbox for control is presented to correct for these large lower order aberrations. The optical setup consists of a tunable liquid defocus lens for defocus correction and two rotational cylindrical lenses for astigmatism correction. The lens-based correctors are relatively cheap and the lower order correction (LOC) toolbox only needs a wavefront sensor once for calibration of the system, but after calibration the system can correct aberrations without a priori knowledge of the wavefront. The toolbox also addresses the problem of the defocus and astigmatism correction being dependent on each other.The complete system has been tested and shows promising results. The performance of thesystem has been compared with a not yet released defocus and astigmatism corrector developed by Varioptic with the same correction range, but the system presented here outperforms that system significantly.","wavefront; correction; sensorless; defocus; astigmatism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-02-28","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Embedded Systems","",""

Since a turbulent boundary layer has a better capability to withstand the adverse pressure gradient that is inherent to the incident shock wave when compared to a laminar boundary layer, it is beneficial to have a turbulent boundary layer at the interaction.

A constant Mach 10 flight has been performed, optimising for flight time, whilst maintaining a large Reynolds number range, in which transition occurs (Retrans = 106). Hyperion-2 is a theoretical experimental vehicle studied at Delft University of Technology. The aerodynamic coefficients of Hyperion-2 in the previous study have been obtained using a modified Newtonian panel method. In present thesis, the aerodynamic coefficients are computed using an open source computational fluid dynamics software called SU2 (Stanford University Unstructured). Simple geometries have been used to verify and validate the solver, focusing on shock position and shape, pressure distribution and heat flux. Using an open source mesh generator called GMSH, a three dimensional unstructured grid of Hyperion-2 has been generated. With this grid, the aerodynamic database consisting of 120 combinations of Mach number and angles of attack has been created.

(mentor)","2015","Due to the necessity of more sources of renewable wind generated energy, the number of wind turbines in the Netherlands has grown in the past. Unfortunately, big sizes and movements of the blades negatively impact ground-based Doppler radars in the form of Doppler clutter. Such clutter leads to a downgrade of the surveillance radar performance in airplanes and precipitation detection, their parameters estimation. Our goal is to characterize and possibly eliminate the Doppler clutter from the wind turbine, where polarization is used as an important tool to reach this goal. As Doppler frequency and polarization are key characteristics for this study, a theoretical model based on these characteristics is built to predict the behavior of the rotated rotor blades of the wind turbine which shows promising results for amplitude and phase analysis. To evaluate this model, real measurements have been done with the PARSAX radar, which gives possibility to represent the wind turbine data in Doppler-range domain or Doppler-time domain in terms of amplitudes and phases of all four elements of the polarization scattering matrix. Using orthogonal LFMwaveforms for simultaneous polarimetric measurements, despite of huge benefits, has one serious drawback a different residual phases in different polarimetric channels. Testing and analysis of a few algorithms, the use of zero Doppler frequency range profile of phases with different algorithms of phase unwrapping, for their estimation and compensation did not result, unfortunately, in reliable compensation of residual phases. As a result, the analysis of wind turbines clutter has been focused on analysis of amplitude polarization characteristics only. For an experimental study a wind turbine was selected, which is located in Zoeterwoude near a highway. Such location allows to observe scattering from wind turbine and automotive targets simultaneously at the same range distance, with the possibility of data comparison. The goal of data analysis is to find polarimetric features, which for both types of targets behave differently, there is a possibility to eliminate the clutter from the wind turbine only. For comparative analysis, the absolute terms of the averaged covariance matrix are used in terms of 2D histograms to find differences between the wind turbine and automotive targets. This is done for consecutive time frames, where the results show different and similar behavior depending on the time frame. Another approach is to obtain and compare the so called target Euler parameters, which are related to a physical of the specific target to extend our study, a few polarimetric decomposition techniques (Pauli and H/®) are used to study feasibility of targets classification. Using comparative analysis with the covariance matrix, shows great potential with correlation coefficient algorithms in combination with polarization. The results are promising, but vary as the correlation coefficient highly depends on the vehicle and the orientation angle of the blades. The results of direct estimation of Euler parameters and the H/® decomposition both show differences between vehicles and blades and therefore potential in distinguishing both targets. Though, the results are affected by the residual phase and therefore additional research is recommended on this problem for better reliability.","radar; polarimetry; Doppler; PARSAX; wind turbines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microwave Sensing, Signals and Systems","","Electrical Engineering - Telecommunication","",""

Each flood defence system along the river Meuse needs to be provided with a safety level with an annual failure probability of 1/250. In the nearby future a new safety philosophy will be introduced, entailing new safety norms and calculations techniques. The water board needs to construct levees including the knowledge of this new safety philosophy. Additionally the water board faces more problems like limited space or an intense infrastructure around the current levees. The objective of this MSc-thesis is to investigate which balance between levee investments and robustness is most cost-effective during the levee design alternative analysis, specified for cases along the river Meuse in Limburg. Robustness within this balance is related to the uncertainties in future hydraulic boundary conditions. Life Cycle Cost Analysis or LCCA is a widely acknowledged technique to support the alternative analysis. One of the methods is the so called Net Present Value (NPV) calculations which include investments as well as benefits. This method suits perfectly to investigate the robustness and the effect of hydraulic boundary condition uncertainties to the alternative analysis. Within this research three different hydraulic boundary condition uncertainty aspects are analysed: The uncertainty in future river widening projects, the uncertainty in statistics and the uncertainty in forecasted climate changes. Two case studies are assessed along the river Meuse in Limburg; Location Arcen and Venlo. For both cases, levees alternatives are defined designed and screened. The resulting alternatives are analysed on their LCC. The cost-effective levee designs along the river Meuse in Limburg are robust in terms of height and are designed with the requirements of the new safety philosophy. LCCA is an appropriate tool to investigate levee design alternatives on a cost-effective manner. Accounting project investments only lead to an unfair alternative analysis. Including uncertainties in hydraulic boundary conditions during the alternative analysis does not lead to another outcome. These uncertainties do contribute to the investigation of the optimal levee height robustness.","Levee; Robustness; Meuse; Life-Cycle cost analysis; LCCA; Uncertainty; Arcen; Venlo; Flood defence; hydraulic boundary conditions; Net Present Value; Cost-effectiveness; levee alternatives","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","51.474174, 6.177379"

(mentor); Opiyo, E.Z. (mentor); Kloppers, G. (mentor)","2015","Ferro Techniek specializes in the use of enameling techniques in heating elements for consumer and industrial applications. They distinguish themself by delivering customized sub-assemblies for consumer products in the form of Thick Film Heaters (TFHs). These TFHs are used in several consumer products like Nespresso machines, food processors, steam ovens, and many others. The TFHs are flat heating elements that consist of a stainless steel plate, an enamel layer, and a printed electrical circuit protected by a glass insulating layer. The current development of these thick film heaters requires a large amount of prototype and testi iterations, taking up valuable time. Ferro Techniek wants to improve the current product development process by reducing the amount of iterations in the development process and shortening the duration of a project. TFHs are more expensive than the competing heating technologies, but offer benefits that other heating solution cannot, such as a very high power density, compact size and high energy efficiency. These benefits allow designers of consumer goods to design with more freedom and produce more energy efficient products, design aspects which are especially important in the high-end of the market. A very important trend in the consumer goods market is the shortening of the product life cycle caused by consumers who expect original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to shorten the time between new product introductions. Ferro Techniek, as supplier of heating elements to these OEMs can improve its market position by shortening its own development time. The current development process roughly exists of four stages; initiation, study, development and implementation. Mainly during the study and development stages, there are many design iterations needed to obtain a proof of working principle under operating and extreme conditions. Two case studies of recent product development processes show that the total development time of one heating element can take up to 3 years and it shows what kind of technical challenges occur. The introduction of simulation in the form of a finite element analysis of the TFH to the current development process, especially in the study and development stages, can partially replace the iterations needed in the development process and reduce development duration. To be able to simulate the TFHs, the production process is analyzed, because it causes an initial deformation and stress in the enameled plates. A method for determining the elasticity of the enamel is presented, because suppliers of enamel do not supply any. The bond between enamel and metal is also studied from literature, but could only be defined in a general way, because there is currently no qualitative method of determining the bond strength. Also, anisotropic behavior of the metal substrate is studied to be able to obtain material specification for the input of the simulation. With the results for the enamel’s elasticity, the metals anisotropic behavior and the bond between the two materials defined, a number of square test plates have been simulated and validated, and subsequently the TFH plates. From these plates, the pre-stress and deformation, caused by a difference in thermal expansion of both materials, could be determined. The stress profile show that it is most likely that the enamel will fail during usage at the edges of the plates, due to a lower compressive pre-stress at those points. The thin layered structure of the TFH required a high amount of elements in the mesh, which requires high computing power to solve the simulations. A transient thermal analysis is used as a thermal load input for a transient structural analysis, but due to the lack of computing power available during this project, no conclusions about the deformation and stress development in the usages of a TFH can currently be made or validated. The study does however show a method of simulating and evaluating the TFHs usage, which can in the future be executed by a specialized external company. Two major conclusions can be drawn from redesigning the product development process with simulations. The first is that implementing simulation can be seen as an additional problem solving strategy next to the current deduction strategy (e.g. formalized knowledge of laws of physics) and induction strategy (knowledge obtained from testing and prototyping). The second conclusion is that the benefits of simulations go further than the obvious time saving, i.e.; (1) Experiment new and non-conventional possibilities and designs (2) Gain insights in physical properties that otherwise cannot be measured, like internal stress development (3) Discover relations between design parameters (4) Clearly communicate test results By adding simulations to the development process, Ferro Techniek can improve and shorten their development time, possibly find new heating solutions and thereby improve their market position.","simulation; finite element analysis; enamel; product development process; enameling; thick film heaters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Coenders, J.L. (mentor); Kasbergen, C. (mentor); Doomen, R.M.J. (mentor)","2015","As fossil fuel reserves are rapidly being depleted, sustainable alternatives have to be found to fulfil the world's energy demand. Numerous concepts have been proposed to generate electricity by harnessing renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power. One of these concepts is the the so-called solar updraft tower (SUT). The SUT consists of three elements: a solar air collector, wind turbines and a chimney. The taller the chimney, the larger the stack effect and thus the more energy which can be generated by the turbines. The proposed concepts for this chimney schematise it as a reinforced concrete cylindrical shell, with the bottom half shaped like a hyperboloid and the top half as a flared cylinder, outfitted with ten stiffening rings evenly distributed over the height. Chimneys as tall as 1500m have been proposed, and, previous research shows that these tall structures have very low eigenfrequencies which come very close to the peak of the wind power spectrum. This makes them extremely vulnerable to resonance induced by storm actions. Two types of resonance can be distinguished in these structures; along-wind resonance, and across-wind resonance. Along-wind resonance is caused by turbulence in along-wind gusts. The second type, across-wind resonance, is caused by the alternating shedding of vortices. This leads to pulsating excitation forces in the across-wind direction, and, if the frequency of the vortex shedding is the same as one of the eigenfrequencies of the chimney, resonance will occur. In this thesis, a finite element model is created based on a pre-existing design. This so-called base model is then analysed to determine which key problem areas could benefit from improvement. The analyses show that especially the first two eigenfrequencies are critical for along-wind resonance as well as across-wind resonance. These eigenfrequencies are seen as two individual problem areas as improvements to one eigenfrequency not necessarily guarantee improvements to the second eigenfrequency. Furthermore, tension on the windward side leads to cracks in the stiffening rings which negatively influence the eigenfrequencies and thus the dynamic response. The last area which could benefit from optimisation is the cost of the chimney; an optimal solution does not use more material than necessary. A design tool called SUMAT (Solar Updraft Modal Analysis Tool) is created which enables the user to analyse multiple chimney configurations at once, subsequently being able to compare their results. Various sensitivity analyses are carried out to determine the influence of geometric and material parameters on the four key problem areas of the chimney. A multi-objective optimisation process is followed to optimise each of the key problem areas, ie. objective functions, by hand. The first step in optimising the structure is to subdivide the parameters which were researched into four categories, depending on their usefulness. The second step consists of gradually introducing these parameter changes into the base model. The optimisation process revealed that the objective functions can be maximised as follows: increasing the moment of inertia of the rings by changing their aspect ratio ensures that the chimney is fully loaded in compression. An increase in the throat height further improves the reduction of tension on the windward side and the first eigenfrequency. A reduction in wall thickness at the top of the chimney improves the first eigenfrequency while also reducing material use. Lastly, it appears that the stiffening rings at the bottom serve little to no purpose. Removing them leads to a reduction in material use while some of the material gained can be used to increase the dimensions of the top rings, consequently improving the second eigenfrequency and reducing tension. More thorough analyses revealed that the optimisation process has indeed led to an overall improved structure when compared to the original base model. While along-wind resonance does not pose as great a threat as was initially assumed, due to the influence of aerodynamic admittance, the results do show that the improved eigenfrequencies led to a smaller increase in deflection as a result of dynamic wind action. Vortex shedding also no longer poses a threat as the improved second eigenfrequency resulted in critical wind speeds which are much larger than could ever occur at the chosen reference location. Future optimisations should therefore focus more heavily on the second eigenfrequency than on the first, assuming that the accompanying mode shapes stay the same.","optimisation; solar updraft tower; reinforced concrete; shell; ndct; finite element analysis; chimney; parametric analysis; random vibrations; ANSYS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

(mentor)","2015","In the past couple of decades, the offshore wind industry has developed from applications in shallow water to ever deeper, more remote locations with harsher environments. In these progressively larger water depths, bottom founded support structures become no longer applicable and floating support structures could provide a viable alternative. Various studies have focused on floater designs for this application and multiple prototypes have been developed. However, no research has been done on the interaction of floating support structures with ice. In this thesis, the effect of level ice conditions on the dynamics of floating offshore wind turbines is studied. The MIT-NREL TLP is used as reference floater design. Based on the structure’s motions and mooring loads, a comparison is made between ice structure interaction and wave loading in harsh open water conditions. The combined floater and turbine arrangement is modelled in a rigid body approach, with three degrees of freedom (surge, heave and pitch). The system’s non-linear restoring stiffness is defined from contributions of its mooring system and hydrostatics. Hydrodynamic characteristics from fluid-structure interaction are derived with Ansys AQWA in frequency domain and transformed to time domain for the performed simulations. Wind and wave loading are covered, taking into account irregular wind velocity and wave height. Ice structure interaction is simulated for both failure of ice in crushing and bending modes. Ice crushing failure is simulated by the application of a Matlock-Sodhi model and is applied for vertical walled geometry. Ice loads from bending failure are considered for a sloping geometry at the waterline and are modelled by application of elastic beam- and friction-theory. Simulations of open water characteristics are performed for sea states with significant wave heights ranging from 2 to 14 meters. The results are compared to ice crushing for ice thickness ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 m and ice bending for ice thickness from 0.25 to 1.5 meters. From the simulations it is found that motion and mooring load maxima from ice bending loads for ice thickness up to approximately 1 m are in line with those for very harsh open water conditions. In the case of ice crushing, structure response is found to be far larger and more volatile, even for limited ice thickness. Crushing action of level ice with 0.2 m thickness will already cause larger mooring loads than the most extreme open water condition considered (with a 14 m significant wave height). On top of that, dynamic amplification issues can arise as a result of ice loading near the structure’s natural frequencies. This mainly poses issues for the high energy loading of crushing, where motions and force variations are considerable for loads near the structure’s pitch natural frequency.","Offshore floating wind turbine dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Overloop, P.J. (mentor)","2015","Afgelopen zomer zorgde hevige regenval voor grote overstromingen in de wijk Asparuhovo. Deze wijk ligt aan de heuvelachtige zuidkant van de kuststad Varna in Bulgarije. Na twee dagen van aanhoudende neerslag kwam er op 19 juni plots een grote modderstroom door de wijk heen zetten. Het gevallen regenwater behoort te worden afgevoerd van het hoger gelegen bosrijke plateau Avren met twee bestaande geulen via de wijk Asparuhovo naar de zee. Deze geulen functioneerden niet goed op de betreffende dag; op verschillende plekken langs het traject trad er een opstuwing van het water op. Door de toegenomen kracht en snelheid veroorzaakte het stromende water veel schade. Er kwamen 14 mensen om het leven bij de ramp en de materiele schade (beschadigde huizen, auto’s en infrastructuur) wordt geschat op 15 miljoen euro. Er wordt onder andere gedacht dat illegale huizenbouw in de natuurlijke geulen, illegale boskap op de hoger gelegen heuvelrug en het slechte onderhoud van de kanalen de belangrijkste oorzaken van de ramp zijn. Het bestaande afwateringssysteem in de wijk functioneerde niet voor de hoeveelheid water die moest worden afgevoerd op de betreffende dag in juni. Er moeten oplossingen worden gevonden om deze extreme afvoeren goed te kunnen verwerken in de toekomst met het oog op klimaatverandering. Binnen dit project is het uiteindelijke doel een ontwerp te realiseren voor de westelijke geul in de wijk Asparuhovo. In het eerste gedeelte van dit rapport is een samenvatting opgenomen van de verschillende doorlopen analysen waarbij het betreffende gebied Asparuhovo wordt verkent, geplaatst in de stedelijke omgeving van de stad Varna. Ook wordt er inzicht gegeven in de oorzaken van de overstromingsramp. De opgestelde randvoorwaarden en eisen waar het toekomstige afwateringssysteem aan moet voldoen worden zoveel mogelijk gekwantificeerd. Belangrijk binnen de oriëntatie is de vraag of het afvoerprobleem afzonderlijk kan worden opgelost of dat er andere belangen en processen samen moeten worden uitgewerkt om tot een goede oplossing te komen? Er zijn een aantal ontwerpconcepten ontwikkeld voor een drainagesysteem in de wijk Asparuhovo welke voldoen aan de eerder opgestelde eisen. Deze oplossingsconcepten zijn op een systematische wijze vergeleken aan de hand van de gekozen criteria en aan de opdrachtgever gepresenteerd. Na de oriëntatie volgt modelvorming. Met behulp van het computerprogramma SOBEK wordt eerst een afvoermodel van de bestaande situatie opgesteld . Bewerkte regenvaldata van de overstromingsramp wordt in het model geïntroduceerd, waarmee de stroming van het water in de linker geul wordt gesimuleerd. De theorie achter het gebruikte regenwaterafvoermodel en de benodigde aannamen in het model worden beschreven. De resultaten worden geanalyseerd en de onzekerheden in kaart gebracht. Met het opgestelde afwateringsmodel worden een aantal technische varianten ontwikkeld waarbij gevarieerd wordt met de dimensionering, bekleding, ruimtelijke inpassing en berging. Met opgestelde criteria wordt het functioneren van de afwateringskanalen geëvalueerd. Tot slot wordt de meest geschikte variant in meer technisch detail uitgewerkt.","Varna; Bulgaria; regenval; flash flood; rivierafvoer","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","43.181895, 27.885610"

(mentor)","2015","With the increase of the life expectancy and the deterioration of the quality of life that neurodegenerative diseases can cause to the patients, they have been receiving more and more attention the last few decades in the developed countries. Two of the leading neurodegenerative diseases are Alzheimer’s Disease and Multiple Sclerosis. In diagnosis and assessment progression Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is playing an important role. MRI is a non-invasive tool and can achieve a great contrast between the different tissues that exist inside the brain. In the search of biomarkers for the faster diagnosis of these diseases, the Corpus Callosum appears to be an interesting brain structure, as it facilitates inter-hemispheric communication and it is not sensitive to brain hydration and dehydration effects. This thesis investigates if the regional and global shape and area changes of the Cor- pus Callosum could set the Corpus Callosum as a biomarker for Alzheimer’s Disease and Multiple Sclerosis. In order to achieve that a segmentation pipeline is proposed, so as to extract the Corpus Callosum from Magnetic Resonance brain images. After such a pipeline is constructed and validated, the quantification of the Corpus Callosum area is investigated for scans acquired in scanners of different vendors and in scanners of different magnetic field strengths, in order to gain better insights of the differences that can exist between such scans. Finally, the potential of the Corpus Callosum to be used as a biomarker is investigated, by attempting to correlate the global and regional shape and area changes of the Corpus Callosum with neurodegenerative diseases. During the thesis the segmentation algorithm showed a high segmentation accuracy performance with a mean dice of 93%, a segmentation reproducibility error of 1.93% and the clas- sification accuracy between AD and MS patients with NC was above 95% for both groups.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

We introduce Stochastic Selective Search (SSS), a segmentation based selective search method, which differs from previous work in two ways. First and most importantly, SSS is much faster than current state-of-the-art algorithms while maintaining comparable accuracy. This is a result of our efficient stochastic segment merging process. Other work requires the computation of features to determine the order in which segments are merged. We show that currently used features from other work does not improve the results of SSS significantly and are therefore omitted. This makes our algorithm nearly twice as fast as the fastest prior selective search algorithms. Secondly, due to the stochastic merging process of SSS, it is not critically affected when two wrong segments are merged during the merging process, which leads to object proposals of higher quality. We show that SSS outperforms existing deterministic selective search methods while generating the same amount of proposals in less time. Additionally, we demonstrate the performance of our SSS algorithm in a state-of-the-art object detection pipeline based on convolutional networks.","computer vision; object proposals; selective search; object detection; object tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Pattern Recognition and Bioinformatics","","Media Knowledge and Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2015","The aim of this thesis is to investigate a debris-remediation technique where a chaser performs a rendezvous with the debris, establishes a rigid-link connection, and actively de-orbits the debris. Remediation of the space environment becomes an increasing urgency, since the continuously growing space debris population in low-Earth orbit currently poses a serious threat for active satellites. Furthermore, on Earth a threat exists due to uncontrolled re-entry of the debris sooner or later. The thesis addresses various aspects of the rendezvous phase for the debris-remediation technique under consideration. Among others, the aim is to assess passive safety of the required manoeuvres in the rendezvous phase. Also, the thesis explores the possibility of continuous ground communication of the chaser during its final approach with the target. Finally, the thesis studies the illumination conditions. This includes sensor blinding, target face illumination and chaser solar array illumination. ESA's satellite ENVISAT was used as design case. The safety aspects of the rendezvous manoeuvres were assessed by analysing the resulting trajectories after various thruster failures. For the analysis related to communication, the chain of core ESTRACK ground stations (located mainly in Europe) was considered. Furthermore, obstruction of the communication signal by the target was studied. Last, for the illumination conditions, obscuration of the Sun by target was taken into account. In the topic of passive safety, the results indicate that fly-around manoeuvres are preferred in the direction opposite to the natural orbital motion, as these are passively safe. On the other hand, manoeuvres on H-bar and fly-around manoeuvres along the natural orbital motion are found to be passively unsafe. It can be concluded from the communication analysis that the maximum duration of the uninterrupted window amounts up to more than half an hour, using the chain of core ESTRACK ground stations. However, the study on communication blockage shows that frequent communication gaps can occur, with the longest gaps being in the order of one minute in duration. In the field of illumination, it can be concluded that correct target illumination and sensor visibility cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, the results show that the average solar array area available during final approach varies between 35% and 75%, due to both incorrect pointing by the chaser and obscuration by the target.","e.deorbit; ENVISAT; Clean Space; Orbital Debris; Uncooperative Rendezvous; Debris Remediation; Safety; Communication; Illumination; Active Debris Removal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Astrodynamics and Space Missions","",""

(mentor)","2015","The urban area is complex. It consists of buildings, roads, green areas and surface water. The subsurface is just as complex. Interaction between groundwater and drainage, seepage from deeper groundwater aquifers and interaction with surface water make it difficult to determine what is happening. The urban area is also sensitive to damages, both wet and dry conditions can cause nuisance large damages. More insight is needed to simulate the changes in the system under changing conditions of climate and land use. This study has used extensive measurements from two neighborhoods in Lelystad in the period 1968-1984 to calibrate the water balance module in the Drought Stress Model (DSM). The measurements of precipitation, groundwater levels, drainage and sewer discharges have made an accurate calibration of the model possible. This model has allowed for simulation of climate change scenarios, scenarios of changing land use and land cover. Countermeasures to reduce the effects of drought have been simulated to evaluate their efficiency. The simulations showed that the predictions of increased precipitation and potential evaporation in the most extreme scenario cause more evaporation and lower groundwater levels in summer. In winter, the increase in precipitation results in higher groundwater levels. The moderate climate change scenario causes little changes in the urban areas. The increased predicted precipitation leads to more sewer runoff and a rise of the groundwater levels of a several centimeters. The land use changes showed that an increase in paved surface reduces the evaporation from the area. This results in an increase in the other outgoing fluxes, drainage and runoff, as well as an increase in groundwater levels. The counter measures show that both managing the drainage level and using surface irrigation are capable of controlling the groundwater levels. The simulation of the surface irrigation indicated that roughly half of the irrigated water reaches the groundwater. The rest is lost to evaporation.","urban water management; climate change; water balance; Lelystad; model; bucket model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water resources management","",""

The research is split up in<br/>different sections: sensors, communication and behaviour. The behaviour is split again: individual<br/>behaviour, anti collision behaviour and swarming behaviour.<br/>The research on the sensors and communication points out that the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)<br/>sensor is the most suitable for an autonomous Zebro Swarm. BLE can be used to transfer data as well<br/>as serve as a range sensor. As a communication device, BLE offers the ability to advertise data an has<br/>a range of 50 meters which is sufficient for application in a swarm. As a sensor, BLE offers fairly<br/>accurate measurements in distances below 1 meter. Due to the properties of radio signal strength and<br/>the always present radio frequency noise, the accuracy decreased with increasing distances.<br/>The individual behaviour aims at exploring as much area as possible, with the amount of energy<br/>available. The energy use therefore has to be minimised and the explored area maximised. Since<br/>little is known on the energy use, this is assumed constant. Maximising area, however, has some<br/>key elements. The first is to keep moving; standing still results in energy use without exploring new<br/>terrain. The second is to make only gentle turns; the rotational centre must be outside of the detection<br/>distance. When this centre lies inside of the detection distance, the inner turn will cover area for a<br/>longer period making the turn ineffective.<br/>The anti collision behaviour should prevent units from making physical contact. By using a contactless<br/>sensor an approaching collision can be detected. Changing the parameters of the movement<br/>of the units at the moment they enclose more than a certain value prevents the collision.<br/>The anti separation behaviour should prevent units from separating from eachother. This can be<br/>done by making units turn 180 degrees once the relative distance reaches a certain limit. The turning<br/>on a certain limit is a simple algorithm and thus requires little processing power.<br/>Apart from the anti collision behaviour and the anti separation behaviour, there is another approach<br/>to deal with these behaviours. Since the units are able to communicate with each other, they can also<br/>advertise their location to other units. There are several methods for a unit to acquire their location.<br/>These methods are divided in approximate and exact location estimation methods.

(mentor)","2015","The introduction of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) is a result of the financial crisis of 2008 and one of the first concrete measures of the European Commission in order to prevent a new crisis of this scale. After the fall of Lehman Brothers, often described as being “too big to fail” the decision was made to increase supervision, focussed on fund managers of alternative investment funds, real estate funds included. This graduation thesis describes the impact of AIFMD on real estate fund managers and the potential effects on the real estate investment market. Through the use of a cost-impact survey on fund managers and by conducting interviews with institutional investors, the main research question has been answered. This report argues that, in general, the cost impact for large, institutional real estate fund managers is not significant. However, smaller, private real estate fund managers do suffer a significant cost impact. This probably has far-reaching consequences for the real estate investment market.

(mentor); Vincent-Bonnieu, S. (mentor)","2015","Gas flooding is a widely used improved and enhanced oil recovery method. However, due to the low density and the high mobility of gas compared to oil and water, gravity override and fingering of gas though high-permeability zoness can occur during gas flooding reducing oil recovery. The development of foam leads to lowering the gas mobility and thus can help overcome the above disadvantages and improve the reservoir sweep efficiency and the oil recovery as well. Many experimental and modelling studies have been devoted to accurately describe foam in the last decade, but questions remain about foam performance at elevated temperatures. Although the surface activity of surfactants as a function of temperature is well described at the liquid/liquid or liquid/ gas interface, the description of the effect of temperature at foam behavior is limited, especially in porous media. In this work, we tested a N2 foam with AOS surfactant at four different temperatures (20°C, 40°C, 60°C and 80°C) and three different sandstone rocks with different permeability range (Bentheimer, Berea and Bandera) under co-injection conditions. The pressure drop, or equivalently the apparent viscosity, was measured in steady-state experiments. Conducting these core-flood experiments we concluded that the apparent viscosity of foam was reduced as temperature increased. Also, the mobility reduction factor was lower for the lower permeability sandstones. Furthermore even if superficial velocity was constant throughout the experiments (since total flow rate was kept constant) we observed an increasing trend of the velocity values because of the increase in the flow rate of gas as temperature increased. This was a result of the applied correction factors on the gas flow during the experiments. From the above we would assume that the increase in velocity was also contributed on the decrease of apparent viscosity apart from the change of the surface-tension for different temperatures. By normalizing apparent viscosity with respect to velocity we calculate the capillary number. We observed that all experimental data collapse on a single curve of capillary number: this suggests that the reduction of surface-tension was responsible for the drop in apparent viscosity at elevated temperatures. As a second part of this study, foam flow in the porous medium was simulated by a mobility-reduction model. For the purpose of this work only Local Equilibrium models were described and used and especially STARS model which scaled down the gas mobility based on empirical parameters. We managed to obtain the five foam flow-parameters used in the STARS model as well as to fit the data from the constant-velocity foam-scan core-flood experiments with two different methods (Boeije and modified Ma et al.). Finally, testing the capability of the current empirical models on the effect of temperature we concluded that it cannot sufficiently account for the effect of temperature or surface-tension.","foam; foam eor; surfactant; temperature effect; coreflood; gas injection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

In this paper, a method is described to approximate the compressive behavior using a vertical crack plane. Rather than adopting the crack topology, a transformation is applied prior to the evaluation of the cohesive law. The method is applied on predefined interface elements in a 2D model, as well as on cohesive segments in the extended finite element method in a 3D model. It is found that the compressive failure of composite laminates including the wedge effect can be approximated accurately with this method using a vertical crack plane. In 3D, a variable fracture plane angle is easily taken into account with the method, which means that the whole range of failure modes, from tensile, through shear-dominated to compressive failure can be covered in a single approach.","Composite Laminate; Compression; Cohesive Law; Interface Elements; XFEM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Mechanics / Computational Mechanics","",""

The mechanical properties of steel decay signicantly with increasing temperature. Therefore, in case of a re, the buckling resistance of steel columns is considerably reduced due to the decrease in the modulus of elasticity and yield strength. Furthermore, in a realistic re scenario, temperature gradients develop throughout the cross-section and throughout the column's length. However, the design guidelines in Eurocode 1993-1-2, as well as in other leading construction codes, specify that in the case of a non-uniform temperature distribution the column's buckling resistance must be determined by considering a uniform temperature distribution considering the maximum temperature in the cross-section. The objective of this thesis is to assess the reliability of the provisions given by the Eurocode for elevated temperature design in the presence of temperature gradients. A series of finite element models were created for five different cross-sections and analyzed at room temperature, uniform elevated temperature and non-uniform temperature along the cross-section. From the uniform elevated temperature analysis, a buckling curve for elevated temperature was derived. The finite element analysis results for the models under the effect of temperature gradients showed better agreement with this FEM-derived buckling curve than with the Eurocode provisions, which were shown to be over-conservative for the case of a temperature gradient along the column's weak axis. The FEM results were also compared to the results obtained with the American and Australian building codes.","finite element analysis; column buckling; steel structures; fire safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Steel and timber structures","",""

(mentor); Hegyi, A. (mentor); Van de Weg, G. (mentor); Wang, M. (mentor); Goossens-Visser, L. (mentor)","2015","Traffic congestion continues to remain a serious problem in most countries, with significant economic and environmental losses. ‘Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)’ that utilize advanced information and communication technology for managing road infrastructure, including vehicles and users, have shown great potential in dealing with this problem. However, most current traffic management measures, like route guidance, ramp metering and variable speed limits are designed and implemented independently. Potentially counter-productive when deployed simultaneously, integration of these measures can benefit from synergic effects. The aim of this work is to integrate a near-future variable speed control strategy with ramp metering, to operate efficiently at a freeway merging section. From a policy perspective, this is a challenge because freeways and urban network are managed by different authorities. Currently, a spillback of ramp queue to the urban network results in a deactivation of ramp metering, and an abrupt release of on-ramp vehicles onto the freeway. This is undesirable for the freeway control measure. Therefore, the development of the integrated strategy considers both, an improvement in freeway efficiency, and at the same time queue reg- ulation at the on-ramp. The research arch is initiated by conducting a literature survey, wherein the theoretical and control as- pects of available speed control approaches are studied first. Subsequently, different queue management approaches used in current ramp metering strategies are reviewed to identify the desirable features for a queue controller. Finally, integration approaches for combining ramp metering with variable speed limits are looked at. It is seen that optimization-based integration strategies may offer huge potential to improve freeway effi- ciency but these strategies are computationally complex for systems available in practice. Therefore, a so- phisticated reactive variable speed limits strategy - COoperative Speed Control ALgorithm (COSCAL v2) is chosen for integration with ramp metering. COSCAL v2 is a counteractive control strategy that resolves moving jams to recover loss in efficiency from capacity drop. It uses shockwave theory concepts to speed limit the exact the number of vehicles required to first resolve a jam, and next, to stabilize the traffic while recovering traffic throughput. The theory development is conducted in two stages from a simplistic to a more advanced approach that relaxes some of the initial assumptions. The basic strategy is developed to guarantee jam resolution under the condition of a constant ramp metering flow during the activation of COSCAL v2. Additionally, ramp queue constraints are not included, which implies that in order to prevent a spillback, a sufficiently high metering flow must be chosen. The theoretical formulation to determine when and how many vehicles must be speed-limited, as in COoperative Speed Control ALgorithm (COSCAL) v2, is preserved here. The core principle involves instantaneously speed-limiting the vehicles entering the moving jam. In this way, the inflow into the jam is reduced as compared to the flow exiting the jam, resulting in jam resolution. In the integrated strategy, the theory to determine the most upstream speed-limited vehicle that resolves the jam, given a constant ramp metering flow, is formulated. Similarly, the theory for determining the last vehicle speed-limited for stabilization is extended for the additional ramp flow. For this, COSCAL v2 checks for a maximum (average) density in the speed-limited area to ensure traffic stability. The value of the target density determines the freeway flow arriving at the on-ramp. Then, the integrated approach determines reduced target densities required to accommodate the ramp flow. It is also described how these densities can be implemented in practice, and how errors its realization can be compensated within the feedback structure of the scheme. However, this approach is not feasible for time-dependent ramp metering flows. This is essentially because accommodating a varying ramp flow will require implementing different densities in space-time, which is both difficult to determine and implement in the COSCAL v2 algorithm. Therefore, in the advanced strategy the theory of COSCAL v2 is extended for compatibility to a more sophisticated ramp metering approach. In the new approach, rather than regulating density the flow arriving at the on-ramp is directly controlled by determining when and where vehicles should enter and exit speed-limits. This addition- ally improves the effectiveness of COSCAL v2. Further, a new ramp metering strategy using cumulative curves is developed to include: queue-length constraints; policy restrictions on ramp metering flows; and limitations on the minimum freeway flow that can be achieved with speed limits given the traffic state mea- surements. One of the main advantages of the advanced strategy is its responsiveness to changing ramp flows, and the utilization of freeway speed-limitation to prevent a queue spillback on the ramp. Following the development of the two integration strategies, the advanced approach is translated to an al- gorithm. This step ensures that a controller can be designed to realize traffic behaviour according to the developed theory. Here, the complete strategy is divided into five modules that together determine the spatial extent of speed limits at any given time. Similarly to the algorithmic formulation of COSCAL v2, unique driving modes for the different detection and actuation tasks of the algorithm are used to communi- cate the control scheme for implementation. The control strategy thus developed is tested by means of simulation. Of the five modules, three modules related to the speed control strategy are implemented in this work. Simulation runs under different de- mand conditions are performed to verify the behavioural performance of the approach. Jam waves - that otherwise occur when ramp metering and COSCAL v2 are implemented independently - are prevented in the integrated approach. The results offer an initial indication of potential improvement from the strat- egy. However, a more comprehensive quantitative evaluation is recommended. Furthermore, some critical developments to the approach following the simulation study are identified. In conclusion, this work demonstrates two ways in which COSCAL v2 can be integrated with ramp me- tering (RM); how cumulative curves can be used for integration of control measures; and how efficiency gains on the freeway and urban network can be balanced. The simulations offer a proof of concept for the working of the advanced integrated strategy. However, the basic strategy should be both implemented and tested further.","variable speed limits; ramp metering; congestion; traffic control; shockwave theory; COSCAL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

The following report provides an overview of the context, methods and final outcome of the WeVlie concept. This design project has been commissioned from the Province of Friesland and executed in collaboration with the community of Vlieland. In order to understand the province of Friesland and particularly the Vlieland community dynamics large part of the project have been dedicated to learn the community dynamics and gain empathy by immersion in the context. To do so an iterative and co-creative design approach called the “four cycle method” has been used in this project and resulted in the WeVlie concept. WeVlie is a service that connects Islanders from different generations with each other, matching their skills and interests. A “physical touch point” in the municipality of Vlieland enables the exchange to happen. Here Islanders can offer and request chores to their community without the involvement of money. WeVlie relies on typical human mechanisms of mutual support and represents a concrete tool for the Vlieland community to strength the connection of generations and embrace that sense of community that nowadays have got lost in the individualistic behaviours patterns. WeVlie is a case study for the Province of Friesland to investigate how social innovation services can succeed in promoting connection between generations, as a means to create strong sustainable communities.","Service design; Social innovation; Vlieland; Province of Friesland; Co-creation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design","","","",""

The current standard door is very time consuming in its handling and is not optimally ergonomic. The new door should be faster in use and provide a more efficient and ergonomic handling. Therefore, an analysis was done on the current handling of ULDs. As the interaction with luggage handlers and the container is important, this was examined in real context use by visiting an airport luggage handling area. Other aspects of containers were looked at such as regulation, certifications, competitors, trend and developments and stakeholders. Furthermore, a patent research was done on existing innovations of aircargo containers. At Zodiac’s workplace, two containers were assembled to get a better view of the containers on construction level. During this analysis current problems with the container were collected. An overview of all findings led to a more concrete assignment formulation and to a list of requirements for the new door. A brainstorm session was done with some of Zodiac’s employees. This input and other individual brainstorming led to 8 idea directions. From these 8, 3 were chosen to continue with: Slap Door - a fabric door with bi-stable composite strips, enabling automatic rolling up Folding Door - a door consisting of 3 panels, foldable to the side of the container Reinforced Folding Door - a fabric door with an integrated frame enabling faster and easier storage of the door. Several sample containers were available at Zodiac’s workplace and were used during the ideation phase to verify and simulate the solutions with full-sized products. These prototypes and further detailing showed what concept had the most potential to further develop. The Folding Door was chosen to continue with because of its advantage in use and for being able to compete with the current door on weight and costs. Further detailing was done on all aspects of this concept. Then a new prototype was built which could be used for user test. A user test was done and then improvements were proposed leading to an enhanced design. Furthermore, estimations were done on weight and costs demonstrating that this design comes very close to the weight and price of the current standard door while cutting the handling time in half.","aircargo; container; ergonomical; prototyping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Vellinga, T. (mentor); De Koning Gans, H.J. (mentor); Sieben, A. (mentor)","2015","Growing transportation rates and the subsequent growth in inland waterway transport have led to an increase in inland vessel sizes and draught. Due to the fluctuating water levels on rivers and these increasing draughts, the distance between the river bed and the ships are decreasing. Rijkswaterstaat wants to know the effects of sailing at these small underkeel clearances on river beds and ship manoeuvrability. In order to quantify these effects, more knowledge about the flow field beneath sailing vessels is required, as well as the effect of the flow field on erosion of bed material. Currently no methods exist to determine the flow field beneath vessels, only a few formulations for a single maximum velocity value are available, but these are not applicable at small underkeel clearances (h / T < 1.25). Also the effect on the river bed is fairly unknown. To quantify the different effects of small underkeel clearances on the flow field physical model tests (with a length scale of 30) have been performed at Deltares. During these experiments a ship was towed through the flume, and flow velocities and pressures on the bed were measured, as well as forces on the ship. Additional experiments have been performed to investigate the effect on a moveable bed with different bed forms. From the experiments, it was found that the most important parameters that influence the flow field beneath the keel are the bow shape and the underkeel clearance. Barge bows force more flow underneath the keel than conventional bows, and this results in higher bed velocities. Decreasing keel clearances also result in significantly higher velocities at the bed. However, for very small underkeel clearances the boundary layer on the ship will interact with the boundary layer on the bed. This results in flow blockage underneath the keel. As a result, the flow needs to divert to the sides, and the velocities underneath the keel decrease. The diversion of the flow to the sides is also known as the fanning-out effect. This effect has definitely been proved by the measurements from the experiments. The effect (transverse velocities) increases with decreasing keel clearance (due to boundary layer interaction) and also increases with increasing ship widths. During the experiments, erosion of bed material was clearly observed, and its effect increased with decreasing keel clearance. However, the underkeel clearance needs to be very small (h /UKC < 1.1) to give significant bed erosion. Due to the fanning-out effect and turbulence fluctuations, most sediment transport occurred immediately alongside the vessel, rather than underneath the keel. With bed forms such as dunes the erosion increased, due to erosion at the dune tops and deposition in the troughs (10 passages of a conventional vessel over a dune resulted in a decrease in dune height of 20%). For the removal of small shoals this might be interesting, although a small underkeel clearance is necessary. Barges are preferred over conventional vessels due to the higher velocities and increased turbulence intensity. From the measured velocities during the physical model tests a model has been developed to predict the flow field underneath sailing inland navigation vessels. There are separate models for conventional vessels and for barges. The model is able to accurately predict maximum velocities (in sailing direction as well as in transverse direction), as well as a transverse velocity distribution. Compared to the previous prediction methods, the newly developed model is preferable. The results are more accurate, and the model is more extensive, due to the inclusion of transverse velocities and velocity distributions. More validation is required however, due to the lack of other data sets.","inland navigation; ship induced erosion; return current; ship boundary layer; flow field","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

De sluis met één kolk geeft toegang tot het Prinses Margrietkanaal / de Hoofdvaarweg Lemmer-Delfzijl en vormt de op één na belangrijkste verbinding voor de recreatievaart tussen het IJsselmeer en de Friese Meren. Een relatief hoog aandeel van de 40.000 passages uit 2013 (53,6%) bestond uit recreatievaartuigen. Uit de laatste Nationale Markt- en CapaciteitsAnalyse, uitgevoerd door Rijkswaterstaat, is naar voren gekomen dat de Prinses Margrietsluis onder bepaalde economische scenario´s rond 2020 een capaciteitsknelpunt kan vormen voor het binnenvaartverkeer. Dit is voor Rijkswaterstaat, de beheerder van de sluis, reden voor het starten van een capaciteitsanalyse op een hoger detailniveau met een simulatiemodel, waaruit moet blijken wanneer en onder welke omstandigheden een capaciteitsknelpunt kan optreden. In dit onderzoek is gebruik gemaakt van het simulatiemodel SIVAK II. Omdat dit model de afwikkeling van een groot aanbod recreatievaart zoals bij de Prinses Margrietsluis minder nauwkeurig simuleert, zijn enkele modelaanpassingen gedaan. Het toekomstige scheepvaartverkeer kan zich volgens verschillende scenario’s ontwikkelen. Om deze scenario’s te kunnen bepalen is een uitgebreide analyse gemaakt van de huidige verkeerstromen door de sluis en de samenhang met het omliggende gebied. Vervolgens is een toekomstanalyse gemaakt waarin gekeken is naar de mogelijke economische en regionale ontwikkelingen in de binnenvaart, de ontwikkelingen in de recreatievaart en de veranderingen in de infrastructuur. Er zijn 6 scenario´s bepaald voor de vlootverwachting in het jaar 2020, 2040 en 2065. Naast een analyse van de huidige sluis zijn ook verschillende alternatieve sluisconfiguraties onderzocht. In dit onderzoek is uitgegaan van de NoMo-passeertijdnorm van 45 minuten voor de binnenvaart en een passeertijdnorm van 75 minuten voor de recreatievaart. De NoMo-passeertijdnorm is maatgevend bij de Prinses Margrietsluis. Overschrijding van deze norm duidt op een inefficiënte scheepvaartafwikkeling en is een waarschuwing voor een naderend capaciteitsknelpunt. Een capaciteitsknelpunt ontstaat bij een gemiddelde passeertijd van meer dan 60 minuten voor binnenvaartverkeer. De ontwikkeling van de toekomstige verkeersintensiteit bij de sluis is sterk afhankelijk van het beschouwde scenario. Bij een hoge economische groei en een grote toename van de binnenvaartoverslag in de Eemshaven en de havens van Delfzijl wordt de norm al vóór 2020 overschreden en heeft de sluis dus onvoldoende capaciteit. Maar in het geval van lage economische groei wordt de norm tot 2065 niet overschreden en heeft de sluis wel voldoende capaciteit. De knelpuntenanalyse uit dit onderzoek wijst uit dat dit het belangrijkste knelpunt zal zijn voor het binnenvaartverkeer in Noord-Nederland. Omdat op korte termijn al een capaciteitstekort kan worden verwacht, blijft het monitoren van de passeertijden bij de sluis belangrijk. Wanneer blijkt dat de NoMo-passeertijdnorm wordt overschreden, dan is dit het moment om een vervolgstudie van hoger detailniveau te starten naar maatregelen die het ontstaan van een capaciteitsknelpunt bij de sluis kunnen voorkomen of uitstellen. Op basis van deze studie wordt een sluisconfiguratie met twee kolken en/of de ontvlechting van de recreatievaart via een alternatieve route aanbevolen. Beide maatregelen zorgen voor een aanzienlijke verlaging van de gemiddelde passeertijd.","sluis; capaciteit; Prinses Margrietsluis; SIVAK; Lemmer; Hoofdvaarweg Lemmer-Delfzijl; Prinses Margrietkanaal; binnenvaart; recreatievaart; lock; capacity analysis; friesland","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM","","52.851320, 5.676581"

(mentor)","2015","In design with composite materials, the capability of tailoring the properties of the structure with respect to the specific load requirements in each direction, allowed by their anisotropic nature, is coupled with the development of interlaminar stresses transferred through the thickness. Specifically, at the free edge of the laminate, due to the change in fiber orientation and the unique response of the constituent materials, stresses are developed in the thickness direction. Moving towards the center of the laminate up to a certain threshold, the stress state of the plies is further complicated by that phenomenon. The primary goal of the thesis project was to develop an analytical stress model for both the in-plane and the out-of-plane stresses acting within the laminate. Furthermore, the model was intended to capture a specific sequence of damage occurrences in laminates of the family [02/?2/-?2]s loaded under tension, as observed by O’Brien. Namely, during loading, matrix cracks initiating at the free edge of the off-axis plies and propagating along the respective fiber orientation are anticipated to occur first. While these cracks increase in length and number, at some point a +? crack will intersect with a – ? one, forming an envelope with the free edge. Continuing, a local delamination is expected within this envelope. In order to predict that, the stress expressions would have to be implemented in a failure theory that is capable of accounting for the ongoing phenomena and of distinguishing between different matrix failure modes. These requirements led to the selection of Puck Failure Theory. The process proved to be more complex than estimated. At first, results from literature could not be duplicated. After an extensive period of thoroughly checking and editing the approach, the expressions and the code in which they were implemented, it was realized that a multiplicative factor is distorting the output. After calculating and applying the factor for each one of the out-of-plane stress expressions, agreement with published results was excellent. Unfortunately, the origin of the error could not be found. Once the error has been corrected, the potential integration of the stress expressions in a fatigue life evaluation model specifically designed for composites, could replace the currently employed semi-empirical theories that where originally formulated for isotropic materials and rely mainly on curve-fitting.","composites; interlaminar stresses; free edge effects; stress analysis; damage initiation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-01-09","Aerospace Engineering","Structural Integrity & Composites","","Design and Production of Composite Structures","",""

(mentor); Nick, H.M. (mentor); Boeije, C.S. (mentor)","2015","Foam injection is a promising method to improve sweep efficiency for gas flooding in enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The effect of oil on foam is a complex phenomenon and for this reason three phase foam simulations have shown to be difficult in the past. Initially the objective of this simulation study was getting a better understanding of relating composition paths for foam displacements on the ternary diagram to the gas mobility reduction factor on the same diagram (Dharma, 2013). However, there were unexpected numerical problems during the course of the study and consequently the objective of the thesis has been changed. The new focus of the research is investigating the different problems that are encountered with three-phase foam simulations. Additionally an attempt is made to overcome the problems by changing the numerical method and adding a capillary diffusion coefficient. Two cases are examined, both showing oscillations using the STARSTM foam model. Firstly, a Finite Volume Method (FVM) model has been created. This simple single point upstream scheme without diffusion is tested and used to study the challenging cases of Namdar Zanganeh et al. (2009) and Dharma (2013). In both researches oscillations between the foam and no-foam region appear. Research on the case of Namdar Zanganeh et al. is presented; the same difficulties occur using the FVM method. The oscillations cannot be overcome by using extremely small time steps and grid size. Hence this is a fundamental problem for finite volume grids with a single point up-wind scheme and no diffusion. The FVM script is extended with a capillary diffusion coefficient to approximate the effect of capillary pressure gradient and Finite Element Method (FEM) is in an attempt to overcome the problems encountered. The addition of the capillary diffusion coefficient makes the oscillations between the foam and no-foam region disappear and shocks to states predicted by Namdar Zanganeh et al. are present. The forward shock is broad, but it appears to be a shock. The velocity of the slow shock is too fast. For the FEM simulation COMSOL is used, with this numerical method no oscillations occur. However, a shock to a state not predicted by Namdar Zanganeh et al. (2009) is present. Moreover, a travelling ’shock’ does not advance at all, on the time scale studied. Additionally, research on the case of Dharma (2013) is presented. For this case the oscillations disappear using the FVM. This means the oscillations are a result of the higher order FVM used by Dharma. However, the result is not optimal since new complications arise: non-monotonically moving shocks. A study on this abnormality is carried out and results obtained are for a number of cases compared to the work of Dharma. The FVMresults in this research show similar behaviour as Dharma found. An intermediate oil bank is found at a different saturation this most likely because of the use of a different oil relative permeability function.","Three-phase; foam; simulations; STARS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2015","The polytropic model to describe air expansion, has been used for years to describe the behavior of surge vessels. In this thesis the alternative to describe this behavior, the Rational Heat Transfer (RHT) equation developed by Graze (1968), is extended with an estimation of all heat terms in surge vessels. The RHT model is compared to the poly- tropic model for isolated and non-isolated vessels and is shown to give a good estimation for the air expansion, which has been checked with measurement data from Shuweihat, a location in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates where a large pumping station is located. Calculations for the size of the surge vessel point out that the minimal volume of a surge vessel calculated with the RHT model is 10 % smaller than if the volume is calculated with the polytropic model. Furthermore, the heating of the air pocket in a surge vessel has been modeled by a numerical solution of the one-dimensional heat equa- tion with a convective and a non linear source term. From this models can be concluded that the air in a surge vessel warms up slower than the expansion time of that vessel.","Thermodynamics; Surge Vessels; Rational Heat Transfer","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","Numerical Methods","",""

(mentor)","2015","This thesis investigates the self-healing mechanisms of deformation-induced defects in ferritic Fe-Au(-B-N) and Fe-Mo alloys, by segregation and precipitation of Au elements and Fe2Mo compounds. For this purpose, cyclic tensile tests on the Fe-Au(-B-N) alloys are conducted interrupted with isothermal ageing steps at 550 °C. Coincidence Doppler Broadening (CDB) measurements are performed to study the defect evolution and precipitation behaviour occurring at these defect sites, to clarify the correlation between precipitation and strain-induced defects. Using this technique, the Fe-Mo samples are studied for various ageing times up to 64 h. These measurements are conducted with 8% deformed and undeformed samples, to study the influence of dislocations on the Fe2Mo precipitation. Furthermore, Vickers hardness tests are conducted on undeformed and 8 % deformed Fe-Mo alloy samples for various ageing times, as well as creep tests for the Fe-Mo and Fe-Au(-B-N) alloys in combination with SEM observations. Next, diffusion-based finite element model calculations are performed on filling of a creep cavity for the Fe-Mo alloy. It is found from the model that the filling of a creep cavity on a grain boundary can be well compared with the growth model of a precipitate on a grain boundary. From the CDB measurements, it is found for the Fe-Au(-B-N) alloys that in a major part of the deformation-ageing cycles healing takes place after introducing defects. Being consistent with previous research [1], it is found that the addition of B and N to the Fe-Au alloy retards the Au precipitation. For the Fe-Mo alloy, it is found from CDB measurements that the segregation and precipitation of Fe2Mo is enhanced by induced dislocations and other defects. The creep lifetime of this alloy is improved compared with that of the Fe-Au alloy, together with a higher ductility. Based on the CDB measurements, supported by the creep measurements and SEM studies, it is shown that Mo solutes have a tendency to segregate selectively to dislocations and open-volume defects. The site-selective precipitation makes Mo a promising alternative for Cu and Au to act as an efficient self-healing agent for deformation-induced defects in Fe-based structural alloys for use at elevated temperatures.","Self-healing materials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","Novel Aerospace Materials","",""

(mentor); van den Berg, E.M. (mentor); Kleerebezem, R. (mentor)","2015","Dissimilatory reduction of nitrite to ammonium (DNRA) and denitrification are two biological processes that occur in natural and man-made ecosystems, where nitrate and nitrite are the terminal electron acceptors. The understanding of the environmental factors that determine which of these processes dominate, can contribute to optimising engineered nitrogen conversion processes. In the present study, we aimed to quantitatively assess the influence of nitrite as electron acceptor compared to nitrate on the competition between denitrification and DNRA. A nitrogen limited continuous mixed culture was used, with acetate as carbon source and electron donor, and nitrate and/or nitrite as electron acceptor. It is shown that replacing nitrate by nitrite does not change the conversions nor the microbial community structure in the system. DNRA initially was, and remained the dominant process and the microbial community consisted in all experiments for more than 90% of Geobacter sp. It remains unclear if the denitrification activity observed can be fully attributed to the side population Betaproteobacteria, or that denitrification was also (partly) catalysed by Geobacter sp. The Ks, qsmax and Yxs values obtained in this study can be used in environmental modelling studies and in the bioprocess engineering of nitrate and nitrite containing streams.","DNRA; Denitrification; Chemostat; Enrichment; Competition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Environmental Biotechnology (EBT)","","Life Science and Technology","",""
