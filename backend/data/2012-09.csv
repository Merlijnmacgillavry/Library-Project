(mentor)","2012","In this work we examined the discretised form of Boltzmann-like transport, i.e. the neutron trans- port equation and the Boltzmann-Fokker-Plank (BFP) equation with the discontinuous Galerkin method and polynomial basis functions. In particular we examined an adaptive algorithm, which bases its decision of where to refine on the adjoint problem, as in sensitivity analysis. In this way an accurate detector response should be obtained in an efficient manner. The goal-orietend criterion uses the adjoint solution as a measure for importance to the detector response. This refinement technique is compared to traditional methods, which base refinement on the change in the solution of a local test refinement, and to the discrete ordinates method. Problems with one spatial and one angular dimension are used to test the adaptive algorithm. In previous work the same problems were solved with first order polynomials in the spatial di- rection and zeroth order polynomials in the angular direction. We saw then that constant patches, zeroth order polynomials in the angular part of the domain, could not represent the angular flux in diffusive materials accurately. We furthermore saw that the quality of the error estimate with the global adjoint approximation was reasonable, while with the local adjoint approximation it was poor. In this work we employed first order polynomials in both the spatial and angular domains. Linear patches, the first order polynomials in the angular domain, provide a better approximation of the angular flux using less unknowns. This can be seen when comparing both the constant and linear patches to the discrete ordinates method. Also the diffusive materials are now much easier to approximate, which has as effect that traditional refinement gives smaller errors than with constant patches. The quality of the error estimate with linear patches, however, is poor for almost every test case. A cause can be found in the approximation of the exact adjoint solution that is used in the estimate. This approximation is done by refining all the current mesh uniformly one level. It appears the space of the deeper level is only slightly larger than the coarser level on which the forward problem is solved, in the sense that the adjoint solution on that deeper level does not yield information not contained in the coarser level. The solution we propose is to solve the adjoint problem with higher order basis functions than those of the forward problem. Finally we present some results on the Boltzmann-Fokker-Planck equation discretised with discontinuous Galerkin. The discrete operator one obtains is very similar to the discrete transport operator, with extra bands added within a spatial element. To solve this system of equations one could use a Gauss-Seidel iteration, which means one sometimes uses outdated angular flux values of neighbours, or Kylov subspace methods, as the matrix operator is not computed explicitly.","Neutron Transport Equation; sensitivity analysis; adaptive algorithm; Discontinuous Galerkin method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Numerical Analysis","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The introduction of the Through-Silicon Via changes that, by allowing connections to be made from one side of a die through its silicon substrate to the other side of the die, so that multiple dies can be interconnected efficiently inside a single package. Like any revolutionary development, TSVs require changes in the tools that deal with them. Not all current Electronic Design Automation software is able to extract chip layouts containing TSVs to a correct circuit. In order to adapt extraction software, a methodology to extract TSVs is required. This methodology, in turn, requires a model. Several models that can be found in literature are compared and contrasted. The one that is selected is improved upon by making some minor corrections. The model is also simplified and the conditions for validity of this simplification are shown. The resulting model is then used to implement an extraction methodology, both with a model-based approach and with a formula-based approach. Simulating the different dies that make up a 3D IC together is demonstrated, giving the designer access to a complete toolchain necessary for designing 3D ICs and verifying their correctness.","modeling; extraction; through-silicon vias; tsv; space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Bergema, C.P.A.M. (mentor)","2012","To begin with, I would like to ask you a question; do the following statements ring a bell? “Changing technology”, “evolution of the market”? I assume your answer is yes. If not, in any case I would like to share my experience with you, also something you could try. Type “changing technology evolution of markets”, these exact words, in a search query of Google.com and the result are visible in the picture below. The search query returned with 98,100,000 results within 0.25 seconds. This should give you an idea of how most of the markets today are dominated or rather driven by technology. The radical shifts in technology often disrupt markets and the environment which existed before the introduction of this new technology (Verganti, 2010). It will not be justified to quote a single author to state that technology is driving the world today and is dominating relevant markets and hence the customer behavior. Consumers are not the first ones affected; instead the stakeholders within the value chain of a product or industry are deeply moved by any technological shifts or changes. Philips Lighting itself is an example that can be quoted here. This project, initiated by the Lighting Design group within Philips Lighting, looks at designing new customer experience flows for the B2B channel in professional lighting, with a focus on architects and lighting designers. This project is carried out in collaboration with an internal project partner, the Philips Lighting University (PLU). The PLU group has a vision to address to an overall challenge of creating creative partnerships and gaining trust of key stakeholders by providing customer education. This education is focused on lighting technologies and their various applications. PLU has a defined business model but there is scope for creating an effective platform for engagements strategy and designing a new stakeholder experience thereby, making it a good opportunity for a master thesis project. The real strategic design problem, as identified within the current business plan, is to first identify the real knowledge needs of the target audience of architects and lighting designers in order to provide suitable education at specific times in their design process. The next important challenge is to translate this information into a design for commercialization strategies, and design a new strategic design vision of PLU. This will lead to an effective learning environment and a new image for Philips Lighting University, that of an ‘inspiring partner’. Architects have been a difficult customer segment for Philips Lighting in the past. Their motivations and aspirations around a project are difficult for the core marketing team to identify with. As a creative group we have similarities of vision and a similar approach todesign. This close proximity of interests proved useful to conduct a qualitative research with architects. The studies were conducted using both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Insights reveal that architects approach a design process like a learning process. Here learning is a result of 'doing'; which in this case is designing. During this overall design process the preliminary research phase, conceptualization, and design development phase are key points when an architect seeks new learning. The learning needs or knowledge requirements of architects are of two kinds; declarative, and procedural. The declarative knowledge is information that is easily transferrable through mediums like books, articles, etc. This type of knowledge supports familiarization with facts. Such knowledge is useful during the early design phase of preliminary reserach. On the other hand, the procedural kind of knowledge is more implicit in nature and is difficult to transfer through mediums such as books and magazines. Procedural knowledge is based on professional experiences within a field and is therefore transmitted through mentoring activities. This type of knowledge is extensively required from the concept design to design development phase. This also forms 80% of the overall design process. The current educational tools identified by PLU and the nature of information targeted are that of the declarative kind. That means PLU is only targeting a percentage of customer's 30% involvement in a design process. This might not sound attractive from a business perspective. The focus therefore needs to shift to cover a larger share of the pie, through learning engagements made for the remaining part of the design process and respective learning needs. PLUS, or Philips Lighting University Support is a strategic-design vision of the PLU. The Strategic-Design Vision encompasses concerns of architects regarding the required types of knowledge and their relevant sources used to compliment a project. PLUS is a learning democracy supported by the PLU. Like any other democracy it is OF the people, FOR the people and BY the people. PLUS is a platform that allows people to get together, share experiences, and in return share knowledge. People here refer to the various stakeholders including lighting designers, architects, installers, and etc. The three key personas that will help run this democracy is that of the architect (student of PLU), expert (specialist in the subject), and Philips (internal expert, or key account manager). The PLUS will orchestrate collaborative learning through three key elements; physical space, virtual university, and the experts. These three elements will complete a holistic learning environment offered by PLU. The goal of this strategic vision will be to enable thought leadership for Philips in the light industry, making PLU the most engaging customer education programs available in the market.","strategy; design; qualitative research; LED; industry; lighting; architects; customer education; vision; M-learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2012","For centuries sports are providing people entertainment and physical fitness. Often sports go hand in hand with competition. Olympic Games are organized every two years and the whole world is watching it. A crucial part of the competition is sports timing. A lot of people do sports and sport events take place on a large scale. Mass sport events attract over more than hundred thousand people and they all want accurate sport timing. This thesis focuses on analyzing the UHF RFID system used for mass sports timing, e.g. marathons. As of today UHF systems are commonly used in other industries, but are not optimized for sports timing. The main advantage of the UHF RFID system is the low cost of the individuals RFID tags used. Mass sporting events on a grand scale have contributed to the popularity of the UHF RFID systems. However, there are several sports timing specific challenges. Four major challenges can be identified: throughput, accuracy, missing detections and multiple antennas. There are several relationships between these challenges, e.g. there is a trade-off between accuracy and throughput. Optimized for throughput the system would attempt to read as many unique tags as possible, decreasing the probability of missing an athlete. In this situation the number of ’hits’ (the number of times an athlete is seen by the system while crossing a timing line) is low, making it difficult to record the precise starting or finishing time. An optimized reader algorithm is proposed. The algorithm dynamically finds a good balance between throughput and accuracy. As a result, the optimized reader algorithm switches faster to the next antenna and misses fewer athletes. Simulations of marathon races show that the proposed optimized reader is more efficient, has more hits and misses fewer athletes than the currently used standard UHF RFID reader.","Sport timing; RFID; UHF","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-09-21","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor)","2012","Homes, offices and vehicles are getting networked. This will enable context aware, autonomous operation of many support systems that could be controlled remotely. To achieve this there would be a large number of tiny devices -- sensors and actuators -- which are networked and they are termed generally as Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In future, they will be powered through harvested energy from the ambience to enable perennial lifetime and minimal manual maintenance. Some examples of energy sources are photovoltaic panels and piezoelectric crystals. Several challenges arise due to the nature of sources of energy. One of these challenges is that the devices (nodes) leave and re-enter networks due to fluctuating availability of harvested energy. This energy condition requires the adaptation of special means at every layer of the communication model. For example, as a result of fluctuating energy levels, the neighbor table maintained at each node changes quite often leading to complications in forming and maintaining routes. In fact initial neighbor discovery (ND) itself is a difficult task. Further, usage of directional antennas would affect the time taken to complete ND. Given the spatio-temporal variations in energy availability in harvesting environments, there are benefits of energy prediction. With the help of prediction, resource allocation within a single system and splitting of tasks between nodes in a network would be enhanced. In order to identify the various parameters that affect ND we first describe a generic analytical model of an energy harvesting device. Next, we study a network of these devices through exhaustive simulation study considering these various parameters. We demonstrate the benefits and challenges of using directional antennas for ND. We present a scheme that nodes could use to discover their neighbors during initial deployment and another scheme that could be used for subsequent discovery on re-entry into the network. We show that a dedicated ND protocol is necessary for energy harvesting networks and that directional ND is beneficial in these networks under some circumstances. Finally, we present light-weight energy prediction solutions that can be used to improve the performance of the ND process in particular.","energy harvesting; neighbor discovery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-04","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Telecommunication","",""

(mentor); Van Doorn, F. (mentor); Pudjiatie, C. (mentor)","2012","Nowadays, E- learning has became an realistic education alternative to everyone with an internet connection. It is not only about learning, it is also about online socializing, communication and personalizing. There is no teacher and classroom, students have more freedom of time and location. The use of multi-media and ICT (information-communication-technology) makes E-learning more dynamic and interactive than traditional paper-based materials. However, it also takes time and effort to design a good E-learning product. Without face-to -face teaching and introduction, E-learning designs need to be clear enough for learners. A good using experience is also asked by the learners, which can make their learning more fun and motivating. This master graduation project focused on designing an E-learning platform for the Aflatoun Academy. As a part of the Aflatoun program, Aflatoun Academy’s aim is to help teachers through training of teaching the Aflatoun curriculum. Currently Aflatoun teachers are from all around the world and they are usually trained by local trainers in a three-day-workshop. The challenges of this project are to develop a new digital way of processing the educational content to teachers on an E-learning platform, work together with the paper format curriculum; To support and inspire teachers’ work on the platform; And to stimulate the communication between Aflatoun and teachers and also between teachers from different schools. Starting from the preliminary research of the design context, a context analysis was performed, including two parts. The first, an Internal study, was aimed to get a deep understanding of the relevant company information in this project, including the materials they are using, the training activities they are doing and the future strategy. The second part is an analysis of E-learning theories and E-learning products, which could guide the future design. At end of this research, the design opportunities are mapped. After finding the design opportunities, the target user group was studied, for understanding teachers’ behaviors in their current work situation and their behaviors in digital activities. The data gained from this study helps to form the user model for further design’s use. From the design research of the context and users, the design brief has been defined for guiding the conceptualization phase. In conceptualization, a scientific interface design approach has been taken, including 5 steps: Defining functions and features; Building information structure; Sketching flowcharts and wireframes; Preliminary concept evaluation and finally the Design visualization. At end of this phase, the framework of the concept has been formed. Then the concept has been detailed and evaluated. The Evaluation was done with a functional prototype. Insights are gained, about both usability and user experience. Finally design improvements have been made based on the evaluation results. The final design of the Aflatoun Academy E-learning includes four basic elements: Program information, Aflatoun educational content, Communication&socialization and finally Personalization. They have been translated into functional features. These features are arranged into the information structure with some other supporting functions. The final concept has four main functional parts in the information structure. They are ‘About Aflatoun’, ‘Aflatoun Resources’, ‘ Teacher Community’ and ‘Personalizing functions & Others’. About Aflatoun: Includes two sub.-parts, ‘Aflatoun intro.’ and ‘News & Events’. Here users can get to know Aflatoun program and keep updated with the program information. Aflatoun Resources: Includes two sub-parts, ‘Training refreshing’ and ‘ Teacher supports’.‘Training Refreshing’ is aiming to help teachers refresh the content in training workshops. Users can check out the training manual and watch corresponding workshop videos. In ‘Teacher supports’, users can access the teacher manuals’ content and get further materials from Aflatoun. They get tips, teaching aids and other inspirations without hard searching. Because the topics on the platform are all tagged, the system offers a thoughtful way of relevant resources searching too. Teacher Community: Includes two semi-parts, ‘Share & Discuss’ and ‘Groups’. As an important part of the platform, the teacher community stimulates group learning and communications. Teachers’ experience, stories and questions are shared here. Teachers feel getting more involved by participating the online activities. Aflatoun Academy will also hear more from the teachers and make efficiently use of their feedback. Personalizing functions & Others: The platform also offers personalizing functions such as users profiles, editing their tags and manage the information they are interested in by marking it. It gives the users more control. Other supporting functions such as the searching engine and the online guide are also offered on the E-learning platform. The four main parts explained, offer many more functionalities than described. The report presents the research results and design details, which can be used as a basis for the further development and implementation.","E-learning; website design; Aflatoun; teachers; education; interaction design; children; platform; online community","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

It has been demonstrated that the patient experience during the MRI scan influences their breathing, and with that the scan time and image quality. Reducing the data acquisition time means to decrease the chance to incur into physiological distresses or to limit the set of physical constraints implicit within the MRI scanner. In this direction a research on a novel technique to guide a subjects’ breathing pattern through the use of a projected video has been carried out by the Basel University Hospital in Switzerland. This graduation project is based on that research and it is about the design of an integrated video experience for MRI patients to reduce phycological distresses by improving the respiratory efficiency and as a consequence the imaging time. On the market there are already three MRI video systems that could be used to show the video developed by the hospital. However these systems lacks in term of engagement and some of them may cause disorientation to the patient. Moreover most of these systems are not designed for a daily use. A new projection system has been developed with the aim of decreasing the patient stress by engaging him with a video screen placed in proximity of the patient face. This screen solution together with an innovative video projection technique designed by Knowledge Resources (Basel, Switzerland) allows to watch the video at any stage of the examination. The advantage is that the patient starts the immersing video experience before to enter in the scanner bore and it ends immediately after he his driven out. In particular this system help the first time MRI users to cope with the high stress level of entering inside the scanner bore. To prevent disorientation or dizziness the projection screen has been designed to do not completely exclude the patient from the outside environment. In particular the screen do not completely fill the field of view of the patient in order to let him to control what is happing around. Unlike the video systems already on the market this is the first example of an MRI video system who has been designed with the principal aim of decreasing the patient stress. The entire video system has been designed to be placed inside the MRI suite that is regulated by a specific product restriction. A working prototype of the video system has been produced with the aim of testing the video system principle and the user experience. However the short time nature of the project did not let the student to do that. In this direction those tests should be conducted by the client before to decide what is the next step in this project.","MRI; video; projection; experience; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

FLEX/the INNOVATIONLAB® (Flex), a design studio with more than 20 years of experience in product design, recognizes this need and wants to include sustainability in their design process. Several methods and tools can be used to facilitate SPD. Examples of these are Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Cradle to Cradle (C2C). Literature research on these and other methods together with interviews within the company have shown that existing methods are comprehensive but difficult to adopt within the product development process at Flex. This process is characterized by creativity, intuition, experience, fast results and leaves little space for time consuming interventions. Therefore Green Map, a tailor made sustainability approach for Flex, has been developed. A life cycle approach was adopted to look at the sustainability consequences in the broadest sense at each stage of the value chain of the product. Including the following phases: design, material procurement, production, transportation, product use and end of life. For each phase Green Map addresses three main sustainability strategies, each with a good, better, and best scenario. These strategies are the starting point for a creative session in which Flex, the client and eventual other stakeholders are involved. Green Map consists of a combination of tools, which support the initial phase of product development. The first step is strategic questioning, where the client’s motivation and aspiration related to sustainability opportunities are probed. With that output goals are set, to assess more specifically how much impact will be addressed. The last step entails idea generation. Here, the Green Map Canvas and Strategy cards are used as a brainstorm tool, to produce more sustainable ideas for the complete life cycle of the new product. To facilitate the adoption of Green Map within the company several sessions with designers and project managers at Flex have been conducted.","sustainability; tool; Flex; life cycle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

The availability of cheap and powerful digital signal controller have increased the interest in its application in motor control. Sensorless control of motor is especially challenging because the rotor position and speed information need to be estimated without any shaft sensors. The use of machine model has been helpful in estimating the rotor speed using the phase currents of motor. However such control schemes have limitations at low speed because of absence of Back-EMF in the motor at low speed. Therefore these controlling schemes are useful only above a minimum speed above which there is substantial back-EMF in the motor. The aim of this thesis is to find a method to lower this speed limit as close to zero speed. Here in this thesis a brief study of the existing control scheme was carried out to understand the advantage and disadvantage of each control scheme. The current observer sensorless scheme was adopted for further study and improvements. The three improvements suggested were current injection, current averaging and voltage compensation. The current injection and current averaging was selected for implementation in this thesis. The current injection which was done on the rotating reference frames in the machine model and the current averaging was found to reduce the speed limit of an existing sensorless control. The stability and power efficiency of the changed control scheme was studied. The control strategy tested on the given motor was able to bring the minimum speed of control from 450rpm to 50rpm. The algorithm was also found to make the control unstable at speed ranges between 220-440 rpm. Besides that, the coupling effect of the injected current was found to reduce the efficiency of the motor at speeds less than 200rpm.","sensorless control; PMSM; motor control; current injection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","This research performed technology forecasting (TF) of electric vehicles (EV) using data envelopment analysis (DEA) with the purpose to determine to what extent TFDEA can be applied to predict the technological progress of electric vehicles. This study was commissioned by SKF, who is interested in having a useful forecasting tool to analyze EV technological advancements and identify whether one of the existing EV configurations has potential to become the dominant design in the future. SKF dedicates a major part of its resources to supplying the car industry; therefore changes in the automotive industry may impose technological changes on their current development projects and state of affairs. New market opportunities or threats brought about by the introduction of electric vehicles need to be signaled in due time to be able to adjust corporate and research activities to better serve the car industry and maintain a strong market position. Electric vehicles are available in several configurations: battery electric (BEVs), hybrid electric (HEVs), plug-in hybrid (PHEV), and extended-range electric vehicles (EREV). This indicates that electric vehicles represent a heterogeneous class of products with different technical and performance specifications. Therefore, two aspects need to be accommodated by the forecasting technique used to produce electric vehicle forecasts: ? EV technology is not homogeneous, therefore the forecasting method should allow for the simultaneous analysis of different EV configurations in order to measure and predict technological change over the whole class of EV technology. ? EVs are characterized by several performance attributes which may be differently valued by different user categories, therefore the forecasting method should allow for multi-criteria evaluation of the technology performance and technological progress. This research used TFDEA to forecast the technological progress of electric vehicles. The reason is that TFDEA appeared to have significant advantages over conventional trend extrapolation methods. Unlike conventional techniques, TFDEA can simultaneously evaluate multiple technologies using multiple variables. Furthermore, TFDEA is an extreme point method which means that it can calculate the individual performance of an observation instead of calculating the average performance over the data set. For this reason TFDEA is able to identify the state-of-of the art frontier (i.e. the best performing technologies at a given time). In addition, TFDEA can determine rates of technological change without assuming non-correlated attributes and can account for dynamic trade-offs between performance parameters. The description of TFDEA fits the requirements identified for the forecasting method needed for EV technology. Remaining concerns about the usefulness of the method were related to the amount of data needed for the model to produce reliable results and the inherent assumptions of TFDEA listed below: 1. Technology performance is a linear function of the technology inputs. 2. The inputs of technology remain constant over time. 3. The rate of technological change remains constant over time. The focus of this study was to identify the impact of these assumptions on the accuracy and validity of the EV forecasts. A technical system analysis of electric vehicles was performed to provide understanding of the basic operation mechanisms of EV systems and of the relations between different EV design variables. Such information was necessary in order to properly identify and select those design parameters that are responsible for the EV performance and which can pose limitations to further technological advancements. For both families of vehicles, the output power of the propulsion unit, the charge storage capacity of the battery and the vehicle weight were found to be the main determinants for EV performance. In this study, the performance of BEVs was expressed in terms of acceleration possibilities and driving range, while for HEVs fuel economy, CO2 emissions and acceleration were selected as key performance indicators. The technical and performance attributes of EVs were used as inputs and outputs respectively in three TFDEA models. Two of the models ware applied on BEVs or HEVs only and were used to evaluate the individual technological progress of BEVs and HEVs as homogeneous products, while the third model was used to determine the rate of technological change over the full class of EVs. Each model was used to produce a forecast for yearly EV performance levels until 2020. These forecasts were verified for accuracy against a set of existing products. Then, it was analyzed how the data availability and the assumptions of the TFDEA model impact the reliability and validity of the forecast. The results of the analysis are shown below:  For the first 11-12 time periods all vehicles in the data set were ranked as SOA, therefore no rate of change could be calculated, which reduced significantly the possibility to analyze whether there is a visible pattern of constant progress. This was caused by the large number of attributes included in the model, combined with a low number of products released over a relatively short time window.  TFDEA assumes linear relations between technology inputs and technology performance. For electric vehicles, this assumption is realistic to a limited extent. The results showed that in the case of battery electric vehicles there seems to be a linear relation between battery capacity and electric range.  It was shown that TFDEA models consistently underestimated the performance parameters subjected to regulation. This indicates that the method is very sensitive to exogenous drivers of technological change. The EV case study shows that the approach to evaluate the performance of a technology as a linear function of its inputs may be an oversimplification.  The results of the three models show that the TFDEA cannot anticipate the introduction of potentially disruptive technologies, such as the PHV and the EREV. This is due to the fact that the forecasts produced with TFDEA indentify what may be feasible in the future based only on what exists today. TFDEA assumes that inputs remain constant over time and has no mechanism to identify future re-configurations of inputs which could lead to better performance. The present study has concluded that TFDEA is not a suitable method for analyzing technological progress of electric vehicle technologies. This is due to the high sensitivity to exogenous drivers and its limited capability to anticipate the introduction of potentially disruptive design configurations. These limitations are mostly a result of the assumptions that inputs and the rate of change remain constant over time. As a general note on TFDEA, it was observed that TFDEA would not be a useful forecasting tool for emerging technologies with significant economic and socio-political implications. The model could be used for mature technologies which have shown constant progress over time, given that no exogenous forces are expected to influence the technological change. Furthermore, TFDEA could be used for forecasting emerging technologies whose performance can be expressed with very few attributes (at most three times less than the number of products available), and whose performance is not targeted by governmental regulation. With respect to EV forecasting, this study identified that a simple analysis of technological progress is not sufficient to determine the evolution of EV technology. Due to the economic, environmental and political consequences, it is expected that the adoption of electric vehicles will not depend solely on performance, but also on different technological and context factors, such as battery technologies, available infrastructures, standardization opportunities, consumer acceptance, national interests and governmental support. To better understand the development possibilities of EV technology, this study recommends the use of technology forecasting and market shift indicators analysis to identify possible innovations in EV-supporting technologies, such as battery charging stations and smart grit technologies. Furthermore, combined analysis of consumer research and market structure analysis can help identify the market forces expected to affect further advancements of electric vehicles. In addition, monitoring government and industry plans can provide information on potential standardization opportunities and strategies meant to accelerate the adoption of BEVs.","TFDEA; electric vehicles; technology forecasting; technological progress","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

A compelling characteristic of an enhanced BI-solution is distinguished by the adoption of advanced Analytics in business activities to obtain information more easily, to gain more insights in company’s data, and to get more timely and better decision-making support. However, many organizations are still reluctant to adopt Analytics in their organizational structure, culture and mainly to carry out their business activities. For organizations that tend to have corporate culture based on silos, the implemented Analytics are not yet efficiently and effectively utilized and they tend to have concerns in data governance across organization. During the execution of the research project, the common Analytics adoption process was explored and subsequently an Enterprise Analytics adoption model, or denominated as the ADOPT-model, was developed. The conceptual model was designed to provide an overall overview and guidelines for organizations to pamper their Analytics initiatives emerged across various functional units. A holistic approach at the enterprise level has been opted to achieve a consistency of effectiveness across business units within an organization by focusing on the four organizational elements, i.e. structure, process, people, and technology. Accordingly, the main research question was formulated as follows: “how to transform an organization towards an analytical competitor?”. The conceptual ADOPT-model was designed to provide a better representation of the exploration study, as well as to structure the research findings in answering the research (sub-)questions. A research framework was built to provide a systematic and a clear overview for the execution of research project. Desk research and literature study were carried out in the early stage of project execution; subsequently a primary data was collected by conducting qualitative interview sessions with the field experts and relevant stakeholders. All data gathered was analyzed by utilizing the Applied Thematic Analysis approach and a thorough analysis results were explained by illustrating various key nodes and relationships of the themes in the thematic networks. The reflections on the research findings, the quality of the results, as well as a brief reflection on the entire process, were reported. Finally, the conclusions drawn from the data analysis and the recommendation for practitioners were formulated, and then followed by the limitation of the research and the direction for possible further research at the end of this thesis.","(enterprise) analytics; predictive analytics; business intelligence; business operating model; competitive advantage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-09-28","Technology, Policy and Management","Information- and Communication Technology","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Zand, F. (mentor); Te Velde, R. (mentor); Van den Berg, J. (mentor)","2012","The number of cyber-attacks creates the realization that the vulnerability of critical infrastructures of a country are increasing. The numbers of cyber-attacks are so high that governments fear a cyber war. This makes it important for governments to prepare their nation for cyber war. To be able to make the right preparation and to design the right resilient systems it is necessary to know how dangerous other countries can be by measuring their offensive cyber warfare capabilities. This leads to the design of a model based on offensive cyber warfare attributes and public indicators for the assessment of offensive cyber warfare capabilities. The aim of this research is to provide an approach of a maturity model to assess offensive cyber warfare capabilities of countries based on public data, by which governments can make better decisions and policies to prepare themselves for cyber war. The research has been started with an in depth desk research describing the process of cyber warfare, which resulted in a diagram with 6 categories. These categories have been defined based on some literature about traditional warfare and an analogy about individuals in war. The 6 categories describing the process are: Motivation, Channel, Target, Means, Method and Damage. This diagram shows the difference between traditional and cyber war. Only offensive cyber warfare attributes are specified in this diagram. This was necessary for finding the indicators for offensive cyber warfare capability. From these 6 categories only two have been used to define offensive cyber warfare capability. Motivation level does not contribute to capability level, but to the threat level. If one is motivated, it does not necessarily mean that one has the capability. The channel is the environment where the cyber attack is launched. Having access to the channel, having knowledge about it and skills for operating in this medium is necessary to launch a cyber attack. So channel is an important group to consider for assessing offensive cyber warfare capability. The Target actually does not decide on the capability of another. So this is not important for the design of the model. The Means are very important to assess the offensive capability level, because having the ability to create the means, having access to them and the ability to use them shows how capable one is. The Method is the way how the attack is performed for example from behind or from the front and thus is not contributing to the assessment of the capability level. Also Damage is not contributing to the capability of a country, because anyone can cause damage by hiring others. So based on this analysis Channel and Means are important for assessing the offensive cyber warfare capability level. Based on these 2 classification and their details in the diagram the indicators for offensive cyber warfare capability have been identified. This resulted in a theoretical model showing the relation between the indicators and the cyber warfare attributes. As data to direct indicators are limited, an approach of a model has been given based on proxy variable and indirect indicators for which data was available. Finding data for indirect indicators has been difficult as well, but there are 16 indicators for which data has been found. The dataset for offensive cyber warfare capability was not available, so a proxy variable has been used. The closest proxy variable based on the categories Channel and Means is the ICT development index, which describes the access to, use of and skills in ICT. ICT development has been build from 11 indicators, from which 9 are the same for offensive cyber warfare capability. The assumption has been made that the ICT development index is a data collection method for offensive cyber warfare capability. Using the 16 indicators and the proxy variable the model has been designed following some analysis as is shown in the flowchart. The flowchart describes the statistical analysis in SPSS. On the 16 indicators factor analysis was done, which resulted in 4 factors that are the independent variables to explain offensive cyber warfare as the dependent variable. As there is no such dataset for the dependent variable the ICT development index is used in its place. Based on a linear regression the equation has been found; this is the model to assess offensive cyber warfare capability. Due to limitation only an approach of a model for assessing offensive cyber warfare capability has been given, which is based on proxy variable and indirect indicators. The equation in this report is a first approach of a model assessing offensive cyber warfare capability, on which further research can be conducted. The growth in capability level is described by maturity levels. There are 5 maturity levels defined for offensive cyber warfare capability based on the Channel and Means capability, which are: Beginners, Semi-intermediate, Intermediate, Semi-advanced and Advanced. In chapter 1 an introduction has been given, describing the aim of this research, the research questions and the research methods. In chapter 2 the theoretical background has been built resulting in a diagram describing offensive warfare, maturity levels and a theoretical model for assessing offensive cyber warfare capability. Chapter 3 gives an approach of a model and the statistical analysis to be performed. Chapter 4 has been devoted on reflection and the report ends with conclusions and research relevance.","cyber warfare capability; maturity; indicators","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","ICT","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Van der Helm, F.C.T. (mentor); Vallery, H. (mentor); Delgado Lopes, G.A. (mentor)","2012","Currently a lot of research is performed in the field of walking robots and especially on bipedal humanoid robots. Successful walking robots have been made but there are still problems that have to be overcome to make them as versatile, robust and energy efficient as human beings. One of these problems is the control of balance after taking a step during which often instability occurs which can result in a fall. To make TUlip step more reliable the cause of this instability has to be determined and solved. To find the cause of this instability push recovery experiments have been performed on the bipedal humanoid walking robot TUlip. After taking a step the upper body starts performing oscillating translational motions and its feet start tilting which cause TUlip to become unstable resulting in a fall. By analyzing the whole control loop layer by layer it was found that the application of too high ankle torques is the cause of this problem. These too high ankle torques are caused by an incorrect control model of the ankle torques and by incorrect desired ankle torques. The desired ankle torques are incorrect due to an incorrect estimation of the Center of Mass (CoM) and an incorrect estimation of the support polygon. The CoM is used to calculate the Instantaneous Capture Point (ICP) which is a point used in the control of balance and to calculate step locations. The ICP and the support polygon determine the location of the desired Center of Pressure (CoP) which the robot uses to determine its desired ankle torques. Since the CoM and support polygon estimation are incorrect this will automatically result in incorrect desired ankle torques and incorrect step locations. So to improve the balance control the CoM estimation, the support polygon estimation and the ankle torque control model have to be improved. Since improving the CoM estimation is already performed by Bart Vissers [1] and improving the support polygon estimation requires hardware improvements, this thesis focuses on improving the ankle torque actuation model. A new ankle torque actuation model is derived and implemented on TUlip. After tuning the controllers the old and the new situation are compared using push recovery experiments. It was found that using the new ankle torque actuation model the number of ground contact changes for the stance foot after taking a step has been reduced with 56.8 %, the distance traveled by the upper body in x-direction after taking a step has been reduced with 37.2 % and most importantly the percentage of successful steps has increased by a factor four.","push recovery; humanoid robotics; instantaneous capture point; series elastic actuation; torque control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-09-28","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Den Hollander, M. (mentor)","2012","Interface is an international manufacturer of carpet tiles with a long history in sustainability. With its mission Zero, Interface wants to become the first company without a negative impact on the environment by the year 2020. Over the years Interface already made significant progress by means of product innovations and organizational changes. Within this project another step is made, through the development of a financial viable business model that reduces the environmental impact of using a carpet tile floor. The production of a tile is the biggest impact on the environment, due to the needed energy and raw materials. Focusing on the usage of a floor, the goal of this project was formulated as follows: Develop a flooring concept for the office segment that extends the average usage period of a carpet tile from seven to fourteen years. In the current business model Interface’s key resources and activities are related to the production of their broad collection of carpet tiles. This collection and their wide range of additional products and services is what set Interface apart from its competition. Having strong partnerships with architects, installers and other actors within the market is another one of Interface’s characteristics. The carpet market is complex and includes a lot of actors that provide different products and services related to floors. Within the office segment Interface’s carpet tiles are always sold to the end-customers by installers, who are Interface’s direct-customer and an important sales channel to the end-customer. Next to the installers, architects are another important channel to reach the end-customer. When it comes to choosing and exploiting a floor cost are, next to the image of a floor, very important to end-customer. However they often do not take in to account the total cost of a decision. Saving costs on a cleaning budget for instance could lead to higher overall costs as a result of shortening a floors life span. Next to cost the importance of sustainability as a decision factor is growing. Although Interface’s products are of high quality and can last for 15 years, the average usage period is 7. The main reasons for this relative short usage period are the loss of appearance and the changing needs of end-customers. A floors visual performance can deteriorate fast if sensitive products are chosen for intense used areas or because of poor cleaning and lack of maintenance. Next to this the increasing importance of the image of a building and the fast changes in organizations and fashion require a building to become more flexible and lead to higher replacement frequencies. In order to offer flexibility to customers without increasing the production of carpet tiles, the concept Tile Exchange is developed which includes a product pool. Instead of selling carpet tiles Interface will sell customers the right to use a floor for a period of three years, after which the floor can be returned to Interface for further use. This makes it possible to extend the usage period of a carpet tile by increasing the number of customers that will use it. However, the requirements and wishes of customers within the office segment vary a lot. The developed business model is therefore based on a multisided platform that identifies different segments that are served sequentially. High Image customers, who value the appearance of their building and follow the fast changes in fashion, receive a new floor every three years. After three years the floor returns to Interface and will be cleaned and stored in the product pool. Next to the High Image customers, there are the segments True Greens and Functionals. Functional customers want quality for a competitive price to ensure a floor that lasts, while True Greens mainly value sustainability and durability. Both segments are served with the products from the pool and will also pay, however significantly lower usage fee for three years. At the end of each period the contract can be extended, against a lower rate, or ended, after which the products will return to Interface again. Depending on the age of the tiles, they will now enter the ReEntry program in which the product will be recycled or enter the product pool for the last segment; Fast Movers. These customers are purely cost driven and need short to mid-term flooring solutions. When the floor returns from this customer all tiles will be recycled. The new business model requires Interface to further develop its partnerships with selected Installers and maintenance companies, since the installation and exploitation of the floor are very important for the overall success of the model. The relationship with the customer will also change, since Interface now sells their service directly to the end-customer. Furthermore, the revenue streams are changed from a onetime payment to multiple smaller payments over a number of years. Although the margin per produced tile is increased by the new business model, the profit per customer is lower due to the reduced average of tiles produced per customer. This means the new value propositions need to attract additional customers in order for Interface to maintain its current financial performance.?","carpet tiles; sustainability; Product Service System; business model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-09-27","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2012","With laser scanning (including laser altimetry and multi-beam echo sounding), many data points, called point clouds, are measured. The interest in point clouds is increasing. Depending on the laser scanner, the measurement set-up and the technique, the number of points in one dataset can vary from a few hundred points to over a billion points. The data volume of a laser survey mission can easily reach Gigabyte or even Terabyte level. It is a problem to handle these voluminous datasets efficiently. One way to manage the data is to partition the data with tiles or grids and then store the data in each tile or grid as a single file in text or binary format; the large volume of data is divided into separate files of a reasonable size. As an alternative, the data can be stored in a database management system (DBMS); each point in a single record based on standard data types. Since the data stored can be accessed in single point level, it is easy to perform queries and analysis on the data server, and only the qualified points are returned to the user. Since the data is spatial data, it has a location; data can be stored based on a spatial data type in a spatial DBMS, spatial objects can be clustered and spatially indexed to limit searches, with the result that spatial queries can be performed. Storing and retrieving massive datasets as single point records (one point per record) results in storing and retrieving lots of records, but fast retrieval become questionable, as there is overhead per record and because of the number of records to be retrieved. As Oracle is the market leader in the development of DBMS, this research is limited primarily to Oracle. This leads directly to the research question of this thesis: What is the best design for a data model to store large point clouds in an Oracle DBMS, such that it is generally accessible by spatial applications, that all attributes are preserved and that performance is optimised? Analysis A solution has been found by reducing the number of records by clustering nearby points without loss of information. If points are clustered, associated attributes have to be clustered as well. It has been decided how to record these attributes with the points. The Region Quadtree is implemented to grid the data in logical parts. The Morton space-filling curve is implemented to cluster the data. Hilbert space-filling curve would even be better. The points have been stored using a well-known data type called SDO_GEOMETRY (GTYPE 3005, POINTCLUSTER), SDO_GEOMETRY is a standard spatial data type implemented in Oracle. Attributes have been stored in one or more arrays (VARRAY), because ordinates are also stored in a VARRAY. This method is been compared to the newer SDO_PC data type. Conclusion The presented method using SDO_GEOMETRY (GTYPE 3005, POINTCLUSTER) performs optimal for large point cloud datasets in terms of performance and the points can generally be accessed by spatial applications. The alternative method using SDO_PC is not suitable for the conditions as stipulated in the research question. Because the SDO_PC data type is newly implemented in Oracle, not generally readable by spatial applications, not (yet) fully supported by all vendors and required storage space is double the amount.","Oracle; Point Cloud; SDO_GEOMETRY; multi point; space-filling curve","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","GIS-Technology","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Ryan, J.K. (mentor)","2012","A serious complication that patients face after a heart attack is the formation of scar tissue at the damaged part of the heart. This scar leads to stiffening of the damaging region, and thereby it requires more perfomance of the heart muscle, which leads to fatigue and hence to failure and thereby causing immediate death of the patient. To circumvent scar tissue formation, stem cells are injected which trigger the angiogenetic response, leading to fewer invading fibroblast which produce scar tissue in the form of an excess on extra cellular matrix. The goal of this research is to learn more about the number of stem cells that has to be injected into the wound of the heart after a heart attack, aiming to avoid the formation of scar tissue. We develope a model for angiogenesis under the injection of stem cells onto the damaged part of the heart after an infarction. The model is based on reaction-transport equations with a certain degree of hyperbolicity due to chemotaxis as an important mechanism for cell migration. Using the method of characteristics, we will be able to quickly estimate the efficiency of treatment with respect to biological parameters like the number of stem cells injected. The method, which is based on a “snail trail” formalism, was originally set up in one dimension. One of the challenges in this research is to construct a more-dimensional counterpart of the equations. Furthermore, we implemente finite element and discontinuous Galerkin techniques to solve the system of partial differential equations.","discontinuous Galerkin; angiogenesis; heart attack; hyperbolic problem; convection dominated","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-09-19","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Numerical Analysis","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","Motivation: Numerous genetic disorders can be detected in prenatal diagnosis using Chorionic Villus Sampling. As this brings a 1:100 chance for miscarriage, this method is only applied when the fetus is suspected to have an increased chance at having an aberration. It is known that a small percentage of DNA in maternal plasma is of fetal origin and with the upswing of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) it is now possible to diagnose trisomy 21 cases non-invasively using maternal blood samples. Other and smaller aberrations can be detected with this kind of blood samples using high coverage NGS, but this makes these methods more expensive. Our goal was to find a method to detect small aberrations using only shallow sequencing (low coverage NGS), keeping the costs per sample to a minimum. Methods: We developed an approach (called WISECONDOR) that determines whether a small region is aberrated by looking whether the read count within that region differs abnormally compared to the read counts of other similarly behaving regions within the same test sample. The other similarly behaving regions are considered to have similar NGS biases, such as GC-richness, and are found by comparing read count correlations over a set of healthy samples. Results: The developed script was able to correctly identify all tested T13, T18 and T21 cases. Aberrations such as del(13)(q12.3q14.3), i(12p10) and i(18q10) were also correctly called. The amount of false positives was minimal and even zero when the size of the aberrations was at least 20Mb, while the test samples varied from only 0.15 to 1.66 fold coverage. This shows that most fetal fetal copy number aberrations can be detected by shallow sequencing of maternal blood samples.","CNA; bioinformatics; fetal; DNA; Maternal Plasma; NGS; Next Generation Sequencing; Sequencing; Copy Number Aberration; WISECONDOR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Pattern Recognition & Bioinformatics","","Computer Science, MKE, Track Bioinformatics","",""

(mentor); Seck, M.D. (mentor); Steenhuisen, B.M. (mentor); Van Kaam, H. (mentor)","2012","Due to rising costs and an increasing demand for health care services Dutch hospitals are looking for ways to reduce costs while maintaining or increasing the level of patient satisfaction. Reducing variation in bed occupation in common nursing wards could save costs by reducing the amount of required beds and nurse staffing, and increase quality of care by stabilizing the nurse workload. Adjusting current OR schedules offers potential to reduce variation because they have often been developed without explicit consideration for the wards due to the uncertain relationship between them. The main research question is therefor ’How can the management of Dutch hospitals implement adjustments to the operating room schedule in order to reduce the variability of bed occupancy in the patient wards?’. The variability in bed occupation can be seen over years, weeks and days. The weekly variation can be influenced by making adjustments to the master surgical schedule (MSS), a repetitive two weekly schedule that assigns all avail- able OR blocks to a surgical specialism. An OR block is a morning or afternoon session in a certain OR on a certain day. Analysis has shown that for the Sophia hospital, which is used as a case study in this research, only 16% of total admis- sions should be considered because they can be directly influenced by adjusting MSS. Research has shown this group exhibits the most variation. Swapping OR blocks in the MSS is difficult because analysis revealed the MSS was not as repetitive as thought and differed slightly each cycle due to for example specialisms trading or cancelling blocks. To solve this the MSS was reconstructed using historical data over an entire year to find for each block which surgical specialism has used the block the most cycles for elective surgeries. The resulting reconstructed MSS represents the structural influence the MSS has had over that year. This reconstructed MSS can be adjusted by swapping MSS blocks in order to reduce the structural bi-weekly variation caused by the MSS. This variation can be seen in wards, specialism clusters, wings and the entire hospital. This research will focus on making adjustments to the structural master surgical schedule that reduces bi-weekly variation in common wards per surgical specialism cluster. Current literature has a low rate of implementation because the influence of stakeholders is often disregarded, and rarely sees the MSS as a tool to level ward occupancies. Optimization approaches are limited because an optimal MSS is an unobtainable objective given the variety of objectives of stakeholders. This thesis presents a visualization allowing non-technical users to identify beneficial MSS block swaps between blocks from within a single surgical specialism cluster. A decision support tool (DSS) allows stakeholders to quickly evaluate the effect of those swaps on variability in their bed occupation in nursing wards. The DSS does this by adapting an implementation of the mathematical model from van Berkel that is able to relate the master surgical ward to the occupation in the nursing wards. The DSS is able to predict the effect of the structural MSS accurately enough to evaluate changes in structural variation patterns caused by MSS block swaps. Experimentation has shown the method is able to identify a potential reduction in peak occupation by several beds for both the neurosurgery- and common surgery cluster in Isala. Another observation was that an unequal division of MSS blocks over the week caused peaks in occupation that could not be compensated with MSS block swaps. This led to the suggestion of a multi- stage approach to bed leveling through the MSS, where the division over the week of MSS blocks from a specialism cluster or hospital wing is equalized as much as possible. MSS block swaps can then be done between clusters or wings (discussed in appendix D.1), after which swaps within clusters or wings can be applied. The developed decision support tool helps stakeholders with this last step and enables specialisms to find beneficial swaps themselves. The research is supplemented with a process design that addresses how to use and embed research efforts in a hospital environment with a strong influence of stakeholders with conflicting interests. The decision support tool can benefit a hospital looking to realise a certain reduction in peak bed occupancy in order to reduce the amount of beds. The DSS can also support a sustainable process solution with incremental adjustments to the MSS, in order to allow hospital to consider ward occupation when adjusting the MSS. This thesis has not answered the entire scope of the main research ques- tion but has identified a range of possible measures, intervention levels and a multi-stage approach to bed leveling. The method provides practical means to reduce bi-weekly variation in Dutch common nursing wards through the master surgical schedule while accounting for the influence of stakeholders. The results have yielded valuable insights for Isala, where the research will be applied and developed further. Bed leveling is not only an important issue in Isala but also becoming increasingly important in other Dutch hospitals looking to better uti- lize their expensive resources. This research has contributed to the academic field with a unique non-optimization approach to adjusting the MSS in order to reduce variation in bed occupation. Contrary to other research the method takes into account the influence of stakeholders by enabling stakeholder inter- action to find adjustments to the MSS. In conclusion, the developed method might benefit the rapidly evolving Dutch health care sector that is pressured to improve its cost-effectiveness.","master surgical schedule; surgical scheduling; ward occupancy; hospital; decision support systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-09-27","Technology, Policy and Management","Systems Engineering","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

Traditionally, BJT based references are commonly used, but produce an output voltage of 1.2 V and are not suitable for supply voltages below 1 V.

An investigation into the system inertia of a future European energy scenario that integrates a high percentage of renewables was done using the output of a 2030 economic dispatch model to evaluate potential problems. The dispatch model provides a realistic view of possible scheduled generator mixes for three synchronous regions in Europe, as simulated for the year 2030, and allows an analysis of the available system inertia in this future scenario. This analysis yielded a positive view into the state of the synchronous system, and suggests that wind turbine installations alone is not a good predictor of a system synchronous inertia. Also central to the analysis was an investigation of the possible ways wind turbines can contribute a synthetic inertial response in a contingency event. The literature based theoretical inertial capabilities present in wind turbines are used to estimate the resource of synthetic inertia available in future systems. This capability was aggregated after using mesoscale meteorological data for its computation. Across each of the European synchronous regions for the 2030 energy scenario, the coincidence of the synthetic inertial capability was compared to the synchronous inertial capability and the stability of those systems was investigated.","wind energy; power systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Intelligent Electrical Power Grids","",""

(SWIL), Kingston, Jamaica. At this moment the shipping channels in Kingston Harbour, Jamaica, slowly accrete. When the harbour is expanded, the local and global sediment transport is likely to change. During this project it is investigated whether these changes are significant and if they will have a negative influence on the Kingston Harbour area. Also the increase of flood risk for the area surrounding Hunts Bay is investigated. This investigation is done by modeling the hydrodynamics of the Kingston Harbour area with MIKE21 and Delft3D, where after both modeling programs are compared to each other. For the input data for the models, research has been done concerning the boundary conditions. This data is gathered from several projects done in the past about other areas in the harbour and fieldwork in Hunts Bay. During the year, most of the wind comes from the east and south-east direction. There are also two mayor streams which debouch into Hunts Bay, namely the Sandy Gully and the Rio Cobre. Since there is only discharge known about the Rio Cobre (daily values from 1985 to 2010), only the Rio Cobre is taken into account. The maximum measured value was 563 m3/s (during hurricane IVAN) and the average value is about 12 m3/s. For the sediment input data some fieldwork is done in Hunts Bay to gather information about the type of soil. From this it is concluded that it is silt, which is confirmed after a lab research of the sediment. However these accurate soil properties couldn’t be implemented into the models due to the lack of time. During the fieldwork also a bathymetric survey was done, which showed that Hunts Bay is sedimented compared to the previously used bathymetric data, gathered from admiralty charts in 2000. Calibration of both models is done by comparing it with the measured water level and flow velocities underneath the Causeway Bridge. Since this is the only point where data was available for, the calibration kept global, and should be improved in the future. The modeling showed that most of the sediment transport into the shipping channel is caused by the high discharge of the Rio Cobre. Ivan showed the most extreme sedimentation and the biggest change due to the expansion. In the present situation the shipping channel is gradually silting, with two areas where the siltation is concentrated. With the first phase expansion these ‘mountainous’ areas will be much more concentrated. However it can be concluded that the changes in the sediment transport due to the first phase expansion are not significant and will not lead to more problems than there are without this expansion. For this problem a sediment trap is proposed. At first it was placed just eastward of the Causeway Bridge, but this didn’t solve the problem and it would be in the way for the phase two expansion. Therefore a sand trap is designed in Hunts Bay, just westward of the Causeway Bridge. This location is really effective, since it stores the sediment from the rivers. This solution prevents the shipping channel to silt. Again, since the lack of reference data, on the size of the pit nothing can be said.","Jamaica; sedimentation; fine sediment; Hurricane","en","student report","TU Delft, Section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","The present Low Voltage (LV) grid, which until recently was mainly composed of passive electrical components (consumers), is being gradually overrun by active electrical components (prosumers), who not only consume but also generate and share power locally. This development is introducing changes in the operational dynamics of the LV grid that could result in voltage stability problems and the violation of infrastructural constraints if not well managed. A re-design of the present LV grid is, therefore, imperative to enable it meet these new requirements. This thesis was aimed at studying the influence of topological metrics on the operational performance of the LV grid in view of current developments in energy consumer behaviour with a view to proposing the topological changes and/or modifications in network architecture that would yield optimal outcomes. We modelled the present LV grid as a radial network, and compared it to three other network models -random, small-world and scale-free networks- under different loading scenarios. We proposed novel structural and operational metrics that are suitable for the LV grid, and analysed the networks in terms of these metrics. We also compared their robustness under different attack scenarios and demonstrated the correlation between the structural and the operational metrics, thus, identifying important structural metrics that need to be optimized to improve the future LV grid performance. Finally, we then investigated the possible modifications of the radial network model of the present LV grid that would yield similar results. The results highlighted the structural weaknesses of the present LV grid under futuristic and simultaneous loading conditions and presented the scale-free model as the most suitable architecture for the future LV grid as it out-performed all the other network models under similar loading conditions. They also showed that the insertion of additional links at critical positions in the radial network could achieve similar results. We therefore proposed this structural modification as a more cost-effective approach to improved operational performance of the LV grid.","network topology; low voltage grid; structural metrics; operational metrics; smart grid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Network Architectures and Services","",""

While the co-existence of the ETS system with other RES-E support schemes could result in high levels of carbon abatement, it does not rule out all catastrophic high carbon futures. There are potential ‘free lunches’ for policy makers to reduce carbon emissions but these will probably not suffice when ambition levels are high. Synergies between the ETS system and RES-E support schemes are possible to largely reduce carbon emissions when conditions for high penetration levels of renewables need to be fulfilled. However risks of high costs for society and producers are very real without additional measures in the co-existence of the ETS with RES-E support schemes.","deep uncertainty; energy transition; EU power sector; ESDMA; robust policy design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-09-26","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy analysis","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor); Meijer, S.A. (mentor); Jagtman, H.M. (mentor); Nugteren, H.W. (mentor); Van den Hoogen, J. (mentor)","2012","ProRail is the railway management company of the Netherlands. It is responsible for the construction, maintenance, management, and safety of the Dutch railway system. ProRail has as a goal an annual five per cent increase in the number of transported passengers up to 2020. This goal cannot be reached with the current way of transporting passengers. There is no room to expand the infrastructure, so the manner in which it is used must change. This means that during the decision making, the impact on individuals connected to the system must be taken into account. ProRail makes these decisions in collaboration with other actors. This means that ProRail is involved in a process of multi-actor decision making. This is an uncertain process. The uncertainty stems from three main causes: substantive uncertainty (ambiguity and lack of information on a project), strategic uncertainty (unpredictable behaviour of other actors), and institutional uncertainty (unknown decision making procedure). Because the Dutch railway network is a socio-technical system, the substantive uncertainty stems from social elements, technical elements, and exogenous elements. As no clear definition has been found in literature, this research proposes a definition for these elements based on the way in which an element can respond. A degree of freedom (DOF) is defined as the possibility to respond in an allowed way that is not included in the task description of the element. Technical elements are designed with zero DOF and social elements with more than zero DOF. Exogenous elements are elements that are not designed in the system but do influence it. In this research the value of the HAZOP methodology for decision makers at ProRail involved in multi-actor decision making is assessed based on literature and a trial application. To make this assessment the causes of uncertainty in decision making in projects initiated by ProRail are investigated. Second, the methods and practices currently used by ProRail to reduce uncertainty and make decisions are evaluated. Third, the potential of the HAZOP methodology to reduce substantive uncertainty was assessed. Last, it was investigated if the HAZOP methodology could improve the decision making process. ProRails tasks can be subdivided into two core tasks: (1) the daily operation of the network including controlling and correcting the flow of trains; (2) the execution of projects. The methods and practices currently used by ProRail to reduce uncertainty in decision making in projects do not sufficiently reduce the level of ambiguity. This results in a level of uncertainty too high to make good decisions. This study proposes the HAZOP methodology as an alternative decision making tool for decision making on projects and explores its value for decision makers at ProRail involved in multi-actor decision making. The HAZOP analysis and a suitable two-phase method of interaction are proposed and discussed based on a literature review. The first phase of this method is an individual preparation. This phase reduces the probability that important elements of the system and variables are overlooked. The process of combining the individual definitions into a joint image of the problem in the preparation phase allows a reduction of the ambiguity of the problem. The second phase is a group-based discussion. This discussion allows tacit knowledge to be made explicit for the other members of the group, and allows the joint creation of knowledge. Both of these processes reduce the lack of information. It is thus theoretically feasible to reduce uncertainty using the HAZOP methodology. A trial session was organised to apply the methodology and validate the theoretical results. The results from the application support the results from the literature review. The creation of a joint image was observed as the combination of different definitions into a single shared definition. Ambiguity was reduced, which was observed by an increased ease of communication, especially on more technical subjects. Social subjects remained a difficulty, but this could be caused by a lack of expertise of the participants. During the discussion one of the participants shared previous experience and made his knowledge explicit. This allowed the other participants to change their definition, a process that was not seen in literature. The analysis could not be performed due to time constraints, therefore a reduction in the lack of information and the joint creation of knowledge were not observed. However, the new information becoming available by making knowledge explicit makes it plausible that the lack of information can be reduced by the HAZOP methodology. To assess the value of the HAZOP methodology the chance that the advice will be accepted was investigated, as well as whether the methodology has a positive effect on the decision making process. The acceptance of the advice could not be predicted because it was not possible to predict a priori the trust decision makers will have in the advice. The value was assessed based on the feasibility to include joint fact-finding, redundancy, and parallel linking. In the current form, the methodology allows for joint fact-finding and to a limited extent redundancy, parallel linking seems infeasible due to the required time of the analysis. The conclusion of this study is that the value of the HAZOP methodology in the current form is too low to implement it. However, it is a promising tool for the reduction of uncertainty in the decision making process. To increase the value of the methodology, the time required for the analysis should be decreased. Limiting the required time seems to be feasible by limiting the discussion time per deviation. This is one of the recommendations for future research made at the end of this research. The results of this research present key insights for the decision makers at ProRail. The first is that the current methods and practices of ProRail of reducing uncertainty are insufficient because they do not reduce ambiguity. Reducing ambiguity requires the collaboration of different departments or with different external parties. Second, two dilemmas were identified that should be recognised and considered prior to initialising research. These dilemmas are (1) the choice between better suitable and more familiar participants and (2) the choice between a faster or a more thorough analysis of the alternatives. These dilemmas are not unique for the HAZOP and thus do not speak in favour or against it. Last, the definition of social elements based on the task description rather than the fact that an individual performs the task allows for a closer look at the task descriptions of the elements.","multi-actor decision making; decision making process; railway system; socio-technical systems; uncertainty; HAZOP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Department of Multi-Actor Systems","","Management of Technology","",""

Automatic simdization–the act of exploiting loop level parallelism by issueing SIMD instructions that operate on multiple data elements at once– remains a daunting task for compilers, especially because SIMD instructions impose restrictions on the organization of the data elements. The CoSy simdization flow is able to effectively transform and simdize a program such that parallelism that is directly exposed in the inner loop is exploited, but it may not be able to exploit parallelism that is exposed at higher levels of a loop. This thesis proposes a new pass in the simdization flow that exposes such parallelism in a form in which it can be exploited. To achieve such transformations and determine which transformation should be applied, the polyhedral approach has been used. A polyhedral representation of loop nests allows for precise dependence analysis and application of transformations. To find the best transformation, we have proposed a cost estimation model that estimates the simdizability and cost of a transformation based on the polyhedral representation of the original loop nest. A prototype of this pass has been implemented, and using a number of tests the new flow has been shown to allow simdization in the CoSy flow where previously no simdization could take place.","SIMD; simdization; loop-nest transformations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

Two zinc-bearing spinels are covered: zinc ferrite ZnO·Fe2O3 to a limited extent and gahnite ZnO·Al2O3 as the main subject, compounds which are found naturally on the Earth’s crust as well as in industrial residues from the zinc industry, steel industry and others. Zinc ferrite contains 27 % of Zn and 33 % as ZnO; resource recovery from ferrite has been studied already in the past. On the other hand, the processing of gahnite, containing 35 % of Zn and 44 % as ZnO, is studied more extensively since research in the field of extractive metallurgy is effectively non-existent. Hence, the main objective of the present thesis is finding routes of treatment for this spinel. Zinc ferrite was produced synthetically at the CiTG/3mE labs by mixing equimolar amounts of ZnO and Fe2O3 at 1100 °C. Gahnite was produced by an analog method, a mixture of equimolar amounts of ZnO and Al2O3. The first approach was hydrometallurgical. Atmospheric hot acid leaching (4 M, 95 °C, 120 min, L/S 40) was performed with H2SO4, HCl and HNO3, resulting in a non-detected dissolution of the compound. Pressure leaching (90 min, L/S 40) was carried out in an autoclave with H2SO4 and HNO3, resulting in a low (2.9 %; 0.75 M, 140 °C, 3.6 bar) and a moderate extraction (22.2 %; 4.0 M, 250 °C, 39.7 bar) respectively. The second approach was pyrometallurgical processing (60 min dwell, 10 °C/min heating rate), divided into two sub-routes. A series of carbothermic tests (1:1.25 stoichiometric ratio) successfully led to a full reduction of the spinel at 1300 °C (99.90 % extraction of zinc). Aluminothermic tests (1.5:2 stoichiometric ratio) successfully resulted in a 99.98 % zinc extraction at 1200 °C. The mix of gahnite and ferrite with carbon at 1300 °C produced a 99.65 % extraction of the metal. Addition of ZnO to the previous mixture resulted in a 100 % extraction, at 1300 °C. Further experiments with gahnite at 1200 °C by adding SiO2, first with carbon and later with aluminium, resulted in a moderate 23.14 % and a low 4.69 % extraction correspondingly. Trials with CaO at 1400 °C created a glass residue and a slag, in each case. It is thus possible to establish the zinc extraction from gahnite ZnO·Al2O3 as follows: Route / Zinc extraction Atmospheric acidic leaching / Non-detected Pressure leaching / Low – Moderate Reduction with aluminium and silica / Low Reduction with carbon and silica / Moderate Carbothermic reduction / Full Aluminothermic reduction / Full","gahnite; spinel; zinc; zinc extraction; resource recovery; extractive metallurgy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","European Mineral Engineering Course","",""

(mentor); Goossens, R.H.M. (mentor)","2012","A large number of studies have shown that home telemonitoring helps patients gain control and moreover: helps to reduce health problems associated with the illness. Implementation rates in daily practice have been low though. Literature indicates that traditional business models do not fit with self-directed patients and e-health solutions. This book is the result of the graduation project and exam of Evelien Griffioen for the Master program Strategic Product Design at the Delft University of Technology. This graduation project was performed in co-operation with Philips: a world leading company in healthcare, lifestyle and lighting. The assignment of this project has been to investigate the healthcare sectors in four European countries with regard to telemedical needs and solutions, to identify similarities and differences and to suggest sustainable business models that can work across countries. Through standard literature research methods the four healthcare systems were examined. By designing stakeholder maps of these healthcare systems it was possible to visualise the differences. In the examination of the stakeholders in the context of heart failure disease management new tools were designed to enable the involvement of the subjects into the creation of the results: visual maps of routines, stekeholders in the heart failure context and patient journeys. The methods for developing the customer value propositions and business models were based on the ideas provided by Mark W. Johnson in his book ‘Seizing the White Space’, but redesigned for this purpose to a five step plan. In total 10 models are presented in this book. Matching these models to the four countries, one model is suggested to be the most sustainable business model for introducing home telemonitoring to the market: the Product Lease Model. Introducing several additional criteria however leads to suggesting a different business model to Philips: the Software Support Model. These two models suggest customer value propostions to different beneficiaries: the patient with a mild to medium condition or the hospital providing heart failure disease management healthcare services to severly ill patients. These suggestions lead to two scenarios on service design, profit formula and key processes and resources. Based on the findings in this project it is recommended to Philips to emphasise the compliance issue. The results suggest several ideas on doing so through different designs of a compliance feature for the home telemonitoring service. Eventhough the Software Support Model has a better fit with Philips current business structures and strategies, it is recommended to Philips to further research the possibilities of implementing the Product Lease Model. Chances are that this model could provide a solution for a much larger target market and be more suitable to solve a real and important problem in heart failure disease management: lack of compliance to the therapy.","business model; healthcare; heart failure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2012","Topology optimization is a valuable tool that can assist engineers in the design of many complex problems. However optimization techniques often have difficulties dealing with problems that have a strong tendency to localize in the global design domain forming a sparse design. Typically an extremely fine mesh is needed to capture these results, with high computational costs. Examples are seen in spanning of large bridges, reinforcements of thin plates, and the branching effect of a heat conduction problem. The aim of this explorative review is to identify different possibilities to improve the computational efficiency. Next to reviewing current techniques, also two novel ideas were developed and evaluated. The first idea is inspired by techniques present in fields such as computer graphics. In this field 3D objects used in animation are represented by skeleton models to reduce the complexity of the problem. Similar techniques are investigated to determine if such an approach can be used within topology optimization to develop an optimum structure. The second idea employs an adaptive substructuring technique in a less traditional manner. The computational domain is split in a part that is changing and one that is static during the optimization process. The overall goal of both proposed approaches is to improve the solution process by reducing the number of variables needed to be solved to obtain the response of the design. From these investigations and research many ideas are presented which bring benefit to the sparse problem in optimization. The idea of skeleton modeling is a potential method but has several issues in developing the model and obtaining the temperature response. The sub-structuring approach is a promising development offering significant improvements with up to approximately 67% time savings in the finite elements were shown for a design problem using 1% of the orignal volume.","topology optimization; heat conduction; sub-structuring; skeleton modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

One of the most important reasons mentioned for this is “making the wrong study choice”. Proper information can help high school students to make a “right” choice. The Delft University of Technology, together with the Erasmus University Rotterdam, recently started up a new joint bachelor program “Nanobiology”. This program is used as background for a case study to research what information strategy could be used to lower dropout rates, using the following question. Research Question: “In order to contribute towards preventing dropout in the future Nanobiology student population, by a) encouraging prospective students with a high probability to be successful in the program, to consider enrolment, while b) discouraging prospective students who have a low probability to be successful in the program, from enrolment: which information elements about the Nanobiology program should be emphasized in communication with high school students?” Methods: Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used, including: a literature study to uncover “choice” and “success” factors; a qualitative analysis of what core elements constitute the Nanobiology program and a quantitative analysis of the outcome of a questionnaire sampling the target population. Indicators of 1) interest and 2) success probabilities with respect to the Nanobiology program were measured amongst 5 VWO students with NT and/or NG profiles using the survey. The respondent population was segmented according to these two dimensions, using cluster analysis in SPSS. The 38 elements found to describe the Nanobiology bachelor were reduced to a few theme’s using factor analysis in SPSS. Outcome: The cluster analysis revealed four segments, two of which scored high on indicators of interest in the program. The first of these, the “dream” segment, also scored positive on indicators of success probability while the second, the “risky” segment, scored negative on the success indicators. The factor analysis produced five grand theme’s describing the Nanobiology program: Biomedical-/Molecular Biology, Exact/STEM, Fundamental/Science, Innovative/Specialist and International, Of these the “Exact/STEM” theme received a positive score from the “dream” cluster and a negative score from the “risky” cluster. Conslusion: Emphasizing this theme in informative communication with the target group is therefore expected to contribute towards the goal of lowering dropout rates, benefitting both the program and the students.","Science Education and Communication; quantitative; qualitative; choice process; study success; dropout; higher education marketing; information strategy; nanobiology; cluster analysis; factor analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-09-25","Applied Sciences","Science Education and Communication","","Communication Track","",""

(mentor); Ruiter, I. (mentor); Van Sandick, E. (mentor)","2012","This master thesis is carried out for independent research organisation TNO, who initiated the Biogas Socket project in 2008. The Biogas Socket project is part of TNO’s ‘Innovation for Development programme’, wherein high tech development and low-tech innovations contribute to stimulate economic growth and prosperity in BoP countries. This project targets the upper part of the BoP; subsistence farmers that own at least two cows and have a small additional income. They own a domestic biogas digester and are not connected to the grid. The combination of having a surplus of biogas and a lack of electricity in rural areas is where TNO identified room for innovation. Rather then letting the methane being released into the atmosphere, TNO started a product development project wherein the left over biogas is used to generate electricity; The Biogas Socket. The Biogas Socket is a sustainable, robust and inexpensive device that uses the heat of a biogas flame to transform the gas into electricity; enough to provide rural villagers with basic lighting and to power their low energy household appliances. Having the possibility to charge a phone at home saves a family recurring costs for charging and hours of traveling towards the charging station in the village. Owning a good lighting solution and having more time gives a family the possibility to undertake income generating or social activities at night and enables children to study. Goal of the graduation project is to elaborat¬e on the user perspective of the Biogas Socket and define the user-product interactions. By involving the end users, a technical prototype developed by TNO, is taken a step further towards a user-friendly product. One part of the graduation assignment is a research on the needs, wishes and concerns of rural families in Rwanda. These findings lead to a list of product requirements and a design proposal for a user friendly Biogas Socket, covering design improvements in the field of human-product interaction. The user insights and design ideas are to be used by a design company who will further develop the product. A one-to-one model of the design proposal and a user scenario are made. The relatively long local presence during this graduation project makes it possible to gain insights on the process from both the Dutch as the Rwandan point of view. Observations of the current co-creation process lead to a suggestion for a new process approach. Part of the graduation assignment is to develop a protocol that facilitates field research, similar to that what is conducted for the graduation project. The protocol can help TNO and partners to do similar research in other countries. For the next step in the Biogas Socket project, wherein prototypes will be tested with end-users, two test protocols are needed; one protocol to guide the first testing phase wherein a functioning prototype is tested in rural households, and a second protocol for the testing phase wherein 10 optimised prototypes are placed and tested in context.","biogas; electricity; Rwanda; Africa; Base of the Pyramid; BoP; contextmapping; design; interaction; co-creation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-09-21","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Schott, D.L. (mentor)","2012","This study aims to understand the material behaviour of ore inside a coarse ore stockpile by discrete element modelling. This is of importance since the stockpile is the last stage to control the size distribution of ore in the ore handling system before feeding the grinding circuit. An optimal size distribution is required for efficient grinding in an autogenous grinding (AG) mill. To investigate the material behaviour in the stockpile this work focussed on the flow mode inside the stockpile and the size distribution during discharge. The individual particle characteristics are important to apply in the modelling; hence the discrete element method is very well suited for this type of modelling due to its distinct particle character. In this work the discrete element package used is EDEM, which is a discrete element modelling package developed by the commercial company DEM Solutions. In order to study this aim, several measures in the modelling were taken. The size distribution was divided into the three important sizes, as they are determined by the AG mill. Fines are sized 30mm, pebbles are 80mm and coarse particles are 130mm. A calibration of the parameters of these particles was carried out in order to acquire the correct bulk density, angle of repose and static wall friction of the material in the simulations. Furthermore, an effective simulation model was found by the application of two measures. Firstly, the use of a 3D slice instead of a full 3D simulation showed good results. The second measure was to simulate only coarse sized material to represent each of the particles sizes, which also proved to be very well applicable. Based on segregation mechanisms two different methods to fill the stockpile were determined; batch and mixed filling. The influence of these filling methods was simulated for different flow modes in order to review the impact on the discharged size distribution. It was found that the best suitable mill feed was obtained by batch filled stockpiles, especially since core flow was the expected flow mode. Furthermore, it was found that the ratio between input and output rate has a significant impact on the size distribution at the discharge, since this ratio determines whether there is a ‘last-in, first-out’ system. High input rates result in heap formation, which leads to segregation of coarse sized material. Therefore, at a high input rate it is advised to feed finer material. Feeding of coarser material at moments with a low input rate result in a more optimal size discharge, then when this is done at moments with high input rate.","EDEM; discrete element method; bulk material; material flow; stockpile; size distribution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Resource Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","This thesis focuses on assessing the crack width and durability at the outside of an immersed tunnel in case of fire inside the tunnel. Previous research (for instance Nieman [20]) addressed only the heating phase of a tunnel while also the inevitable cooling phase may have a large influence on the crack width. A user supplied code was written to calculate both the heating and cooling phase and handle the different reversibilities of the material properties. The material model is based on an explicit strain model where some simplifications had been made such as uniaxiality and the omission of the Poisson ratio. This material model is validated on some small models; the tunnel calculations are performed by making use of the geometry of the Wijkertunnel. The results of the tunnel calculations showed good agreement with the results of TNO 2007 [26] for the own weight and pressure loading. During the heating phase the results start to deviate from [26]; partly due to differences in the material model (load induced thermal strains reduces compressive stresses in the walls), partly due to instabilities in the calculation process. The load induced thermal strain decreases the thermal strain under compressive stresses and first time heating. One analysis could follow the complete fire, heating and cooling phase. During the heating and cooling phase the convergence behaviour was poor which is partly due to the complex material behaviour. The material model should be improved to obtain a more stable calculation process. During the cooling phase the tensile stresses increased in the roof and decreased in the walls of the heated tunnel tube as expected. The crack width at the outside of the tunnel is cumulative over a specific area. A lower limit is calculated and a crack width of more than 1 mm is found. This could influence the durability of the tunnel. To support this indication more calculations should be performed. The effect of the load induced thermal strain shows in a decrease of the tensile stresses in vertical direction in the walls and the compressive stresses in the side wall which are present for a longer time. In the mid wall an increase in compressive stress can be seen as a consequence of the net shrinkage which is a consequence of the load induced thermal strain during the cooling phase. It is possible to analyse the crack width during a fire. However more tests need to be performed to get a better understanding about the behaviour of the material properties during heating (high temperatures) and cooling. The code must be validated more thoroughly and only when the deformations of the walls can be explained for sure, a good assessment of the crack width after a heating and cooling phase can be made. In this thesis a foundation is laid for assessing the crack width in immersed tunnels during a heating and cooling phase. No such model existed until now. This model should be perfected, particular with respect to convergence, in order to obtain a more stable calculation and reliable results.","tunnel; cracks; fire; cooling phase; unheated side","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural mechanics","",""

The final output of the project is the design of a strategy to support the Chamber of Commerce in the implementation of a new service to the district of Prato. Faced with current economical and social pressures, the Chamber of Com- merce of Prato expressed the need for internationalizing the district. Prato is an industrial district in Northeastern Italy, highly specialized in fashion manufacturing. However, the general fall in demand and competitive pres- sure of new supply markets had immediate repercussions on the exports and economic situation of Prato’s industrial district. The research question addressed in this study is: How can stakeholders be better engaged in the experience of a service provided by a public sector organization? In order to provide an answer to this question, a literature research was done and a case study was performed. To reach the objective, the project is structured in three main phases: re- search, design, implementation strategy. The service, named Fashion Valley, was developed during the collaboration period and used as a case study for this research. From the literature and context analysis, a list of design guidelines to reach a greater engagement and thus create better experiences was developed. These guidelines lead to the creation of Fashion Valley, a discovery and management web-platform for the companies of Prato and external designers. The service creates new business opportunities in the district and facilitates the manufacturing process. The value exists for designers, companies and con- sequently to the Chamber of Commerce. Fashion Valley promotes the district and fosters new business relationships. The business model developed is the unification of all the steps which need to be taken in order to achieve a cohesive service strategy. Steps can be clus- tered in three diðerent levels: the technology implementation, engagement initiatives and long-term strategy, and are represented in the service road. Technology refers to all the backend development and design work needed in order to build the web platform where the service will exist. Engagement initiatives are meant to promote the district, create connections between us- ers (e.g. workshops and pilot group) and happen through the existence of the service. They widen the already existing service touchpoints to not only digital but also physical experiences. Moreover a greater engagement of stakeholders will least to the continuity and exploration of the service opportunities over time. Furthermore the project outlines a strategy for the coming four years, thus the chamber will still need to be flexible towards any changes that might occur. The graduation research on the basis of this project has unveiled challenges inherent to the management of service design approaches within the public sector.","service design; experience; engagement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2012","Needle wells are conventional well-bores that contain several hundreds of laterals, called needle holes. The reservoir contact area is increased by these holes, which enables enhanced hydrocarbon production. The needle holes are created by dedicated pipes that are equipped with nozzles. These pipes are mounted in a special liner that is lowered downhole. By pumping fluid-abrasive particle mixtures through the nozzles, the formation is eroded away and causes the needle to propagate into the reservoir. The transport of fluid-particle mixtures in the narrow annulus of a needle geometry might result in challenges with regards to hole cleaning. Also, pressure losses for these mixtures are challenging to predict. The purpose of this study was to experimentally investigate the effects of flow rate variations, needle inclinations and needle eccentricity on pressures and hole cleaning in the annulus between a needle and the hole that it creates. From a literature study was determined that the combination of water with 4 vol.% steel particles might be a good mixture for the purpose of needle jetting. Due to strong acceleration of the mixture in the nozzles of the needle, the impact of the particles cause the formation to break and the water subsequently can enter the cracks to remove the rock cuttings. Typical pressures that have to be applied over the nozzles are in the order of 350 bar. The material properties for steel particles and water were used as input for a needle system design calculation. The needle diameter was set at 10 mm and from pressure loss calculations, and the aim to apply maximum pressure drop over the nozzle, the annulus outer diameter was defined to be 16 mm. Typical flow rates needed per needle are in the order of 30 L/min. Steel particle sizes for this system were calculated to be ~ 0.2 mm. A program of experiments was defined wherein flow rates were varied between 10-30 L/min in steps of 10 L/min. Steel particle concentrations were set at 4 vol.% and particle sizes ranged from 0.2-0.3 mm. These experiments were run in a specially designed setup, wherein the annulus eccentricity and inclinations can be varied over their full range. Experiments were conducted for a concentric annulus in horizontal, vertical and 45 degree critical angle setting. For a fully eccentric annulus, the transport in horizontal and critical angle setting were investigated. In the vertical and critical angle experiments, the flow-direction was set against the force of gravity. Over a small length in the annulus, movies of the particle distributions were recorded by high speed camera. Stationary beds, moving beds and an asymmetric suspension of particles only occurred at 10 L/min & 20 L/min for horizontal eccentric setting and at 10 L/min for critical angle eccentric setting. The pressure losses for water-steel particle mixtures in concentric annuli were all higher than the losses for water flow. However, for increasing flow rates, this difference decreased. During water-steel particle experiments at 10 L/min in horizontal concentric setting, the annulus plugged. This resulted in rapid particle buildup in the annulus and should therefore be avoided. When flowing at 10 L/min in vertical concentric setting, the pressure losses were lower than for flowing at 10 L/min at horizontal and critical angle concentric settings. A pressure loss model for homogeneously suspended particles matched within 10% accuracy with the results from vertical concentric setting. Furthermore, it was expected that at the critical angle, particle beds would slide back into the hole. This was not observed during the experiments.","reservoir stimulation; fluid-particle; annulus; jetting; abrasives","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-21","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

The first step in this process was to map out the situation at the start as well as the information needs of the end user. The design of the dashboard, comprised of a visualization and set of gesture interactions, is based on the information needs of the end user. The design was implemented using standardized web technologies. This approach has resulted in a web application usable on mobile as well as desktop devices with touchscreens. Finally an end user validation of the system was performed to determine whether the application fulfills the needs determined at the beginning. Testing with the dashboard revealed that there were a few points on which the dashboard can be improved. Users want to explore the information with more detail. Another point is that the users required more axes to fulfill their information need.

(mentor); Schouten, A.C. (mentor); Mugge, W.

Research investigating reflexes via transient perturbations elicit muscle activations typically observed as two distinct responses in an electromyography with the short-latency response M1 viewed as stereotyped and task-independent and the long-latency response M2 seen as task-dependent. In contrast, task-dependency of short-latency pathways (specifically velocity and force feedback) was demonstrated by studies using continuous perturbations and system identification techniques to separate reflex from voluntary contributions. This study addressed the opposing experimental findings by isolating reflex contributions in the human wrist joint using both the transient and the continuous approach simultaneously in conditions where reflex modulation is expected. Subjects (n = 11) held a manipulator handle which applied mechanical perturbations and imposed a virtual mechanical environment to the wrist. Increasing damping of the environment and reduced continuous perturbation bandwidth in a ""maintain position"" task (PT) decreased the subject’s mechanical joint admittance, increased excitatory velocity and force feedback obtained from a neuromuscular model, increased M2 but did not affect M1. Instructing subjects to ""maintain force"" increased the joint admittance, decreased M2 and counterproductive to the task increased M1 with respect to the PT. Results from this study indicate that the continuous approach does not condition M1 and that the reflexive feedback from short-latency pathways obtained via the presented neuromuscular model does not directly map to the M1 elicited by transient perturbations.","stretch reflex","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-07","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Daalhuizen, J.J. (mentor); De Jong, E. (mentor)","2012","In rural areas in Kenya, only 6% of the rural population has access to electricity. Hence there is a large market for electricity solutions such as solar and wind power. RIWIK is Dutch start-up that produces and sells Small Wind Turbines (SWTs) in Kenya. An SWT can produce enough electricity for one family or business. RIWIK’s business is based on a local-for-local concept. It means that local craftsmen are responsible for the production and sales of the wind turbines. Hence RIWIK’s SWTs enhance both rural electrification and employment. Currently RIWIK focuses on prosperous households. These households can afford RIWIK’s products without the need for external financing. RIWIK wants to expand the focus to the Micro & Small Enterprise (MSE) market for two reasons. First, the MSE market is large. MSEs account for a contribution of 13% to the Kenyan GDP. Second MSEs can use electricity to increase productivity, expand their products & services and increase their income. However focusing on the MSE market is expected to be complicated. MSEs will need support in purchasing, using and maintaining the product, since they have little financial, educational and technical resources. This research aims at designing a Product Service System (PSS) for RIWIK that contributes to successfully introducing RIWIK’s products on the MSE market. A large part of the data was collected in Kenya, during a field research of 2,5 months. The research analyses the composition of the MSE market and RIWIK’s strengths and weaknesses as a company. Moreover a closer study is done on the interaction between RIWIK and the rural MSE market. The research finds there are three business categories that are most common in rural areas in Kenya: general supply stores, catering businesses, and clothing businesses. There is a need for electricity in the MSE market but there is a lack of infrastructure such as financing, supporting products, training etc. While the MSE market is defined as one of RIWIK’s targetgroups, it is unclear what the business model for the market looks like. Furthermore RIWIK is a technically focused company, in which room for cultural knowledge and clear vision could enhance business success. It is concluded that an end-to-end solution is needed, meaning that RIWIK’s PSS needs supporting products and services for MSEs in order to make their SWTs useful. The research presents an overview of the interaction process between RIWIK and the MSE market. From the overview practical steps for the realization of the Product Service System are derivatived. The steps consist of strategic partnerships & decisions, as well as 47 touch points, RIWIK can design. Two touch points are worked out as an example and finally a business model for the MSE market is presented. In the end the report presents the main conclusions and recommendations for further research.","electricity; MSE; business; wind; products; services; rural; Kenya; market","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2012","One of the first mathematical models to describe the interest rate over time was the Vasicek model (1978). Soon after, the Cox Ingersoll Ross (CIR) model (1985) was introduced. The Vasicek model and the CIR model belong to the family of short interest rate models. Through transformation these models can be applied to compute the interest rate values. Classical techniques such as the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) and Least Squares Method (LSM) are used to estimate the parameters in the short rate model from the historical data. One must understand that the short rate values cannot be observed from the financial market. However, we can observe the bond prices and from these we can compute the interest rates values. It turns out that when the short interest rate values are not known, MLE and LSM cannot be used to estimate the parameters in the CIR model. Rabobank encountered this problem. My assignment was to estimate the parameters in the CIR model using the historical data collected by Rabobank. When doing calibration using MLE or LSM for the Vasicek model, it turns out that the drift parameters are estimated with very high bias. Rabobank uses the Long Term Quantile (LTQ) method, which is expected to have no bias. My assignment was to test this claim and see whether there is a bias and if so I had to eliminate this bias.","Kalman filter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-09-18","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","Finance","",""

(mentor)","2012","In process engineering applications numerical models are needed to make extensive analysis for the design and operation of unit operations. In the present work, a transversal granular flow model and two numerical models for the description of the granular bed of a rotary kiln are developed for the analysis of a Calcium Aluminate rotary kiln from an industrial partner. From the transversal granular flow model it is concluded that the kiln from the industrial partner is probably not in rolling mode. This hints the possibility that there is a non-optimized mixing in the kiln which could bring adverse consequences in the production and current modelling of the studied rotary kiln. A validated one-dimensional rotary kiln model is developed taking into account different approaches from literature. Simplified sintering reactions are proposed by considering experimental X-Ray Diffraction data. The one-dimensional model is successfully used to describe the properties of the product when changing air to gas ratio of the combustion gasses in the kiln from the industrial partner. Furthermore, a two-dimensional transversal model for granular bed heat transfer is developed to explore whether a full granular flow model is necessary in order to have a sufficiently accurate description of the granular material properties of the kiln from the industrial partner. It is concluded that due to the low loading of the analyzed CAC kiln, a one-dimensional is sufficient to make a sensitivity analysis on the operating conditions and design varaibles of the kiln if the bed has a rolling mode with an active layer of 5 to 20 percent of the bed height. Further research must be done in order to characterize the transversal flow of the analyzed kiln in order to develop more complex kiln models.","granular flow; rotary kiln; numerical modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-09-22","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","DIAM","","COSSE","",""

(mentor)","2012","Ecological monitoring, i.e. the process of assessing the quality and health of natural habitats, is required to assess the impact of anthropogenic influence. This process is often inhibited by the expenses involved and a limited accessibility to the study site. The use of remotely sensed data then logically comes to mind as a potential solution. This thesis focuses on the ecological monitoring of an intertidal mudflat located in the Oosterschelde known as the Galgeplaat. It possesses a monitoring platform standing 15 meters tall producing imagery that was previously used for monitoring the morphology of the mudflat. The goal is to examine the potential of using this available terrestrial imagery for ecological monitoring of the mudflat and whether it is possible to do this automatically. Two separate case studies were formulated to investigate this potential; 1. automatic detectionof microphytobenthos and 2. automatic detection of bird numbers. The primary focus in this thesis was put on the microphytobenthos case study which elicited the most interest from involved parties. The main inhibiting factor for microphytobenthos detection was the presence of macroalgae (in particular brown macroalgae) in the images, which possess similar spectral properties to that of microphytobenthos. Two methods were used to detect microphytobenthos: I. maximum likelihood classification combined with the masking of the macroalgae (the undesired target) and II. Kohonen’s self organising maps (SOM). The results of this case study indicated that distinguishment between microphytobenthos and macroalgae was best achieved with the Self organizing map (SOM) approach. For the detection of bird numbers consecutive snapshot images of the camera were used such that the motion of birds could be taken advantage of. Background subtraction using a weighted mean background image and a standard deviation image was the most promising of the methods used to count the birds in the 20 frame video sequences. The video sequences with the least zoom (far scale) produced the most erroneous detections. This probably as a result of the lack of movement visible in the video and the small size of the birds (more interference from noise). The results suggest ecological monitoring, in this case of microphytobenthos cover and bird numbers on the Galgeplaat, is indeed possible by using the available terrestrial imagery from the platform. In the current state of development however, the process cannot be claimed fully automatic yet as some a priori knowledge from the user’s part is still required. Regardless, the use of remotely sensed imagery for ecological monitoring proves promising in comparison with current ecological monitoring for several reasons. Provided that unsuitable images are filtered out (images where raindrops are on the camera lens, or other irreparable images) the problem of limited accessibility to the mudflat is ruled out. This makes it possible to produce high time resolution data. Additionally, no costs are required for lab work or transport to the mudflat for bird counting and the collection of specimen.","image processing; ecology; automatic detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","Msc.

(mentor)","2012","Robust automatic detection of surface and air objects in a maritime environment is a problem that is of growing importance to the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNLN). Due to a shift in the field of operation from the open oceans towards the littoral waters, the RNLN is forced to operate in complex environments with cluttered backgrounds and the presence of many small vessels and a wide range of other objects. Traditional radar systems are not optimal in these circumstances due to their minimum detection range, lack of sensitivity to small, non-metallic, objects and poor classification power. Complementation by Electro-Optical (EO) camera systems is therefore desired, which resulted in the start of the development of a detection algorithm based on polynomial background estimation. Automated object detection in the maritime environment is a complex problem however, due to various complicating factors. These factors include the highly dynamic background, camera motion, the variety in possible objects and their appearance, and the diversity in meteorological as well as environmental circumstances. Although the developed detection algorithm is quite well capable of detecting the objects, it also produces an extensive amount of false detections. This study investigates whether these false detections can be eliminated, while maintaining the true detections, by means of classification of the detections as either target or background. To this end, the initial detection algorithm is optimised to detect as much objects as possible in a carefully constructed dataset of eight hundred Visible Light (VL) images. The resulting detections from the optimised algorithm are used accordingly to train and test various basic classifiers, using a set of features found in the literature. The best performing classifier is selected and the performance of this classifier, and the two-stage detection algorithm as a whole, is subsequently further analysed by means of various tests involving the features used, the evaluation procedure and the fusion of detection results. Results show that especially the features as well as the clustering procedure for detected pixels are important parameters with respect to a good performance of the algorithm. This works shows that the linear discriminant classifier is best to use with the problem among the classifiers considered. Moreover, it is demonstrated that including features of histogram equalized boxes in combination with features of the entire image increased the performance the most, that determining the features on a slightly larger area than the originally detected area is beneficial and that fusion of detections after classification can be used to optimise the detector output. Although the developed classification approach is capable of eliminating many false detections and to retain a majority of the true detections, further research is required. Suggested are separate classifiers for the sea- and sky part, inclusion of the time dimension, optimisation of the operating point of the classifier and preprocessing steps.","Object Detection; Maritime Environment; Pattern Recognition; Image Processing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-19","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Media and Knowledge Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Kuijk, J.I. (mentor)","2012","This report describes the process and the results of an Industrial Design (DfI) graduation project which was carried out for Nspyre in Eindhoven. The project served as a demonstration on applying user centred design in a traditionally technology driven product domain: domotica (home automation). The assignment was to create a tablet-based control application for domotica systems to be used in an apartment complex. There was no actual client involved in the project so a virtual client was defined, the housing corporation. At the start of the project, experts on domotica were consulted, users of existing systems were interviewed and a market study was performed. This resulted in the identification of design opportunities, based on projections of the future market and the evaluation of current products and user wishes. The studies also resulted in an overview of the stakeholders involved in domotica projects and an image of the virtual client in a real world context. From the studies and discussions with experts it was concluded that current systems lacked flexibility and did not allow users to personalise functionality and thus utilise all possibilities of an integrated home automation system. The identified opportunities were grouped into three search areas, of which one was chosen to be the most promising design direction; providing user-level access to system automation. A target group was identified in young professionals, as they will be future users of domotica technology and have grown used to flexible and personalisable technology around them. This makes current domotica systems too static for these users, who are used to systems fitting into their dynamic lives and able to adapt to any changing living conditions. A contextual inquiry with representative users was conducted to gain awareness of their views on domotica, the concept of ´being at home´, and how a domotica control system could contribute to their home lives. To define the design brief, a proposal for the extent of controllable home elements was evaluated by a domotica expert working for a housing corporation. Criteria were set up based on the studies performed and discussions with experts. The design brief specified a focus on the domotica control interface and its supporting system. The interface should enable users to quickly identify home elements on screen, and let them personalise the system’s functionality by being able to program atmospheric scenes and automatic scenarios. Conceptualisation focused mainly on interaction design of the control interface, exploring ways to visualize and manipulate the state of home environment elements like lighting, curtains, heating and power sockets. The design had to be successful in communicating mental models of certain processes which would allow users to personalise the system. To ensure a usable interface, easy and intuitive to use from first usage; many quick and dirty evaluations were conducted with conceptual designs early and often throughout the project. This resulted in a tablet based control application consisting of two main parts: My Home allows for direct manipulation of the state of home environment elements through a visual layout of the apartment and the elements to be controlled. Gestures are implemented where they contribute to making interactions pleasurable and efficient. Users have direct access to creating and editing scenes to control atmospheres. My Moments is a guiding wizard that allows users to program automatic patterns to occur in response to certain events in their daily routine. It allows them for instance to specify that the domotica system should automatically create a comforting atmosphere when they come home, or have the system make it seem as if someone is at home at night by switching on lights and closing curtains. A final user evaluation was conducted with a working prototype, running on a tablet to mimic actual usage. The goal of this evaluation was to see if the usability of the interaction concept allowed users to perform critical use cases without getting stuck or becoming confused or frustrated, preferably while judging the experience as enjoyable. The results show that the interaction model of creating Moments was successful in guiding users while creating a Moment during first usage. The design of the interface allows them to start building a mental model of the process, being able to utilise more options within the interface after some time. Some issues that arose during the evaluation have been addressed in a redesign to ensure a usable and satisfying product proposal as end result of the project. Although the focus was on interface design of the control application, an outline of the system design was created to communicate all considerations that need be taken into account when realising the interaction concept in a real world context. The system design was set up to be supportive of the interaction concept, and provide a pleasurable user experience in all usage phases. The result of the project shows that when domotica system design is approached from a user centred standpoint, the resulting design goes beyond what is currently available on the market and addresses needs that will be present within the upcoming user group of domotica systems. Designing the system to support the interaction design ensures that not only the control interface is satisfying to use, but each interaction between the user and the overall system is a pleasurable experience.","domotica; interaction design; user centred design; home automation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2012","In recent years, space missions to asteroids have been a focus of research. This type of mission has introduced a new challenge in space mission analysis: target selection. Indeed, given the large number of small Solar System bodies and their various orbital and physical characteristics, selecting a specific target is a rather complex task. This problem of target selection was given to the participants of the second Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC2) in 2006. The GTOC2 problem relies on the design of a low-thrust mission with four consecutive asteroid rendezvous. The main challenge in finding good solutions for GTOC2 stems from the vast search space and stringent constraints set out in the problem description. At the time, a TUDelft-led team of students participated in GTOC2. Since then, there has been a concerted effort within the Astrodynamics & Space Missions (A&S) research group to further investigate feasible solutions and develop new methods to achieve better results. Building on the lessons learned from these previous efforts, we design and implement an algorithm aiming at reducing the pool of candidate targets in a computationally fast manner. This is achieved by decoupling the integer and continuous aspects of the problem. The combinatorial problem is modelled as a static, single-source Shortest Path Problem, tackled with a multi-path greedy algorithm. The continuous aspect is optimized on a leg-per-leg basis with two different optimization techniques. With computational efficiency in mind, the individual transfers are modelled as bi-impulsive, high- thrust arcs, computed with an efficient Lambert solver. The resulting combinatorial tool builds on and contributes to the existing capabilities of Tudat, an Astrodynamics toolbox developed within the A&S Department. The greedy searches in the complete asteroid pool are performed with different parameters and different directions, the sensitivity to the bounds of the continuous optimization problem is analyzed, two different costs functions are investigated. The computational times achieved with the designed greedy algorithm are very attractive. For the largest time intervals considered, where the impact of phasing is reduced, the sequence corresponding to the GTOC2 runner-up is present within a reduced set of asteroid combinations. This points to a fast and accurate pruning of the initial integer search space.","mission analysis; asteroid; combinatorial; optimisation; GTOC; greedy algorithm; shortest path problem; differential evolution; tudat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Astrodynamics and Space Missions","",""

(mentor)","2012","Efficient querying and retrieval of data from XML databases is a challenging task, especially when these DBs contain a large number of documents, potentially millions of them. One way to scale out is by spreading the documents over multiple nodes, but running all queries on all nodes has poor scale-out qualities. Here we propose a solution to this problem whereby the document space is partitioned on the basis of some document characteristic that is referenced by the queries, and can be inferred efficiently for a given query; this allows the query dispatch system to preemptively avoid issuing the query to the nodes that are positively known to contain empty result. Our partitioning scheme provides an environment for automated placement of data and thus allows the users (i.e., query authors or clients) to operate at a higher abstraction level; in other words, the information about the location of data is not required as an input from the user. Satisifiability of XPath, which determines the emptiness and non-emptiness of its answer at compile time, plays an important role in our strategy of determining data location and query optimization. To further optimize the performance of a query in addition to what is attainable through the process of context identification, indexes are utilized which are built on such XML elements that are important from point of view of expected queries. The strategies have been designed, implemented and tested on top of xDB. We demonstrate that the performance of distributed XQueries is improved after passing through our context identification phase. The precision of our context identification is 90% on our dataset and query set. We show interesting tradeoffs to alternative approaches in terms of xDB data pages instead of time-based parameters to get highly reliable and consistent results. Large datasets and XPath/XQuery with different syntactic properties have been used which show the applicability of proposed techniques to real world XML database systems.","query; XML; data partitioning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-09-18","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor)","2012","This research investigates iterative methods for solving large and sparse least squares problems, as those encountered in tomography. A widely used method for such systems is the Conjugate Gradients method for Least Squares problems (CGLS), which is derived from the popular Conjugate Gradient method. The Conjugate Residuals method can also be adapted for Least Squares problems, which would lead to the Conjugate Residual Least Square method (CRLS). Such a method seems to be unknown. In this thesis we derive the method of Conjugate Residuals for the Least Square problem and compare it to other iterative methods like Conjugate Gradients, Conjugate Gradients for the Least Square problem, Conjugate Residuals, Least Square Minimal Residual (LSMR) and Least Square QR-factorization (LSQR). Also a non-iterative method, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is tested and compared to this iterative methods. A test problem that provides ill conditioned problems is used to test the accuracy of the methods. It can be concluded that CRLS behaves significantly worse with this test problem than the methods SVD, CGLS, LSQR and LSMR, if it is implemented in its most time efficient way. Its accuracy is comparable to the methods CG and CR. If the implementation is altered the accuracy improves up to the level of the other algorithms, but this implementation requires an extra matrix multiplication. This means the investigated method can achieve high accuracy, but may require more time and memory while computing a solution. In the application of the discussed algorithms on a representative geophysical test problem the accuracy problem of CRLS cannot be detected. Even the time-efficient implementation does not result in loss of accuracy in comparison with CGLS in this test problem. After adding perturbation to the measured data of this problem, it is clear that CRLS is also in this area comparable to CGLS.","conjugate gradients; conjugate residuals; tomography","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","Numerieke Wiskunde","",""

(mentor); Gielen, M.A. (mentor); Kock, J. (mentor)","2012","Band is a product service system which has a physical music player and an online music service as core components. It allows children to listen to music alone and with friends. The songs are provided by a streaming music service and can be shared online and offline. When children are about 8 years old, they enter a new phase in their development, the so-called operational phase. This phase is characterised by a number of changes. Firstly, friendships and relationships with peers begin to take a more prominent place. Belonging to a group becomes more important. Secondly, children start to share objects and stories with their peers. The fact that their senses mature and their increased focus on detail help them to assess the value of these objects and the equality of these exchanges. Another effect of the increased focus on detail is the desire of children to have more complex and real toys. Finally, the formation of their personality becomes more concrete when children are between 8 and 10 years of age. Children form and can communicate their preferences. Their music preference changes rapidly and is often decided upon within a group of friends. Current music players do not offer a combination of a detailed, mature appearance and the possibility to stay in contact with friends, aspects that are important to children between 8 and 10. The Band ecosystem takes these elements of child development and product desires into account and allows children to listen to music both alone and with friends. Firstly a player that can be used to by children to play their favorite music at home. The songs that are played are the songs they have stored in their account of the music service. Apart from listening to songs on their own, they can invite friends who also have Band to listen along. Secondly a music service where children can search for new songs, manage their current songs and see what music their friends have in their account. Behind this service is a database of streaming music. In order to be able to see what music friends have in their account of the service, children can exchange avatars that come with the player. This exchange connects the accounts online. Avatars can only be exchanged when children meet in person, which limits the risk of children connecting to strangers. Finally, children can also share music using so-called mixtapes. On these mixtapes they can store links to songs in the database of streaming music. By exchanging these mixtapes they can introduce new songs to their friends.","product service system; social; music; children","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Revealing all experiences during the discussions with supervisors, thus communicating the ideas could be sometimes difficult. In order to provide a better guidance, it is also important for supervisors to understand the students’ process in between these meetings. There are available tools used in the fields like education or health in order to monitor an individual’s daily life in relation to the context (e.g. time, place, activity) and personal circumstances (e.g. emotions, feelings, ideas). These tools are developed based on experience sampling method (ESM), a research method focus on collecting self-reported data from participants in order to measure their daily life experiences, especially during a long period of time. Since the target group and experience has different characteristics for each context, design of experience sampling tools are also gaining importance to address these specific experiences according to individuals’ needs and expectations. Aiming at assisting design students to do regular self-reporting on their experiences, this study presents a background research for designing experience sampling tools that would be used by students and supervisors to keep track of students’ experiences throughout design projects. In this sense, this study intends assisting students self-reporting activities, translate the main design requirements of experience sampling tools into the context of design projects, as well as revealing guidelines for the future implications of ESM tools in design education.","student experience; design education; tools","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Jepma, E. (mentor); Dijkstra-Hellinga, A. (mentor)","2012","The Bugaboo Meerkat is a patentable concept for grandparent-grandchild personal mobility. The design concept creates a new mobility product market for elderly people. The core functionality of the Bugaboo Meerkat is the combination of a shopping trolley and wagon in one product. An innovative converting mechanism enables a user to convert between the two use-modes in one step, with no tools. The shopping mode is for grandparent activities. The wagon mode is for grandparent-grandchild activities. The premise of the Bugaboo Meerkat was validated through user evaluation and concept is embodied in a functional prototype. These deliverables conclude a MSc. graduation project involving are the author, Bugaboo International B.V and TU Delft. Bugaboo International B.V (Bugaboo), is a Dutch baby stroller company with a vision to become an innovative mobility brand. From an external perspective, developing a 'elderly' mobility product portfolio is a logical step for business growth. The demographic of developed societies are maturing. As the demographic changes, the proportion of 'active-elderly' who desire a meaningful role in society increases. 'Active-elderly' are 65+ year old people who are healthy and independently mobile. This connection between brand and external factor creates an opportunity for innovation. Thus the project brief, Develop an elderly mobility product for Bugaboo based on the relationship between grandparent and grandchild. Results from the research phase are condensed into six fundamental user-centred conclusions. Promote Grandchildren, Active Grandparents, Grandmothers are Favourites, Activity Tours, Close Proximity and Grandchildren Lead. These conclusions embody the grandparent's needs and wishes in the context of the project. Therefore, the conclusions are referenced throughout the development stages as a decision tool requirements and evaluation. Promote Grandchildren was selected as a pivotal research conclusion, thus the reason why the product converts from a shopping trolley to a wagon. The final design concept was evaluated against several sources. Central is user feedback from an evaluation survey and the list of requirements. Secondary, the Bugaboo Meerkat is evaluated to Bugaboo design principles, the project's design goal and satisfying the problem definition. Since the six fundamental user-centred conclusions were derived from qualitative user interviews, the user evaluation survey focused on validating these conclusions. All respondents agreed that the product would enable them to 'promote' their grandchild in public spaces. An additional result is that the respondents agreed that the concept would improve their supervision (proximity) of their grandchild. This is a key insight as it reflects on a grandparent's confidence to do outdoor activities with their grandchildren. In conclusion, the users can see the product integrating into role as a grandparent rather than their day-to-day routine. Although the product appeal is recognised, several respondents were sceptical about the potential market size and grandchild safety.","mobility; elderly; grandparents; grandchildren; shopping trolley; child's wagon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-09-17","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Van der Voort, H. (mentor)","2012","This research is based on a multiple case study research within the food-products multinational corporation Danone, specifically within the segment Nutricia Advanced Medical Nutrition. In this study, the process of the front end of open innovation projects within Nutricia Advanced Medical Nutrition was studied and explored for an application of R&D and Marketing collaboration. The case studies selected within the firm were related to technology and product innovation. The main objective of this research was to explore the process activities between R&D and Marketing departments within open innovation projects. As a product, a framework was developed specifically for Nutricia is on how, which and when R&D and Marketing activities should take place in order to facilitate open innovation. The following main research question was answered in order to achieve the research objective: How does R&D and Marketing cooperation take place within open innovation projects and how can it effectively facilitate open innovation within Nutricia? The main research question was approached by qualitative research, which included interviews and direct observations executed in parallel. In this case Nutricia Advanced Medical Nutrition was observed and the business unit participated in twenty-six qualitative interviews on multiple (types of) open innovation projects and shared available documentation on these projects. Additionally, external interviews were performed with eight external specialists from different universities and a consultant, within the subject of open innovation and R&D and Marketing collaboration. In total six cases have been studied, namely: two cases on collaboration with universities and research institutes, two cases on collaboration with ingredient suppliers and two cases on collaboration with complementary goods suppliers. The data was analysed with the aid of ATLAS, qualitative analysis software, in order to process coding and link data. Following Yin’s (2011) analyses method multiple stages were adopted within the analyses of this study. The stages followed, were not based on a linear process, but had rather a recursive relationship. The framework recommended for Nutricia shows when Marketing and R&D are collaborating within the open innovation process more intensively (red). Not all open innovation projects require “intensive” collaboration between the epartments. From he case studies it was roughly concluded that for the innovations dealing with large risks and uncertainties require a less intensive collaboration at the start then for innovations with far less ncertainties and risks. The generalizability of this framework is basically limited to the firm but can be related to a certain extent to the pharmaceutical industry rather than the foods industry. Basically irms dealing with very tacit and explicit information which forms a potential barrier for early intensive collaboration between R&D and Marketing. Senior management support is continuously present as a “roof on a house” providing “shelter” by safeguarding the strategy or by strategically supporting projects with high potential which fall outside the defined strategy of the business. Obviously regulating only the involvement of Marketing will not be sufficient. Expertise from different perspectives is crucial and has to sustain “open” (so not formalised) since opportunities can differ every time. Within the literature, the need for expertise was not stressed as being critical for open innovation. However, many external specialists did confirm its importance. The need for expertise might be less obvious for other type of firms (firms who are not dependent on tacit or explicit knowledge for instance), but it certainly is for a firm like Nutricia. There was no specific difference observed between the open innovation process and the internal innovation process (without open innovation practices) regarding the content of the activities and responsibilities for Marketing. The only difference is the stage where support is required from Marketing, which is explained in terms of the integration moment. The barriers related to R&D and Marketing collaboration within open innovation, as put forward by the participants, were to a large extent comparable to those summarized by the researchers within the theory concerning R&D and Marketing collaboration within “closed innovation projects”. Most barriers could be categorized under cultural, organisational and communication barriers. It was further concluded that Nutricia is a business driven division which also forms a barriers for developing radical innovations since these cannot easily be managed with tight deadlines. The pharmaceutical science behind the products of Nutricia can form a barrier for Marketing, due to the tacit and explicit knowledge involved within the technological uncertainties at the initial phase of NPD. There is a paradox noticed within the need for the right integration moment. Defining benefits at the starting stage of the open innovation project depends on the scientific, technical, Marketing, and regulatory barriers which could occur. Most R&D participants addressed that Marketing should be involved after the benefits are defined; however, input from Marketing will be required in order to create and validate assumptions for defining potential business benefits. In the end, the following six key succes factors were mentioned the most requently by the respondents (external and internal): o Alignment o Expertise o Strategy & vision o Senior management support o Customer benefits & consumer needs o Integration moment In general it is not suggested to retain a “trial and error” relationship between R&D and Marketing for managing open innovation. This is to a certain level favorable for the capricious nature of open innovation and the R&D and Marketing collaboration (in order to retain the informal collaboration). However, continuing in this manner could mean that external opportunities are not treated with caution, and the trust and alignment required between R&D and Marketing (but also other functions) is not stimulated. It has to start at taking up the open innovation within the strategy. Now the company has undertaken different projects and soon it can measure the commercial success of one of the major projects. After that it is wise to decide to which level will open innovation be of importance for the firm.","open innovation management; new product development; marketing and research & development collaboration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-09-14","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Gemser, G. (mentor); Wisse, B. (mentor)","2012","Sprinq is a daughter company of InteSpring. The company Sprinq was founded to further develop one of InteSpring’s products, the SpringUp. This graduation report (thesis) focuses only on Sprinq and their products, the SpringUp chairs. The final advice will tell Sprinq which products to develop and how to enter the market. An analysis of the current standing-up-chairs reveals that the current market is dominated by primarily, heavy-, traditional looking and electric standing-up-chairs. With the unique spring system, Sprinq can offer a new distinctive non electric standing-up-chair with a lighter and more contemporary design. Sprinq wants to know which private markets are interesting to enter and which needs and requirements for the SpringUp this would entail. Another question that Sprinq wants to answer is how they can make the target group aware of the physical benefits that the SpringUp chair offers in comparison with the current electric standing-up-chairs and how sensitive the target group is to this issue. Would they choose a SpringUp chair above the other products offered in the standing-up-chair market and for what reasons. To achieve this goal research is done on how Sprinq can best enter the market and which products they have to add to their portfolio. To answer these questions, several analyzes of the company and the market it operates in, are executed. In addition a survey is conducted among 97 participants, all aged above 55, throughout the Netherlands. This survey tried to provide insights into the daily habits, the interior style and de consumer behavior of the target group. Also their opinion was asked on the prototype, the SpringUp Living. The survey showed more insights in the daily activities of elderly at home. The analysis of the survey showed that the elderly spend most of their active part of the day in the living room (+/- 3 hours a day) and next to that also a lot of time in the kitchen/ dining room (+/-2 hours a day). Due to these findings a SpringUp ‘Dining room’ was added to the Product Roadmap next to the already existing SpringUp Living that is developed for the living room. This is also done because the current standing up chair market does not really offer standing-up chairs for the dining room. All the current chairs are aimed at the living room. Developing a standing-up chair for the dining room can be the ‘gap in de market’ where Sprinq can anticipate on. During the presentation to Sprinq of the SpringUp ‘dining room’ concept a lot of suggestions were made to also develop a SpringUp ‘Project furniture’. This SpringUp model should be ideal for nursing- and retirement homes in the public eating and relaxing areas. The mean difference between the SpringUp ‘Dining room’ and the SpringUp ‘Project furniture’ will be that the SpringUp ‘Project furniture’ needs to be adjustable by a nurse because the chair will be used by different people each day. While the SpringUp ‘Dining room’ will only be use by one user and only needs to be adjusted once at the day of delivery (and maybe later, when the health conditions of the user deteriorate). Even though this graduation research was aimed at the private consumer market, the SpringUp ‘Project furniture’ was also taken up in the Product Roadmap for Sprinq and the Designguidelines for this product where worked out as much as the information conducted allowed. Besides the kitchen/ dining room the living room is still important. Listening to the responses of testing the prototype SpringUp Living shows that there is a ‘need’ to a relax version of the SpringUp Living. This SpringUp Relax should also enable the user to have a comfortable nap in the chair. This would mean that the seat needs a leg support and a back support, which is able to tilt backwards, this all in combination with the standing-up spring system. The advice to Spinq is to expand their portfolio with: - The SpringUp ‘Dining room’; - The SpringUp ‘Project furniture’; - The SpringUp ‘Relax’. The SpringUp ‘Dining Room’ and ‘Project furniture’ can be developed side by side because they have a lot of similarities. The goal is to bring these products to the market in late 2012 or early 2013. After these products are introduced to the market the development of the SpringUp ‘Relax’ should be started, so this model is market ready in June 2013 and Sprinq has a complete portfolio to offer within a year from now. Analyses of the survey showed that the older the user, the more important comfort ability and the supporting function of the standing-up-chair becomes, however the appearance may not be forgotten. It is therefore important that the development of new SpringUp chairs, not only focuses on the function but also on the appearance of the chair. Using results out of de research, Style Guidelines where conducted. After proposing the Product Roadmap and Style Guidelines for Sprinq to implement, the Business Canvas for Sprinq was analyzed to make sure all facets, that are important to enter the standing-up-chair market, are considered. In the Business Canvas, the business model of Sprinq is discussed. The main recommendations are; - Preserving the vision; - Developing a broader product portfolio - Finding partners for distribution opportunities. For the SpringUp products, distribution opportunities should be found in B2C market as well as in de B2B market,. Possible partners in the B2C market are the furniture stores. The outcome of the customer survey shows that 54% of the participants would visit a furniture shop to get information about standing-up chairs. For the B2B market Sprinq should aim at the healthcare shops. Sprinq is already investigating a possible collaborations. As long as there are no partners for the distribution of the SpringUp product, it is important that the current sale channels of Sprinq (website, fairs and telecommunication) are working and looking perfect. Sprinq should visit at least two fairs a year to expand their relevant network and reach new potential customers.","sta-op-stoel; standing-up-chairs","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-09-14","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2012","CHP-Belduco is a Combined Heat and Power plant, which was built on the site of Belchem, a chemical company in Flanders, Belgium. The purpose of the plant is to deliver steam and other utilities to the chemical plants on the site. In order to do that efficiently, the combination of heat and electricity is used. The plant is owned and managed by Duteng, a Dutch energy production company, but operated by employees of the client (Belchem). The CHP plant consists of newly built equipment, like turbines, heat recovery steam generators, and water treatment units, combined with existing equipment, like boilers and pumps of considerable age. This equipment is integrated in the utility grids of an extensive chemical site with numerous users of the utilities. A considerable amount of agreements is used to capture all the arrangements regarding building rights, hired services and back and forth delivery of fuels, auxiliary materials, and utilities. The reliability of steam supply of CHP-Belduco, which is very important for the client, turned out to be far below expectations and contractual agreements. The cooperation between the two companies is difficult and they are blaming each other for the unsatisfactory performance. The opinions of Belchem and Duteng, regarding how an installation is to be operated and which training and instructions are required, are far apart. In order to find causes and solution orientations for the problems at CHPBelduco, this case was studied from the perspective of organizational structures and cultures. The organizational structures of Belchem and Duteng were analysed, using the theory of Henry Mintzberg. The most salient difference was identified between the coordination mechanisms of the two companies. The main coordination mechanism within Belchem is standardization of work processes, while within Duteng it is standardization of skills. In order to study the organizational cultures the theory of Edgar Schein was used. A number of Duteng employees, which worked at CHPBelduco and cooperated with Belchem employees, was interviewed. The interview results were used to identify differences between the organizational cultures of both companies. The identified differences were compared to the differences in the national cultures of Belgium and the Netherlands. For this comparison the theory of Geert Hofstede is used. As part of his research, he identified a number of cultural dimensions. A large number of differences between the cultures of Belchem and Duteng could be explained by differences between the cultures of Belgium and the Netherlands. These differences were mainly in the cultural dimensions power distance and uncertainty avoidance, which both score significantly higher in Belgium (and Belchem) than in the Netherlands (and Duteng). Causes of the cooperation problems were found by using the theory of Hofstede. The research showed that CHP-Belduco was organized in a way that did not fit the way of working and culture of Belchem. On top of that Belchem and Duteng insufficiently recognize the differences between each other’s cultures, which leads to incomprehension and friction. For finding causes of reliability problems the ‘Normal Accident Theory’ is used. This theory, developed by Charles Perrow, explains why accidents happen and relates reliability to issues of organizational structure and culture. This research showed that Duteng does insufficiently show the importance of reliable steam supply and that the inexperienced operators were trained in an ineffective way. Furthermore, Duteng has next to no direct influence on the operators. The ‘High Reliability Theory’, which studies why ‘high reliability organizations’ manage to sustain high records of reliability, is used to help identify solution orientations. Like the ‘Normal Accident Theory’ this theory also relates reliability to issues of organizational structure and culture. The identified solution orientations regard a number of aspects, like: more autonomy for Belchem in operating the plant; training for operators that better fits their way of learning and which is more focussed on worst case scenarios; better fitting of the skills and knowledge of employees to the role they should perform in the chosen structure; better scoping of maintenance; and improving the technical integrity of the plant. The results of this research have led to the conclusion that cultural differences, and the way they are handled, are major causes for the problems under study. Changing the contractual structure in such a way that Duteng manages all aspects of CHPBelduco, including operations, seems to be a good solution. Due to the implications this solutions brings along, it might not be feasible. Without changing the contractual structure, the cooperation within and the reliability of CHP-Belduco can be improved if both partners take the cultural differences more into account. More understanding of and respect for each others way of working will reduce mistrust and can open doors to a more constructive way of cooperation. Furthermore, aligning the skills of staff members with their role in the chosen way of working is expected to improve the performance of the plant. It was also concluded that the research method, developed in this research, can be used for a number of cross-border organizations for which reliability of technology is important. Furthermore, this research method can be applied before entering a crossborder alliance, merger, or acquisition in order to reduce cooperation and reliability problems, due to cultural differences, up front.","cross-border alliance; electricity; energy; chemical industry; Combined Heat and Power (CHP); cogeneration; organizational structure; organizational culture; Normal Accident Theory (NAT); High Reliability Theory (HRT)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-09-14","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","Engineering & Policy Analysis (EPA)","",""

(mentor)","2012","It is common practice to use the inhalation route to deliver medicine in the form of aerosol to treat patients with pulmonary ailments like cystic fibrosis. In pulmonary drug delivery, medicine in the form of small droplets is inhaled by patients and delivered to their lungs. A major challenge faced in developing such devices is that effective drug delivery is only obtained for a narrow droplet size distribution. Large droplets (> 10 micron) remain stuck in the throat of the patient, and small droplets (< 1 micron) are immediately exhaled out. Conventional nebulizers are generally inefficient in this aspect. For this purpose, portable micro system devices called vibrating mesh (VM) nebulizers are being developed at Philips Research Europe, that use ultrasonic waves produced by a piezoelectric crystal to generate an aerosol of droplets by passing the liquid through a mesh of micro-sized nozzles. The goal of the project was to maximize the droplet throughput (> 1 gram/minute) with minimal treatment time, at specific droplet size (between 4 and 5 micron, for 95% of all droplets) for maximum treatment efficacy. A time-resolved finite element simulation model is constructed to model the process of droplet formation. It includes the multi-phase flow of liquid and air, both inside and outside the channel. The model was developed using the commercial code COMSOL. In COMSOL, the level set method can be used along with Navier-stokes equations to model and advect the interface between two fluids. Furthermore, a scheme to carry out parallel computation of multiple parameters was devised. This was accomplished using the distributed computing facility at Philips Research Europe. Using the data from simulations, several aspects of flow dynamics were studied. Different modes of operation of the device were identified. Also, an effective method to visualize the simulation data was developed.","two-phase flow; level set method; mesh nebulizer; finite element method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-09-14","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Fluid Dynamics","",""

(mentor); Quist, P. (mentor); Zijlema, M. (mentor); Kieftenburg, A.T.M.M. (mentor); De Jong, M.P.C. (mentor)","2012","Volgens de Waterwet dienen elke zes jaar de Hydraulische Randvoorwaarden (HR) te worden vastgesteld. De HR bestaan uit hoogwaterstanden en golfrandvoorwaarden voor de toetsing van waterkeringen gegeven overschrijdingskansen welke in de wet zijn vastgesteld. Ook voor waterkeringen in havens en afgeschermde gebieden dienen de HR vastgesteld te worden, maar mag er rekening worden gehouden met een reducerende invloed als gevolg van de geometrie en de bathymetrie op de belasting door golfrandvoorwaarden. Voor het bepalen van de reductie van de golfrandvoorwaarden schrijven het Voorschrift Toetsen op Veiligheid (VTV, onderdeel van het wettelijk toetsinstrumentarium) en RIKZ (2004) een driestappenschema voor waarbij van grof naar fijn wordt gewerkt. In het schema moet worden overgegaan op een volgende stap als blijkt dat de te toetsen kering niet voldoet aan de gestelde veiligheidseisen bij de belasting uit de betreffende stap. Elke volgende stap levert een nauwkeuriger, betrouwbaarder en scherpere golfrandvoorwaarde op ten opzichte van de vorige stap. De eerste stap voor havens en afgeschermde gebieden wordt gevormd door het toepassen van ongereduceerde golfcondities en is het meest conservatief. De tweede stap bestaat uit het toepassen van het eenvoudige spreadsheetmodel ‘Golfbelasting in havens en afgeschermde gebieden’. De laatste stap in het bovengenoemde schema is de toepassing van numerieke modellen. Het spreadsheetmodel uit de tweede stap is vooral ontwikkeld voor simpele havengeometrieën en het gebruik is alleen toegestaan wanneer aan een aantal voorwaarden wordt voldaan. Een probleem is dat deze voorwaarden tot nu toe zijn gebaseerd op theorie en nog niet zijn geverifieerd aan de hand van metingen. Hierdoor is het niet duidelijk waar de werkelijke bruikbaarheidsgrenzen liggen van dit model en wanneer moet over worden gegaan op de derde meest gedetailleerde stap. De keuze welk numeriek model moet worden toegepast in de derde stap wordt overgelaten aan de gebruiker. Maar doordat modellen verschillende eigenschappen hebben, is een model niet altijd voor alle situaties geschikt voor het correct bepalen van de gereduceerde golfrandvoorwaarden. Door bruikbaarheidsgrenzen te formuleren voor numerieke modellen welke aangeven in welke situatie de modellen correcte antwoorden geven, zou deze keuze veilig en gefundeerd gemaakt kunnen worden. Onderliggend onderzoek is uitgevoerd om te bepalen binnen welke grenzen het spreadsheetmodel, SWAN (spectraal energiemodel) en Pharos (mild-slope model) geschikt zijn voor het modelleren van de indringing van golven in havens en afgeschermde gebieden en leiden tot conservatieve antwoorden. Hierbij is gefocust op havens waarvan de geometrie op het grensvlak van complex dan wel niet-complex ligt. Het effect van wind op golven niet beschouwd voor een zuivere vergelijking van de modellen. De modellen zijn toegepast op diverse cases en de resultaten zijn vergeleken met schaalmodelmetingen en resultaten van een meer gedetailleerd numeriek model. Ook zijn tests uitgevoerd waarmee de gevoeligheid van de modellen voor enkele hydraulische en numerieke aspecten is onderzocht. Op basis van de cases en de gevoeligheidstests is een oordeel gegeven over de prestaties van de modellen en zijn bruikbaarheids-grenzen opgesteld. Met het onderzoek is aangetoond dat het spreadsheetmodel waarschijnlijk breder ingezet kan worden dan de huidige richtlijnen doen voorkomen. De resultaten van het model blijken conservatief ten opzichte van gemeten waardes of numerieke modellen in situaties waarvoor het spreadsheetmodel is ontwikkeld. Echter ook in situaties waar het model oorspronkelijk niet voor ontwikkeld is, zoals havens met sterk reflecterende randen en/of veel afgeschermde gebieden, blijkt het spreadsheetmodel conservatief. Door het breder in kunnen zetten van het spreadsheetmodel kan tijd en geld bespaard worden op het gebruik van rekentechnisch duurdere en arbeidsintensievere numerieke modellen. Voor SWAN en Pharos is vanuit de opgestelde bruikbaarheidsgrenzen een schema afgeleid waarmee een onderbouwde keuze kan worden gemaakt uit de twee modellen. Pharos blijkt hierbij het breedst inzetbaar en SWAN vooral in een haven met een open geometrie welke belast wordt met een kortkammig golfspectrum. In dit laatste geval is het in SWAN missende golfproces diffractie van minder belang en komen de berekende golfpatronen van SWAN en Pharos sterk met elkaar overeen. SWAN geeft in dit geval over het algemeen wel conservatievere antwoorden. In alle andere gevallen zijn de prestaties van SWAN matig tot slecht door de afwezigheid van diffractie. Zo zijn de prestaties van SWAN matig in havens met veel afgeschermde gebieden welke belast worden met een kortkammig spectrum. Voor dit type haven wordt het aangeraden SWAN alleen te gebruiken om een eerste impressie te krijgen van het lokale golfpatroon. In havens welke belast worden met een langkammig spectrum levert SWAN slecht en wordt de toepassing van het model afgeraden. Bovenstaande conclusies zijn gebaseerd op een beperkt aantal cases. Aanbevolen wordt in een vervolgstudie de huidige dataset uit te breiden om de opgestelde bruikbaarheidsgrenzen nader te onderbouwen.","spreadsheet; SWAN; Pharos; golfindringing; havens; afgeschermde gebieden; bruikbaarheidsgrenzen; WTI; Voorschrift Toetsen op Veiligheid; Hydraulische Randvoorwaarden; golfrandvoorwaarden; basiscases; Monopoli; Limassol","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","Pick and place robots are very popular in industry as they provide speedy and precise handling applications. They are especially practical in repetitive work as they can work long time with a faster and more accuracy motion than humans. Compared with serial manipulator, parallel robots have the advantages of high accuracy, high rigidity and high payload/inertia ratio, and thus more suitable for a pick and place application. In this thesis, a 5 DOF parallel robot designed for haptic application is approaching to achieve pick and place operation by improving its tracking speed and accuracy through inverse dynamic control. Pick and place robots have different performance criteria than haptic devices. One main difference is that they operate at higher speed and accuracy than haptic devices. Therefore the parallel robot is first calibrated by using mechanical constraint method to reduce the position error from kinematic computation. Inverse kinematic model based iteration method is used to find out real structure parameters after fabrication. Then an inverse dynamic model of the 5 DOF parallel robot is built up based on virtual work principle, which considers two situations and is able to be adapted dependent on whether an object is captured by grippers. Also, grasping force is setted by this model and therefore could be easily changed for different application by humans. A simmechanics model in matlab is used to compare with this numerical inverse dynamic model and proves its correctness. The inverse dynamic model provides feedforward compensation in high speed movement and reduces the tracking error than normal position control. In order to obtain higher stiffness in grasping performance while keeps fast response and low overshoot, a nonlinear control strategy is introduced to replace normal PID controller. Simulations and experiments are carried out to test tracking performance under dynamic control, the results show a limited error and a realization of pick and place operation finally.","5 DOF parallel robot; calibration; inverse dynamic; nonlinear controller","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

Respectively, speeding is more crucial for rural areas, whereas red light running is more frequent in urban areas where most of the traffic lights are located. To adequately address both issues consistent actions are needed in three main directions (also known as the three Es): engineering, education and enforcement. This study treated, in a way, the engineering and the enforcement. On the one hand, it reviewed the effect of road design and road side environment on speed and red light running that was reported in previous studies. On the other hand, the study aims at developing a model for prediction of the percentage of offenders depending on several road characteristics. It was found that age and gender is an important factor for both types of violations. The road characteristics reported to have an influence on speed are among others curve radius, curvature change rate, road, lane and shoulder width, shoulder type, type of objects and lateral distance, traffic signs and road marking, access points density and street lighting. In regard to red light running the most important factors are related to traffic signal characteristics (control type, cycle length, yellow interval duration), intersection characteristics (traffic volumes, grade, width, speed limit, number and width of approach lanes) and traffic flow characteristics (percentage of trucks). The prediction model was based on speed and road data for the N roads in the Province of Gelderland in the Netherlands. The study was aimed at tangent sections and considered both driving directions together. When calculating the percentage of offenders a speed of 87 km/h was used as a limit. It was found that the percentage of offenders is considerably lower in horizontal curves than on tangent sections. Additionally, it was found that the horizontal curve effect disappears about 100 m from the beginning or end of the curve. After reduction, 64 sites were used for model calibration and 12 sites for validation of the resulted model coefficients. A linear and a nonlinear model were developed. Tangent length, median width and the presence of barriers were found to have a positive effect on the percentage of offenders. The presence of street lighting, on the other hand, had a negative correlation to the percentage of offenders. In the end, the only difference between both models was the logarithmic transformation of the tangent length. This transformation was necessary to capture the effect of relatively shorter tangents. This also explains the higher R2 for the nonlinear model. The R2 for the linear model is 0.428 and for the nonlinear model it is 0.502. Both models were equally well validated with the different sample of road sections. It was found that both models perform better for percentages of offenders between 15 % and 45 %.","speeding; red light running; prediction model; offenders; road characteristics; street light; tangent length; median width","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

The goal of this paper is to introduce a system using pneumatic power that can increase the ratio of pinch force to operating force for prosthetic hands/hooks. This system is intended to be used in a hybrid body- and pneumatically- powered manner; the prehension phase is performed solely by the user while in the pinch phase the pinch force gets provided by both the user and a pneumatic piston. The piston linearly magnifies the force input of the user by using a Force Demand Valve (FDV). Using this system, a pinch force to operating force ratio of 3 is achieved (current prosthetic hands/hooks fall in the range of 0.11-0.45). Force control tests were carried out with 9 test subjects for both the system with pneumatic force magnification and without. These tests showed there is no large degradation in force control performance when the force magnification is engaged.","prosthetics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-11-05","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

The main objective is to use FEM (in this case PLAXIS) to calibrate the partial safety factors. To fulfil this objective, level II probabilistic calculations (FORM) are performed using Prob2B (a toolbox from TNO) to define influence coefficients for the different parameters and reliability indices for the different failure mechanisms. This is done for two benchmark quay walls: an anchored sheet-pile and a quay wall with relieving floor. Both are designed according to the FEM design guidelines in CUR 166, the handbook on sheet-pile structures. Furthermore, the calculations require coefficients of variation for each stochastic parameter, correlation coefficients and definitions of Limit State Functions. These are all derived and presented in the report. With the output of the level II calculations, a level I method is used to define the partial safety factors and besides the design procedure of CUR 166 with FEM is evaluated and suggestions for adaptation for quay walls with relieving floor are presented. The main consequences according to the output of the probabilistic FEM calculations are: 1) Higher partial safety factors on the internal angle of friction and stiffness parameters of the soil 2) Lower partial safety factors on the geometrical parameters (retaining height, water levels) 3) Mean values for cohesion, sheet-pile parameters and anchor diameter 4) Changes in fault tree for quay walls with relieving floor 5) Adaptation of the in the handbook sheet-pile structures (CUR 166) prescribed calculation method using FEM for quay walls with relieving floor (CUR 211) 6) Additional effort in the research and calculations of other quay walls 7) Standardization of probabilistic calculations or sensitivity analysis in quay wall design","Probabilistic Calculation; Quay Wall; Finite Element Method; Partial Safety Factor; Reliability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-09-12","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Simone, A. (mentor); Van der Veen, C. (mentor)","2012","Recently several studies have been performed at the TUDelft on the use of the generalized finite element method (GFEM) to model fiber reinforced composite materials in a two dimensional space. The GFEM model allows a large number of arbitrarily placed fibers to be taken into account. The fibers are placed on top of the ordinary mesh and therefore do not require aligned meshing to be done. Matrix material, fiber material and the interface between them each have their own material parameters. The discontinuous displacement field on the fiber, also known as the ""fiber slip"" is taken into account by the use of extra degrees of freedom. These extra degrees of freedom are placed on the original nodes of the elements crossed by fibers. Fibers are in essence one dimensional objects. The main degree of freedom they should have is the slip in direction of the fiber. It is therefore computationally expensive to use extra degrees of freedom on top of regular element nodes to describe the displacement field of the fiber. Why not inserting the extra degrees of freedom in direction of the fiber on top of the fiber itself? In this thesis a search is done to an efficient element with extra degrees of freedom on the fiber. A first unsuccessful try is the use of a so called ""Interface-enriched GFEM"" element (IGFEM). The second successful approach is the slightly different ""embedded reinforcement approach including bond slip"" (ERS). This is an element that has been used before in calculating reinforced concrete in several publications. This element is used here for calculating elastic material reinforced with many fibers. In its mathematical derivations, a small extension is made to allow for an arbitrary enrichment function to be inserted on the fiber displacement field analogous to the GFEM derivations. This enrichment function inserts a priori knowledg into the solution allowing it to converge faster. However, enrichments in this research are kept simple. Next to a two dimensional implementation of the GFEM and ERS approach, a three dimensional implementation is presented. Encountered problems and numerical examples for both models are discussed. Both approaches produce very similar numerical results. The ERS approach is more efficient as the current GFEM approach.","finite element method; fiber reinforced composites; Generalized finite element method; embedded reinforcement approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Computational Mechanics","",""

(mentor)","2012","In today’s highly competitive environment, it becomes increasingly common for many companies to face internal and external pressure for delivering their products and services with the lowest cost and/or fastest time possible. Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO) has helped to release part of such pressure by enabling companies to gain cost advantage and obtain access to qualified labor pools (Manning, Massini, & Lewin, 2008). Not too far from this topic is Agile Software Methodologies, which came into place by promoting continuous releases and close customer participation along the software development process. Agile Scrum has been defined as the most mature and widely adopted method from all the Agile methodologies (Hossain, Babar, & Paik, 2009). Further investigations suggest that Agile Scrum, in collocated development, can increase productivity up to 5-10 times higher than the industry average and empirical evidence proposes that non-collocated teams can reach the same performance (Sutherland, Schoonheim, & Rijk, 2008). Blending Offshoring Outsourcing projects with Agile Scrum, seem to be the perfect combination for many companies. However, companies continue facing difficulties in reaching such promised results and the mechanisms behind the ability of Agile Offshoring Outsourcing to shorten time-to-market remain hazy. Investigations explaining why certain projects cannot reach such promising results are scarce. This problem context led us to the main research question: What criteria hinder the reduction of time-to-market in software development projects that combine Agile Scrum with Offshoring Outsourcing? To answer it, we first researched what is Agile Scrum and how software development takes place under this methodology. Our research revealed that Agile Scrum is conformed by three main actors: ScrumMaster, Product Owner, Development Team. Additionally, literature suggests that Scrum demands high levels of interaction, openness and flexibility among all its participants. The second step in our research was to understand on how Offshore Outsource project are executed through their most common problems. Literatures addressed us into five main topics: 1) Culture Differences – subdivided into National Culture and Organizational Culture, 2) Coordination, 3) Trust, 4) Time Zone Differences and 5) Effective Communication. Based on these theoretical concepts we built a Conceptual Model containing twelve propositions describing what criteria influence the reduction of time-to-market. Each proposition is associated to Scrum concepts and how they could stimulate or hinder the reduction of time-to-market based on the context where the project takes place. Following, we conducted a multiple case study considering a Belgium telecommunication company (the Client) and an Indian outsourcing service provider (the Vendor). The unit of analysis: projects blending Outsourcing Offshoring and Agile Scrum. The Case Study analyzed two projects: 1) Red Project. The project suffered major delays on the original schedule, thus the Vendor decided to introduce Agile Scrum to reduce such project gap. The project delivered part of its functionality and later it was halted. It is considered a major failure in their Client-Vendor relationship. 2) Blue Project. Second project in timeline. Agile Scrum practices were also introduced after the project was already started through a Vendor initiative. The project experiences neither major delays nor exceptional performance, however Client-Vendor frictions were found in the meantime. The refined Conceptual Model is described in Figure 6 7, page 78. Our findings can be summarized as: 1)The Identification of criteria influencing the reduction of time-to-market: Literature deductions supported by empirical evidence suggest the existence of at six criteria influencing the reduction of time-to-market. Such criteria is expressed in six prepositions the mentioned Conceptual Model (P1,P3,P5,P7,P9,11). 2) Implicit evolution of the Agile Scrum methodology. No scientific evidence was found tracking the implicit simplification of Scrum as a methodology, confirming the gap between practitioners and scientists with regards Agile practices. Additionally, based on the theoretical findings and empirical experience from the Case Study, we derived a set of recommendations to Clients and Vendors aiming to reduce time-to-market while conducting this type of projects. For further research, we recommend the following topics: 1) Complement the current research quantitative research techniques and also conduct case studies in other industries besides telecommunication 2) Investigate the most suitable contract agreements in Agile Scrum Offshore Outsource Projects. 3) The execution of Agile Scrum Offshore Outsource Projects involving multiple organizations and 4) Research on why Agile Scrum certifications are largely concentrated in western countries.","Agile Scrum; Offshoring Outsourcing Software; time-to-market; qualitative research; multiple case-study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Management of Technology","","","",""

The goal of this work is to create a needle that can measure these forces. The design is used in an insertion experiment, to determine if this force information can be used to determine tissue properties and differentiate between tissue layers. A new trocar needle design is presented for measuring forces in the tip of the cutting stylet, only measuring the cutting forces and stiffness forces and excluding the friction forces on the shaft. Through the centre of the stylet of a 20 cm 18 G trocar needle runs an optic fibre with a fibre Bragg grating close to the tip, that will function as an optical strain sensor. The interrogator measures the Bragg wavelength shift caused by a change in strain. The grating is embedded in a PVC jacket to increase the strain in the grating. Calibration was performed in a universal test machine to determine the force - wavelength relationship in a range of 0 - 10 N at different constant temperatures. The calibrated prototype was used in insertion experiments in a phantom model and in an ex vivo tissue model. The total axial force is compared to the prototype output. The calibration revealed a linear force - wavelength relationship where the slope coefficient increases with increasing temperature. The calibration showed an average error of 0.1069 N. In the insertion experiment the output of the prototype has a good correlation with the total axial force. Puncture events are clearly identified in both samples. In the phantom tissue it is seen that the different layers can be differentiated by the gradual change in the output profile. The force from the prototype was overestimated, because insertion experiments were performed outside the calibrated temperature range. To conclude force measurement at the tip of needles is feasible, but has to be further investigated. As a first step this design can be improved by the addition of a method for temperature compensation and the improvement of the measurement accuracy.","needle insertion; force sensor; Fibre Bragg Grating; tip forces; force feedback","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-09-07","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","MIMS","",""

(mentor); Bots, P.W.G. (mentor); Chappin, E.L.J. (mentor)","2012","Gas is essential to the functioning of the Dutch energy system, as it covers nearly half of the total primary energy supply in the Netherlands. Biogas obtained by the digestion of wet biomass may become a growing source of green energy for the Netherlands. The Dutch ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation (EL&I) considers biogas as one of the key options for meeting its policy objective of 14% sustainable energy supply in 2020. Accommodating biogas requires a transition of the Dutch gas system. Currently the decision making in the biogas system is in an impasse, i.e. only a little more than 10% of the biogas projects that were granted an SDE+ subsidy in 2010 is realized (Agentschap NL 2012) and the amount of green gas which is injected in the Dutch gas infrastructure is below expectations as biogas represented less than 0,3% of total primary energy supply in 2010, while the goals are set at 5% in 2020 (CBS 2011). The main obstacle is the policy-making process, in particular the lack of a consistent national policy regarding sustainable energy and the lack of coordination and transparency in the decision making process. The objective of this study is to obtain insight in the decision-making process in the Dutch biogas system in order to contribute to resolving the impasse. An Analysis-of-Options collects relevant data for the decision-making process in order to reveal resource dependencies between actors. These resource dependencies are determined by the possibilities (OPTIONS) that ACTORS have at their disposal to influence the decision-making process and change the final outcome: SCENARIO. A change in the final outcome also results in a change in the pay-off to the involved actors, which is expressed by the VALUES given to options, representing their preferences. We hypothesize that an Analysis-of-Options can provide more transparency in the decision-making process and help coordinate the transition towards an increased use of biogas in the Netherlands. The main research question central in this thesis, is as follows: “Can an Analysis-of-Options help to understand the multi-actor context in the Dutch biogas system in transition in order to support the use of biogas in the Dutch Energy mix towards 2030?” An Analysis-of-Options for the biogas system in the Netherlands was formulated based on literature study and 25 interviews with experts in the Dutch gas system. First, a selection of the relevant actors was made, based on their interest in the biogas issue and their power to influence the decision-making process. For the selected actors, we identified the options at their disposal to influence the decision-making process. Sixteen scenarios were formulated on the basis of four decision areas which determine the future system for biogas: 1) Feed-in point in the national gas infrastructure; 2) Direct or hub injection; 3) Quality conversion; and 4) End-use. The values in the model were estimated based on our findings of the interviews. We validated the model statistically and with an expert meeting with nine experts representing the most relevant parties from the biogas system were present. Based on the performed analyses, we obtained some relevant insights with respect to the Analysis-of-Options approach. We distinguished scientific purpose from practical purpose with respect to the usability of the model. In general, our most important insight is the fact that the Analysis-of-Options is a tool which fits best to situations where the action perspectives are clearly defined, and the options available to the actors are limited. For the biogas system in general, many options exist, and there is a high degree of case specific characteristics that influence the options for individual decision-making issues. The applicability of the Analysis-of-Options is thus expected to be highest for clearly delineated situations for which a larger number of projects decisions have to be taken, such as provincial area planning. For scientific purpose, the Analysis-of-Options approach was mainly focused on the insights we could obtain in the interdependencies between the actors and their potential strategies. The current Analysis-of-Options approach provided insights on the OPTIONS which are essential for achieving particular SCENARIOS. Especially the role of the national government, the local government and the network operator turned out to be essential in all of the strategies, as without subsidies, a permit or construction of a pipeline and injection-point respectively, the scenarios are not feasible. A drawback of the fact that a general biogas approach was chosen, is that it resulted in a limited level of detail in the model and the outcomes. Case-specific factors are essential for the OPTIONS and the VALUATIONS, which in turn have a high impact on the outcomes. An advantage of the general biogas approach is that with relatively little information, some general conclusions could be drawn on the essentiality of actors. Introducing sequentiality in the decision-making process could improve our understanding of the relation between options and values. If a simulation game approach is taken, the involvement of actors in multiple decision-rounds allows for dynamic actions. From our research it can be concluded that what is of scientific value is not considered of highest value for practical purposes. The practical usability of the Analysis-of-Options approach depends very much on the objective with which the analysis is conducted, the specific case at hand and the facilitation that is provided in case multiple actors use the model together. Furthermore, it should be noted that the practical usability depends on the affinity that individual users have with the usage of a model that contains many different input variables (both codes and numbers). Experts found it difficult to assess whether the Analysis-of-Options is of practical use, for that would depend very much on the objective with which it would be used and the specific decision-making problem at hand. Based on the experience in the expert meeting and the discussion with experts, it seems that the practical usability lies mainly in the potential mediation character of discussing the factors in a group-meeting. During the expert meeting the Analysis-of-Options approach structured the discussion and evoked interesting questions which may not have come up without explicitly stating the factors in the model. Experts representing different organizations also noted that they are already aware of interdependencies between each other, options and scenarios. They do not value the Analysis-of-Options for that (more scientific) reason. All in all, we can answer the main research question with yes. However, our analysis so far did not contain enough evidence to proof it scientifically, but we neither found proof to invalidate it. On the basis of our research it is hard to conclude whether the Analysis-of-Options provides useful insights for transition management as we only linked the information we get from the Analysis-of-Options to the information which is necessary in the first three steps of the decision-making process. The merits for this approach in combination to transition management are yet to be confirmed. More research has to be done to validate the potential of incorporating a higher level of detail. A real validation can only be done with hindsight, for instance by reviewing the benefits after the transition has succeeded. Also predictive computer models could be designed for the validation purpose.","actor analysis; Analysis-of-Options; Dutch gas sector; biogas; multi-level perspective; socio-technical system; transition management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor)","2012","The design of current industrial crystallizers is strongly focused on optimisation of known types of crystallization equipment. To get a better control over the physical events governing crystalline product quality the TU Delft started with the development of a task based design (TBD) strategy, which is an example of a phenomena based approach. Task-based design uses physical phenomena to construct tasks, which are used as building blocks for design. In this research, a modelling tool for dynamic simulation of task based solution crystallization processes is developed. This is an important step towards the long term aim of model-based optimisation driven process synthesis. The developed TBD model can be applied to a wide range of crystallization processes: various crystallization methods, operation modes, configurations and a variety in number of streams, compartments and crystallization tasks. The modelling structure is based on compartmental modelling. A new way to connect tasks to this compartment model is developed. This framework supports rapid generation of consistent process models and facilitates analysis of the influence of individual tasks. The model is implemented in gPROMS. To show the ability to quickly construct networks of units representing all kinds of crystallization processes, three different cases are simulated with the new model. Already existing innovative task based equipment from the TU Delft is also implemented, such as an airlift crystallizer, a membrane unit for solvent removal and an ultrasound vessel for the creation of primary nuclei. The first case simulates batch cooling crystallization experiments of ammonium sulphate in an airlift crystallizer with tasks Growth and Seeding and a cooling curve. The results are in agreement with experimental values. Case 2 shows the effect of individual tasks on a batch adipic acid crystallization system using a membrane unit for solvent removal. To demonstrate the future potential of TBD, in the third case a crystallization process is modelled which is never experimentally tested: continuous crystallization of adipic acid in a cascade of airlift crystallizers. Influence of the crystallizers in series on the CSD width is investigated. As expected, more larger crystals with a narrower CSD are produced in the cascade of airlifts. The results show that the developed structure works well. Using the task-function framework, newly developed tasks can be easily added, such that innovative Process Intensifications can be included in the model. The developed TBD model offers potential for model based process design of innovative task based crystallizers.","crystallization; task-based design; modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Intensified Reaction & Separation Systems","",""

(mentor)","2012","Desalinated or demineralised water or even soft water is characteristically low in hardness, alkalinity and pH. Thus, these kinds of water need to be re-conditioned (re-mineralized) before distributing for usage as drinking water. The produced water is expected to satisfy the following requirements: safe quality for human health, no quality change during distribution and no demolishing of the distribution infrastructure (no corrosion or excessive scaling). In order to achieve both targets, the water alkalinity, pH and calcium saturation level must be considered as the three main parameters in re-mineralization process. In general, limestone contactors are frequently used for increasing these three parameters before the water can be distributed. This technology should be considered as one of the most popular conditioning techniques used in drinking water treatment field nowadays. Typical examples are limestone contactors of Ashkelon Desalination plant in Israel, Larnaka sea water reversed osmosis (SWRO) plant in Cyprus and Barcelona SWRO plant in Spain. In fact, the determining factor for remineralized water quality is the kinetics of limestone dissolution. There are several theoretical models (PWP, Chou) as well as practical models (Dreybrodt) to describe the calcite dissolution kinetics. However, the theoretical models tend to idealize the real kinetics in practice while the empirical models are not systematic and constituent to be widely applied. Consequently, this study would mainly focus on developing the two popular theoretical kinetics models (PWP and Chou) to a practical model with theoretical basis that could fully capture the practical calcite dissolution kinetics. On top of that, a layer model concept would be introduced as the base for further developing the downflow and upflow limestone contactor model. Subsequently, simulated results indicate that upflow model is technically more superior to downflow hence providing more economical benefits as well. Vosbeck, Anderlohr’s experiments as well as the marble filtration recorded data at Hoenderloo pumping station of Vitens (Netherlands) would be utilized for building and verifying models throughout this research. In the end, an optimal design would be introduced for the remineralizing process at Hoenderloo marble filtration with the aim to increase the filtering capacity, effluent quality and reducing the operational costs at the same time. In addition to the technical research, a computer based program was built in Excel application with PHREEQC embedded, which includes all of the developed kinetics models for calcite dissolution. The program is developed in order to assist the users as an accurate yet handy tool for quickly predicting or simulating certain calcite dissolution kinetics.","upflow; downflow; limestone; contactor; soft; desalination; water; calcium; carbonate; calcite; dissolution; kinetics; PCM model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

Streaming applications are applications which can be split into several distinct stages working on data elements in a pipelined fashion. We propose a distributed-memory array (MEP- MAS), where the cores communicate via message-passing, optimizing the throughput. Application tasks are dynamically scheduled by a hardware scheduler taking the consumer-producer locality into ac- count, thereby minimizing the communication overhead. The array is evaluated in terms of performance, scalability and predictability as a function of varied input stream sizes, multiple pipelines, number of pipeline stages and traffic volume. The array is configured as a 4 by 5 mesh and has reached speedups as high as 3.6x for a 4-stage pipeline and 13.4x for a 16-stage pipeline. Our experiments have highlighted the need for a balanced workload in order to optimize the performance. Furthermore, it is shown that MEP-MAS is scalable as the speedup and throughput almost linearly increases with the number of added pipelines. The speedup has increased from 3.6x to 13.5x and the throughput from 17k data elements per second to 65k data elements per second. Increasing the traffic volume in the network marginally affects the speedup (-1.9%). Finally, increasing the traffic volume can cause a high deviation in arrival times between two subsequent data blocks in the pipeline of up to 8%.","Multiprocessors; Streaming; Hardware scheduler","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Koster, R.P. (mentor)","2012","Bioplastics change the way plastics are made because they are manufactured from plants like corn and sugar instead of oil. This has many environmental advantages and in the future also financial advantages. Bioplastics are rapidly being developed and applied in various kinds of products. The challenge of this thesis was to understand bioplastics and to investigate how to change a materials perception by changing its sensorial properties. To change the perception of a material it is important to understand what the current perception of it is. By comparing these results to the envisioned perception -natural and high quality- the next step of investigation was to change three sensorial properties of the material and see what effect it had on the preferred image. Qualitative research showed that bioplastics are badly recognizable for consumers or they have never heard of them. However consumers expect the material to look less quality. Since the envisioned perception of the material was high quality and natural a gap needed to be crossed. The conflicting properties between natural and high quality were on smooth and rough, reflective and not reflective and fibers and no fibers. This resulted in twelve materials which were incorporated in two products and rated by 70 participants. They rated that fibers and not reflective materials positively influenced naturalness. Reflectiveness and smoothness positively influenced quality. The stiffness of a material had a larger influence on quality then the presence of fibers. All effects were larger when applied to fibered materials then to materials that had no visible fibers in them. The influence of a product on the perception of a material was small and only applied for strange on rough materials, modern on no fiber materials and quality on no fiber and rough and reflective materials. The materials that were rated highest on both natural and high quality were fibered & smooth materials both reflective and not reflective. The final evaluation study focussed on consumer behaviour and the question if consumers were willing to buy a material with fibers. This qualittive study shows that some consumers are willing to buy the material because they think it look different, feels nice or provides better functionality to the product. The guidelines that were created were designed to aid a professionals in applying the right finish to the material to get the intended perception. 1. The influence of information. Providing information to the consumer will help them to take bioplastics into consideration. 2. Influencing the quality perception. The quality of a material can be improved by making it heavier, smoother, reflective and stiffer. 3. Influencing the perception of naturalness. The naturalness of a material can be imporved by adding fibers or by making it not reflective, heavy and opaque. 4. High quality & natural. The most natural and highest quality material was a fibered, not reflective and smooth material. 5. The influence of colour. Colour has a strong influence on consumer preference. It can aslo affect the naturalness and quality perception of a material. 6. Applying to long term products. More bioplastics should be applied in long term products to show consumers the material in a durable context. These guidelines can be used to create bioplastics that consumers will prefer over traditional plastics.","bioplastic; perception; quality; naturalness; guidelines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

While working on the CAD model of your product, choose the component you wish to use from the component library and simply drag and drop it at the place you want it to be in your product. The Embedables plug-in will make sure it gets connected with the electrical circuit automatically. Directly from your CAD software, you can choose to order the product you just created. Your product will then be fabricated automatically at a DDM (Direct Digital Manufacturing) factory. Welcome to the future of manufacturing! Background Even though 3D-Printing is still quite new to many of us, it has been entering our lives increasingly more and often in unexpected ways and places. However, the technology of AM (Additive Manufacturing) itself is developing fast and soon it will enable 3D-Printing systems to evolve from a prototyping platforms into mature manufacturing processes. Designers currently do not have the tools to use these technologies effectively. On the other hand, Traditionally, products, especially ones containing electronics require many intermediate manual steps before manufacturing as well as during manufacturing. New platforms such as Arduino help designers to get a headstart in improving the former example. However, during manufacturing, in various cases, there is still room for improvement. The product The goals of this project are twofold. One is to develop a manufacturing method using robotics and AM, which forms a step towards DDM. This resulted in the creation of the back-office of Embedables. It is a carefully structured manufacturing platform, consisting of dedicated software and combinations of digitally controlled machines that enable the fabrication of products in the intended way. This way the manual steps during manufacturing are reduced. The other goal is to create a showcase product that uses the Embedables platform. This goal resulted in the current Embedable components and their dedicated CAD plug-in. In theory, interested parties are openly invited to create similar products, that can make use of the Embedables manufacturing platform. This way, designers will have tools to benefit more from the advantages of 3D-Printing.","3D Printing; Additive Manufacturing; Rapid Prototyping; Electronics; Direct Digital Manufacturing; Electronics prototyping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Mesbah, A. (mentor); Van den Hof, P.M.J. (mentor)","2012","One of the main reasons for the success story of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control in process industries has been the difficulty and complexity of modeling chemical, thermal, and physical phenomena in these systems. Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) identification has been found incapable to accurately capture the dynamics in these applications over the entire operating region, while nonlinear identification methods still often result in over-laborious and expensive process modeling tools with a too complex model for control synthesis. The concept of data-driven Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) modeling offers an in-between-solution over LTI and nonlinear identification by describing the signal relations in a linear manner which vary with the operating point of the system. Furthermore, the LPV modeling and control framework is considered to have the potential to become the long-waited solution for the modeling and control problems of the process field. Through the case study of Propane-Propene splitter, which is a commonly used high-purity distillation column, this thesis explores the potential of LPV modeling and identification for process systems. Importantly, the PP-splitter represents a particularly challenging process system due to its Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) nature and significant nonlinear behavior in the high-purity operating region. The results presented in this thesis shows that, although such a system could impose problems for local LPV identification approaches (identification w.r.t. constant operating conditions), the application of global LPV identification (identification w.r.t. varying operating conditions) has found to be able to identify the dynamics of the system even under severe noise conditions. Moreover, the global methodology presented in this thesis, which is called the LPV Least-Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), belongs to an emerging trend of novel approaches which adopt machine learning theories in the system identification. This method is the current state-of-the-art among such learning approaches in the LPV identification framework.","systems and control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","In the last few years there appears to be a paradigm shift in the job recruitment field, from physical contact between recruiters and job seekers to e-recruiting, with online job boards providing the meeting place for both parties. As job boards have gained in popularity so have the number of vacancies and curricula vitae being posted on these sites. Whilst this wealth of online vacancies and CVs provides great opportunities to recruiters and job seekers alike, locating relevant information on the job boards has become an increasingly tedious task. This thesis describes an attempt to alleviate this situation by creating a web application that aids both recruiters and job seekers. Recruiters are offered the possibility to match a CV to all vacancies in the database, providing them with possible leads. Job seekers will also appreciate this functionality as it provides them with job suggestions and saves them time searching through many vacancies. Job seekers are also provided with improved means to search an online vacancy database, through offering them advanced (boolean) search capabilities and improved result ranking. In both cases the effort required to find suitable matches is reduced. A local vacancy database was created by retrieving vacancies from a number of popular Dutch job boards. Data extractors were implemented to automatically extract features such as the function title, job requirements text and required education, skills and competences from the retrieved vacancies, after which the vacancies were clustered on the requirements text using the cosine similarity measure and k-means. The cosine similarity measure was also used as part of the CV vacancy matching algorithm and to improve result ranking when querying the vacancy database. Evaluation of the working prototype demonstrated that whilst some improvement to the data extractors is desirable, the prototype was able to show that improved result ranking and relevant CV-vacancy matches are achievable when CVs and vacancies are of high quality.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Man-Machine Interaction Group","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","The construction of an artificial island is one of the solutions to be able to drill for oil safely in the Caspian Sea. On this island the required facilities are installed. Construction of an artificial island however, results in loading of the subsoil and will trigger settlements. Consolidation is one of the processes which cause the settlement. Differential settlements can damage the shallow foundations on the island. In order to prevent this, an alternative foundation on piles needs to be considered. Piles placed in a thick, soft soil layer will have low end bearing capacity, and thus need to activate skin friction. Since the surrounding soft soil is consolidating, these piles will have their own challenges. The relative movement between pile and soil determines the zones of negative and positive skin friction. Positive skin friction will need to be mobilized to support pile loading. Applying load on the head creates additional pile settlements, thus expanding the zone of positive skin friction. The consequence of this is that the bearing capacity of the pile is increased. This research looks into the two dominant parts of these friction piles in a consolidating soil profile. The driving mechanism, consolidation and subsequent settlement of the subsoil, is studied. Besides that the behavior of the interface between the soil and the installed piled is considered. Site investigations performed at the reference project are interpreted and a ‘Caspian’ soil profile can be determined. Besides this general profile a ‘Centrifuge’ soil profile is determined, which is revised to fit the specifications of the centrifuge. A one layer ‘benchmark’ situation is created to check the different calculation methods. The reaction of the ‘centrifuge’ and ‘benchmark’ soil profiles to the new loading situation is calculated and can be checked with centrifuge measurements. Recreating a two layer soil profile, containing stiff and soft clay, is done in the centrifuge. Msettle, a Hand Calculation and the Plaxis Soft Soil model give an accurate representation of the settlement in the physical model. The settlement in time seems to be described accurately as well. Calculations are done with a constant permeability. The “settlement in time” lines are calculated with Msettle and give a good image of the decrease in permeability during the performed centrifuge tests. The measured compression parameters for Kaolin Clay agree well with the values found in the literature. These compression parameters are tested in an oedometer test, and are given in a one dimensional stress space. Recalculation of the compression parameters into isotropic stress dependent parameters does not give the same settlement predictions. The used relationships given in the Plaxis 2D Material Models manual do not seem to give an accurate relation. The performed direct shear box tests show that the peak friction on the pile-soil interface is mobilized at displacements of about one millimeter. Further shearing led to a decrease in maximum shear stress, the so called residual value.","floating piles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""

(mentor); Timmer, W.A. (graduation committee); Ruiterkamp, Richard (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2012","During the development of an aerodynamic analysis tool to predict non-linear lift and drag coefficients, research was performed on arbitrary wing configurations focusing on airborne wind energy (AWE) applications. The purpose of this research is to develop and examine the accuracy of computationally fast aerodynamic methods. The non-linear part and maximum value of the lift curve, with the corresponding drag, are of great interest for AWE applied wings, since these y at high angles of attack. By means of a trail and error procedure, a most promising method is found. This research was performed via ASSET at the faculty of Aerospace Engineering and Ampyx Power, following the MSc Sustainable Energy Technology at the faculty of Applied Sciences at the Delft University of Technology. Kite technology has been discovered some 3,000 years ago. Since then, kites have been used to for example send messages, pull carts and perform weather measurements. Nowadays, the most advanced kites are used for sports such as kite surfing. Although higher altitudes can be reached with kites and (AWE) have been developed to extract energy from the wind, the wind energy market is dominated by wind turbines. The efficiency of these turbines is reaching the Betz limit, leaving one option to increase power output, which is increasing the operating altitude. However, structural issues will then appear for a wind turbine tower, where a tethered kite can easily y up to several kilometers altitude. The opportunities of kite power systems have been discovered by scientists, which has resulted in a number of 40 active AWE companies around the world. Ampyx Power is one of these companies, where a tethered rigid sailplane, called the PowerPlane, is used to extract energy from the wind…","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
