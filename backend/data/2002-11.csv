(mentor); Wang, Z.B. (mentor); Winterwerp, J.C. (mentor); Hibma, A. (mentor)","2002","The bathymetry of long-stretched tidal basins consists of different kinds of undulations in the seabed (dunes, shoals, et cetera) and a system of meandering and braiding channels. Knowledge about the behaviour of these channel-shoal systems is relevant, both for estuarine management and scientific purposes. Various studies indicate that the interaction between the local bathymetry and the flow leads to residual flow circulations, which play a role in the development of channels and shoals in a tidal basin. A particular form of residual flow circulation is secondary flow induced by curvature of the flow. A curvature of the flow originates for example when water flows through a bend or around a shoal. This secondary flow is a three-dimensional, transversal flow circulation. The main objective of this study is to identify the feedback mechanisms in channel-shoal formation in long-stretched tidal basins. Use is made of the process-based Delft3D modelling system. A tidal basin with a rectangular geometry is modelled, with a semi-diurnal tide as boundary condition at the seaward side. The model simulates two states of the development of channels and shoals in a tidal basin. The first state is an initial state, where the basin consists of channels and shoals that form relatively small, sinusoidal undulations in the seabed. The other state is a state where the basin consists of channels and shoals that are more developed and form relatively large, sinusoidal undulations in the seabed. The main conclusion of this study is that although secondary flow is present in the investigated basins, its magnitude is very small and its effect on residual transports in transversal direction too. The presence of secondary flow in transversal direction and its magnitude is an indication of the three-dimensional character of the flow and therewith an indication of the necessity of carrying out three-dimensional calculations. In future research to the initial development of the morphology of tidal basins with a rectangular geometry with corresponding characteristics as in this research, use can be made of modelling systems making two-dimensional calculations.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2002","The port of Kandla, which is situated in the north west of India and is subject to a large tidal variation of about 5 metres, is preparing a major expansion plan. The capacity of the harbour will be increased in two ways. Firstly the construction of several berths and jetties will allow more ships to be handled on a yearly basis. Secondly deepening of the harbour and its approaches will allow ships with a larger draught to call upon the port. It is this deepening that causes concern. The Kandla Port Trust (KPT) and the Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS) have calculated the amounts of cubic metres that will have to be dredged in order to raise the permissible draught from 10.7 to 14 metres. Especially the maintenance dredging posts a problem. KPT and CWPRS have calculated that between 90 and 111 million m3 have to be dredged annually to maintain the required depths. This is an increase by a factor 20 from the present 5 million m3. The costs that accompany this huge increase of dredging exceeds the extra generated income by large. As no details are known about the calculation methods of both KPT and CWPRS and the expected dredging amounts seem unrealistically high, a goal of this study is to simulate the future situation and determine the dredging amounts that will arise. A second goal is to determine the effects of training walls on the sedimentation in the approach channel, where the largest increase in maintenance dredging is expected. A process-based software package, Delft3D, developed by WLI Delft Hydraulics will be used to simulate the reality. The set up and calibration of the model has led to mixed results. In Kandla Creek, where the port is situated, the flow velocities calculated by the model resemble the measured data quite good. In the area around the approach channel (Sogal Channel), the flow velocities are too low in comparison with reality. This has consequences for the morphodynamics in the region. The morphological development in Kandla Creek shows better results than the morphological activity in the shallower vicinity of the approach channel, where little to no morphological change has occurred. The simulation of the future situation has led to the calculation of a significantly lower increase in maintenance dredging than found by KPT and CWPRS. Even though assumptions have been made the increase amounted to a more realistic magnitude of a factor 3. The costs that accompany this increase are significantly smaller than the extra income generated by the expansion. Implementing training walls to divert or contract the flow in order to decrease sedimentation by means of natural flushing of Sogal Channel will not be necessary from an economical point of view. The simulation of a few training wall layouts however has been done to obtain insight in the morphological development of the approach channel. The first concept consists of a wall in line with the main flow direction. The idea is to guide the flow more into the main channel creating more natural flushing and stabilising the channel in its present position. The effect of this proposal however is negligible, as the main flow isn't deflected enough. The flow velocity in the bend of the channel is increased only marginally, especially in the creek outfall. The extra erosion in that area isn't beneficial as the depth is large enough already. In order for this concept to be more effective a larger portion of the flow (both ebb and flood) needs to be directed into the channel and therefore the training wall has to be less in line with the existing flow direction. The model has to be adjusted to create a different alignment of the wall. The other two concepts block a part of the flow and only allow water to flow through the channel. This is done by implementing training walls perpendicular to the flow direction. The first of these concepts consists of a staggered wall, which does not block the flow completely. Water is able to flow through the wall, albeit that the flow is severely hindered. The second layout blocks the flow completely and all of the water is directed through the channel. Both concepts have a favourable effect on the morphological development of the bend in the channel, which becomes subject to erosion. The problem however is shifted towards other parts of the approach channel, which become subject to sedimentation. The effect is roughly twice -as large in case of total blockage than in case of the staggered training wall. The impact of these proposals is very severe. The rate of morphological change is very high as the present hydrodynamic situation is gravely affected. It is not clear what the effect will be in the long run. The results of the simulations have to be interpreted cautiously. In the process of modelling assumptions have been made. A few of these assumptions had to be made due to a shortage of data, while others have been made in order to simplify the problem so that it could be dealt within the scope of this study. The quantitative results cannot serve as a basis on which conclusions are formulated. A qualitative analysis however is possible, which can be found in this report. The overall conclusion of this study is that the best way to enlarge and maintain the maximum permissible draught is to increase dredging. The extra costs of the increase in maintenance dredging weighs up to the extra-generated income. Furthermore the impact of the different training walls is too severe and the uncertainties that accompany this impact in the long run are too plentiful.","estuary; morphology; India; Kandla; maintenance dredging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Bij het hydraulisch lossen dient het zandpakket eerst te worden gefluseerd, dit gebeurt doormiddel van waterjets. Voor het optimaliseren van de beunvorm en het jetsysteem van een sleephopperzuiger is het van groot belang om zowel meer te weten van de stromingsmechanismen onder invloed van jetten als van de grondmechanische aspecten die een rol spelen bij de stabiliteit en ontwikkeling van een ontgrondingskuil onder in een zandpakket. De doelstelling van deze studie was het verkrijgen van inzicht in de mechanismen die bepalend zijn voor het losmaakproces onder invloed van een horizontale waterjet in combinatie met een leegzuigsysteem, welke beide op een vaste positie in een zandpakket zijn geplaatst. Allereerst is er een uitgebreid literatuuronderzoek verricht. Om datgene wat in de literatuurstudie werd gevonden te toetsen en om het inzicht in de mechanismen verder te vergroten zijn er modelproeven uitgevoerd in de baggergoot van WL | Delft Hydraulics. Op basis van zowel de resultaten uit de literatuurstudie als op basis van de resultaten uit de modelproeven zijn een tweetal modellen opgesteld, het waterstraal-/ erosierekenmodel en het stabiliteitsmodel. Met behulp van het waterstraal-/ erosierekenmodel wordt de stroomsnelheid aan het front van de ontgrondingskuil berekend. Dit wordt gedaan door de ontgrondingskuil te schematiseren als een cirkelvormige ondoorlatende koker, waarin de jet spuit. Met behulp van het stabiliteitsmodel wordt berekend gedurende welke periode het bovenliggende zandpakket zijn stabiliteit behoudt. De belangrijkste conclusies die volgen uit deze studies zijn ten eerste dat er kan worden geconcludeerd dat het erosie- en het instabiliteitsmechanisme de twee maatgevende mechanismen zijn in het losmaakproces en dat het inzicht in de mechanismen is vergroot. Ten tweede kan worden geconcludeerd dat de 2 gepresenteerde rekenmodellen bruikbaar zijn voor afschattende berekeningen en hiermee tegelijkertijd een brede basis is gelegd voor een integraal 3D-jetmodel.","","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

Met de komst van steeds snellere computers met betere grafische mogelijkheden is naast het oplossen van problemen ook het uitbeelden van de problemen steeds belangrijker geworden. De animatie wordt steeds vaker gebruikt om de opdrachtgever of het grote publiek te overtuigen van de kracht van simulatie. Door de complexe vervoersstromen in de hedendaagse havens heeft simulatie ook in deze sector een belangrijke plaats ingenomen. De naam van het simulatiepakket dat hier vaak voor gebruikt wordt is Prosim, een pakket dat zeer geschikt is voor het simuleren van de havenlogistiek. Ondanks dat het pakket zeer geschikt is voor de simulatie van havens zitten er een aantal nadelen aan het pakket. Een van de nadelen is de beperkte mogelijkheid tot het maken van animatie. Hierdoor is de onderzoeksvraag ontstaan: Welk simulatiepakket is geschikt voor het simuleren van de vervoersstromen in hedendaagse havens en heeft dit pakket uitgebreide animatiemogelijkheden ? Om tot de oplossing te komen van de vraagstelling zijn vijf pakketten door middel van een multi criteria analyse (mca) met elkaar vergeleken. Tevens is er een testcase in de vorm van een model met het gekozen pakket gemaakt. De onderzochte pakketten zijn: * eM-Plant (Tecnomatix) * Arena (Rockwell simulation software automation) * Automod (Brooks automation) * Prosim (Prosim B.V.) * 4 Tomas (H.P.M. Veeke en J.A. Ottjes) De volgorde van geschiktheid op basis van de gestelde criteria en de gewichten van deze criteria is weergegeven op basis van de rangorde van de bovenstaande tabel. De grootste verschillen tussen de verschillende pakketten zijn te vinden in animatie, flexibiliteit en documentatie. Door middel van een casestudie is er volgens gekeken of het gekozen simulatiepakket daadwerkelijk geschikt is voor het maken van havensimulaties. De case studie betrof een haven waarin een aantal problemen spelen. Deze problemen worden vooral veroorzaakt door een gebrek een capaciteit en een te geringe diepte. Voor de haven zijn een aantal alternatieven opgesteld: * Behouden van de huidige situatie (0-alternatief). * De aanleg van een extra aanlegplaats in combinatie met een vergroting van de diepte naar CD -11 meter bij twee van de vier aanlegplaatsen. * De aanleg van een extra aanlegplaats in combinatie met een vergroting van de diepte naar CD -13 meter bij twee van de vier aanlegplaatsen. Deze alternatieven zijn vervolgens uitgewerkt in de vorm van simulatiemodellen.","","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""
