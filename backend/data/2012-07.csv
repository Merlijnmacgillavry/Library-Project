The FFOD algorithm is evaluated by checking the introduced requirements and benchmarking using the Bonn Benchmark on Tracking (BoBoT).

(mentor)","2012","The effective thickness of the bedload layer over a river bed can be schematised as the total volume of bedload sediment that is in transport, divided by the surface. In practice, this layer is considered to have a constant thickness over time. Main question of this thesis is whether this assumption is valid. By analyzing the mass balance, it is possible to gain an approximation of the reality. By means of numerical approximations, it is possible to build a morphological model which imitates these equations. This imitation makes it possible to analyze the effect of specific parameters on the sediment transport and the bed surface elevation. In this way, the effect of neglecting the derivative over time of the effective thickness of the bedload layer can be investigated. The model of a river section of the Rhine between Emmerich am Rhein and Lobith results in a maximum influence of the derivative of the effective thickness of the bedload layer on the morphodynamic changes as the result of one flood event that is smaller than 4%. A parameter study makes it possible to test the obtained result on sensitivity. Because the morphodynamic model is based on a lot of input parameters, a well founded choice between the large variety of parameters has to be made. A rough sensitivity test shows that the at maximum 4% influence on the derivative is subject to a possible variation of approximately a factor 2, depending on the variation in the input parameters.","morphodynamic; morphodynamic model; numerical model","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The second perspective was a literature review followed by practical work. It had to reveal and prove the behaviour of coarse particles in laboratory batch flotation tests. Flotation experiments with fixed parameters and operating at low froth bed thickness were conducted. Different particle size distributions of a porphyry copper ore were tested. Different behaviour for different particle size fractions was observed. Mineral liberation data indicated the availability of liberated, binary and ternary chalcopyrite in the concentrate. The liberation of chalcopyrite indicates the optimum aperture size for fine wet screens.

(mentor); Cila, N. (mentor)","2012","Product metaphors are products that refer to something else in order to convey a meaning. In a product metaphor the product itself is the target, and the reference is called the source. The association between the target and source is what makes it possible to convey the meaning to the product metaphor. The representation of the source is called the mapping. In this research we tested the hypotheses that the aesthetic appreciation of a product metaphor will grow, when the association is novel, yet comprehensible and the mapping is subtle, yet identifiable. In the first study 60 participants rated 60 existing product metaphors on how novel, comprehensible, subtle, identifiable and aesthetic they are. The results show that our hypotheses are correct, furthermore it shows that the mapping has more influence on the aesthetic preference than the association. Also, comprehensibility and identifiability have more influence on the aesthetic preference than novelty and subtlety. We suspect that this is because the metaphor first needs to be recognized for the observer can start to think about the metaphor, and then there can only be a appreciation when the metaphor is understood. The second study digged deeper into the mapping, we created two product metaphors and made nine variations for each. These nine variations varied on three levels on identifiability and on three levels on subtlety. 79 participants rated all the variations. We found that when the mapping was moderately to highly subtle the aesthetic appreciation would increase. Unless the mapping is very identifiable, then it doesn’t matter how subtle the mapping is, also at this point it is the most aesthetically pleasing.","product metaphors; metaphor; aesthetics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

My concern in my tall design project is to find a new high-rise typology which could integrate with eixsting urban fabric and street life in an intensifying city. When a city population increase, building scales enlarges and the city may grow into metropolitian. Existing buildings in the city may transform into mega block or super tall buildings. Such mega block building would kill the streetscape and block the urban fabric. Residents living in those building would sense isolation from neighborhood and the lost of identity. It is important to tackle the social problems by introducing new strategies to design high-rise residential buildings. The design is to achieve a rich neighborhood and lively streetscape by re-composite the arrangement of high-rise components to create a new kind of tall building typology.","tall; typology; social","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-03","Architecture","Architecture","","Materialization; TALL","",""

(mentor)","2012","We present a framework for learning arithmetic expressions from a set of observations. Our intention is to introduce a Bayesian method for what is known as equation discovery. Our method is based on measuring a degree of belief (posterior probability) for a set of hypothesized expressions to find those which best explain the observed data. This measure is used as the basis for choosing one hypothesis over another. In our work we distinguish two tasks in the process of equation discovery, namely: the task of exploring the space of arithmetic expressions and that of evaluating the degree that an expression describes the data. Separating these two, allows us to investigate them independently. For the first task, we use a context-free grammar to construct a large set of expressions which we take as our hypothesis space. The set contains a large number of hypotheses (each an arithmetic expression) that should be tested against the data. We also evaluate complexity of for each expression using the grammar. The complexity is presented to the model in the form of a prior probability. Our main focus here is the second task: the posterior evaluation using a Bayes formulation. The method tests a hypothesized expression against a set of provided samples that have quantitative input features. It calculates a likelihood probability which expresses the degree that a hypothesis describes the data. A final posterior probability is calculated based on the prior and the likelihood, that is the measure of qualification for each expression.","Rule-based Learning; Equation Discovery; Bayesian Learning; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","Pattern Recognition and Bioinformatics","",""

(mentor)","2012","The purpose of this study is to find an appropriate sky model for further development of an artificial daylight solution. The current concept for the artificial daylight solution, developed at Philips Research, contains a skylight with a static sky view. To make this concept more realistic and appealing Philips is interested in investigating how to convert the current skylight solution to one that provides ‘daylight’ dynamics. These dynamics should mimic the real changes in the position of the sun in the sky and should change the lighting in the room accordingly. To implement appropriate dynamics two models widely used in literature for the luminance values of the sky over daytime were studied and based on those models two additional, simplified models for the sky luminance were developed. One of the simplified models used a homogeneous luminance value, whereas the other interpolated the luminance linearly between a minimum and maximum value. The two models from literature and the two simplified versions were implemented in Matlab and their effect on the illumination in a real room was rendered in images. For the renderings HDR environmental maps of the skies were made and used as the light source for a 3D scene. Three different scenes all of the same room with a view outside were used: one contained only windows, one only skylights and the third one contained both. The renderings were compared in two experiments: the first experiment determined which model performed best in terms of realism and appeal of the daylight, and the second experiment determined which time of day was most realistic and appealing. The results of the experiments showed that overall the models from literature performed best, while the simplified linear model performed worst. However, for the scene with only skylights there was no significant difference between the simplified models and the models from literature, and so the simplified models were considered as realistic and appealing as the more complicated ones. The results of the second experiment showed that somehow the earliest time of the day was preferred over noon and later times of the day. From the results it can be concluded that a simplified sky model can equally well be used in an artificial daylight solution than a more complex model from literature, but only for a scene with only skylights. When there is a view to the sky near the horizon the simplified models scored significantly worse than those from literature. So, because Philips Research currently develops an artificial skylight solution the author advices to use a simple model of the sky luminance and to examine more complicated alternative models only when needed for window-type of artificial lighting solutions.","daylight simulation; artificial daylight","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Interactive Intelligence","","","",""

(mentor); Enserink, B. (mentor); Tan, Y.H. (mentor)","2012","From economic perspective, standards provide information (e.g. increasing market transparency and reducing transaction costs), foster compatibility (e.g. positive network externalities and increased competition) and reduce variety (facilitating economies of scale and building a critical mass). There are growing debates about whether using open standards in public sector will or will not bring the potential benefits as indicated in qualitative literature, while a common methodology for quantification of benefits of standards is not readily available. This paper will explore the possibility to adopt methodologies used in other field in the context of public IT procurement. We outline our main question as following: What methodologies are used to assess the benefit of open standards at micro-level and macro-level, and to what extent can these methodologies be applied in the context of public IT procurement? This report describes three methodologies: ISO Methodology, econometric modeling, and Cost-Benefit Analysis, for economic impact assessment of standards and gives numerous examples of their application. ISO Methodology ISO Methodology is developed to ex-post evaluate the micro impacts of application of open standards in private sector from organizational perspective. Overview of the pilot cases found main impacts for most companies are reduced transaction cost due to easy access to information, and economies of scale due to reduced number of suppliers/ raw material/ mass productions. From the analysis of ISO Methodology and cases, we can say that ISO Methodology indeed provides a set of methods to measure the impacts on organizational value creation; however it has limitations including difficulty to isolate the impacts of standards to other factors and to estimate accurately, which are inherent problem in quantification of impacts. Econometric Modeling Econometric modeling uses statistical methods to empirically test the relationship between macro economic performance, e.g. economic growth and trade, and stock of standards. Studies have found that standards have a positive influence on economic growth; international standards often have a positive relationship to exports and imports; and there is no single answer to relationship between national standards and trade. However, there are limitations conducting the econometric modeling to test the standards’ impact on macro performance. Firstly, patents and standards could turn out to be highly co-linear, which lead to the elasticity estimates of standards be the upper bound on the estimated contribution of standards to the growth. Econometric modeling does not present us a detailed picture of how standards impact on the macro economic performance; and thirdly the number of standards is taken as a legitimate proxy for the quality of standards without considering the importance and functionality of different standards. Cost-Benefit Analysis Cost-Benefit Analysis is initially developed to evaluate the social effects of infrastructure projects. Cost-Benefit Analysis is ‘social’ in nature and includes all types of effects. CBA is mostly used as ex-ante evaluation. The three standard implementation cases studied show that the most quantitative benefit is improved efficiency; some social impacts are not quantified, such as the main goals of implementation of open standards, i.e. to increase interoperability and reduce the supplier-dependence. Additional research presents us a classification of types of consumer switching cost in the IT field and a simple way to estimate the switching cost just using price and market share, which make it possible to investigate the switching costs as indication of vendor lock-in. Redundant transaction costs could be measured as an indication for imperfect interoperability. Ex ante CBA is always disputable. Firstly, it lies in the difficulties to measure the societal impacts, e.g. put price tag to put price tag to non-price effects and leave qualitative effects aside. This requires careful interpretation of result when benefits are not easily quantifiable in monetary terms. Secondly, as in ex ante CBA, results depend largely on assumption made about the future trend, which is highly complicated and subjectively. Thirdly, it arises from the evaluation process being as a ‘black box’, leaving room for strategic manipulations. Comparative overview Comparison of the three methodologies gives a picture of complementarity. The focus level is complementary. Econometric modeling focuses on macro-level, ISO Methodology studies in micro-level; CBA includes both the micro and/or macro-level. Secondly, the three methodologies together cover both private and public sector. Thirdly, the three methodologies measure the benefits of applying standards at different time points. Moreover, the three methodologies are complementary because they measure different dimensions of benefits of standards. By comparing all quantified benefits to potential benefits indicated in literature, we can find that to date the most observed and recognized benefits of using standards in monetary value are reduction of transaction cost and economies of scale. In addition, switching cost can be measured as indication of magnitude of vendor lock-in; redundant transaction costs can be measure as an indication for imperfect interoperability. For perception of stakeholders, such as trust due to improved quality, environment and policy compliance, it is hard to be quantified to monetary value. The three methodologies suffer from some limitations. For example, it is hard to isolate impacts of standards from other factors; and each methodology can only address part of the effects of standards. Moreover, there are also estimation errors. Partially the limitation is caused by cognitive limitations of analysts; partially it is caused by explicitly or implicitly strategic manipulation and misinterpretation, which should be avoided at best. The three methodologies are complementary and they together cover all fields. Theoretically, the combination of the three methodologies could assess benefits of standards in any field. Depending on the scope of the problem, the author of the study can choose a suitable methodology or combined methodologies to conduct in its specific context. Although certain benefits of standards are not easily quantifiable, the three methodologies provide ways to quantify the benefits of using standards in a systematic way. Qualitative methodologies, such as Multi-Criteria Analysis and Value Measuring Methodology, are able to compare all possible effects of projects, which is helpful to get the perception of stakeholders on different alternatives and support the political decision making. But qualitative methodologies bring more political controversial, as MCA and VMM depends on political weights on criteria. In summary, to choose which methodology depends on the aim and scope of the problem, keep in mind that each methodology has its limitations. Recommendation Firstly, current assessment reports have not quantified the most important objectives of using open standards in public sector, such as increased interoperability and vendor independence. Further studies should include quantification of these effects. These cases should try to quantify all impacts, or as many effects as possible, to give an actual picture on whether there are substantial savings due to increased using of open standards in public sector. More complete cases on value of standards implementation should be done. As studies accumulates, it is suggested to reach a standardized guideline including a list of impacts of standards and possible techniques to measure certain impacts. Secondly, to make it clear the position of quantification methodologies in the decision making process. Incomplete and inaccurate results could be interpreted in different ways. Moreover, in order to ensure the process of quantification be transparent (to make the assumptions and the estimation clear), peer review are needed.","Benefits of open standards; Quantification Methods; Public IT Procurement; ISO Methodology; Cost Benefit Analysis; Econometric Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-07-25","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructure Systems & Services Department","","Information and Communication Technology","",""

Het project begon met een vooronderzoek. Hierbij moest uitgezocht worden hoe het huidige systeem in elkaar zat, waar de data vandaan kwam en hoe de data verwerkt werd. Ook werd gekeken hoe het huidige systeem gebruikt werd en hoe wij dit konden verbeteren. Er werd met medewerkers gesproken en hieruit werden requirements voor het gewenste systeem opgesteld. Het belangrijkste van heel het project is toch het zichtbaar maken van data in de vorm van grafieken. Tijdens het vooronderzoek hebben wij verschillende Libraries bekeken, en uiteindelijk voor FLOT gekozen omdat dit een gratis Library was. Tijdens de oriëntatiefase hebben wij er ook voor agile-programming gekozen. Dit omdat het een flexibele manier is van programmeren waardoor late requirements toch redelijk eenvoudig konden worden toegevoegd. Tijdens de voorbereiding kwamen we al op enkele obstakels, waaronder de werkomgeving binnen het bedrijf. Het werd ons niet gemakkelijk gemaakt om overal bij te kunnen, maar de ICT-afdeling willigde al onze eisen in. Ook was Historian, een hoofdbestandsdeel van het systeem, een belemmering. Er kon niet direct bij de data en binnen het bedrijf was daar ook niet de expertise om ons hiervoor te helpen. Een bedrijf, Novotek, is gespecialiseerd in Historian en kon ons hierbij van dienst zijn. Doordat het even duurde voordat dit probleem opgelost kon worden, hadden we veel tijd om de basis goed gestructureerd te krijgen zodat daar niets meer aan hoefde te veranderen. Zo waren de requirements van taken al volledig geimplementeerd voordat we aan het historian-gedeelte begonnen, zodat dit geen omkijken meer had. Ook was de layout van de applicatie helemaal op orde zodat vast stond waar alles kwam en dat alles ook daadwerkelijk daar kwam. Door heel vroeg al branches publiekelijk te maken kon er al vroeg door de gebruiker getest worden waardoor eventuele fouten sneller konden worden verwerkt. Wanneer een deel van het programma functioneerde werd het online gezet. De reden hierachter is dat wij ons realiseerden dat wij te weinig tijd hadden om alles geautomatiseerd te testen. Door de verschillende branches kregen we ook positieve feedback. Het zag er goed uit en ze waren blij dat het eindelijk eens was opgepakt. Deze feedback werd meegenomen tijdens het ontwikkelproces om hier en daar elementen te wijzigen of toe te voegen.

(mentor); De Jong, M. (mentor); Van Beers, C. (mentor); Elmorsi, K. (mentor)","2012","Various authors propose that half of the national and cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) fail to achieve their prior-set targets. One of the most cited cause of failures is ‘culture clashes’. The ‘socio-cultural issues’, as they are in mostly cited, are believed to influence the integration of acquisitions and the overall success of the combined organizations. However, the direction of influence is not always clear for all the identified factors. This research is focusing on technology-driven acquisitions and on the socio-cultural issues that appear during the integration period of such firms into the acquiring large organization. The sponsor of the research is Philips International, through its New Venture Integration department. The research was organized as follows: firstly, a literature review was conducted, in order to identify the most important socio-cultural issues that appear in the post-acquisition period and their influence on acquisitions’ success. Then, a conceptual model of factors and interrelations was developed. This draft model tackles acquisitions in general, not only technology-driven deals, due to insufficient literature on socio-cultural dynamics characterizing the latter. The initial model was further improved after collecting empirical data in ten Philips’ technology-driven acquisitions. The empirical data was analyzed after being transcribed and coded with the help of the MAXQDA software package. The findings helped the researcher improve the initial conceptual model, as technology-driven characteristics are taken into considerations. Finally, the improved scheme of socio-cultural factors and interrelations was tested against the opinions of various external and internal experts: post-acquisition managers from Philips, two other corporations and two consultancy firms. The resulting model proposes that, among the socio-cultural factors that appear in the post-acquisition period, organizational commitment has a central role: all the other identified socio-cultural factors should be tackled in the direction of improving organizational commitment (i.e. changing the employees’ psychological contract towards the new organization). This offsets the role of cultural differences in the post-acquisition period. In other words, this research proposes that it is not the cultural fit that makes or breaks the deal, but the commitment of the resulting organization, towards achieving its vision of the future. Other important factors identified in the model were: communication, leadership commitment & skills, a shared vision of the future and cultural awareness. Cultural factors cannot easily be disentangled in practice from other social factors. Also, solving various cultural issues in the post-acquisition period is possible only after accounting for these other factors. Another insight is that the so-called ‘cultural clashes’ can originate, not from the existing cultural differences themselves, but from exercises of power from the acquirer’s side.","technology-driven acquisitions; post-acquisition management; integration of acquisitions; socio-cultural integration; socio-cultural factors; organizational commitment; cultural awareness; communication; leadership; shared vision of the future","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-23","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

At room temperature, the thermal motion of the system is the smallest amplitude of motion possible and this can be detected if the detector has a high sensitivity. We present a high frequency transmission line resonator operating in the GHz frequency regime as a detector to measure such small changes in motion. Graphene, an atomically thin membrane of carbon will be used in a capacitor geometry with the detector to measure its thermal motion. The motion of graphene is transduced into capacitance which in turn modulates the electrical resonance frequency of the detector. This non-linear effect produces intermodulation sidebands which contain the resonance signature of the graphene membrane which can be read out at thermal noise limited sensitivity. The thesis discusses the design of the detector from analytical modeling to electromagnetic simulations. Fabrication of the complete device is also discussed. Measurement results indicate that the detector has a Q factor of 43 at room temperature.

(mentor); Schiele, A. (mentor)","2012","This thesis reports on the development of an efficient grasp master for space robotics teleoperation that will complement the haptic human arm master X-Arm-2 (Schiele 2011). It should provide the hand and fingers of various operators with sensing and feedback functions, enabling bilateral teleoperation of various types of robotic end-effectors in different control architectures to perform a wide range of tasks. Analysis of the state of the art of reported grasp masters reveals issues that limit their use in combination with arm master devices. Two important factors involved are device placement w.r.t. the operator (e.g. arm coverage by actuators and arm workspace limitation by external transmissions) and structural complexity (bulky designs leading to uncomfortable operation and mechanical losses). Because of these issues, the device efficiency, defined as the user- and device performance achieved with respect to the resources expended, appears to be generally too low. It is the goal of this work to present on the development of an efficiency grasp master device that can be used by various operators in space robotics teleoperation without requiring device adjustments. By following a human-centric design approach, considering relevant space operation tasks, required operator grasp types, and psychophysical effects in human grasping, a reduction of the required number of DOFs of a possible master device was achieved. In combination with the separation of control and feedback channels this can constitute an efficient device concept and was elaborated into a detailed prototype design in this work. As a tool in the design of device geometry and workspace verification, an adaptable kinematic human hand model was constructed and partially verified. This model is based on human functional anatomy and is easily adaptable to various real human hand sizes by the use of body proportions. Verification of the grasp master workspace showed robustness against hand size variation from the 5th female- till 95th male percentile. Verification by analysis and simulation showed that key human factors- and performance requirements can be met. Verification using device efficiency indicators, proposed for the purpose, indicates that the grasp master design is relatively efficient w.r.t. other compared devices based on slave controllability, slave observability, and the quality of the reflected force. The proposed prototype design will be manufactured to enable further verification by testing and validation of real user interaction.","Space Robotics Teleoperation; Haptic Hand Grasp Master","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-07-20","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biome","","BMD","",""

The aim of this thesis was to find a definition for a robust system and to use this definition to search for an added value of robust design in structural engineering. The literature on robust design has been extensively studied to establish a definition for a robust system. Also, several so-called ‘robust’ design methods were tested for their applicability. It was concluded that these methods are all inferior to the lifecycle cost optimization as introduced by van Dantzig, when it comes to structural engineering. Namely, in practice, when designing a system it is always the priority to find a costs-optimal design alternative. It was concluded that a robust system can be found by assuming that the additional risk that arises due to discrepancies between the reality and the model, is smaller for a robust system than for a less robust system. In other words, the lifecycle costs of a robust system are least sensitive for discrepancies. The choice for a robust design alternative will however only be economically justified if the expected lifecycle costs, as calculated from the model, are less than or equal to the expected lifecycle costs of any other design alternative. The reason for this it that robustness focusses on hazards for which no value of the risk can be defined, so that it cannot be quantified what may be spent on robustness. This definition of a robust system was tested in several case studies. From these case studies it was concluded that robustness can be achieved by increasing the reliability of the system, or by searching for a robust design alternative. Increasing the reliability will always increase the expected lifecycle costs, so that the robust system is not cost-optimal. Finding a robust design alternative may be possible without automatically increasing the expected lifecycle costs. Therefore it is recommended to investigate different alternatives when designing a robust system.","robust design; lifecycle costs; optimization task; Taguchi; probabilistic; dike","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

(mentor)","2012","Active cameras are increasingly used to extend the area coverage and to improve image quality in video surveillance. With such a pan-tilt-zoom camera, operators can control its rotation around two axes and can use an optical zoom to get a better shot. Although multiple video streams are monitored simultaneously on a large grid of displays, they lack spatial correlations that the operators can rely on. In stressful situations, such as during the pursuit of a target, it is hard for the operator to maintain situation awareness while controlling cameras and switching between them. In this work, an interface is presented that helps the operator in controlling the cameras while maintaining spatial knowledge of the environment. Its design extends the work of De Haan et. al. on augmented surveillance interfaces, which only uses static video cameras. First, pan-tilt-zoom camera operation is integrated by providing the user with new camera controls and visual feedback methods. Second, the special hardware joystick is replaced by a simple mouse and keyboard control in order to have a seamless integration with the overall system. Finally, the user is assisted in steering multiple active cameras by automatically determining and focusing an optimal camera based on user-indicated target location and movement direction. As active cameras allow live interaction by the operator, it is difficult to experiment and consistently perform evaluations using real-life surveillance systems. Therefore, the prototype interface is implemented upon a simulator which generates virtual scenarios and live content. Evaluation measures are designed to measure situation awareness and performance of the operator during the pursuit of a target. In the evaluations performed, the prototype was found to have a better learning curve, a better ease of use and user performance is increased in comparison to a classical interface. These findings indicate that the presented interface can enhance operator performance in surveillance control rooms that monitor vast and complex areas.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Computer Graphics","",""

(mentor); Aprile, W.A. (mentor); Mayer, I.S. (mentor)","2012","This thesis describes the complete redesign of the serious game TeamUp. Introduction At the faculty of Technology, Policy and Management a first concept of a serious game had been developed to assist in teamwork training. The goal of this graduation project was to take this concept and develop it into a full featured prototype that can be used to test all intended aspects. The goal of this concept game was to facilitate assessment and training of teamwork through a serious game, however a lot of refinement and expansion on the original concept was required to develop it further. The reasoning for using a serious game in this context is, that currently most training tools that assess users do this based on limited input from the users and/or observation. The advantage of game technology in this context is that it could allow far more fine grained statistics to be recorded during a training session. In addition, shorter feedback loops can be used to encourage different behaviour in users which could lead to a faster learning experience for the end user. The game was designed to allow for easy use in a way that inexperienced users do not need to spend a significant amount of time just trying to understand how to play the game, nor should they have a serious disadvantage while playing the game with others with more experience in this field. Process As the project was a continuation of previous work the previous version of the game was first studied to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the previous prototype's implementation. In addition the needs of the various stakeholders were analyzed to gain a better understanding of the requirements of the final product. Based on this analysis a new design directions was formulated. Various specific parts of the game, such as the challenges the players would be faced with and the user interfaces used in the game, were studied and concepts were generated to design a new prototype that would these requirements. Finally a new prototype was developed to evaluate this new design direction. To ensure that the game worked will for its intended audience an iterative approach to the development of this new prototype was chosen with extensive user tests to create short feedback loops. Results A completely redesigned and rebuild prototype of the game was delivered. The new version is more than twice as long and provides a more comprehensive and consistent experience. The game also features logging capabilities that are designed to work together with a research and facilitation tooling currently under development at the faculty of Technology, Policy and Management. When this tooling is completed it will allow workshop facilitators who use the game to gain detailed insights in each individual player's as well as their team's actions. In addition the extensive datasets from each play session can form the basis of further research in teamwork in general.","design; serious games; teamwork","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Koornneef, F. (mentor); De Bruijne, M. (mentor); Van Steenbergen, J. (mentor)","2012","This thesis explores to build a Safety Management System for infectious disease outbreak control in the Netherlands. Q-fever and Salmonella were two major disease outbreaks in the past decade. The outbreak management were criticised for ineffective implementation of control measures, and the magnitude of the outbreaks increased by years. Although they were not as contagious and lethal as pandemics such as SARS, but the well-being of the people were threatened. Moreover, the two outbreaks did not end well: relevant actors had fallen victim to last-minute remedies which cost a large proportion of their properties. RIVM (National Institute of Public Health and Environment) has initiated a project to investigate the past outbreaks, aiming at a clearer understanding of the complexity of the situation back in time during the outbreaks, and calling for strategies for improving the outbreak management system in the country. The research project started with studying four evaluation reports on Q-fever and Salmonella. Phase I of the research focused on reconstructing chains of events, which led to root causes analysis of unwanted events. Fact reconstruction tool Event and Conditional Factors Analysis+ (ECFA+) was used to analyse the two cases. Significant events were picked from the resulted ECF chart, and underwent Cause Change Control Analysis (3CA), out of which work controls/protective barriers and root causes of the significant events were obtained. Results of ECFA+ and 3CA were revised within the project team with the attendance of an expert from RIVM. Phase II of the research focused on system building and discussion. A Risk Management System (RMS) for outbreak control and a companion Business Process Model (BPM) were constructed to address the controls or protective barriers identified in the 3CA analysis. Organisational Learning (OL), as an embedded process in a risk management system, was mapped to the RMS, and then barriers to organisational learning were discussed. After a focus group discussion, recommendations were given in terms of a guideline of gap analysis for the safety management system, as well as how to tackle the barriers to organisational learning in the system for outbreak control. This exploratory study attempted to combine incidents investigation tools (ECFA+3CA), using abductive reasoning as a base to formulate explanations for the occurrence of unwanted events and to build a safety management system preventing such occurrence. The resulted RMS steps and business process model added systemic perspectives to the infectious disease outbreak control management in the Netherlands.","infectious disease; outbreak management; incidents investigation tools; safety management system; risk management system; organisational learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Safety Science Group","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Wormgoor, R. (mentor)","2012","This project started with a visit to Xtenders where a tough model of a new concept came to my attention. This sketch looked different from at the time produced by Xtenders models and evoked some curiosity that emerged into the graduation thesis. Xtender is a Dutch brand that builds yacht tenders. The main advantage of the product has been defined by the used production technology. Carbon pre-preg laminate was used in combination with special curing system called Autoclave to produce the most parts of the tenders. Further, all tenders were custom built and required a modular approach to optimise the production costs. Back then Xtenders were only RIB (Rigid Inflatable Boats) tenders in their portfolio and we looking ahead to expand their portfolio. The idea came due to the high investment costs for new moulds to research the possibilities within the existing 12.3m RIB hull by extending it upwards. This way a new type of the boat would be created called Solid-Hulled boat. In order to realize significant results in the given time, a boundary has been set. Following constructives of the product design received the main attention: 1. First, strategical decisions had to be made to define the main aesthetic and functional qualities of the new tender. Extensive analysis of the brand, market of superyachting/tenders and defining the target group was performed to define the most opportune direction and attitude towards the technical and aesthetical approach. Main factors that influenced the choice of design direction were the dominance of the superyachts within the range between 50 and 80 meters that often need a multipurpose tender. This tender should be able to facilitate transportation during hospitality events and for leisure purposes such as day cruising and watersports. The same functionality package appeared to be missing on the market. Therefore the decision was made to pursue with this direction. In order to compose the design brief scenario mapping, based on the chosen design direction, was used. different user scenario’s were generated with the help of specialists from each field. Defining the user situations narrowed down the list of demands and provided accurate input for design. Despite clear focus, the design process had so many questions and challenges that they could hardly be addressed all at once. Muller’s “Fish-trap model” was used for the set-up of synthesis (Muller, 2002). Process included several ideation stages where choices were made to narrow down the design field. As the design brief defined a clear package of demands, first a “Structural concept” was created. It means that a global lay-out consisting of a certain amount of structural elements was defined by building a modular cardboard model and idea sketching to experiment and visualize the concepts. Multiple combinations were photographed and compared. Three main lay-out combinations appeared to cover the most combinations. These were weighed against each other to make the choice. Finally the lay-out to work with was placing an open roofed area above the engines in the back of the boat. The driver would be in the middle of the tender for the best overview and control and in front of the tender the toilette and main roofed guest area wold be arranged. After the lay-out was chosen, a new ideation phase addressed the partial problems and exterior. Choosing one concept was split into multiple stages due to the large scale of the project. After making the choices a Formal Concept was defined. In this concept the main guidelines for the lay-out, formgiving and dimensions received the most attention. Instead of the materialization of multiple concepts, the discission was made to choose one and apply two materialization rounds to it. At this stage ergonomics and definition of geometry were the main field of attention. Manufacturing, assembly, specification of materials, finishing, texture and colours were considered too. The material concept was worked out in 3D and presented to the company. Mi features of the tender were high freeboard, retractable roof and hinging transom. Modelling is the key to understand the design and detect pros and cons. To obtain the needed insights for the next materialization round and evaluate the concept, a 1:1 wooden mock-up was built. Ex,- and interior were simulated. Building the mock-up and seeing it grow provided important insights in the structure and flaws of the design. Afterwards an evaluation session with Xtenders was organized. During evaluating the tender some major changes were discussed. The lay-out had to be slightly changed b removing the toilette from the bow to the centre part of the tender. Further, multiple improvements of almost each part were revealed. Finally, the redesign was made using gathered feedback. A shorter yet in depth iteration for the structural and material conceptualizing was performed. The second materialization round delivered an impressive result. Not only the ergonomics improved, aesthetics and usability of the tender received attention too. The redesign is more dynamic and refined. Improvement by iteration in design has been acknowledged by all the stakeholders of this project.","superyacht; tender; xtenders; carbon; swot; boat; yachts; luxury; context; marine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Integral Product Design","","","",""

(mentor); Strijker, G. (mentor)","2012","Natural fracture systems are often influenced by the presence of different layers with contrasting rock mechanical properties. Understanding the distribution of stress between different mechanical layers is essential to the interpretation of fracture networks within these systems. Knowledge of the fracture system’s geometry and spatial distribution is crucial in understanding the planning and development of any fractured reservoir. In this study, stress/strain distributions and deformation patterns in a three layered medium with and without pre-existing fracture set are analysed. Starting from the most simple to a complex configuration, finite element models are used to understand these patterns. Stress distribution in the presence of fractures gives a better understanding of the type of failures that the rock can undergo. Stress and strain localizations at fracture tips are observed. The study indicates that tensile stresses will result in the fractured layer in response to remote compression alone given sufficient input parameters. In this case, tensile stress arises without the requirement for an additional body force such as internal fluid pressure. Frictional sliding (displacement) causes localization of deformation at the fracture tips. The displacement intensity varies as a function of fracture orientation (?) (?: angle between the fracture strike and the bulk compression orientation). This displacement along the fractures present in the middle layer of the model also impacts the stress distribution within the surrounding layers as well. Any change in the orientation of the remote stress may lead to significant differences in the stress magnitude within the three layers. Similar analyses have been done with increasing complexity and the impact of fracture length, spacing and overlap/underlap between the adjacent fractures are studied. It is observed that all these parameters not only impact the stress and strain distribution within the fractured layer but also have a significant or subtle impact on the surrounding layers. The study also aims to predict if these patterns are localized or if deformation between the fractures is also influenced by these parameters. The scenario with two fractures is therefore used to investigate the influence of one fracture on the other and it is observed that the stresses are compressive in nature and the magnitude is influenced by the fracture spacing and fracture overlap/underlap. The study gives a confirmation on why finite element modelling is one of the better tools to do such an analysis and more importantly that it gives a first-hand understanding of the impact on such a system under external stress.","finite element method; ansys; fracture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Section Applied Geology","",""

(mentor); Babuska, R. (mentor)","2012","The reinforcement learning (RL) framework enables to construct controllers that try to find find an optimal control strategy in an unknown environment by trial-and-error. After selecting a control action, the controller receives a numerical reward. The reward signal is based on the current state of the environment and the applied control action. The controller aims to maximize the cumulative reward, known as the return. In this thesis actor-critic and criticonly RL algorithms are considered. Actor-critic algorithms consist of an element that selects the actions (the actor) and an element that learns the expectation of the return (the critic). This expectation is captured in a value function. The critic is used to improve the control policy of the actor. Critic-only algorithms select the action by direct optimization over a value function. Before a RL algorithm can be applied to a control problem, a number of learning parameters need to be set. The optimal values of some of these parameters are highly problem dependent. It is not straightforward how these parameters should be chosen and often these are often determined by trying a large set of parameters. The main focus of thesis is to devise an action selection method that is able to select continuous actions without problem dependent parameters. Two approaches are taken: first, it is investigated if Levenberg Marquardt (LM), a popular optimization method, can be used to determine the actor update step. Second, an action selection method is treated that lacks an explicit actor, called Value-Gradient Based Policy (VGBP). The LM algorithm uses the gradient and the Hessian to compute the update step. Therefore the policy gradient and Hessian need to be found. A novel actor-critic method has been devised, called Vanilla Actor-Critic (VAC), that efficiently learns the policy gradient. On the inverted pendulum swing-up task this algorithm outperformed Natural Actor-Critic (NAC). A number of different approaches have been taken to approximate the policy Hessian, but none delivered a proper Hessian estimate. Therefore, no LM actor update method was created. In VGBP the action is found by optimization of the right hand side of the Bellman equation. VGBP uses the provided reward function and a process model for this optimization. The process model is learned online using local linear regression (LLR). Due to the efficient use of information VGBP shows fast learning on the pendulum and a 2-DOF robotic arm.","reinforcement learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-07-18","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems and Control","",""

(mentor)","2012","Video surveillance is found in different areas, such as public buildings, metro stations and miliary areas. These systems have become increasingly cost efficient, allowing for larger systems as well. Traditionally multiple security cameras are positioned throughout the area, and linked to monitor screens. These screens are monitored by security pesonnel. Unfortunately humans suffer from certain flaws when it comes to surveillance. For example, humans may lose focus when nothing happens for a long period of time. Though computers may no be as good at computer vision and reasoning as human operators, they provide different advantages. For instance, computers are capable of working 24 hours a day, 7 hours a week. By using an automated intelligent multi-camera video surveillance system the security personnel could be supported in their work, allowing for less security flaws in monitoring the area. For this Bachelor project the project group has developed such an automated intelligent multi-camera video surveillance system. In particular, the system was developed for monitoring the 'Netherlands Defence Academy' (NLDA) area of the 'Koninklijk Instituut voor de Marine' (KIM). In order to develop the system, a scientific approach was used in combination with an incremental, agile development technique called Scrum. Weekly meetings were held with the goup, the supervisors and the domain experts. The system consists of two applications: a Client written in C++ with OpenCV and a Server application written in Java. The Client application is attached to a security camera, and will then detect moving objects, classify them as either human or non-human, and determine their location relative to the camera. For each detected object it will then transmit this information to the Server application. This Server application gathers the information from the Clients and combines the information into actual objects in the monitored area. It then reasons about these objects by using their history of GPS locations to detect whether suspicious situations are occurring. Examples of such situations are when a person enters a restricted area, when a person suddenly starts running or when a person has been following another person or a period of time. In case of a suspicious situation the security personnel is alarmed, and relevant information is displayed to allow the personnel to take action if required. Ensuring code quality, maintainability and extendability of the system was an important aspect of the project. Using a diverse set of tools we ensured that these properties of the system were maintained throughout the project. It is simple to change image processing modules in the Client, or add new reasoning rules to the Server. This resulted in a much appreciated 5 star rating from the Software Improvement Group. Another important aspect of the system was testing. Using Google Test for C++ and JUnit for Java the parts of the code with simple in- and output behavior were automatically tested. The more complex code parts were tested manually using recorded video, or simulation files generated with a specially developed application. A working beta implementation of the complete system has been delivered as a proof of concept and all initially set requirements were fulfilled.","video surveillance; multi camera; bachelor project","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Technische Informatica","",""

(mentor)","2012","The goal of the new brand ‘Vleesch noch Visch’ is to reduce meat and fish consumption in the Netherlands. Reasons for this are the high consumption of meat, the unhealthy influences of meat on the consumer’s personal health, and the high environmental impact of the bio industry. The target group for this new brand are those who want to eat more environmental friendly and nutritious meals, but lack the knowledge of how this could be put into practice. Where eating more vegetarian meals provides the solution for the mentioned problems, three thresholds (taste, convenience, and education) prevent consumers from eating these vegetarian meals. The ‘Vleesch noch Visch’ products will reduce all three thresholds in a positive manner to support consumers during the process of creating vegetarian meals. This does also lead to a new perception of a vegetarian meal. By starting with the current diet, a composition of meat, potatoes, and vegetables, the new created vegetarian meal exists of three similar elements; sauce, vegetables, and carbohydrates. Here, the ‘Vleesch noch Visch’ product line focuses on the sauce, which will be made based on personal flavours and desires. To create this sauce, spice mixes, each representing one cultural kitchen, will be combined with a protein-rich basic sauce. By selling the spices and basic sauces separately, the interaction of making combinations is stimulated. Here, each basic sauce is combinable with at least two spice mixes. The amount of five spice mixes and five protein-rich basic sauces, results in thirteen delicious combinations. In order to understand the possible combinations, each ‘Vleesch noch Visch’ product has a combination key, which visually communicates the possible combinations. When these keys match, a delicious combination is guaranteed. The created sauce guarantees a delicious and nutritious ingredient for a dish. To complete the meal, the combination of the ‘Vleesch noch Visch’ products has to be combined with vegetables and carbohydrates. However, since these products are not part of the product line, the complete meals are promoted via meal tips and online recipes. These meal tips are stickers pasted on the lids of each ‘Vleesch noch Visch’ product. Each sticker communicates the possible ingredients for a meal. Since there is no universal sticker, each packaging could promote another meal. During the cooking process, the online recipes help guiding the consumer systematically. An additional feature of the online recipe database is a suggestions generator. This tool will let a consumer explore which combination of ingredients lead to a delicious meal. Here, the consumer himself will search for the ingredients of his meal and think of which cooking techniques to apply. Next to that, individual stickers in the vegetables department will also promote ‘Vleesch noch Visch’. These are similar sticker as the meal tips, however this sticker only communicates with which spice mix or basic sauce that individual vegetable could be combined. Again, this provides the opportunities of promoting multiple combinations on the same kind of vegetable. For example, a tomato is both delicious with a Mexican as well as Italian spice mix, which does not mention the possible combinations with the basic sauces yet. While focussing again on the thresholds, the taste and convenience thresholds are clearly applied in the product line. The educating element is more unconsciously present. The generated theory of the new vegetarian meal comes back in the division of the product line. However, this is just a superficial element of the theory, the detailed written information is provided online.

(mentor)","2012","This project was executed for ING Bank, division Retail Banking Benelux, Sub-division ‘Mortgages and Leads’. Based on consequences resulting from the financial crisis there are several new regulations that will be implemented in 2013. One of these regulations is the Provision ban on mortgage advice. This change will affect customers in their decision process when looking for mortgages. Therefore the objective of this project was to put the customer first and ease his and her mortgage orientation process in order to improve the customer’s quality perception of ING. To achieve this the focus was put on identifying how online review and rating sites currently influence customer quality perception and how these online sites can be designed in the future as new interactive service tools that in turn influence, build brand trust and recognition and put the customer quality experience first. The guiding question was: how can online review sites be used as service tools to help improve the customer journey and experience which in turn will improve the customer quality perception of ING’s mortgage advice. This question was addressed through an extensive literature review into extant articles that cover service touchpoints, customer decision journey and online review sites. Next to that a customer research shed light onto which points of the customer journey are of high impact to the decision process. The results from these inform the research question. The main findings showed that service touchpoints and support throughout the decision process have a crucial effect on the customer experience process of acquiring a mortgage. The customer will come in contact with physical and online service touchpoints that let customers infer a quality perception of the service provided and the service provider. These touchpoints should help guide a customer’s decision process through alleviating uncertainty. It was found that this was not the case with touchpoints throughout the mortgage acquisition process. Review and rating sites were found to be useful in guiding difficult decision points and help customers orient and evaluate. The best practice guidelines for such review sites advice to separate reviews into two categories that address the ‘financial mortgage product’ and the ‘mortgage service’ provided in form of call, mortgage advise, branches and websites. Customer research especially showed that there are eight main factors that influence customer decision making and perception: trustworthiness-, expertise-, independence-, intentions-, and transparency of the service provider as well as the advising party, support in the decision making process and ease of process, and finally expectations – customers want their needs to be understood and taken to heart. The objective was reached through deducing findings from literature review and customer research into strategic recommendations. The overall strategic recommendation for ING is to develop a review website with emphasis on providing the customer with expert knowledge and advice. This recommendation entails two pivotal steps. First creating an all bank review and expert site that responds to the immediate customer need of overview on financial mortgage products and mortgage services once the commission ban is implemented in 2013. Second, before step one can be implemented ING should also focus on developing a review and expert service on the ING.nl site with focus on improving the customer journey and making it more accessible through direct online customer interaction with mortgage experts and customer reviews. This service in the future can be developed to include track-and-trace mortgage process possibilities and direct online video call communication with mortgage advisors. The vision here is that the ING.nl site will develop towards providing online service for customers and guiding them through their service journey with support and guidance of mortgage expert advice.","financial services; customer journey; touchpoints","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-07-18","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2012","Nowadays almost everything is digital. Even testing new products can be done by simulating them digitally, also called virtual prototyping. This report describes research that is done to improve virtual prototyping at Philips Research. Two experiments have been performed with the aim to evaluate how image quality and realism are affected by the integrator, i.e. the method used to calculate the light at each point in the scene, and the time spent on the rendering process. The first experiment was conducted to evaluate whether a different integrator than an implementation of a standard path tracer might result in more realistic renderings. Mitsuba was used as render software and support integrators both based on path tracing and photon mapping. Two images of the same scene were simultaneously shown to 20 participants separately. The participants had to indicate which of the two they considered most realistic. They had to do this for different lighting conditions and with and without a reference to the real scene. The results showed that people preferred a photon based integrator over the path based integrators. The second experiment focused more on how material characteristics influence the rendering time. Renderings of a teapot with different materials and under different lighting conditions were created with Mitsuba and Indigo software. Participants had to compare a rendering to a reference rendering, which was part of a standard quality ruler, based on one type of material and light condition. As a consequence, they had to compare quality across different materials and lighting conditions. The results were widely spread across the 20 participants, mainly because comparing quality of different materials was a difficult task. The task became even more complicated because of the different kinds of noise generated by the different integrators. To overcome the issue found in the second experiment, a follow-up study was conducted. In this follow-up study the participants not only saw a stimulus and a ruler rendering but also the perfect versions of those two. The task was now to identify if the stimulus or the ruler rendering had the smallest difference with their perfect version. The results for the 4 participants that performed this follow-up study were less spread than those of the second experiment. Therefore the interface used in the follow-up study is considered to be useful for future experiments where comparisons across different materials are needed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Interactive Intelligence Group","","Master Computer Science / Media and Knowledge Engineering track","",""

In this project work, an off-the-shelf recycled automotive alternator is experimentally parameterized and modeled with an assumed small wind turbine. The wind turbine’s characteristics have been designed to match the power requirements of the alternator. The dynamic response of the alternator to wind speed variations is modeled and the effect of turbine blades’ inertia on the generator speed and by extension on the wind turbine’s performance coefficient indicates the need for a speed control mechanism to attain turbine optimal power operation.

Reliable prediction of injectivity through experiments and modeling is very essential under such circumstances. A model for predicting the injectivity during internal filtration taking into account particle dispersion, retention kinetics, nonlinear filtration, permeability reduction and viscosity functions was proposed. Subsequently, the analytical model for external filtration was coupled with the numerical model for internal filtration using the concept of transition time to predict the overall decline in injectivity. Core flood experiments using hematite suspensions for various particle concentrations (1-5 ppm) were conducted in Bentheim sandstone cores to quantify the injectivity. Simultaneously, X-ray CT scanning was performed under dynamic conditions to obtain deposition profiles along the core at different times. From microscopic analyses and visual observations, it was found that surface deposition in the porous medium and face plugging at the inlet of the core were responsible for decline in injectivity. A good agreement was obtained between the modeled and experimental results showing the validity of the retention function. Further, the effect of various parameters (particle concentration, number of grids etc.) on injectivity was investigated.

Polymer flooding is a mature technology and still is the most important EOR method based on full field case histories. Accurate assessment of injectibility of viscous polymer solutions into these reservoirs without induced fractures is a major challenge. Therefore, the objective of this study is to experimentally investigate and model the polymer injectivity in porous media using unfiltered partially hydrolysed polyacrylamide (HPAM) solutions for wide range of polymer concentrations (125?5000 ppm) and salinities (5?20 g/L) in high permeability sandstones. Data from rheological measurements and single phase linear core flood studies carried out as a part of this study were utilised for understanding the key microscopic (pore level) mechanisms and for quantifying the injectivity. Based on the experimental analyses, it was found that viscous nature of polymer solutions and their retention in porous media were the main mechanisms for loss in injectivity. Data obtained from the experiments were used to validate and fine tune the model. Subsequently, with the help of the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, filtration theory, permeability reduction model, Non?Newtonian viscosity and Darcy laws numerical modelling was performed for predicting the injectivity losses during polymer injection. A good quality match was obtained with experimental data. Finally, sensitivity of various parameters (polymer concentration, salinity etc.) on injectivity was studied. Further, the results from this study, will serve as an auxiliary input for field scale simulations, will help operators in the selection, design and execution of the field projects and will stand as guidelines for extending the polymer flooding technology for heavy oil reservoirs.","polymers; porous media; injectivity; adsorption; polymer filtration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Bruining, H. (mentor)","2012","Alkaline Surfactant Polymer (ASP) flooding is a chemical EOR technique that takes advantage of both interfacial tension reduction and mobility control. Core flooding tests show almost 100% recovery when the experiment is carried out under optimal conditions, i.e., a middle phase micro-emulsion characterized by extremely low interfacial tension is formed when a phase behavior test is done. In the field, reservoir heterogeneity causes mixing, which takes the system away from its optimal condition. Another major drawback of the ASP floods is the high cost of the associated chemicals. In some cases the logistics can also be a major challenge. Therefore this thesis considers the application of ASP at non optimal conditions. We study this application by performing series of core flood experiments. For a given surfactant concentration we determined the optimal condition by varying the alkali concentration, which turns out to be 1.75 w/w% of Sodium Carbonate (Na2CO3). Subsequently we performed vertical flow experiments using alkaline weight percentages from 1.0 % to 2.25 % with increments of 0.25% around the optimum. Initially we used a 38.3 cm core, which gave an unexpected low recovery of 68% to residual oil, after injection of two pore volume (PV). Injection of over-optimum solutions resulted in even worse recoveries, while injection of under-optimum solutions led to higher recoveries at chemical break-through for 1.5 w/w% and 1.25 w/w% before it dropped again for 1.0 w/w%. To understand this behavior we repeated the experiment with shorter cores (30 cm and 17 cm) at optimum conditions, which gave a recovery of more than 90% (95% of the oil initially in place (OIIP)), which value is often encountered in literature. We propose that instabilities may be the cause of the low recoveries after a stability analysis shows that the system apparent viscosity is higher than the viscosity of the displacing ASP solution.","ASP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kolstein, M.H. (mentor); De Boer, A. (mentor); Hendriks, M.A.N. (mentor)","2012","Considering the recent increase in the use of fiber reinforced polymers in the civil engineering industry in general and in the bridge engineering industry in particular, as well as the recently more and more applied cylindrical truss bridge type, this research focuses on the question whether it is possible to combine fiber reinforced polymers as stand-alone structural material and this bridge type to construct a bridge suitable for heavy traffic as well as bicycle and pedestrian traffic. This research combines an extensive literature study on the use of fiber reinforced polymers for bridge engineering with a theoretical feasibility- and design-study on fiber reinforced polymer cylindrical truss bridges for heavy traffic. During the design study the spatial needs of all bridge users were defined to obtain an initial shape of the bridge. This shape was then optimized in several steps using finite-element-modeling and -analysis, yielding a final shape of the bridge. The behavior of this structure under design loads was then extensively investigated, again using finite element analysis, showing that the bridge could very well meet the self-derived deflection limit for fiber reinforced polymers at relatively low stress levels. Since fiber reinforced materials are a very diverse field of material, with hundreds of different compositions being available, the first result of this study was the choice of a suitable composite for further analysis. For this bridge design very high fiber content (>60%) carbon/epoxy composite was used. The main reason for this choice was the high modulus and -strength of the carbon fibers and the high durability and strength of the epoxy resin. A major reason of the slow implementation of fiber reinforced polymers in the bridge engineering industry are the worries concerning the lack of fire safety of the material. The literature study of this research showed however that it is possible to construct a heavy traffic full-FRP truss bridge, while complying with the known fire safety standards. The virgin FRP material can be adapted by several fire-protection measures; it turned out that a combination of intumescent gel-coating and low volume phosphorous filler systems works best in increasing the fire resistance and thereby providing a fire resistance class of R30 for hydrocarbon fire curve loading. The initial shape of the bridge was optimized in three stages: first several different truss topologies, which were derived with a parametric geometric model, were analyzed and compared using finite element analysis software, yielding the square truss with one diagonal as most efficient topology. In the next steps several grid sizes of this truss as well as several cross section dimensions were compared, again using finite element analysis software. An optimum was found between minimum material usage and minimum deflection, which reduced the material usage of the main load bearing elliptical truss by about 40% compared to the initial variant. The optimized structure was then fitted with the inner bridge deck supporting trusses as well as the cantilever trusses. The elliptical truss bridge performed very well considering the maximum deflections and stresses under Eurocode design loads and load combinations that were derived in finite element modeling software. When comparing the full-FRP bridge design with similar, existing steel structures, the maximum deformations and –stresses were considerably lower for the full-FRP bridge while only weighing about 60% of the steel structure. This research showed that the ‘new’ cylindrical truss bridge type is not only an aesthetically appealing structure but also performs structurally very well when combined with fiber reinforced polymer as structural material. It turned out that fiber reinforced polymers can be used as stand-alone structural material for medium span heavy traffic bridges. Next to that, this research clarified that there is no legitimate structural reason for the fact that fiber reinforced polymers are used relatively scarcely in the civil engineering- and bridge engineering industry compared to traditional building materials such as steel and concrete. Since this research is one of the first researches of its kind, using FRP as stand-alone structural material for a relatively new and complex bridge type, more research is needed in the field of high order connections for fiber reinforced polymer circular hollow sections. Next to that the possibility of the use of differently sized and shaped cross sections for the truss members should be investigated.","fiber reinforced polymers; plastics; FRP; civil engineering; bridge engineering; structural engineering; structural design; bridge design; stiffness driven design; cylindrical truss; elliptical truss; tubular truss; spatial truss; truss topology optimization; grid size optimization; space efficiency; heavy traffic road bridge; truss topology; mechanical properties of FRP materials; fire safety; fire resistance; steel viaduct comparison; FEA; FEM; finite element modeling; finite element analysis; CFRP; carbon; epoxy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-24","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); Metrikine, A. (mentor); Cammaert, R. (mentor); Bereznitski, A. (mentor)","2012","In light of the recent increasing interest in the oil and gas developments in the arctic region, Huisman Equipment B.V. started development of a drilling semi-submersible suited for arctic condition. Model tests were performed by the Krylov Shipbuilding Research Institute to gain insight in the ice forces acting on the structure. Based upon the data gathered during these model tests a mooring system was designed using an ice loading model that was based on the means of the loads measured and assumed an ice-load independent of vessel motions. For a more accurate design of the mooring system and a better understanding of the dynamics, a dynamic model of the ice-loading and moored vessel motions is/was needed. This thesis elaborates on a model that can model the dynamic interaction between the vessel motions and the ice-loads. Based upon this model, the mooring system is optimized for the highest possible ice conditions. During the model tests the model of the JBF Arctic was retained in a fixed position while being towed through the ice. The main interest was in the interaction with level ice at operational draft. Three parameters were varied during these tests: the ice thickness, the ice velocity and the trim angle of the vessel. To model the ice loads, the first step was to create a model for the mean part of the ice loading. A very simple ice model for the mean of the horizontal force had already been made by the Krylov Shipbuilding Research Institute. This ice model only depends on the ice thickness and the ice velocity and is only valid within a certain range. As part of this thesis the model was expanded so that it would be valid for the entire range of parameters which are required during the time domain simulations. Next the transition between bending and crushing was found to be dependent on the trim angle of the vessel. The mean loads in all other five DOF’s were added based on correlations with the horizontal force or as separate entities. Several other ice phenomenon were also added to the model, such as the initial transient interaction between the approaching ice sheet and the vessel and a crude implementation of the interaction with ridges. The second step to model the ice loads, was to add the fluctuating components of the ice loading. An extensive study was done to analyze the frequency characteristics of the data gathered. The frequency characteristics of the analyzed spectrums were random, and no correlation could be found with the variables that were varied during the tests. A flat or white noise spectrum with the correct energy density was used to model the dynamic part of the ice forces. The moored vessel motions itself were modeled with AQWA DRIFT. The AQWA model was coupled with MATLAB to incorporate the mean and dynamic ice forces. Eventually a model was delivered that can be used to model the dynamics of a moored vessel in ice. This model was also used to do a comprehensive study to find the optimal mooring configuration (material type, grade and, the anchor radius, the number of lines and their layout etc.) for the JBF arctic. The final mooring system can handle 3.1m thick ice moving at 0.5 m/s or 2.4m thick ice moving 1.5 m/s.","ice model test; dynamic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore Engineering","",""

(mentor); Tassoul, M. (mentor)","2012","Albert Heijn is the largest chain of supermarkets in the Netherlands. Since a few years they also have a non-food department that focuses on offering non-food products to the customer, next to their large assortment of food products. The assignment is to help this department to design more surprising and innovative non-food products. While “innovative” as an adjective is used here to characterize the result of a process, innovation can best be described as an organizational process to implement new ideas. As is discussed in the introduction, ideas that are not implemented do not have an impact on the company or its environment, therefore cannot be characterized as “innovative”. Innovation as a process can be characterized by stages and gates as described by Cooper. The first stage in this process is an insightful moment that is based on new findings in the environment of the company. Companies actively search for this “lightbulb” moment by watching trends, doing (user) research, developing new technologies etc. The translation of these new insights to idea inputs for the innovation process is often described as a creative and “magic” moment, or isn’t described at all. So, while a constant stream of ideas to this funnel is very important, companies haven’t fully grasped this stage yet. Albert Heijn is no exception to this. More clarity could be given to this “fuzzy” stage by linking the new insights from the discovery stage to an ideation tool. User-centered design is one way to achieve this at Albert Heijn. User insights can be a good starting point for innovation by inspiring the design team and enhancing empathy for the end user. The question of the company was analyzed and divided into three partitions. The solution proposed in this graduation assignment focuses on two of the three partitions: 1) Communicating user data in a way that it inspires and enhances empathy & 2) utilizing that data in ideation. The third point is about organizational change and creating a culture of innovation in the company. A change in the organization will be required to give employees the time and space to use the proposed concept. However, this would make the assignment way too elaborate for a graduation assignment, so there was little emphasis on the third sub-problem. After an extensive internal analysis of the company, a framework to communicate user data to design teams is developed. It discusses the implications for the content, form and inherent qualities of data to facilitate empathy and the provide inspiration. It is based on literature research, interviews and questionnaires with experts (from academic field and practice). The framework is then combined with theory about creativity techniques to cover both the communication and utilization stages of user data to enhance innovation at Albert Heijn. A morphological chart is used to combine several ideas of each stage in one working prototype. In a series of iterations the prototype is used, treating real problems of the company. In a multidisciplinary setting the tool is thereby tested, improved and implemented in the organization at the same time. The iterations and evolution of the tool can be seen in the figures above. The solution is a combination of a redesign of the company’s intranet and a simple tool for ideation. The two parts are inseparable and complement each other. Together they fulfil all stages to enhance empathy, get inspired and translate these new insights into concrete ideas. A platform will be added to the intranet, where Albert Heijn employees can plan, register for and browse through internal presentations. This way sharing knowledge throughout the company is made easily accessible. The final tool and its manual can be accessed through the same portal. This concept is a first step in creating a more innovative culture at a large and traditional organization.","design; retail; innovation; user-centered design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Communication & Conceptualization","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Celemens, F. (mentor); Langeveld, J. (mentor); Talsma, L. (mentor)","2012","Sanitation, as described by the World Health Organization (WHO), refers to the provisions of facilities and services for safe disposal of human urine and faeces. On the outset of the 21st century, 40% of the world’s inhabitants do not have access to sanitation facilities and still rely on a bucket, a bush or a backstreet for excretion. Technically, all options that are required to deal with the global sanitation problem seem to have been already developed. However, the challenge remains in selection and implementation of technologies in a way that the desirable outcomes would be resulted. Some decision-making support tools have been developed so far to address this problem by assisting the decision-makers in selecting the appropriate technologies. While decision-making is about considering the likelihood of uncertain events, in most of the existing evaluation approaches the complex task of predicting and evaluating probabilities is reduced to simple judgmental operations. Forinstance, evaluation of sanitation options is often performed based on predicting the outcomes that best represent a sanitation system, with no or little regard to the factors that limit the predictive accuracy. This thesis adopts a new evaluation approach by taking into account the real world examples from executed sanitation facilities and develops a probabilistic evaluation framework in which sanitation options are assessed based on the probabilities that specific outcomes occur in practice. Absolute judgments are replaced by probable assessments, as this approach tries to keep its distance from making the uncertain certain. Although there may be a hidden consensus that quantification of occurrence probabilities for various outcomes of sanitation options is not always possible, some quantification methods are developed and presented in this thesis for all the assessment criteria. Moreover, this thesis does not only focus on making the decisions, but also tries to channel the decisions in a way that the negative outcomes of sanitation facilities would be reduced through the measures that could be taken to improve the performance of sanitation options. By applying the probabilistic evaluation approach for decision-making about sanitation facilities in low-income unplanned slum settlement of Nyalenda in Kisumu, Kenya (based on limited available data about this region in literature) it is indicated that while a sanitation option may be known for fulfilling a certain task by definition, through a probabilistic evaluation it may be revealed that the local conditions are not likely to allow the expected outcome to occur in practice and as a result this option would have no priority among other options. The necessity for monitoring and post-evaluation of implemented sanitation projects in order to have sufficient feedback for improvement of future decisions is also highlighted.","sanitation; decision-making; probabilistic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","A new extreme ultra violet light source is designed for ASML for the next generation of their machines. The company Settels Savenije van Amelsvoort has been asked to design the mechanical part of this mechatronic system. The challenge with this mechanical design, is that the components in this design are very heavy and have relatively high position stability requirements. In the current design is everything mounted with high stiffness relative to each other. However, due to the large masses of the subsystems, it is a challenge to achieve the desired high eigenfrequencies. The objective of this research is to develop methods to design heavy systems with high performance requirements. In this specific case, the heavy subsystems require impossible high stiffnesses to reach the needed natural frequencies (100-200Hz). One of the two main methods discussed in this report is a method to reduce the mass which must be dynamically stable. A possible solution is to make the sensors less sensitive for positioning errors by adding reference points. The best solution is to make an optical reference point which is much lighter than a camera and its housing. The reference is now responsible for the accuracy of the measurement. The vibrations of the camera have almost no influence on the measurement any more. The other method is to rearrange the stiffnesses between the masses. By cleverly choosing and rearranging the stiffnesses between the masses, the performance is also optimized. With this method, lower stiffnesses are needed to achieve the same dynamical positioning stability. Or when comparable stiffnesses are used, at least a factor two improvement of the dynamical error-reduction can be made. It can be concluded that the overall performance can be increased relative to the current design. The research is done for a general case where the EUV-light source is used as a guideline. Because these methods are analyzed for any type of system, it can also be used for another high precision system with comparable performance challenges.","dynamica","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-08-03","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

Key elements that can determine the security and reliability in transmitting power are the grids topological structures as well as their physical and operational behaviors and states. The capacity of a network to cope with disturbance imposed on it defines its degree of robustness. In assessing power grids reliability, their robustness and vulnerability against failures (both random failures and intentional attacks) must be taken into account. The secure delivery of power as well as the ability to protect and react to power outage and failures must be done in a distributed environment. Improving the robustness of the grids in distributed environment with no centralized control and management is a challenge. This work propose an effective theoretical method based on complex network approaches for improving robustness of power transmission networks dynamically by reducing their vulnerability in a decentralized and distributed environment.

(mentor); Van Dijk, W. (mentor); Wisse, G. (mentor)","2012","This thesis presents research done on XPED, a passive walk assisting exoskeleton. It uses exotendons to assist the user, which are elastic elements running over multiple joints which are able to store and redistribute energy over these joints. A computer model predicts that joint powers of the user would decrease when walking with XPED, compared to walking without XPED. Because of these predictions a lower energy consumption for walking with XPED was expected. Previous research shows however that this is not the case, but that the energy consumption of the user increases when walking with XPED. The goal of this research was to find the reasons why XPED does not help the user decrease his energy consumption when walking. Possible mismatches between reality and model were identified and tested on occurrence. Three hypotheses were formulated: A. The user alters his gait pattern B. XPED's hip harness deforms C. XPED moves relative to the user These effects do not occur in the model but they were thought to occur in reality. They all have the potential to decrease the amount of energy storage in the exotendons and thereby decrease the energy efficiency of XPED. Using motion capture measurements on three subjects, the kinematics of XPED as well as those of the human were measured. From these measurements, all three hypotheses were accepted. A: The human alters his gait pattern due to the exotendons by walking on his toes more, thereby relaxing the exotendons. Changes in back orientation were also found. Two of three subjects bend over more, thereby relaxing the exotendons and one subject walked more upright, thereby stressing the exotendons more. The energy stored in the exotendon decreased due to these gait alterations ranging from 9.5 to 32.6 Joule. B: The original hip harness of XPED was found to deform significantly due to the exotendon forces but the stiffening elements added to the hip harness brought down the energy loss from 6.7 Joule for XPED 2.1 to 2.3 Joule or lower for XPED 2.2. C: It was also found that XPED moves relative to the user. The effect of these movements on the stored exotendon forces can range from 0 to 6.7 Joule for XPED 2.2, depending on how the user adapts to less relative movement.","Exoskeleton","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-07-12","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

An extended contextmapping study was done on how the inhabitants react to learning on their flooding risks as well as how their environment and the water. From this, 6 different ways of looking at the Maas were derived. A connection was made between these perspective, between the reaction on flooding risk and the different groups of inhabitants. Inspiration was gained from the positive views on the Maas and flooding risks. The design aspires to evoke this attitude among the inhabitants. This resulted in 'Emergence'. Emergence consist of 25 poles in frames, hanging over the water. When the water rises through the changing tides, the poles will start floating. When this happens, the design changes from tiles flat in the ground, to poles rising from the surface. Because the poles are floating on the water, sitting or standing on them will give a bouncing sensation. Furthermore: when boats sail by they will bounce on the waves. Emergence communicates the presence of the Maas, its changeability and its uncontrollable influence on our landscape. Furthermore, the bottom of the poles are colored red: indicating high or unusually high water levels. This way attention is drawn to the condition of the waterlevel, creating a natural sense of the frequency and severity of (unusually) high water levels occurring.","water play rotterdam floodings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Thissen, W.A.H. (mentor); Geertje, B. (mentor); Deenen, R. (mentor)","2012","An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is a comprehensive set of integrated software solutions. It is used for example to allow companies to improve their performance by streamlining business processes and to manage the companies’ resources. An ERP system incorporates a central database that supports the various functions of a company by drawing and feeding data to the applications used within the different departments so that the information is integrated throughout the business. ERP implementations are costly and the reason for why companies are willing to spend considerable money on such an endeavor is because they have been associated with benefits that make it worth it. The problem is that the benefits that justify the cost of implementing such a system are often not realized to their potential. That might render the cost associated with the implementation to outweigh the benefits and not the other way around as it should have been. In order to get the most out of the implementation, so at least the benefits outweigh the cost, it is crucial to carry out the implementation process successfully. That means by overcoming the challenges that are manifested not only in the complicated technical rollout and installing of the system but also in the reconfiguration of the organization in terms of its business processes and its structure so that the system fits with the organization. Furthermore, as this leads an organizational change as well as an adoption of a new information system which impose great changes on employees, there is also the challenge to facilitate the transition in order to mitigate the effects of resistance to change. Most companies rely on external consultants to transfer their accumulated knowledge of ERP implementations to their employees to facilitate in-house contribution to successful implementations. This study is carried out for the company Accenture that commonly takes on the role for providing such consultancy. It is carried out in order to develop a product that can assist with getting the knowledge transfer across not only in sessions with clients of Accenture but also for in-house education. Driven by above mentioned motive this study sets out to develop an interactive model that can be used in a gaming session that simulates the process of implementing an ERP system. This model provides a formal system that captures the essence of the systematic challenge of the natural system of ERP implementations in terms of realizing the associated benefits. Here interactive means that it is allowed for multiple inputs (levers) which can be tweaked by users so that they can interact with the formal system in a way that mimics how the natural system is interacted with in reality. Through the interaction with the model the users should experience the systematic challenge of carrying out the implementation process, which brings up one of the purposes of the model. The other purpose is to provide a medium for discussion, as the model is interacted with by several persons (at once) in a group session. The aim of such discussions is to facilitate a common understanding (e.g. between consultants and clients or people from different departments) on the overall process. The interactive model was formulated and supplied with an interface aimed for usability in terms of allowing for game-like experience of going through a simulated process of an ERP implementation. This forms the product of this study which can be summarized as a prototype of a management flight simulator on the process of implementing an ERP system. The model is based on the methodology of system dynamics and the study looks also towards the field of serious gaming as the product is intended for gaming purposes. In order to realize this product so that it meets the purposes stated above the following research questions were stated and answered as follows: 1. When looking at ERP implementations in general, what is the systematic challenge that commonly needs to be overcome so the benefits of the implementation can be realized? 2. What is the best way to represent the process of ERP implementations, what are the foreseen challenges for transforming that representation to a simulation model and what are the implications of the approach taken (for this case and in general)? 3. What is the potential of the product of this study to deliver its purpose? The decision for implementing an ERP system should not be based purely on the benefits that have been generally associated with the technology but on a strategy that identifies if they apply to the organization. A benefit hierarchy was formulated in this study that traces not just what the benefits of ERP implementations are but what constitutes them. The implementation should be justified based on how the specific constituting elements of the benefits fit to solve identified problems or lead to identified opportunities. If this is clear then the systematic challenge remains to carry out the implementation by balancing the resources available for the project between four aspects that commonly need to be aligned in order for the ERP implementations to be successful. These are the aspects of technology, business processes, organizational structure and people. The level of detail for representing the activities of these four common aspects needed to be quite high in order for the challenge to be captured, of balancing resources between the aspects (and the activities within them) while making sure that the aspects are aligned. A design choice was therefore made to represent the activities in terms of what drives them which is reasonably the resource allocation to the activities. All phases of an implementation, from analysis until after the go live, were decided to be included in the simulation. From this and the level of detail for activities a modeling challenge was foreseen due to the great many activities to be included dynamically. Conceptual maps of how the activities relate to each other in terms of dependencies were first constructed in order to model the process of the activities that should be carried out in terms of their effects and dependencies. These conceptual maps were then validated with expert interviews and what remained was to transform them to a simulation model. To make this transformation feasible an approach was taken to use molecules of structures to represent the activities in general. What is meant with that is that the activities are represented by general structures that can be used repeatedly to incorporate all activities in the simulation so that they are represented dynamically. Only two types of molecule structures were needed to allow for each activity to be captured. The dynamic feedback governed behavior of the model of this study is mostly based on the model’s base structure. This base structure is the result of improving upon a pre-existing model of which the model of this study builds upon. The inputs for how this behavior will result are the outputs of the streams of activities that make up the implementation process. These streams of activities were formed by stringing together the molecules that represent the individual activities. The individual molecules are governed by a limiting feedback loop and their behavior is therefore logically characterized by an asymptotic growth of completing an activity. The behavior of entire streams of activities is therefore a combination of the activities being performed where output of activities influence the effectiveness of attaining the completeness of the asymptotic growth of other activities until it has an effect on the base structure. The management flight simulator (the product of this study) allows users to play integral part in the simulation of the ERP implementation process that the model provides for. The users travel through the streams of activities mentioned above by making sure that individual activities are performed by allocating resources to them. It is completely up to the users how they move through the process in terms of when, how much and for how long they allocate resources to the individual activities. Logically, though, the path of direction is from the analysis phase to the deploy phase by moving through the phases of design, build and test. For each of these phases the users allocate resources to the aspects and then further divide that allocation to the individual activities within them. They should try to carry out the implementation by staying within the given planned budget and to make sure that the system can be set to go live on time. If necessary the users can delay the go live point. Since the molecule structures are general they can be used in any other situation where the focus is on the rate performing the activity as driven by some input rather than how the activity is performed; where this input, such as resource allocation, is the main force driving the activity’s rate of completeness or increase in output quality. The use of the molecules is especially relevant if an activity dense process is to be modeled and simulated interactively. What would then set apart the models for the different type of projects would be the interconnections between the activities, the relative difference of the effort needed for them and there would always be some structure of which is influenced by the activities but a separate structure in itself. The evaluation of the product conducted in this thesis provides promising indications for the usability of the product in terms of fulfilling its two purposes mentioned above. Yet this is only an indication, a sneak preview, for the potential usability and usefulness. That is why this is merely a preliminary evaluation and that a more thorough face evaluation and tests for usability are needed. The criteria that the promising indication of the preliminary evaluation is based on is that the questions about the potential for the product to deliver its intended purpose received positive and affirmative answers in two feedback sessions conducted. The preliminary evaluation of the product conducted in this thesis only gives indication that the potential usability is good. What is lacking in this thesis, due to time restrictions, is that the product still needs to be tested directly for its usability. To say if the product actually delivers its purpose would require a testing of it in sessions with people, who are potential users and would play through the simulation.","ERP system implementations; system dynamics; management flight simulator; gaming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-07-12","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

In this thesis, the substation reliability with respect to protection failures is evaluated using the event tree method. The basic protection principles for substations are explained first. Then, the event tree analysis is also introduced. Two case studies will be analyzed in this thesis. The effects of different substation configurations on the reliability is analyzed and compared. Then, the reliability of a real substation, Maasvlakte 380kV substation in the Netherlands, will be evaluated using event tree methods. The failure results will be combined with a load flow scenario of Maasvlakte substation in 2020, and indices such as the average lost load, and maximum lost load will be given.","reliability; substation; protection failures; load flow combination; Maasvlakte 380kV Substation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-04","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","Electrical Power System","",""

(mentor)","2012","The numerical flow model Delft3D simulates the flow of water and movement of submerged sediment by means of solving simplified equations that describe these processes. Because of these simplifications, parameterizations are introduced. These parameters represent amongst others the processes that take place on scales smaller than the spacing of the numerical grid. Furthermore, parameters exist that represent measurable attributes of the system, such as the grain diameter. Lastly, scaling parameters are found in the model, with which the relative importance of certain processes in the model can be indicated. All these parameters have to be calibrated using measured data; a model application has to be tuned to produce the best fit with a set of measurements. Although calibration is an essential part in the development of any numerical flow model, no automated or standardized calibration approaches exist within Deltares. As many parameters are available within Delft3D, calibration can be a complex, time consuming process. Automated calibration is objective and can save time, whilst in the process improving the model performance; i.e. minimizing the error between the model results and the measurements. Objective of this Thesis therefore was to develop an efficient method to improve performance of and insights in the Delft3D model throughout complex morphodynamic applications. A careful reading showed that a generic open source platform for calibration of hydrodynamic Delft3D model applications already existed in the form of the software package OpenDA. This software systematically alters parameter values and compares the corresponding model results with the measurements provided. The results are judged by means of a cost function; a performance indicator which represents the goodness of fit between the model results and the measurements. OpenDA was however not yet applicable on morphodynamic model applications. Therefore, the software was adjusted, resulting in an upgraded version of OpenDA; OpenDA MOR. Apart from adding morphological parameter and -result readers, two additional performance indicators were implemented in the code; the Brier skill score and Kirchhofer scores. OpenDA MOR is suited for both calibration and sensitivity analysis of morphodynamic model applications. The OpenDA MOR calibration instrument has been tested by means of TWIN experiments. From these tests, rules of thumb have been deduced on how to apply the tool. It was shown that a calibration was most likely to succeed when no more than 2 parameters were calibrated at once, these parameters are non-inter-related, the parameter(s) are sensitive and that the initial values of the parameters are within a 75% range of their optimum values. An extensive sensitivity analysis was performed on 17 parameters using four model applications. A large overlap in sensitivity throughout the model applications was found; i.e. the same parameters were sensitive in all model applications. Furthermore, from the parameter sensitivity, conclusions could be drawn on the relative importance of the different processes in the various model applications. Lastly, the sensitivity analysis has resulted in insights in the inter-relationships that exist between the various model parameters. After successfully testing the calibration instrument, different calibration cases have been set up to investigate two questions; can OpenDA MOR pinpoint sensitive parameters automatically? Do optimum parameter values differ for different model applications and transport formulations? It was found that automatic pinpointing was not possible, implying that a sensitivity analysis has to be performed separately before starting a calibration. From the second calibration case it became clear that different optimum parameter values were found depending on the model application and transport formula used. This shows the importance of calibration and that there is no such thing as a universal best suited calibration strategy. What parameters should be calibrated depends completely on the goal of the model; perfectly calibrated hydrodynamic parameters do not necessarily produce the best morphodynamic results and vice versa. The test results and calibration cases have shown that the calibration instrument OpenDA MOR has successfully been developed and is applicable on any morphodynamic model application. However, the applicability on complex models was shown to be difficult from a practical point of view, because of the very long runtimes of these models. Therefore, further research is needed on how to decrease the runtimes of complex model applications. Moreover, a new cost function should be developed which enables a more accurate judgment of the morphodynamic model results, as it was found that the Brier skill score and Kirchhofer scores are not suited to replace the standard cost function used during this Thesis.","calibration; morphodynamic; Delft3D; automated; sensitivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Firms employing 'low road' practices tend to rely heavily on supervision, as a consequence of the lack of trust among employees, hence leading to higher management intensity. In earlier research, this phenomenon was observed at country-level. However, the evidence was based on highly aggregated data. The focus of this study is therefore to explore whether the same observation exists at firm level. The 'low road' HRM practice is represented by an external flexibility measure i.e. the intensity of the use of flexible workers. Besides the labour flexibility variable, the influences of various factors associated with firms' internal and external environment are also investigated. The analysis is done using multiple regression analyses on the OSA/SCP database for year 2007-2008. Shares of workers hired from manpower agency are shown to have a small, yet positively significant impact on levels of management intensity in the firm. Firm size, on the other hand, has a significantly negative impact on management intensity. Extent of research and innovation activities in the firm is also found to exert significant influence on management intensity. Firms that are more research intensive and innovative tend to have higher management intensity as compared to non-innovating firms. Lastly, substantial sectoral variations are also observed, which might be explained by firm-level factor such as firm size and level of technical complexity.","labour flexibility; labour-management relations; management intensity; labour economics; HRM econometrics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Management of Technology","","Economics of Innovation","",""

(mentor); Van der Helm, A. (mentor)","2012","Programming is a powerful tool for interaction designers, which provides significant opportunities in creating and testing new concepts. Designers and more specifically interaction designers go beyond the basic button & led interaction, but generally stay below production level coding and complex professional systems. However, programming for interaction designers is often a complicated activity. With little to no skills or experience in programming, interaction designers often run into the problem of translating ideas into functioning code, rather than problems related to language. This graduation thesis is the result of investigating the gap between idea and code, and how this abstraction and translating step can be influenced, to make programming for interaction designers more accessible as a design tool. Interaction designers who operate both in the physical and the virtual domain often need to write programs to try out interaction ideas through interactive physical prototypes. To be able to validate these interactive ideas and behaviors successfully, knowledge related to programming is essential. Programming knowledge is fundamental for understanding the technical possibilities and limitations of interaction. Understanding programming is like understanding a new material; a designer needs to know both the limits and possibilities to be able to design successfully. Many of the contemporary tools for interaction designers, such as Arduino or Phidgets, emphasize the ability to sketch in the physical domain of interaction design (sketching in hardware). However, there is little support for the interaction designer to sketch in the virtual domain (sketching in software). While there is a large body of work about bringing programming for nonprofessional programmers, there are many reasons to believe that the hardest problem interaction designers face is the abstraction and translation step that goes from concepts and behaviors to functioning code. The abstraction and translation step is much more problematic for interaction designers than, for instance, syntax or other linguistic aspects of programming. Based upon observation of interaction design students, as well as several studies with paper programing, it is believed that most students are able to grasp individual statements of the language. Instead, most problems occur at a level above individual statement but below completed programs. This graduation thesis attempts to characterize this step of abstraction and translation in the process of interaction designers and proposes a first rough design for a toolkit that bridges the gap between idea and code. This toolkit is called the Code Companion and contains two tools: the Blueprint, and the Pattern Dictionary. The Blueprint is a paper tool that is inspired by programming plans and guides the interaction designer to think how a computer represents behavior or interaction. The Blueprint has four steps: program description, defining inputs and outputs, defining tools, and finally sketching the path from input to output using these tools. The Blueprint was exposed to students in two interaction design workshops, one at the University College of Antwerp and one at the Glasgow School of Art. In the workshops, the students were asked to use the Blueprint after defining their idea of interaction, but before writing their code in Arduino. Students in both of the workshops seemed to have a better overview and had a better understanding what they had to program, because of the Blueprint. Students frequently drew ‘tools’ in the Blueprint they were unable to reproduce in their code. However, they were able to come up with patterns in the Blueprint, but were unable to translate them into working code. To solve the issue of knowing what to program, but not how to program it, the Pattern Dictionary was designed. This is the second tool of the Code Companion, and is a dictionary of common programming patterns. Throughout the workshops, many of these patterns emerged, such as compare, timer, repeat, or sensor input. The combination of these two tools reduce the gap between idea and code, and allow interaction designers to be able to better sketch in software. Finally, an experiment was set up to measure the effect of the Code Companion on the abstraction and translation process. This experiment was set up to have three different groups, in which participants were asked to do two design and programming assignments. Group 1 was asked to do assignment 1 first, followed by assignment 2 using the Code Companion. Group 2 was asked to do assignment 2 first, followed by assignment 1 using the Code Companion. Finally, group 3 did both assignments without using the Code Companion at all.","interaction; design; prototyping; programming; toolkits; research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

As part of the kWh/m2-project, an initiative from the TUDelft and Wageningen University, I researched the energetic sustainability of a small subset of our society’s products and services: mobile telecommunication services. Mobile telecom has seen a rapid growth in the last ten year and he usage of these services, driven by the growing popularity of smartphones and tablet-pc’s, has been skyrocketing in this time. Just last year the traffic of mobile data through these services doubled, and industry forecasters suggest that this will grow more than twelvefold by 2020. Out of curiosity, I decided to explore the energy costs of this development by looking at the industry from a bird’s-eye-view and try to come to an understanding of it as I went on. In my exploration I investigated the origins and workings of mobile telecom, its stakeholders and conducted a review on its sustainability in terms of energy. From this I learned that for the telecom market, energy costs and economic profitability are in a close relationship, particularly in relation to the rapid rise of user data mentioned earlier. After further examination, I decided to adresss the key issues by proposing two new ways for the market’s stakeholders to do business. Each of these ‘business models’ is based on tailored to a specific energy consumption scenario for the year 2020: a ‘Business-as-Usual’ case and a ‘Less’ case in which energy consumption would be lower. For the first scenario I proposed that a business model in which the stakeholders which facilitate mobile service look for a new source of revenue in location-based advertising services. The profit could then be invested in new infrastructure and an overhaul of the old to build a bigger, more energy-efficient mobile network. For the other scenario a proposal was made to reduce the mobile network’s energy costs by joining forces with their customers: by creating a micro economy in which customers can contribute to the network with their own equipment.What follows is an evaluation of the possiblities and limitations of these scenario’s. Finally, the thesis is concluded with recommendations for further research, as there is much more to research and I have only scratched the surface of this topic.","service sustainability; business model innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Strategic Product Design","",""

These techniques are common for statically typed languages and have found their way into IDEs such as Eclipse and Visual Studio.

For this project, we design and build a static analyis tool for JavaScript code. We start by giving background information on relevant parts of the JavaScript language, followed by a survey of existing tools and research. In the design of our analysis tool, we achieved a clear separation of responsibilities between the different modules for parsing, analysis, rule definition and reporting. The level of detail in the default reporter makes our tool an ideal candidate for integration in a JavaScript IDE. On the other hand, our tool is also suited for batch analysis of large code collections. To validate our tool, we set up an experiment in which we ran our analysis tool on two large collections of JavaScript code: one from a repository of open source JavaScript packages, mostly for server-side use; another one gathered from client-side code on a large number of popular websites.

(mentor); Mulder, K.F. (mentor); Van den Broeke, L.J.P. (mentor); Vethaak, J.W. (mentor); Van Beers, C.P. (mentor)","2012","Breakthrough innovations differ from incremental innovations in several ways. Probably the most important way in which they differ is in the level of uncertainty. Managers of breakthrough innovations need to work with high degrees of technological, market, and environmental uncertainties. TNO, which has developed a breakthrough carbon capture and utilization concept is now trying to make sense of these uncertainties and is looking for a roadmap for commercialization. Literature is fraught with instances where under uncertain and complex environments, managers, entrepreneurs and investors rely upon mental models in order to make decisions. Mental models have several shortcomings - such as biases and bounded rationality among several others. In this research, an attempt has been made to use tools of system modeling and scenario building in order to build a techno-economic model that could be used for rational decision making. The techno-economic model has been used to generate scenarios to evaluate the value proposition of 6 possible markets for TNO's carbon capture and utilization technology - Phycocyanin, Astaxanthin, Beta carotene, Omega 3 fatty acids, Fish oil and Crude oil for fuel. After analysis of value proposition and risks, it was seen that certain high value markets such as Phycocyanin, Astaxanthin and Beta carotene did not have enough value proposition with the technology. Omega 3 fatty acids however had a good value proposition along with being a high value market. There were also good value proposition for markets such as fish oil and crude oil. However, in order to make profit in these markets, a very big investment is required which was considered as risky because the technology has not been proven yet. Thus the omega 3 fatty acid market is the recommended market for TNO's technology - which is the answer to the main research question addressed in this thesis. Furthermore, a niche market strategy has been recommended, where TNO along with suitable commercial and research partners could possibly enter the omega 3 fatty acid market. TNO could utilize the knowledge and the profits gained in this process to develop the market for fish oil and crude oil. The fish oil market is closer to the omega 3 fatty acid market, as it is an upstream product of the omega 3 process. So no change in algae species or conditions may be required. However developing the technology for fuel (which is a much bigger market in the long term compared to fish oil), is likely to require new algal species and process parameters. This poses a risk in the long term that TNO might never end up in the fuel market. This leads to a difficult dilemma for the technology entrepreneur. If he decides to invest big to concentrate on the crude oil market, there is a huge financial risk involved. On the other end of the spectrum there is also a risk that a golden opportunity of being a market leader in a big market such as bio-based fuels will be missed. Proponents of niche market strategy believe that they can mitigate these risks by investing in niche markets and then move on to mass markets. However, if one analyzes the history of key innovations in the last century, an overwhelming majority of technology pioneers who enter technology niches, do not manage to transform their business processes to suit the mass market. As a result, technology followers take advantage of the progress made by the pioneers in reducing uncertainty, and are able to supply to the mass market. Given this evidence, it could be of interest to understand the factors that affect a technology pioneer's inability to enter mass markets from the beginning. In this research, four main factors were found to play a key role - maturity of the technology at the time of invention, nature of the market - the need to prove the technology in a small scale before large scale adoption, need to maximize investor attractiveness (low investment, low payback time, high returns) and finally the core business model of the innovator at the time of invention. Other elements of academic interest in this report include the successful demonstration of system modeling to arrive at a market entry strategy, demonstration of how scenario building practices could be reinforced using through system modeling and on how case studies could be used to form high level quantitative models.","market-entry; algae; CO2 capture; system; modeling; scenarios","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-07-10","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

One of these situations is adapting to different light intensities by changing the dynamic range of the eye, so-called temporal adaptation. This report gives insight into what temporal adaptation means for luminance visibility while driving on an urban street during nighttime. The first step needed was collecting data of luminance values falling onto the retina while driving in the dark. As driving with a head-mounted eye-tracker was impractical and insufficiently accurate, the experimental set-up was changed into a lab set-up. An HD camera was used to record a video during driving in the dark, while a luminance camera was used to measure the corresponding luminance values. The resulting video was shown to 20 participants in the lab, and they were asked to watch the movie as if they were driving themselves. Their gaze positions on the screen were measured using a table mounted eye tracker. The gaze positions were converted into saliency maps, which were then combined with the luminance values of the video frames to generate weighted luminance maps. From the weighted luminance maps luminance profiles were deduced, representing the luminance value falling on the center of the retina as a function of time. The luminance values measured in these profiles varied between about 1 and 18,000 cd/m2. About 54% of the fluctuations in luminance within a one-second time frame had a difference below 1000 cd/m2, while about 6% of the fluctuations had a difference larger than 10,000 cd/m2. The effect of temporal adaptation on these luminance fluctuations was estimated by superimposing a temporal adaptation model existing in literature on the luminance profiles. Light adaptation (i.e. from a dark to a bright environment) is so fast that we considered it instantaneous for our application. Dark adaptation (i.e. from a bright to a dark environment) is somewhat slower and so was expected to delay the perception of the lower luminance values. However, also for dark adaptation the initial drop in perceived luminance is so fast that temporal adaptation only had a small effect on perceived luminance for the highest light intensity fluctuations. It should be noted, however, that literature on temporal adaptation only reports adaptation to homogeneous light intensity fields, while in our particular case of driving on an urban street during nighttime the visual field was characterized by a rapidly changing spatially complex light intensity field. Models to describe temporal adaptation to spatially complex light fields do not exist yet, and so, may affect the conclusions of our research.","adaptation; spatial adaptation; temporal adaptation; eye adaptation; light adaptation; dark adaptation; luminance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Interactive Intelligence Group","","Master Media and Knowledge Engineering","",""

(mentor); De Vries, M. (mentor); Everwijn, B. (mentor)","2012","Data integration is becoming an increasingly important issue with the increased sharing of information as a result of linked data and Spatial Data Infrastructures. To investigate the potential issues a case study for the Water Quality Register (WQR) of the Informatiehuis Water is used. In this case study the data residing in three separate data sources (Water Framework Directive (WFD) Database, Bulkdatabase and Limnodata) is to be integrated into a single register (the WQR). A full integration requires harmonisation steps at the data model level (schema mapping and transformation) and at the instance level (instance matching). Schema mapping involves the definition of correspondences between equivalent elements in two or more data models (schemas) defined in for example the Unified Modelling Language (UML) using class diagrams or the XML Schema Definition language (XSD). Correspondences need to be created between a source and a target schema. During this research the schemas of the data sources are documented using reverse engineering techniques as existing documentation is lacking. During the documentation it was found that none of the sources adhered (fully) to a known standard. Also referential integrity and the quality of data contents are lacking. Because none of the existing schemas is suitable for data integration, a target model for the WQR is developed based on INSPIRE (themes Hydrography, Environmental Monitoring Facilities and Area Regulation, Restriction zones and Reporting Units), ISO19156 (“Observations and Measurements”), the WISE reporting sheets and Aquo. The conceptual target schema in UML is converted to an application schema in XSD. To document the correspondences a number of schema mapping languages exist. Only a few of these languages have practical tooling available however. As part of the research three options were further described and their applicability to the case study examined: Rule Interchange Format (RIF), Ontology Mapping Language (OML) and XSLT. For the case study XSLT (and XQuery) were chosen in combination with Altova MapForce as most suitable option for implementation. The second part of a full integration is instance matching. The key spatial object in the case study is the monitoring location. During instance matching inconsistencies from double entries in the data source (conflation) and overlap between data sources (equivalence) are detected and resolved. This is done by matching the locations against each other using the geometry, geographical name and identifier. The resulting matches are used to create a single reference set with (unique) monitoring locations. Both the INSPIRE Geographical Names and Gazetteer schema are investigated for suitability as schema for the reference set. Preference is given to the Geographical Names schema because it allows for more semantic detail. Adaptations to the Geographical Names schema are suggested to make it more suitable as a reference schema. Based on the user requirements from the case study, a hybrid approach is tested for data integration. This hybrid approach combines the use of a harmonised database (Water Database) for storing data collected after the formation of the Water Database, with the use of a mediated schema approach for queries involving data existing in the original data sources prior to the formation of the Water Database (historic data). The Water Database is built using the WQR target schema and filled through an Extract, Load and Transform process with relevant data (surface water bodies and monitoring programs) from the WFD Database and the monitoring locations from the reference set. The integration solution, the WQR mediated schema, uses the Water Database as a new source together with the existing Bulkdatabase and Limnodata data sources. The WQR mediated schema solution retrieves information from these data sources using XSLT and XQuery in a proof of concept. The mediated schema uses the INSPIRE Geographical Names monitoring locations reference set as a central reference for the geographic queries. The proof of concept is functional but is not practical due to long response times. This is a result from the use of file based XML data sources. Suggestions to improve performance are given but not tested.","Data integration; harmonised database; mediated schema; XSLT; XQuery; schema mapping; instance matching; INSPIRE; observations; OML","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","GIS technology","","GIMA","",""

(mentor); Van Dijk, W. (mentor)","2012","In this study a model was introduced which simulates the effects of passive walking support on the human body. Passive support was designed with the goal to reduce human energy expenditure for walking. The XPED exoskeleton and three alternative exoskeleton configurations were tested. The XPED is an exoskeleton with two artificial tendons, passive elastic structures which provide a moment at the hip, knee and ankle joint. In previous research, simulation showed 42.5% reduction in joint work. In experiments however, no reduction in energy expenditure was measured. The old simulation model lacks modelling of human anatomy. This was considered a very important reason for the mismatch which was seen between reduction in energy expenditure in the model and with experiments. The new model includes the modelling of human muscles, tendons, and dissipation of negative work. This also enabled new measures for energy expenditure: muscle work, in which eccentric muscle work contributes less than concentric muscle work, and muscle moments. It was hypothesised that with this new model the work efficiency, the amount of reduction in work, of the XPED exoskeleton would be predicted much lower. The new model showed 37.0% reduction in muscle work. Although efficiency was lower, the presence of anatomic structures in the model did not greatly affect the functionality of the XPED. An optimisation of the XPED parameters to the new work measure for energy expenditure even brought work efficiency up to 43.6%. The other support configurations provided support at the hip, at the knee, or at the hip and the knee joint. It was hypothesised that these configurations were as efficient as the XPED, since mechanical work at the ankle is already performed passively to large extent. This had to be rejected. Work efficiencies of the hip, knee and combined support were respectively 18.7%, 18.4% and 37.1%. Although efficiencies were lower, these configurations are still worth evaluating since they have the benefit that the exoskeleton can be smaller and that the naturally present and very efficient energy saving mechanism in the ankle is not disturbed. A pilot experiment where these configurations were tested with the LOPES exoskeleton did not prove reduction in energy expenditure.","passive exoskeleton","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-07-09","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Nuth, C. (mentor); Kääb, A. (mentor); Menenti, M. (mentor)","2012","In this study the limits and potentials of the principle of photoclinometry for glacier elevation modelling is assessed. A combination of optical and laser remote sensing instruments are used to map the surface of different remote ice bodies. Loss and gain of a glaciers' mass is a good indicator for local climate. If mass-balances of glaciers are known on a world-wide scale, they can give a better understanding of global climate change. Due to the remoteness and harsh environments at which glaciers are located a mass-balance is difficult to maintain or even start-up. Therefore, the use of optical and laser remote sensing can be of great value. The focus of this thesis is to identify options in which optical and laser remote sensing instruments can reliably map the surface of a glacier. It will use the technique of photoclinometry, also known as shape-from-shading, onto optical acquisitions. Estimated surface and topographic information will be integrated with spaceborne laser altimetry. These methodologies will compose a workflow, which produces elevation estimates of a glaciers' surface. Snow has a homogeneous reflection pattern, therefore the perceived reflection of a surface is primarily dependent on the amount of received sunlight per unit area. In that sense brightness values, perceived by an optical spaceborne sensor, may directly be related to surface orientation. This relation is used in this study to estimate a surface model from an optical image. Estimation of this model is done through the relations of a Lambertian reflection function and inverse theory. Only small patches of imagery can be processed, as its estimation is limited in size due to accumulating elevation errors and computational limitations. The methodology was tested on the high mountain glacier of Zhadang, on the Tibetan Plateau. An optical acquisition from the Earth Observation (EO-1) satellite with the on board Advanced Land Imager (ALI) was used. The estimated surface model was assessed and validated with another elevation dataset and leveling transects from a surveying campaign. The resulting surface model needs transformation to be of use for elevation modelling. Different strategies are used to resolve the residual unknowns of the transformation. Registration of surface models was conducted on the icefield of Lomonosovfonna, Svalbard. Laser altimetric measurements from the Ice, Cloud and Elevation Satellite (ICESat) with the on board Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) instrument are used for this registration problem. Both geometric and temporal relations are included into the registration model, but only under specific circumstances the registration is reliable. A profile based approach of photoclinometry is also investigated. It may give topographic correction to resolve errors due to miss-alignment of the ICESat GLAS laser profiler. However, assumptions on terrain geometry were too optimistic to resolve in a reliable correction.","remote sensing; geomatics; glacier mapping; optical and laser remote sensing; photoclinometry; shape from shading; ICESat GLAS; Zhadang; Tibet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Bult, K. (mentor)","2012","This work mainly focuses on designing a low-power class-AB residue amplifier for a 12bit 500MS/sec pipeline ADC with digital calibration. A foreground ideal calibration test bench has been implemented in MATLAB to correct non-linearities of the amplifier up to the 5th order. A detailed comparison has been made between a class-A amplifier and a class-AB amplifier. Simulation results show that the class-AB amplifier outperforms the class-A amplifier in all performance aspects such as gain, bandwidth, linearity, noise and power consumption, except for the CMRR. A new class-AB amplifier topology has been proposed, which alleviates problems associated with the level shifting capacitors. Due to an insufficient accuracy of the proposed class-AB amplifier in order to save power, the residue output signal from the flip-around MDAC topology becomes distorted. To resolve this problem, the flip-around MDAC has been replaced by a simple charge amplifier MDAC topology. Timing scheme of the pipeline ADC has been modified due to remove the timing related problems and ISI. In addition, layout of the first stage MDAC has been done in TSMC 40nm CMOS technology. Post-layout simulations have shown an excellent Figure-of-Merit (FOM) of 8.08fJ/conv, at an ENOB of 10.8bit and signal bandwidth of 250MHz, which prove that the design is not only energy efficient, but also have a superior speed-resolution product.","Amplifier; MDAC; Pipeline ADC; Calibration; SNR; overrange","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-12-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Microelectronics","",""

(mentor)","2012","In the city of Valkenburg a new underground parking garage is being built next to the Hema. For this project four boreholes were drilled in the Maastrichtian limestone. These cores were described and tested at the laboratory of the department of Geoscience and Engineering of Delft University of Technology to obtain the geotechnical properties of the limestone that are relevant to the car park construction. In this thesis, the cores are analyzed to obtain information about the local (structural) geology. This geological information is necessary to determine in which member of the Maastrichtian limestone the car park will be build and if there are faults in this area that can influence the project. The Maastricht Formation is divided into six members, each having its own characteristics. To determine from which member of the Maastricht Formation the cores are, data from various sources has been interpreted and integrated. The geotechnical description and testing of the cores made by TU Delft have been used. Gamma-ray logs have been recorded (by others) in three of the boreholes made for the car park project. They have been segmented, by the authors of this report, in the hope to determine boundaries between the different members. Also XRF analyses for the mineral content; analyses of fossil remains, limestone color and cherts have been conducted. Their results have been correlated with information found in the literature for each member. The following conclusions have been drawn. Very few macro-fossils have been found in the cores. From this information, the presence of members known for their high content in fossils is excluded, so this conclusion confirms that the cores are not drilled in the Meerssen member. The specific characteristics of the cherts confirmed the occurrence of some members of the Maastricht Formation in the Valkenburg cores. The pipe shaped cherts confirmed the Emael member, and the brown grey cherts confirmed the Gronsveld or the Valkenburg. From the XRF results the percentages of silica was less than 15% for the deepest samples taken in the core linings and according to literature the Valkenburg member has a silica content of approximately 15%, confirming that the Valkenburg member is not reached. The XRF analysis gave unexpected results. Some limestone cores were found to contain gypsum and/or have a silica content higher than what has been reported in the literature. The patterns observed on the gamma logs could not be explained by the XRF results. They are not well understood. Some could be observed in two boreholes and not in the third one. The authors concluded that the cores have been drilled in the Emael to the Gronsveld member. They did not reject the possibility that the members of the Maastrichtian found in Valkenburg do not have the same characteristics as the members found elsewhere in Limburg, for example, Maastricht. During the interpretation of the provided gamma ray logs, some difficulties were encountered. The XRF results stated that the high gamma ray peaks are not caused by higher potassium contents, which is often expected. If higher potassium contents are excluded, the expectation is that the peaks are due to the presence of organic matter, but this was not confirmed by the XRF either. Because of variations in the gamma ray logs and the core descriptions, it is difficult to reject the presence of any small fault intersecting the future car park. Note that the observed variations could well be due to local variations in the sedimentation conditions.","Valkenburg; limestone; Maastricht Formation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-09","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Huang, L. (mentor)","2012","The Super Regenerative Receiver was invented by Armstrong in 1922 [1]. It is used in various applications such as sensor networks, short distance telemetry, home automation, biomedicine, remotely controlled systems, etc., because of its simplicity and low power design. In the classical super regenerative receiver, the RF oscillations obtained at the output of the oscillator is applied to a non-linear detector followed by a low pass filter. Hence the demodulation capabilities of the super regenerative receiver was restricted to amplitude modulation or on off keying (OOK) signals. The challenge is to use the super regenerative architecture to demodulate phase modulated signals which are more robust to interference compared to OOK signals and still maintaining the low power, low cost features of the receiver. The principle of super regenerative receiver is based on the theory of quenching, where a quench oscillator causes repeated build up and decay of oscillations and the oscillations are maximum at the zero crossing where the quench signal goes towards the positive half cycle. Any phase errors in the quench signal directly affects the phase detection performance. Thus it is also important to maintain synchronization between the quench signal and the carrier. In digital communications, packet arrival instants are generally random and unknown at the receiver. The payload of the packet can be successfully demodulated if the start time of the payload is known at the receiver. Thus the objective of this thesis is threefold. Firstly the super regenerative architecture for demodulating BPSK signals is presented and an analyses based on performance and power is done. Secondly a method for synchronizing the quench signal to the carrier is presented and the effects of jitter on the detection performance is analysed. Thirdly, the procedure for preamble detection is presented and its performance is analysed.","BPSK; SNR; Super Regenerative Receiver; Frame Synchronization; Preamble detection; PLL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","This report depicts in detail the thesis project “Meat substitutes for flexitarians: A design driven approach to inspire food developers.” This project was developed as my final evaluation in Design for Interaction at the Faculty of Industrial Design at the Delft University of Technology. The project was performed from September 2011 to June 2012, six months working in colaboration with WUR Food and Biobased Research and four months working in the graduation my own. The thesis project was hosted by the Consumer research Department at Wageningen UR Food & Biobased Research. WUR is corrently working in the joint collaboration project “LikeMeat”. The European Commission Project “LikeMeat” delves into the concept of meat substitutes and their role in Western European culture. Meat has been part of Western European culture since the development of humankind. A detailed introduction of meat types and its role in society is contrasted with positive and negative considerations of meat consumption. The development and origins of meat substitutes are assessed, involving commonly used materials and positive and negative considerations. Sustainability in Western Europe is remarked as the strongest motivator for increasing meat substitute consumption. In order to achieve this, food design must be employed as a tool for understanding the user experience regarding meat substitutes. Meat substitutes users can emerge from different motivations. One of those users is considered as the target group: flexitarians. For those unfamiliar with the concept, an introduction to flexitarians is given by addressing their characteristics, motivations and expectations regarding meat substitutes. In this way, the research questions drawn previously are concentrated on the target group by performing a qualitative research at WUR Food & Biobased Research. Research trough design was implemented to understand the how the current Flexitarians interactions with meat substitutes are. The research trough design process initiated with a creative sessions with food developers, from which 13 concepts were drawn and prototyped. These ideas were evaluated in different stakeholders: involved partners of LikeMeat and intended users. These first ideas helped in finding out what flexitarians value from meat substitutes. As the outcome of the research, current interaction with meat substitutes were identified. This helped to develop a design vision , description of desirable interactions and sugested guidelines for future meat substitutes. After the generation of the design vision an ideation and prototyping for this meat substitutes for Flexitarians was produced. Meat substitutes should be improved regarding involvement and social correspondence in order to become attractive to Western European society. The two prototypes accomplished different goals regarding these aspects and combined; show that meat substitutes can be introduced in the society by means of several integration processes. These later concepts are inspired in the previously generated ideas for LikeMeat. These concepts allow the interpretation of the design vision to be tangible. In this final phase, the design concepts were user tested to some degree with an experimental prototype in two user group sessions with different participants of Dutch nationality.","Research trough design; Food Design; Meat Substitute; Food and Culture; Experience design; Interaction design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2012","This study was completed to determine which location along the Buenos Aires coast is better suited for the development of a Marina port, taking into account physical, environmental and economic features. A literature review related to port development, dimensioning, and port/coast interaction was completed. It was defined that the most relevant criteria to select a location were the water depths near shore, longshore transport rates, and the impact on the adjacent coast. Following this section, the preliminary port dimensions were defined based on the Unified Facilities Criteria (2009), and the California department of boating and waterways (2005). Each initially feasible location was selected based on the information obtained from the literature study, the expertise of the people involved in the project in Argentina, and the two week visit to the Buenos Aires coast. The reviewed literature provided some insight on the morphology and dynamics of the coast, although the reliability of the different studies was limited in many cases. Near-shore wave values were almost non-existent along the coast, and only a few studies had a more thorough methodology to estimate waves, longshore transport rates and coastline change. In this thesis study Delft3D-WAVE model was implemented, forced by offshore wave/wind data from the NOAA Wave Watch data base, including 18 offshore wave/wind points used as spatially varying boundary conditions. The bathymetry of the area was built based on the nautical charts obtained from Servicio de Hidrografia Naval (2012), and the GEBCO (2008) global bathymetry. The NOAA wave and wind data was classified in 125 scenarios by using ORCA tools. To show the results of the wave model, each scenario was plotted showing the distribution of the significant wave height, and the peak wave period. Added to that, 36 near-shore wave roses were created at the 7m water depth contour, covering the coast of Buenos Aires province. A strong dominance of south storms was found, it was also concluded that the coast further north had a weaker wave climate and consequently smaller transport rates, mainly due to energy dissipation induced by bottom friction of the extensive shallow areas near the north section of the coast. By using the calculated near-shore wave climate; longshore transport rates, and coastline changes along the coast were calculated by implementing UNIBEST-CL+. The sediment properties as the D10, D50 and D90 used for the model were derived from the samples extracted during the field visit in Argentina that were later measured at the TU-Delft Geoscience laboratory. The calculated longshore transport rates showed a good agreement when compared to the values obtained by Van Rijn, L.C. (2008) and Scalise, A.H., Schnack, E.J. (2007). After implementing the wave and coastline models, an evaluation of the locations was completed. All the locations were compared by using a multi-criteria table, and it was concluded that Pinamar was the most promising location, since it provided moderate waves and longshore transport rates, short distance from the shore to the required depths, and existing infrastructure to accommodate and entertain the different marina users. Different layout alternatives were derived and compared; for the selected alternative, extra insight was provided, estimating the dredging volumes, and proposing coastal protection structures.","Delft3DWAVE; Waves; UNIBEST-CL+; Longshore; Buenos Aires coast","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

(mentor); Van Paassen, L.A. (mentor); Van der Star, W. (mentor); Ye, G. (mentor)","2012","Rice husk ash is an attractive pozzolan. Due to its low cost and high activity it has a promising perspective in sustainable construction. In combination with lime, its effect in soil improvement can be equal to cement treatment but its production process consumes much less energy. The main component of the rice husk ash is silica, which is the element that governs the reactivity of the ash. A delicate burning process is required to eliminate the organic components in the rice husk but keep the silica to be amorphous so that a highly reactive rice husk ash can be obtained. A too high temperature would transform amorphous silica to crystalline silica, which would reduce the reactivity. The suggested burning process in literature is 2 hours at 500oC. However, due to the exothermic property of the burning rice husk it is difficult to control the exact burning temperature, hence there is still a possibility that the carbon and the crystallized silica are present and hinder the activity of the rice husk ash. Based on the silica state and the carbon content, the rice husk ash is classified in three types: C-RHA which is collected from a quick and open-air burning and contains a large amount of carbon; Cr-RHA which is collected form slow burning at above 600oC and contains a large amount of crystallized silica; and A-RHA which is collected from the suggested burning process which is 500oC in 2 hours and is considered to be the most active. The activity of these three types of rice husk ash and their effect in soil improvement were tested. As expected, the higher reactivity of the A-RHA compared with the Cr-RHA confirmed the capability of these burning conditions. Surprisingly, the C-RHA appeared to be the most reactive and its effect to the soil was also the most positive despite of the large carbon content and the detected crystalline silica. The high reactivity of the C-RHA derives that there is a hierarchy of the solubility depending on the burning duration so that although all the three types of ash were mainly amorphous, the C-RHA is the most soluble. From the experiments, the role of the carbon was seen in only the term of quantity as it reduce the proportion of the silica, but might it have any support to the reactivity of the material in those experiments then it needs more investigation. The results of the treated soil showed that the rice husk ash need the lime to be activated, but then it helped to enlarge the possitive effect of the lime. The immediate effect of the additives to the plasiticity of the soil were seen to be the results of the lime only, but the long-term effect of the strength and the compression of the soil were seen to be the results of the combination between rice husk ash and lime. Especially in the case of C-RHA, it can reduce half the amount of lime in the case of 6% lime mixing to give similar undrained shear strength which was about 410 kPa. Because the carbon is not a serious harmful factor in the soil, and the soil can also take the advantage of the firmness of the quartz, so between the two cases, the rice husk ash with large carbon content and also considerable amount of quartz but higher reactivity, and the rice husk ash which is almost purely amorphous silica but less reactive, the former is the preferred for the soil improvement purpose.","rice husk ash; soil improvement; burning conditions; pozzlan; pozzolanic activity; reactive silica","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van Den Dobbelsteen, A. (mentor)","2012","In the ‘Actieprogramma leegstaande kantoren’ the strategies of redevelopment, transformation and demolition of existing office buildings are suggested to reduce the high vacancy rate in the Dutch office market. Available research on which strategy is most sustainable did not incorporate the estimated service life of the strategies, but applied a standard expectation, which leads to an inaccurate estimation of the environmental load per year of service life. Because the strategy is chosen in the initiative phase of a project, the design is often not present for all strategies. A perfect design for the new-build structure is often assumed leading to an unequal comparison of designs. To find the effect of the estimated service life (ESL) on the sustainability of vacancy strategies the S3 model is developed that includes ESL and replaces the design of a strategy with ambition levels. The sustainability of three real and one averaged case is assessed and the effect of the ESL on these results is analyzed. The model does not include financial or social factors. Sustainability has been defined as ecological sustainability as calculated by Greencalc+ 4.0. A comparison is made between the linear deduction in the lifespan accounting model and an annuity deduction. To prevent negative ESL values the improved factor method by Van Nunen (2010) is adapted and a piecewise formula is used to determine the ESL. A method that standardizes the assessment of ESL factors has been developed. Score tables describe the requirements for a building to be assigned a certain score, which are later translated to factors. The results show that the estimated service life does influence the measurement of the sustainability of vacancy strategies. Because the environmental load caused by materials is deducted over the entire service life, a higher ESL reduces the load per year for materials more than a lower ESL. This means that strategies with a higher ESL are advantaged. Excluding the remaining environmental load decreases this effect because it decreases the environmental load caused by materials. A positive annuity deduction method will cause a higher remaining environmental load and will increase the effect of including the ESL. A negative annuity will cause a lower remaining environmental load and will decrease the effect of including the ESL.","estimated service life; sustainability; vacancy; S3 model; sustainable strategy selection model; transformation; redevelopment; demolition & new-build; environmental load deduction; renovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-11","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Real Estate Management","",""

It is found that the two open branches of Tien River will deepen by more than 10 meters when all three other branches are closed. Due to the need of land for agriculture and other economic sectors, sea dikes are always built close to the mangroves forest. Along the Southern Coast of Viet Nam there are many places where mangrove degradations and coastline erosions are observed on a large scale when sea dikes are built too close to the mangroves forests. Based on the relationship found for mangroves width and coastline evolution, it is concluded that the critical value of 300 to 400 meters of mangroves width is necessary for the stability of the East Coast of Viet Nam. Results from the SWAN model also show that mangroves have a significant effect on wave height attenuation only at cross-shore widths greater than 300 to 400 m and that an increase in width beyond 1000 m does not make much of difference.","Mekong Delta; mangroves; morphology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

(mentor)","2012","There are plans for the construction of a multi-purpose dam in the White Volta River near Pwalugu in northern Ghana. The reservoir that will be formed should be beneficial for hydropower generation, irrigation and fishery. Up to now there has been no research into the morphological consequences of the creation of this reservoir. In this study the rate and location of sedimentation in the reservoir and the erosion of the riverbed downstream of the dam are investigated. Sedimentation could lead to a loss of storage capacity having less water available for hydropower generation and irrigation purposes. Delta deposition (i.e. sedimentation of coarse sediment in the upstream part of the reservoir) could lead to higher water levels in the river upstream, causing an increased risk of flooding. Erosion of the riverbed downstream of the dam could lead to decreased water levels in the downstream reach. This could provoke riverbank collapse and have negative effects on agriculture due to lowering of groundwater levels. Possibly bridges downstream could be damaged by scouring of the foundations. The aim of this research is to understand the large-scale morphological processes and to give first order estimations of the morphological changes. Additionally, the sediment balance of the White Volta catchment is investigated to estimate landscape erosion. The method consists of a literature study, a field study and a morphological model (SOBEK) of the White Volta River. The total sedimentation in the intended reservoir has been analysed by determining the yearly sediment transport of the White Volta River. The estimation is based on field measurements, conducted in September 2011 at a location close to the proposed dam site, supplemented with a literature study and theoretical transport formulas. The yearly average sediment inflow appeared to be ± 1 million ton/year. The theoretical trap efficiency of the reservoir is nearly 100%, so it is assumed that all sediment will be deposited. If all sediment settles in the active storage of the reservoir, this would mean a storage loss of 3% per 100 years. The impact of this storage loss on the functions of the reservoir is considered negligible. The delta deposition (i.e. sedimentation of coarse material) and the erosion downstream of the dam have been estimated using SOBEK RE, a 1D software package capable of solving the hydrodynamic, sediment transport and morphological equations. The model parameters followed from the field research. The delta deposition depends on the water level variation in the reservoir. If the water level varies between maximum and minimum operative level, the reservoir will vary in length over 40 km and most of the delta deposition will occur in this region. The delta deposition is propagating in both upstream and downstream direction. Due to upstream propagation the riverbed level upstream of the reservoir will also increase. After 50 years, the effect is restricted to ± 30 cm just upstream of the lake and has damped out at the border of Burkina Faso. The water levels will slightly increase during high flows. More research is needed to analyse the increased risk of flooding. Erosion of the riverbed downstream of the dam will occur. The released flow through the dam is expected to be sediment-free. As the sediment concentration is lower than the sediment carrying capacity, the river will take up sediment and the bed will experience erosion. The riverbed level could decrease by 20-30 m in 50 years just downstream of the dam. The erosion rate is reducing in downstream direction, but propagating in time. After ± 30 years a bridge near Pwalugu could be affected. The erosion could be limited locally if any coarse layers are present beneath the riverbed. The erosion rate depends on the released flow through the dam, which is determined by the operational strategy. Spillage could occur when the reservoir gets completely filled. These high flows will have a substantial negative effect on the erosion. Spillage cannot be completely prevented, but the risk could be reduced by ensuring that the lake is at minimum level at the start of the rain season. The drawback of this solution is a decreased energy generation, as the lake will not fill up completely during dry years. The sediment balance of the White Volta catchment is based on sediment deposition and erosion rates. During the dry season there is a supply of Saharan dust into the catchment by so-called Harmattan winds. During the rain season eroded material is flowing out of the catchment as suspended sediment in the White Volta River. The Harmattan dust deposition rate has been derived from literature. The sediment deposition and erosion rate are equal (± 15 mm/1000 years), therefore there is no net landscape erosion in the White Volta catchment. Some parts might be eroding and some parts accumulating, but on average there is equilibrium. To analyse if there are areas more prone to erosion, the origin of deposited sediment on the riverbanks was analysed. This sediment has been collected during the field research in September 2011 and subsequently the texture and mineralogy have been analysed. This has been compared to the composition of the soil in the catchment and the composition of Harmattan dust. Both compositions were derived from literature. The texture of the deposited sediment on the riverbanks appeared to be mainly silt and clay. The mineralogy of the sediment is quartz, feldspar and kaolinite. As these minerals are abundant in the soil as well as in Harmattan dust, no definite conclusions can be drawn on the origin of the sediment. The general conclusion is that the creation of a reservoir will have morphological effects in the reservoir and downstream of the dam. In the intended reservoir sedimentation will occur, but the effect on the functions of the reservoir is negligible. Delta deposition will mainly occur within the reservoir and partly in the upstream riverbed. As the sand will be spread out over a large distance the riverbed increase will be limited. The effect on the water levels in the river should be further investigated. There will be significant erosion of the riverbed close to the dam. In the future the riverbed erosion could damage Pwalugu bridge. Other negative consequences such as bank collapse and the draw down of groundwater levels could occur locally. Applying sediment management strategies could reduce the impact on the river morphology. Possible measures to reduce the erosion and sedimentation rates include dredging or sluicing of high-turbidity currents. The factors that are most determining the results of this study are the riverbed composition and the suspended sediment load. In order to obtain more accurate results, model refinement should start with collecting more data in the field.","river morphology; reservoir; reservoir sedimentation; White Volta; Ghana","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-09-19","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

This is a new concept which is not yet used for commercial airplanes but has proven to have several advantages such as lowering the drag and lighter weight combined with higher stiffness. It also increases the maneuverability. However the simulation of the structure using Finite Element Method introduces too many degrees of freedom. Therefore it is necessary to reduce the system of equations using modal order reduction. The common methods of using vibration modes in a reduction basis to reduce the system, fail for nonlinear structures, as with large displacements, the vibration modes of the structure change. Modal derivatives show how a certain mode changes in the direction of another mode. Including modal derivatives in the reduction basis improves the reduction of the model but is very much dependent on the geometry of the structure. In this work, the reduction basis is set up using vibration modes and modal derivatives. It is investigated why this basis fails to reduce the system of the joined wing accurately. By calculating for the remainder, proper orthogonal decomposition and Krylov sequence the reduction basis is improved. Finally a greedy algorithm applied to the joined wing problem succeeds in reducing the system by finding the best possible improvement of the reduction basis for each load step.","nonlinear; finite; wing structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-08-03","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","This master thesis is about the sentiment analysis of the societal theme documents and categorizing them in positive or negative groups. The application of this thesis can be widely used in review blogs, public polls and etc. In this study, we have compared different feature sets as well as different classifiers on datasets of opinionated texts with societal themes. These datasets consist of one large and 6 small sets in terms of number of documents. By considering the often used “Bag of Words” feature set as the base line we have tested 4 other models and came to this conclusion that selecting features with their part of speech tags can always improve the results of sentiment classification while adjective and negation tags can describe the opinionated documents more informatively in much smaller matrices which saves a lot of memory and processing time. Moreover, by selecting these tags according to their PMI ranks in positive and negative labeled documents, we obtained the most informative sentimental words. On the other hand, based on the obtained results, in contrast with the predominant attitude in the sentiment analysis field that support vector machine (SVC) is the best classifier for binary classification of opinionated documents, we found the linear discriminate classifier (LDC) can perform as well as support vector machine but 10 times faster. The consumed time is convincing enough to substitute SVC with LDC in sentiment analysis when we have a large number of features as is the case in a Bag of Words model due to the fact that the time that SVC needs for predicting labels is quadratic in terms of number of documents. The feature vectors obtained through PMI analysis are relatively small, we found that as a consequence, the k-nearest Neighbor Classifier (KNNC) could train well and gave the most accurate results in comparison with LDC and SVC in both large and small datasets. It should be stressed that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used in this study in order to extract mathematically the most common features in all the models.","Support Vector Classifier; Linear Discriminate Classifier; Nearest Neighbor Classifier; Feature Set; Natural Language Processing; Sentiment Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Man-Machine Interaction","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor)","2012","Guidance structures are built in the vicinity of a sluice complex to serve as berth for ships waiting for the sluice to be available. The structure is loaded by the ship and should stop the ship without being damaged. The design of a guidance structure did not significantly change over the last decades. Therefore one could talk about a traditional structure. The structure consists of vertical supports with horizontal beams covered with timber. A new solution is found by mr. Ros who proposes to use pre-tensioned cables to stop the ship. The high tension capacity will make it possible to significantly reduce the use of material. The load on a guidance structure is formed by the ships kinetic energy. The interaction between ship, water, structure and soil will determine the reaction force by which the ship is slowed down. The influence of the water is formed by added water mass and damping through wave radiation. A cable structure has relatively low stiffness which leads to a larger stopping length, which implies more kinetic energy to absorb through the water influence. The guidance structures should be able to serve the entire fleet. The stiffness needs to be low enough for an empty ship which hits all the cables and high enough for a loaded ship which only hits the lower cables. To guaranty safety, the ship should not be able to sail underneath any cable. The solution is found in the use of an integral pre-tensioning system. By a balancing bar the cables are connected and able to interact. A lever beam with counter weight is used for pre-tensioning. With this system the vulnerability for stretch, creep, relaxation, deformation or temperature is minimal. Skirts are providing vertical stiffness, so all cables will deform together. Cables are connected to vertical supports. Those supports are relatively stiff compared to the stiffness halfway the span. Calculations showed the stiffness of the guidance structures increases gradually as the ship approaches the support. To get the ship safely past the support a support glider is invented. The support gliders are also used to prevent crushing of the cable between support and ship. The determent factor for the design of a cable guidance structure is the cable span. For a first design the situation at Krammersluizen (Netherlands) is used. The span is 57,6 meter and the total length is 288 meter. With the use of a maximum allowable stopping length, the needed pretension force is calculated. Only elastic deformation of the supports is allowed. This limits the maximum stopping length to 1,0 meter in the case of 57,6 meter cable span. Optimizing the design is done through varying the amount of support and thereby changing the cable span. Even the extreme case of 1 span of 288 meter has a solution that satisfies all demands. The steel cables have a design factor of 2,3. Reducing the amount of supports leads to a net profit. Extra costs for cables and the pre-tensioning system are not as big as the savings by reduction of the amount of steel. The cheapest possibility is a cable guidance structure with 1 support. Due to placement of bollards and ladders a minimum of 4 supports are needed. The cost reduction for this design is 32% and the reduction on environmental impact 44%. The cable guidance structure is technical and economic feasible. Further research should focus on the proposed issues to reduce costs and environmental impact even further.","remmingwerk; guidance structure; lock approach; cable; tension; berth; hydrodynamic","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-28","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","Rip currents are seaward directed flows of water that traverse the surf zone, and in many cases pose potentially dangerous conditions for swimmers and beach users. The present study is carried out focusing on Perranporth beach, UK, which is known to present quite strong rip current events that have been the culprits of large numbers of incidents or rescues (in some cases more than 65 in a single day) in the past (Scott et al., 2009). The main objective of this work is related to the forecasting of rip currents, particularly in helping to develop, calibrate, and validate an operational swimmer safety model for Perranporth beach, UK. This main objective is divided into several specific objectives, which look into answering both general scientific questions and specific details for the implementation of the model at the study site. The tool used for the estimation of bathymetries is the data-model assimilation scheme Beach Wizard, which uses video-derived information to adjust an initial bathymetry into an updated bathymetry. The Beach Wizard model is run with the numerical model XBeach, assimilating the hydrodynamic model output with video-derived measures of wave dissipation (imaps). Specific model formulations and parameters of Beach Wizard are varied and tested as to determine the effects of each, as well as to obtain the best working model for Perranporth, UK. Two systematic estimation errors that were originally pointed out by van Dongeren et al. (2008) are looked into, resulting in the implementation of a variation in the bed updating process, by introducing a time-dependent bed change factor. The changes applied to the model formulations and the adjustments of default parameters resulted in accurate estimations of bathymetries over a three month period (April-June 2011) during which video derived input and five measured bathymetries are available at Perranporth. The importance of video derived input (timex images) is analyzed in detail, by defining several criteria concerning the quality, quantity, and temporal regularity of images used as input. The quality criteria is divided into two separate indicators, in this manner differentiating between actual image quality (if the camera lens is clean or dirty, or if there is foggy conditions, etc.) and dissipation map (imap) quality (if the dissipation patterns are good or not). With this, it was found that imap quality stands over image quality, meaning that it is more important to have favorable wave breaking conditions than perfect image resolution. As well as this, image regularity was found to be important in maintaining the models predictive ability, due to large temporal gaps between consecutive images increasing the bed uncertainty significantly (resulting in very large, and possibly erroneous bed changes if the corresponding imap is not perfect). The final criteria looked at was image quantity, which turned out not to be of great importance as long as the image regularity is maintained; presenting even improved results for a case using a smaller total amount of input with the same temporal spacing. The estimated bathymetries computed with Beach Wizard were used to model nearshore flows in a non-stationary hydrodynamic XBeach model. It was found that very promising similarities are seen between said currents and the currents modeled over measured bathymetries. The use of estimated bathymetries show clear improvements over using an outdated measured bathymetry for the prediction of rip currents, essentially validating the use of the Beach Wizard tool in the eventual implementation of an operational rip current forecasting system at Perranporth beach.","Beach Wizard; XBeach; Rip current forecasting; bathymetry estimation; perranporth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

(mentor); Korthals Altes, W. (mentor)","2012","The study and comprehension of cities development processes becomes nowadays more relevant not only for academics but also for planners involved in practice, policy makers and other groups concerned with urban space shaping. On one hand, it is already known by the ‘state of world population report’ of United Nations, that about one in two persons of the worldwide population now live in an urban area (UNPF, 2011). Secondly, it is recognized that cities are places where production, circulation and consumption of assets and ideas take place by the means of spatial proximity. Although this condition is suitable for the concentration of wealth in cities, it also affects their socio spatial configuration when is exclusively based in the profit making capacities of land use value (Lefebvre, 1996 [1968], 2003 [1970]; Castells, 1977 [1972]; Harvey, 1973 in Brenner et al., 2009). Moreover, urban development especially under capitalists systems, is set in the middle of social and political clashes and embedded in conflicts between strategies for capital accumulation and satisfaction of social needs (ibidem). These situations have raised concerns about human rights and the role of these ones in the urban environment (McCann, 2002; Harvey, 2008). Moreover, the right to the city is now considered in international debates (HIC-AL, 2008), and its definition as a concept now entails discussion in theory and practice of urban planning and city management. It is within those fields, due to the capacity they have to shape reality, where it is imperative to keep asking: what should be considered socially just in matter of planning policies, strategies and instruments? With this in mind, the graduation project presented in this report: Access to the city for everyone: Planning and spatial strategies to counteract residential segregation in Bogotá attempts to reflect on the broad question mentioned above in a specific context -Bogotá city- and on a specific subject –the articulation of planning and spatial strategies for the counteraction of residential segregation negative effects and provision of social housing in inner city areas of Bogotá-. It does so, by reflecting first about socio spatial segregation in the context of Latin America, to subsequently study its different expressions for the case of Bogotá along with one aspect of the phenomenon: the provision of formal development of housing for low income population groups. Furthermore, an articulation between spatial interventions and planning instruments in different inner city areas is proposed as part of a de-concentration and diversification strategy of the social housing supply in the city.","Bogota; residential segregation; affordable housing; social integration; densification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","MSc in Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences mastertrack in Urbanism","",""

This graduation project was developed within the last year of the programme (2012) with the collaboration of the Complex Cities graduation studio, which deals with understanding the spatial organization of cities today through the integration and comprehension of different approaches towards the built environment. Two centers, Zemun and Old Belgrade, used to develop separately until the XX century when those two places became united within the new capital of Yugoslavia. This set up effected the riverfront that started developing actively only at the beginning of the XX century with the accent on the period after the WW2. It is quite clear that the riverfront couldn’t follow and compete to the highly developed and spatially pronounced identity and vitality of two historical cities. In this way the river had a signifi cant predisposition to develop an urban asymmetry in comparison to historical centers. This asymmetry refl ects not only in terms of identity and vitality but also in terms that the city never evolved into a city on the water. Sometimes it seems like the city of Belgrade was too long in retreat from its waterline to develop as the city on the water. This project aims to understand this relation and try to evoke it through learning from both city and its rivers.","Belgrade; place; non-place; existential space; riverfront; inhabitation groups; Danube; Sava River","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","Spatial Planning and Strategy - Complex Cities Studio","",""

Shipyards are able to deliver a mega ship within 18 to 24 months while it takes years to planning and developing a new terminal. Mega container ships (Maersk Triple-E class vessels) are due to be delivered next year, and it is foreseen to be deployed in the Asia – Europe route. Singapore is strategically located within the route and hence has a great potential to be one of the port of calls. This study is based on interviews and a single case study that provides background information and the current state of affair of the port. The information is then further analysed by performing Multi-Criteria Analysis to identify the short term and long term impacts of mega container ships to the port. SWOT analysis is also performed to assess the port’s competitiveness in relation to mega container ships. The study found that mega container ships have positive impacts to the port both in short term and long term. In addition, the port is very competitive, and it has a great potential of attracting mega ships to come by having the supporting assets necessary.","CoMEM; port; port operation; port management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

The main objective of this study is therefore to research an appropriate design for the sluice structure type that can be applied in Vung Tau Go Cong, which is the largest project of discharge sluice in Viet Nam so far. From the literature review, it can be seen that in the Netherlands, several units of sluice caisson have been applied but their main function was only to permanently close the basin, while in Viet Nam only a single caisson is applied as small river barriers. It is to say that a large discharge sluice with several units of caisson has never been built so far. In contrast with this type of structure, most of discharge sluices and barriers in the world have been build according to the “pier structure type”. In the Netherlands piers and bottom slabs are normally placed on batter pile foundations. Meanwhile in Viet Nam, piers are often placed on vertical pile foundations and a bottom slab is replaced by supporting beams. Because of both “proven structure”- caisson and pier have their own strong and weak points, by combining the best features of these “proven technologies” of the Netherlands and Viet Nam; two appropriate structure types were designed and the critical concerns related to them were checked. It is concluded that the caisson and pier sluice structure are feasible solutions for the discharge sluice at Vung Tau Go cong. It can be also considered as an innovative structure for larger discharge sluice.","discharge sluice; caisson; pier; structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

In recent time, the interests from ship owners in further exploring the viability and future market potentials of applying the LNG fuelling technology to large vessels such as VLCC and ultra large containerships has rapidly grown, mainly driven by tightening environmental legislation and increasing oil price. The key objective of this dissertation consists of two aspects, namely the assessment technical feasibility and the investigation of economic advantages. An extensive literature review of LNG fuelling technology was conducted as aspects of dual fuel engine manufacturing, vessel modification and bunkering methods. It was subsequently concluded that using LNG- dominant-fuelled propulsion for large-size vessels involved in long-haul trips, a VLCC in this project, is technically possible but needs collaboration from port operators with regards to port bunkering facility development. As for the economic advantages, research was performed based on one specific case study of investing a VLCC newbuilding to operate along a presumed transoceanic route. With an estimated 20% investment premium based on the original price for a conventional VLCC, the payback time for investors is expected to be within ten years under most circumstances. The higher oil price is, the more cost-competitive it is to replace the current marine fuel with LNG. By improving infrastructure development worldwide, LNG delivery price as marine fuel could be largely reduced at some future stage, leading to a brighter future of this business area.","LNG; alternative fuel; shipping finance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

(mentor)","2012","Property development along the west coast of Barbados has led to an increasing pressure on the coastline as property owners desire to have their residences close to the sea. The addition of new coastal structures including revetments, breakwaters, and groynes, changes the dynamics of the natural littoral system. The sediment transport mechanism(s) between the beach cells characteristic of the west coast is not fully understood, so accurately predicting the effects of additional structures is difficult. Additionally the potential effects of sea level rise and a healthy reef on the mechanics and stability of the system is un-researched. Recent increases in interest of the design of multi-purpose reefs (MPR) and artificial surfing reefs (ASR) has further led to the desire for insight into the sediment dynamics at headland-reef-bay systems. This study evaluates the response and interaction mechanism(s) acting at a beach cell system with a focus under swell conditions and oblique waves typical of the west coast of Barbados. Using the Delft3D numerical model and a schematized section of coastline, a sensitivity analysis is conducted on parameters of interest to determine their effects on the sediment transport in the system. Delft3D was determined to be a valid tool to examine sediment transport in this type of system. Model results indicated that the most important parameters governing the sediment behaviour are the significant wave height, direction, and sediment diameter. Other factors of importance included reef size, reef shape, reef asymmetry, and reef roughness. Perhaps surprisingly, sea level had little effect on overall transport rates but was the most important factor affecting the location and type of transport. These changes to the mode of transport are important as they govern the public perception of what is occurring. The transport associated with elevated sea levels, although not a problem from the system perspective, becomes an issue from the beach user and public opinion perspective as erosion takes place at the beachface where it is highly visible and has significant effects on beach usability.","Sediment Transport; Coral Reef; Barbados; Delft3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

(mentor)","2012","Learning is often perceived as a very complex and many-sided matter that is fuelled by social interaction and participation. It is therefore no wonder that in today’s knowledge and information-led society the concepts of ‘lifelong learning and knowledge’ have become more popular in relation to both the formation and implementation of policies and strategies, including those around the planning and realisation of spatial development projects. The overarching purpose of this master thesis is therefore to explore the role of learning and knowledge within the urban area development project HafenCity Hamburg by focussing on the learning activities and the impacts these learning activities have on the project’s master plan development. In order to reveal the learning process within HafenCity Hamburg a literature review about urban area development, learning, and knowledge is conducted, accompanied with an empirical research to get a deeper understanding about the learning process. In this research process a critical discourse analysis is used as a tool to interpret the learning process in HafenCity Hamburg and to find an explanation concerning the changes in the various master plans. The results of this research suggest that the changes in the master plans imply a learning process. The discourse analysis supports the idea that the identified learning activities fuel the learning process and up to a certain extent affects the project’s master plan development. Evidence also suggests that learning within HafenCity Hamburg can be seen as a process as well as a product. Learning as a process in HafenCity can be seen as deploying a series of learning activities over time, leading to some durable changes in regard to the development and planning process of HafenCity Hamburg. Learning as a product in HafenCity is the result of the learning process i.e. the consequence of learning, which is the knowledge generated by the learning activities that led to certain changes in the master plans. Besides, it can be concluded that learning within urban area development projects is strongly associated with an adaptive and even reactive learning process resulting in an enduring change in the development and or planning process in regard to the quality of the content, process, and/or individual building projects. Describing the learning process within HafenCity Hamburg implicates that learning is present within spatial development projects and that this exploratory research established a foundation for further research and future explorations in this domain of learning within urban area development.","learning; knowledge; learning process; urban area development; waterfront redevelopment; redevelopment; learning activities; Hafencity; Hamburg; Germany; master plan; spatial planning; knowledge acquisition; knowledge sharing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-06","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Urban Area Development","",""

(mentor); Russchenberg, H.W.J. (mentor); Unal, C.M.H. (mentor)","2012","The goal of this thesis is to investigate the clustering effect of droplets in the water clouds. The initial motivation came from the incapability of millimeter-wave cloud radars to always detect low-level liquid water clouds. The observed discrepancy between the value of radar reflectivity factor estimated by radar measurements and the theoretical one predicted by the standard radar scattering theory set under question the applicability of the incoherent Rayleigh scattering assumption in the case of backscattering from water clouds. A possible reason for the violation of the assumption for incoherent Rayleigh scattering is the formation of clusters inside the cloud volume, which behave as coherent structures. Droplets’ clustering has been investigated through three cases: droplets inside the cloud volume totally correlated form one cluster; droplets inside the cloud volume partially correlated form more than one cluster; droplets inside the cloud volume completely uncorrelated do not form any cluster. The patterns of radar backscattered electric field were visualised in the complex plane by using the Random Walks approach which is a tool for studying the statistical properties of electromagnetic waves backscattered by objects containing few scattering centers. To simulate turbulence inside the cloud volume, four different types of motion for the clusters were introduced. Thus, the turbulence model allows the clusters to shift either horizontally, vertically, towards any direction in 3-dimensional space or rotate about a vertical central axis. The induced velocity and acceleration define clusters’ maximum displacement. The particular motions characterized by the maximum displacement, denote various length scales and intensities of turbulence. The impact of these motions on the pattern of backscattered electric field is investigated for the case of totally correlated droplets which form a single cluster. Low degrees of clustering are explored through the patterns of the radar backscattered electric field, but also from the distribution of power resulting from the coherent summation of the individual backscattered fields. The computational tests showed that the probability density function of coherent power backscattered by n=1, 2, 3 clusters is consistent with the probability density function of the distance from the origin in a single-, two-, three-step isotropic Pearson’s random walk over the two-dimensional phase space respectively. Clusters have been considered in alignment to X-axis, Y-axis, Z-axis or randomly arranged in the cloud volume. An analysis on the statistical properties of the backscattered electric field for different arrangements of clusters inside the cloud volume is presented. The computational results of this research showed that the clustering of droplets results in a radar response which deviates from the one predicted by the standard radar theory. The probability density function of the power backscattered by partially correlated droplets differs from the well-known exponential distribution of completely uncorrelated droplets in the absence of clustering. The systematic discrepancies between the mean coherent and incoherent power imply that radar reflectivity sensitivity of cloud radars may not be sufficient for detecting backscattered signals from water clouds.","droplets clustering; droplets spatial correlation; radar discrepancy; millimeter-wave cloud radar; Pearsons random walk; coherent radar backscatter; water clouds","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Remote Sensing of the Environment","",""

(mentor); Bobbink, I. (mentor)","2012","The invention of technology for land reclamation in the 10th century started a unique transformation in the delta. Sand plates were dike-ed and pumped and became polders. Examples of early harbor cities created on the dike-ring are Ooltgensplaat and Oude Tonge. These cities were founded at the main creek of a sand plate. The polders created a condition for more sediment deposition, due to the hard edges of the dikes. Outside the dike-ring sediment cumulated and formed new sand plates. These sand plates formed the basis of a new adjacent polder and a new harbor settlement. The latest polders date from 1930's, but technically the process came to an end in 1953 with a stop of sediment transportation in the delta. The Watersnoodramp in 1953 led to the engineering of a great and expensive water defense project that would protect the inhabitants of the Southwest Delta against probable storm surges. Shortening the Dutch coast line and closing the Dutch Southwest Delta. However, the Delta Werken caused complications that were not predicted in time of planning and construction. The world known water defenses created environmental problems as blue algae in the Krammer Volkerak, lack of oxygen in the Grevelingenmeer, and the deciline of sand plates and fish migration in all the water bodies. [Programmabureau Zuidwestelijk Delta, 2009] Today, these problems triggered the discussion of re-opening the estuaries of the Dutch Southwest Delta. The graduation project provides research by design on the spatial implementation of the paradigm 'working with nature' in an open Dutch Southwest Delta. The open delta scenario, as proposed by H+N+S (Toekomstbeeld ZW Delta) and WNF (Met Open Armen), gradually restores the delta dynamics in the Krammer Volkerak. The process towards an open delta not only provides a form of the urban landscape. It also contains a new and innovative approach by integrally constituting value in the urban, cultural and natural layer. The new relation of delta cities with water, nature development combined with fresh water storage and day-recreation depict a scenario that sustains the dynamics of a natural delta landscape, social initiative and the improvement of the socio-economic condition of the delta cities Oude Tonge and Ooltgensplaat.

(mentor); Van der Meel, H. (mentor); Koorstra, P. (mentor)","2012","The United Nations Environmental Council, the new, 6th Council, will be in charge for the coordination of sustainability issues, such as waste problems, energy problems and securing biodiversity on the planet, aiming to marshal the existing fragmented running programs (such as UNEP) and coordinate these issues on a global level. In other words, the new UNEC Building will be the center for collecting, producing, propagating and exchanging information on the broad topic of sustainability. United Nations is a none boundary organization. Regardless the location of the new UN headquarters, the new building should manifest one single fact: that it doesn’t acquire its identity by the country that it is being hosted in, but from the whole world. Therefore, it should point out the fact that it is a global building, serving a global purpose. It has to manifest and promote its purpose and not only the general local culture. Furthermore, the building has to co-exist with its surroundings, from both the city side and the waterside, and gain acknowledgement from the public; on the one hand, the presence of the building towards the 1st Avenue should achieve uniformity and continuity with the city of Manhattan. Also, it is very important not to spoil the character of the city. On the other hand, from the river side, the building should become a landmark for the city, since in this way it could manifest both its uniqueness and difference from the rest of Manhattan, giving the intention of a “global building”. Also, the visual continuity from the city to the waterfront is crucial. The new building shouldn’t be standing as an obstacle which is blocking the view and the connection from the city to the river side. At the same time, it should not outshine its colossal neighbors (existing UN etc), but it should have a strong character in order to be able to create a “healthy competition” with its surroundings. On the urban level, the connection of the UN plot with the Manhattan Midtown East grid was crucial. Extending the city within the region of the UN plot results in the creation of a public square that is sheltered from the building itself. This public space, apart from becoming the main entrance area to the building, is very meaningful for the wider city, since Manhattan suffers from the lack of open and public spaces. Furthermore, the UN plot, along with an adjacent open green space, are the only few left open visual connections to the waterfront. In a similar way, preserving an open space from the waterfront to the city was also crucial. By creating a green square on the water side, and extending this square into the core of the building in the form of a courtyard, immediately the building itself becomes the connecting element in the previously fragmented continuity from the city to the water. In this way, the lower volume of the building is actually an intermediate space between two squares of different character, while the floating volume takes the role of the “shelter” to this triple public space. The distinction of the building in two volumes, which corresponds to a distinction between the more public and more private parts of the program, sets the standards for the needed boundaries and security of the building. Openness and spatial continuity are the main qualities of the areas distributed around an open central space connecting the different areas of the building. With its skylights and vertical continuity of the space, the building creates multiple levels of visual interaction. Thus, the value of this graduation project lies in being a design assignment for a project that deals with the question of sustainability from a extremely important stand point, which is not only minimizing the environmental impact of a building, energy consumption, etc; but rather how to coordinate these efforts as well as increase the sustainability awareness of the whole world.","SADD; UNEC; sustainability; United Nations; New York; materialisation; Georgios Siokas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Materialisation","","SADD // Strategic Architectural Design Development","",""

(mentor)","2012","Geological data is often compositional (i.e. positive and sum to unity). The constrained nature of compositional data can lead to severe problems during data analysis. Transforming from the simplex to centered log-ratio (CLR) space can solve these problems, converting constrained non-linear processes into unconstrained linear processes (transforming perturbation and power transformation into addition and multiplication). Using this transformation, techniques were developed to analyze weathering (a compositional process) in the fluvial system. Detailed knowledge of the weathering process will improve reservoir characterization by providing in- sights into the spatial distribution of reservoir rock, provenance regions, basin evolution and composition of sediment at the time of burial (an important input of diagenesis models). To analyze the CLR-transformed compositional data, several methods were developed. The SVD method uses principal component analysis (PCA), singular value decomposition (SVD) and cluster analysis to extract weathering directions from bedload samples (models usually ignore the bedload due to its complicated relation with time and its high level of noise, even though bedload is the main component of reservoir rock in fluvial reservoirs). The pairwise p-vector method combines directional derivatives with simple geological knowledge to obtain weathering directions and drainage patterns. Combined use of both methods creates the best results. The techniques were tested on a dataset including fluvial bedload samples taken in the Orinoco drainage basin. Two different grain type groupings were used; [Q F R] and [Qms Qmu Qp2 Qp3x F R]. To restrict the influence of non weathering processes, mineral groups with deviating densities or shapes were discarded. The developed techniques are able to extract directional information from CLR transformed data, which can provide a prediction of spatial trends in reservoir quality across a fluvial basin. Cluster analysis techniques can divide samples into distinct lithological regions, of which the upstream ones coincide with different provenance regions. The actual flow directions between the different clusters can be reproduced with a fair amount of reliability. A more detailed drainage pattern can be obtained by creating a flow direction vector plot using a grid over the geographical area. The weathering direction can be obtained with a reasonable degree of reliability with the techniques in this thesis (the ranking of elements in the weathering direction vectors, which reflects their durability, is in accordance with geological knowledge). With the weathering direction vector and the created drainage pattern one can start to predict compositional change across a fluvial basin. The results of this thesis contain the first building blocks towards a compositional linear process (CLP) model for reservoir-quality assessment in fluvial systems.","compositional data; weathering; directional data; centered log-ratio transform; fluvial; Orinoco","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

Flood proof expansion in rapidly urbanising delta cities in the Mekong delta: The case of Can Tho","Konings, V.","Meyer, V.J. (mentor); Nijhuis, S. (mentor)","2012","Since 2008, for the first time in history, more than 50% of the world’s population lives in cities. This development can be seen in the Mekong delta in Southern Vietnam, one of the world’s most threatened delta areas related to climate change. This area is experiencing a quick process of urbanisation and economic growth. Meanwhile, large areas in the delta are affected by flooding during the rainy season and suffering from a lack of fresh water shortage in the dry season. This shows that the (Mekong) delta cities are facing a double complexity: Their location in a delta in context to flooding and climate change and secondly, the rapid growth of cities while they face a rapid transformation from a traditional to a modern and globalising society bringing huge social, cultural and economic changes. One characteristic city facing this process is Can Tho situated in the heart of the Mekong delta which will double its population to one million in the coming 20 years. In this graduation project is researched how to find a strategy for the expension of this Mekong delta city as a sustainable example for other Mekong delta cities. To understand the social, spatial and hydraulic problematics of the delta - and more specific for the city Can Tho - several methods are used: the method of the layer approach demonstrates how human intervention transformed the delta landscape to an more urbanised area and how this resulted in problems for the Mekong delta. A spatial-, typological- and hydraulic analysis for Can Tho adresses other location specific issues of Can Tho in order to find the most suitable way of expanding. The layer approach shows how the delta transformed from a water based network to a road based society. Furthermore we see urban sprawl around the large cities, mostly between Ho Chi Minh City and Can Tho, the two largest cities of the delta. This area is also the most fertile agricultural area. While the Mekong delta is one of world’s largest rice producing areas, this urban sprawl could threaten the world food supply in the future. The second layer approach of the urban area of Can Tho shows the current city densification and how nowadays growth leads to the loss of creeks and green space, which results in more flooding by extreme rainfall because rain water can not run off anymore. A spatial analysis of Can Tho makes clear that there is a lack of public space and public green in the city. This results in the fact that streets are the place for all daily activities as markets and terraces and that there is no place left for the pedestrian. The green spaces in the city, like a large university complex, are fenced private domains which are blocking the continuity of the city, showing the first signs of spatial segregation. A lot of riverfronts are blocked by poor housing, industries or resorts, loosing the strong Vietnamese traditional relation between the city and water. The building typology research shows the former rice field allotment structure has a strong impact on the growing urbanisation around Can Tho; the dikes between rice fields are transforming towards roads, keeping the structure of the landscape intact. Furthermore, suburbs are not connected with piping for sanitation or fresh water supply, making rain water and pumped ground water their source of fresh water. The poorest people even use the Mekong water for their ‘fresh’ water supply. Meanwhile, rivers and creeks are used as sewage system and garbage bins in the poorer areas. Hydraulic analysis learned that in the rainy season annual flooding of 50 cm is normal for Can Tho. This flooding occurs by rainfall and a high sea tide and a high discharge upstream from China. In the dry season saline sea water intrudes more and more in the delta. The absence of rain in the dry season increases ground water pumping causing soil subsidence resulting in more flooding. Climate change and urbanisation will result in more extreme hydraulic problems in the future. The proposal to expand Can Tho on a sustainable and climate proof way is based on a new city structure that relates to the existing landscape and the water network. Green public spaces along rebuilt and existing creeks become a new network covering and connecting the whole city. Waterfront development along the Mekong river provides safety for flooding with a ‘delta dike’. With its gentle slope this type of dike will not disturb the relation between water and city. The creeks inside the dikes are locked off from the natural water flow of the Mekong river, these creeks have an enormous potential. Firstly, they improve the drainage capacity to store rain water. Also public spaces along the creeks are designed to be temporally flooded in case of extreme rainfall. Secondly, this creeks are not connected with the polluted Mekong. Water treatment systems make this water suitable for grey water supply in housing making Can Tho, independent from ground water pumping. Thirdly, maintaining a natural water balance will avoid soil subsidence. The already existing landscape rice field structures and a strong local policy will be used to guide the transformation from an agricultural to an urban area. Strategic road building and a proper division of ground lease contracts creates potential to urbanise the rice fields. This model of growth as a cooperation between landscape, urbanism and engineering could be used in more Mekong delta cities answering climate change, avoiding lurking segregation and the maintainance of the local food production. This transformation from water as a threat towards water as an opportunity gives the basis to sustainably expand the Mekong delta cities.","Vietnam; Mekong delta; flooding; climate change; city growth; urban design; Can Tho","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-10","Architecture","Urbanism","","Delta Interventions","",""

Additionally, such flow-structure interaction is a good model for cooling of turbine blades, annealing of plastic and metal sheets, deicing of aircraft systems etc.. Jets are easy to simulate and contain all the constituents necessary for the study of shear flows. The shear-layer instability at the nozzle edge develops into axisymmetric toroidal vortices which magnifies in size and strength downstream of the nozzle.

(mentor); Brunnings, I. (mentor); Haagsman, E. (mentor)","2012","For STEK a new table/desk that fits STEK’s look-and-feel had to be designed. This product should be suitable for longer use (children from 2 till at least 10 years of age) and can either have multiple (totally different) functions, or have a modular character. House visits gave insight in the target group, its habits, routines and needs (related to the use of a desk/table). It was also important to have empathy with the target group. It is evident, that especially after the age of 6, there is a growing need for the child to have a place of its own to retreat, alone or with friends. For children from 2-6, they prefer to have a place to play close to their parents. Design goal: The product provides the child in the age of 2 till 6 a place close to family life. This means that the child can join and watch activities of the parents and vice versa. This without decreasing the usability of the product for a child in the age 6 till 10. The product will have three ways of usability: 1. the use when the child is 2 till 6 2. the use when the child is 6 till 10 3. the transformation For the transformation an interaction vision was formulated: watering a plant’ Watering a plant is a mindless action which leads to a gradual process with a significant different result. The only thing is that you just have to remember to water the plant. Form language analysis showed what features to implement in the product-to-be-designed. These features (most important to STEK) are: - the stereotype look of the side view - the use of geometrical shapes - the 5° angle Related products (desks, in height adjustable desks, modular and multifunctional furniture) showed what ‘good’ and ‘bad’ features are and which are of interest for the product-to-be-designed. Three concept directions were generated: 1. Tables: a cupboard which includes tables with several heights for user in different age groups 2. Table-Couch: product with two functions i.e. a children’s table and a small couch 3. (coffee) tables: this table can be used by the family as a coffee table and by the children as a children’s table Iteration 1: concept direction By involving the user this early in the design process, the eventual result will be more suitable for the user. The goal of this first iteration is to gain the user’s opinion of the three product directions discussed in the previous chapter. The participants considered all three directions as practical. However, the (coffee) table has their preference. The parents like having the children close to them. Furthermore it is practical, due to optimal use of space. Before dismissing one direction, mock-ups of the three are made to make the ideas more tangible and to gain insight in the working principle and the dimensions. Tables was dismissed, due to the double use of material, its size and the fact that the user actually buys half an interior. Moreover, Tables fits the design goal less. For iteration 2 Experience & Use cues, 1:1 cardboard models were made. The goal of the research was to discover if the participant uses the product as expected, how they experience the use of the product in all its functions. After making several adjustments Table-Couch was dismissed, because the positioning of the product in the room was not as expected, not always close the ‘real’ couch. In the couch function, the position was not certain. Therefore this product fits the design goal less. The transformation was also not as mindless as was the case with the coffee table. Since the frequency of transformation is lower, this is not the decisive factor, but of influence on the end decision. Before arriving at the final design, multiple working principles of the (coffee) table were visualized. Decisive factors for the final principle were: - the absence of tilt and therefore the fixed leg of the bench - the two levels as a coffee table - the multiple storages spaces The final design is a coffee table with storage space under the table top (removable drawers are optional). A lower level for the placement of for example the newspaper and magazines is on top of the two benches. The table can be transformed into a children’s table by sliding out the benches. Under the seating area more storage space is present. The prototype is tested with the true target group of STEK; people who appreciate design and are willing to pay for it. The goal in the third iteration: Aesthetics & Use was to discover: - if the participant uses the product as expected - if the aesthetics appeal to them - how much they are willing to pay for it The children could easily teak a seat and all the storage compartments were used. It was obvious how the coffee table could be transformed to a children’s table, but the pushing and pulling did not go very smooth due the guidance method. The participant thought the table fits in the interior due to its neutral look.  500,- would be a fair price according to the participant. After the research the prototype was adjusted. The guidance principle was changed to make the transformation smoother and to have a better connection between the benches.","children's table; multiple function","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial design","","AED & DA","",""

One of them is foreseeing the right information at the right place at the right time during the building life cycle. The aim of this research is to investigate if it is possible to optimise the information streams and if the management process within the building life cycle can be improved with the aid of BIM. This research focuses on two aspects; the fist one is the central and dynamic information administration aspect. The second one is the changes to management due to the implementation of this system. The fact that this trend causes the expected changes in practise is a question that can be asked. To find an answer a clear division will be made within this research, the two topics are Information and Management. These two topics are investigated during a test case at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Two optimal flowcharts will be generated and compared to give an answer to the main research question.

One negative effect stemming from the reduction in size and increased complexity is reduced reliability. This thesis is centered around the matter of fault recovery, in the subject of device fault-tolerance, and graceful system degradation in the presence of hard faults. Using a sparing strategy to re-use functional pipeline stages of faulty cores, we take advantage of the natural redundancy of multi-cores. This is done by the incorporation of a re-configurable network in which the cores of the system sit upon and has the ability to re-direct the data flow from the faulty pipeline stages of damaged cores to spare functional ones. The implementation requires the absence of global signals and thus pipeline stage operation needs to be decoupled. We also develop the bi-directional switch required for the network and implement a 4-core working example of our architecture as proof of concept and to evaluate the design. The 4-core design can guarantee correct functionality with 75% of system non-functional, in the best case scenario. The Defect-Tolerant pipeline has overhead of 1.92% in execution cycles and 14.4% in terms of operating frequency, for our custom made stress-marks. Such a system implemented with un-pipelined interconnect would lead to a pipeline with 50% lower frequency and x 2.1 longer overall execution time when the system has no faults. With our architecture and pipelined interconnect the frequency overhead is reduced by 34% and the overall execution time cost by 28% in the full 4-core system. The total execution time overhead, for our stress-marks, in the complete system ranges from x 1.5 to x 3.8 compared to the baseline, depending on the number of defects in the array. The area overhead is around 69% and power consumption, without incorporating any advanced power saving technique, is estimated between x 4 to x 5 times higher compared to the baseline.","Computer Architecture; Defect-Tolerance; Multi-core; Re-Configurable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

The optimized structure was composed of layers of carbon fiber composite and tungsten foils. For radiation purposes the layers were placed asymmetric around the geometric midplane, resulting in shape distortions due to residual thermal stresses from the curing process. These shape distortions were kept to a minimum. The validity of the theoretical models was assessed by means of testing for shape distortions, radiation attenuation, bonding strength and electrical resistivity. The bonding of the tungsten with the prepreg material was found to be problematic, but an improvement in lap shear strength was found with respect to methods proposed in the literature. A chemical etching surface treatment with a reduced etching time of one minute was proposed for the tungsten foils.","multidisciplinary; optimization; composite; space; enclosure; tungsten; surface treatment; SIDER; induced shape distortions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Design, Integration & Operations","","Design, Integration and Operations of Aircraft and Rotorcraft","",""

The numerical procedure followed is similar to Zhou et al [1999]. The two eddies were found to merge into a single stronger eddy in case of a larger upstream and a smaller downstream eddy placed within a certain initial stream-wise separation distance. Subsequently, the resulting stronger eddy was observed to auto-generate new eddies.

The presence of methane influences fluid properties and fluid flow in the well, leading to changes in the pressure and temperature drop in the producing well. This study presents a model for non-isothermal two-phase flow in geothermal wells. In this model, two-phase flow regimes and their corresponding temperature and pressure drop calculations are coupled. The pressure drop, temperature drop and the flow regime are calculated for different well parameters for the Ammerlaan field. The simulation results are used to give a general overview of optimal well diameter and well inflow rate. Furthermore, the impact of two-phase flow regimes is shown in these simulations. We found that for a larger well diameter, pressure drop decreases. Pressure drop increases drastically when slug or even churn flow is reached. Smaller well inflow leads to a decrease in pressure drop. Based on the simulation results, the optimal combination of a well diameter of 0,3 meter and well inflow of 40 kg/s are found for the Ammerlaan field. Besides Ammerlaan, other fields with different salinity and gas contents are investigated in terms of pressure and temperature drop for two-phase flow in a geothermal well. It is found that fields with a low salinity and low gas content are more favorable for geothermal production.","geothermal; heat loss; pressure loss; two-phase flow","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

In order to be able to sustain this population number and afford a further growth, humankind has to radically change the way we produce, process and consume food. The current food production system abuses the natural environment in a multitude of ways. Ranging from soil deterioration to the draining of fossil fuel and the consequent CO2 production and climate change effect, the issues that food production causes are complex and interconnected. AgroCity is examining possible solutions to this series of challenges. Looking into different approaches as sources of inspiration, AgroCity is revisiting old methods of agriculture and combines them with new technologies and innovation. Further into the food chain, other aspects are examined to some extend: food processing, storage, water and waste management are some examples. In terms of design, AgroCity is using a bottom up approach, starting from the needs of one person. It illustrates how space efficiency increases when food production becomes collective. The result of this study is an optimum size of communities. This optimum size changes also according to the diet ingredients. Diet changes are also proposed, as an effort to assure a healthy, nutritionally dense diet in a much smaller space than we are used to. AgroCity is organizing the different elements used throughout this new food chain into a “Toolbox”. Using modular designs that can easily be combined with each other, AgroCity offers a catalogue of growing, processing and preserving units that can be added as “plug ins” to the dwelling units or other urban program. This way, even existing cities could be transformed into food production machines, by taking advantage of empty spaces. AgroCity is attempting to be a highly sustainable, space efficient, “user friendly” alternative to the current food chain, giving back to the people the power to feed themselves and know what they eat.","urban farming; architecture; food production; i-crates","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architecture","","The Why Factory","",""

By a desire to place these infrastructure as efficient as possible, meaning the trough flow and the building cost/time, these are constructed (location and dimension) without any concern to its adjacent context. The regulations and the dimension of big scale infrastructure make the direct adjacent area difficult to be developing by urban planners and designers. As a result these spaces develop by private initiatives and are developed without the supervision of a spatial organisation or concept. By this an urban fabric formed that mainly is oriented on the car users and hold great obstacles for pedestrian and bicyclist (to gather, travel and hold activities). By this they function as a gap within the urban life of a city, lacking the vitality, connectivity and attractiveness to function as a proper part within the city. This thesis researches the area residual to the A20 and the railroads between Rotterdam central, Schiedam central and Rotterdam Alexander. The area is located between the social-economic weak neighbourhoods of Spangen, Oud Mathenesse, Overschie and Nieuwe Westen. By their location adjacent to infrastructure these hold an autonomous structures, making these isolated island within the city.

Hence, maximum power point trackers, or MPPTs for short, are an indispensable component, since these devices provide one with the capability to fully maximize the achievable power from solar cells in a system. A symbol of the greener world that is evolving around us is the biannual World Solar Challenge, where state-of-the-art solar powered cars race against one another through the deserts of Australia. This thesis forms the link between these two elements: to design an MPPT optimally suited towards the requirements of the Nuna Solar Car. Commercially available MPPTs are not particularly well suited for the specific demands of such a bleeding edge race. They are mostly designed for high power or low voltage systems. The MPPT designed during this thesis is optimized for high efficiency and other requests stated by the Nuon Solar Team members. The design of the MPPT has been split into several parts. This thesis is focused on the converter within the MPPT. It presents the result of research, design exploration, simulation and testing. The results obtained with the prototype that has been built show the designs correctness and conformance to the requirements, with an efficiency of up to 98,5%.","MPPT; Maximum Power Point Tracker","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2013-10-10","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","Bachelor EE","",""

(mentor); Hendriks, M.A.N. (mentor); Giardina, G. (mentor); Pasterkamp, S. (mentor)","2012","Recent tunnelling projects have received a great amount of media attention due to settlement induced damage. Due to the simplified approach of existing risk assessment methods, a new assessment system is in development, which can account for three-dimensional structural aspects of buildings. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of the position and geometry of masonry buildings on the development of damage, while undergoing tunnelling induced settlements. In line with previous research, three-dimensional finite element analyses are used as a tool to perform a parametric study. A parametric study consists of an evaluation of the parameters position, aspect-ratio, grouping and orientation. The position parameter is divided into three characteristics: the sagging zone, a combined settlement profile and the hogging zone. The aspect-ratio parameter is also divided into three characteristics: shallow buildings, square buildings and deep buildings. The grouping effect parameter also distinguishes three characteristics: small and large isolated buildings and grouped buildings. The orientation parameter includes seven different increasing angles of the building main axis with respect to the tunnelling axis. The maximum measured crack width in the buildings gives input for a classification of damage, according the system of Burland et al. (1977). An average trend in the damage classification indicates the sensitivity to tunnelling induced settlements of the parameters. Both during and after tunnelling, a position of the building in the combined settlement profile appears to be the most sensitive to differential settlements. Buildings far away from the tunnelling axis generally obtain no more than slight damage. Structures with a low aspect-ratio seem on average to obtain equal amounts of damage as buildings with an aspect-ratio of 1. Structures with a higher aspect-ratio are less affected, both during and after tunnelling. Grouping of the buildings seems to be an influential parameter. Small isolated buildings obtain far less damage than large or grouped buildings. In relation to the numerical analyses, the empirical Limiting Tensile Strain Method (LTSM) seems to overestimate the damage for an isolated small building, but underestimate the damage in large or grouped buildings. For buildings in the sagging zone, a building with a low orientation angle is the least sensitive to differential settlement, while the maximum measured crack width increases by increasing the angle. The difference in maximum crack width can grow to a factor 3. A building in the combined settlement profile or in the hogging zone displays opposite behaviour. Cases with low orientation angles are the most susceptible to damage, while increasing the angle to 90 degrees lowers the maximum measured crack width. The difference in results can grow up to a factor 2.","tunnelling; settlement damage; LTSM; FEM; damage assessment; masonry; FEA; 3D finite element analysis; tunnel alignment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Brink, W.M. (mentor)","2012","7T MRI-scanners kunnen met de huidige technieken nog niet nauwkeurig genoeg getriggerd worden voor het uitvoeren van scans van hoge kwaliteit. In opdracht van het LUMC is er daarom een project opgestart om een systeem te ontwerpen dat biomedische signalen kan meten, verwerken en versturen om de 7T MRI-scanner te kunnen triggeren. Er zijn drie tweetallen aan de slag gegaan om een sensorsysteem, een signaalbewerkingsysteem en een draadloos transmissiesysteem te ontwerpen. In deze thesis is het ontwerp van een elektronisch signaalbewerkingsysteem beschreven. Dit systeem moest een analoog sensorsignaal digitaliseren met een hoge signaalruisverhouding (SNR) zodat het geschikt is om een MRI-scanner te kunnen triggeren, en 12 uur lang kunnen werken op een batterij. Door een andere projectgroep is een akoestische sensor ontwikkeld zodat er op basis van een akoestisch cardiogram getriggerd kan worden. Het sensorsignaal wordt echter ernstig verstoord door het lawaai dat de MRI-scanner produceert. De magnetische velden en radiofrequente straling die de MRI-scanner gebruikt, vormen een andere storingsbron waarmee rekening gehouden moet worden. De uitdaging was dus om deze verstoringen zo goed mogelijk te filteren en een zo groot mogelijke SNR te realiseren. Om het sensorsignaal met een goede SNR digitaal aan te bieden, is een systeem ontworpen dat bestaat uit een analoog filter, een analoog-digitaalomzetter en een digitaal filter. Het analoge filter is een 3e orde Chebyshev II filter, de AD-omzetter is een MCP3201 en het digitale filter bestaat uit een polyphase decimatiefilter en een FIR-laagdoorlaatfilter met een orde van 55.","7T MRI; signaalverwerking; signaalbewerking; analoge filters; Electronical Engineering; digitale filters; Chebychev; AD omzetter; akoestisch","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

(mentor); Quist, J.N. (mentor)","2012","The Master’s programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology. Over the last few years the general awareness concerning sustainability increased significantly. Also companies are making big efforts to make their processes and products more sustainable. One of the key concepts in this search to more sustainable processes is the concept of Sustainable Development which is often defined as development that 'meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs'. A concept within Sustainable Development which is often used is the Triple Bottom Line, which indicates the three pillars of sustainability: people, planet and profit. Within companies Management Systems focussed on environmental or social aspects are used to manage sustainability topics. These Sustainability Frameworks are used to identify and manage topics related to the sustainable performance of companies. Three major concepts within the management of Sustainable Development are Corporate Social Responsibility, Environmental Management System and Environmental and Social Reporting. An overview of a large number of available sustainability frameworks, as well as their properties has been made. The Capability Maturity Model is a model which is used in a wide variety of industries to indicate the maturity of different capabilities for processes within an organization. Based on the outcomes of the model the organization can improve its processes to disciplined management processes. The main advantages of a Capability Maturity Model are increase of business success, increase of cost effectiveness, possibility to combine with other technologies such as ISO standards, used in wide-variety of industries, long life-span and a good reputation among government and research institutes. Within this research the concept of the Capability Maturity Model has been combined with insights from the field of Sustainable Development in order to improve business performance in a sustainable manner, the Sustainable Development Maturity Model. The following components have been identified as essential for building a new Capability Maturity Model: A number of levels, General descriptor of each level, Generic description of the contents and characteristics of each capability level, A number of Key Performance Areas or dimensions, A number of topics and activities for each Key Performance Area, A description of each activity as it might be executed or performed at each maturity level. Six levels for the Sustainable Development Maturity Model have been defined based on existing definitions in other Capability Maturity Models and insights from the field of Sustainable Development. Level 0 indicates compliance to regulation and is a bottom-line requirement. For level 1 to level 5 generic definitions for the levels have been made containing contents and characteristics of the level as well as a generic descriptor for the levels. These descriptors are respectively: Initial, Initial Transformation, Light Sustainability, Sustainable Transformation and Reinforced Sustainability. A scoring system has been developed to indicate the correlation between the different layers of the system. The score of the different topics can be filled in at layer 5. The lowest score of the topics results in the score for the activity. The average score for the activity result in the score for the Key Sustainability Areas, unless there is a score 0, then it will result in a score 0. The lowest score for the Key Sustainability Areas result in the score for the framework (or the condition). The sensitivity of the scoring, which means the influence of a certain score on the end-result, has been tested using several cases. The information on the above mentioned frameworks have been expanded with information from its websites and quantitative information from websites as www.springerlink.com. From this list of frameworks three different frameworks have been selected for use in the Sustainable Development Maturity Model, one for every main category of conditions (Worker, Social and Environmental). By using knock-out criteria the number of frameworks was reduced to 8 (ISO 14001, ISO 26000, EMAS, OHSAS 18001, SA8000, AA1000, the Natural Step and Global Reporting Initiative). By looking to the background of the frameworks as well as the popularity of the frameworks ISO 14001, ISO 26000 and SA8000 have been selected for the Sustainable Development Maturity Model for respectively Environmental Conditions, Social Conditions and Worker Conditions. From the selected frameworks Key Sustainability Activities and Activities belonging have been identified. It appeared that a number of Key Sustainability Activities was overlapping and thus choice have been made to exclude certain aspects to prevent doubles. For all Activities definitions have been made as well as a descriptor for each Activity. For the Social Conditions also definitions have been made for the Topics as well as a descriptor for the Topics to show that it is possible to work on this level of detail within the Sustainable Development Maturity Model. The found Key Sustainability Areas and Activities have been validated using publications of several well-performing companies (by means of sustainable performance). As soon as the maturity of an organization for different aspects has been determined the organization may decide to work on certain aspects. For this several practices in order to improve the maturity of the organization have been suggested. Within this research changes for three different fields of organizational improvement have been suggested: firstly an overview of aspects to improve the organizational performance of an organization, secondly the improvement of organizational processes, including a new organizational structure and thirdly by looking to the organizational learning processes. A reflection of how these practices can be used have been given as well as an overview of how aspects to improve the organizational performance can specifically be used to improve the performance of an activity or topic from one level to another. Finally a concept version of the model has been made using Microsoft Excel showing that it is possible to build the model with previous steps. A reflection has been given on the use of the model and on the challenges and limitations as identified in the introduction of the thesis. A total overview of the model in one figure has been given showing the relation between the different steps. This thesis ends with the conclusion that it is possible possible to combine insights from the field of the Capability Maturity Model with insights from the field of Sustainable Development. In further research the Sustainable Development Maturity Model should be further developed and it should be determined if the model has an added value for the sustainable management and performance of an organization.","Sustainable Development; ISO 14000; ISO 14001; Corporate Social Responsibility; Industrial Ecology; Environmental Management; Capability Maturity Model; ISO 26000; SA8000; Management of Sustainability; Organizational Development; KPA's","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-09-01","Applied Sciences","Multi-Scale Physics","","Industrial Ecology","",""

In a broad sense, the aim of this study is to gain a better understanding in how non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can set a community-based legacy in a recovery period for long-term socioeconomic development of an urban area. The focus is on a NGO responsible for resettling disaster victims in the recovery period, participating communities in a larger frame of urban area development. It thereby aims to understand how an initial recovery response can be part of the strategy that improves the urban structure, understand the way in which NGOs govern their program and what is needed to make it locally embedded through capacity building in communities for further development. With this, the research question is: What community-based strategy can a NGO uphold in post-disaster recovery, that sets the base for long-term socioeconomic development of an urban area? The motivation for this study is the increased vulnerability of low-income communities in developing countries towards natural disasters and the actions taken in post-disaster recovery. Globalization has changed the way of governing these enquiries and made them increasingly complex. A variety of foreign organizations and institutions simultaneously aim to implement programs and projects; resulting in a loss of efficiency and potential mismatch between them and local stakeholders. The lack of incorporating local perspectives into decisions and activities has ensured that new proposals are not location specific and decreases the effectiveness consequently. Long-term redevelopment has thereby become increasingly dependent on the agenda of the foreign actors and their resources. Yet, NGOs are present only temporary. As a result, recovery outputs stays short-term with little connection to redevelopment.","urban emergencies; post-disaster redevelopment; community-based governance; capacity building; urban area development; NGOs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-09","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Explorelab","",""

The physical interventions have to help for enhancement of livability of the area and socio-economic position of the residents in the developing areas. The interventions should allow local communities to maintain their existing social networks and communities, and improve their sense of belonging to their environment. There might also be issues, which are not to be solved by physical interventions, but they are also important for sustainable regeneration of an area.

De rol van de ontwikkelaar is onzeker geworden en zijn focus is verschoven naar de afzetmarkt. Nu de klant het meer voor het zeggen heeft, wordt het belangrijker om marktkennis vroeg in het ontwikkelingsproces te betrekken. De nieuwe ontwikkelaar moet zelf de consument verleiden en met nieuwe producten komen. Het betekent ook een actievere rol voor de eindgebruiker; ook hij moet een prominentere plaats aan de voorkant van het proces krijgen. Met dit onderzoek is gekeken hoe die betrokkenheid van de eindgebruiker vorm gegeven kan worden, zonder dat de ontwikkelaar buiten spel wordt gezet. Vandaar ook dat er gezocht is naar de manier waarop eindgebruikerparticipatie als commercieel marketinginstrument ingezet kan worden, met de nadruk op commercieel: om de woningen beter verkoopbaar te maken en zo het afzetrisico voor de ontwikkelaar te verkleinen. Op basis van literatuuronderzoek is een theorie ontwikkeld. De theorie bestaat uit drie modellen, die van elkaar verschillen in degene die participeert in het proces: expert, representatieve vertegenwoordiger en de eindgebruiker zelf. Middels case studieonderzoek is de theorie verrijkt, met onder andere de toepassingsvoorwaarden van de modellen.

(mentor); Van der Voordt, D.J.M. (mentor)","2012","De ziekenhuissector heeft de afgelopen decennia een enorme transformatie doorgemaakt. De transformatie is het gevolg van een groot scala aan ontwikkelingen die hebben plaatsgevonden. De mijlpaal binnen de ontwikkelingen ligt in 2006, door de verandering in de wet- en regelgeving. Zo is de oude Wet Ziekenhuisvoorzieningen (WZv) geleidelijk vervangen door de Wet Toelating Ziekenhuisinstellingen (WTZi). Deze verandering heeft een grote impact op de zorgsector en hoe ziekenhuizen heden ten dagen kunnen inspelen op de voortdurende beweging binnen deze sector. Door de invoering van de nieuwe wet- en regelgeving zijn de zorginstelling vanaf 2009 zelf verantwoordelijk geworden voor de investering in eigen vastgoed en apparatuur, maar lopen daarentegen meer risico’s. Met de WTZi wil de overheid de marktwerking versterkten en ontstaat er de mogelijkheid om winst te maken als zorginstelling. Een ander neveneffect van de invoering WTZi is de geleidelijke deregulering van het College bouw zorginstellingen (Cbz), want onder invloed van het Cbz en het Ministerie van Volksgezondheid Welzijn Sport (VWS) was de keuze voor bouwcontractvorm beperkt tot de traditionele vorm. Hierdoor was er nauwelijks flexibiliteit voor een andere contactvorm, waardoor de innovatie significant werd gestagneerd. Naast de invoering van de WTZi, hebben er op ander vlakken ontwikkelingen gemanifesteerd. Zo is de gezondheidssector voortdurend in beweging. De medische en medisch-biologische ontwikkelingen volgen elkaar in rap tempo op en leiden tot veranderende inzichten en behandelingswijzen. De ontwikkelingen binnen de informatie- en communicatietechnologie (ICT) zijn aanleiding geweest om te komen tot veranderingen in de bedrijfsprocessen. Op sociaal-maatschappelijke en demografische gebied hebben de ontwikkelingen grote invloed gehad op de fabricatiemethodiek(en) van ziekenhuizen, dus ook op de manier waarop de gezondheidszorg wordt georganiseerd. Tevens is de mondigheid van zowel opdrachtgever, gebruiker als patiënt toegenomen, omdat zij zich bewuster zijn van hun behoeften door intensivering van zelfkennis. De voorgenoemde ontwikkelingen hebben tot gevolg dat ziekenhuizen steeds omvangrijker en complexer worden en dat organisaties zich hierop in hoog tempo moeten aanpassen, maar door lange doorlooptijden kunnen gebouwen niet adequaat op deze behoeften inspelen. Als de stap naar nieuwbouw of renovatie is gezet, kan het bouwproces wel 10 tot 15 jaar duren. Hierdoor is op het moment van oplevering sprake van een verouderd zorgconcept en dus een gedateerd gebouw. Het algehele negatieve effect van deze ontwikkelingen is dat vandaag de dag opdrachtgevers en gebruikers steeds vaker ontevreden zijn met het eindproduct, omdat het na oplevering simpelweg niet voldoet aan hun behoeften. De sleutel tot het inspelen op de voorgenoemde discrepanties ligt bij het programmeren. Met name het toekomstgericht programmeren kan na de invoering van de nieuwe wet- en regelgeving een uitkomst zijn.","programmawijzigingen; programmeren; ziekenhuis; contractvorm; Meander Medisch Centrum; Gemini Ziekenhuis; Wet Toelating Zorginstellingen","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Design and Construction Management","",""

(mentor); Knott, P. (mentor)","2012","The use of radars in detecting low flying, small targets is being explored for several decades now. However radar with counter-stealth abilities namely the passive, multistatic, low frequency radars are in the focus recently. Passive radar that uses Digital Video Broadcast Terrestrial (DVB-T) signals as illuminator of opportunity is a major contender in this area. A DVB-T based passive radar requires the development of an antenna array that performs satisfactorily over the entire DVB-T band. At Fraunhofer FHR, there is currently a need for an array antenna to be designed for operation over the 450-900 MHz range with wideband beamforming and null steering capabilities. This would add to the ability of the passive radar in detecting covert targets and would improve the performance of the system. The array should require no mechanical adjustments to inter-element spacing to correspond to the DVB-T carrier frequency used for any particular measurement. Such an array would have an increased flexibility of operation in different environment or locations. The design of such an array antenna and the applied techniques for wideband beamforming and null steering are presented in the thesis. The interaction between the inter-element spacing, the grating lobes and the mutual couplings had to be carefully studied and an optimal solution was to be reached at that meets all the specifications of the antenna array for wideband applications. Directional beams, nulls along interference directions, low sidelobe levels, polarization aspects and operation along a wide bandwidth of 450-900 MHz were some of the key considerations.","conformal array antenna; wideband beamforming; passive radar; null steering; polarization; mutual coupling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

(mentor); Nicholls, R. (mentor)","2012","Bangladesh, located on the northern littoral of the Bay of Bengal, is one of the most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change and sea level rise. Agriculture is the prime economic activity in the densely populated coastal areas of the country. During the dry season of the year (November to April), when rainfall is low, the irrigation is done by extracting groundwater. Over the years this continuous groundwater pumping causes the depletion of groundwater table. Due to the proximity to the sea, the lowering of groundwater initiates saltwater intrusion into the coastal aquifers and this affects the crop production significantly. The objective of this project was to establish generic models to evaluate the inter-relationships among different cropping patterns, irrigation requirements, groundwater recharge and saltwater intrusion in the south-west coastal region of Bangladesh. The models were initially used to analyze the current situation and then future predictions were also made by considering climate change and sea level rise in the future. Crop Irrigation models were established in CROPWAT by using CLIMWAT climate data for two meteorological stations in the area (i.e. Khulna and Barisal). Two cropping patterns were considered, i.e. rice cultivation throughout the year and mixed cultivation of rice and vegetables. Crop water requirements (CWR), Irrigation required (IR) and groundwater recharge were calculated. Groundwater modelling was done in MODFLOW and the changes of groundwater head were observed. The distance of landward saltwater intrusion from the shoreline for pumping groundwater was determined by particle tracking method and the safe distance of wells from the sea was calculated for present condition. Future predictions for these were also made by considering climate change and sea level rise. The analysis showed that mixed cultivation of rice and vegetables increase the groundwater recharge. This cropping pattern also reduces the extent of saltwater intrusion inland. As a result the loss of cultivable land due to groundwater salinity problem is less. For future scenarios, as a consequence of climate change, the analysis reveled that groundwater recharge will be higher in the future due to increase of total annual rainfall. However, if the farmers cultivate rice and vegetables jointly, there is a possibility that in the future the recharge will be so high that it may elevate the groundwater table very close to the ground surface. This will initiate the problem of water logging in the lands. It was also found from the analysis that in Barisal, the safe distance of irrigation wells from the sea to avoid saltwater intrusion will be same in present time as well as in the year 2100. However, for Khulna, this distance will not remain the same.","Sea Level Rise; Saltwater Intrusion; Groundwater; Climate Change; Bangladesh; Agriculture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

To overcome this problem the hotel rates are cached, but due to the fact that the suppliers will not send notifications of price changes it is a challenging task to keep the cache up to date. Analysis of the problem of how to improve the cache’s performance, in terms of accuracy and coverage, led to the conclusion that there is no single risk-free overall solution, but that the cache should be enhanced in a step-wise manner minimizing the (financial) impact of a faulty enhancement. The Enhancement Cycle is defined as a number of stages that each step-wise enhancement will go through. The system provides a solution for two of those stages. The system measures the cache performance in a correct manner and predicts the expiration time for a hotel rate. The system uses Complex Event Processing to detect the patterns needed to do the measurements. The system has been generalized and is extended with a Domain Specific Language for a low-effort application to other problems. The system is running in production and processes millions of messages a day. It aggregates and compresses the measurement data without loosing expressivity and its predictions improved the cache’s accuracy.","complex event processing; cep; domain specific language; dsl; streaming data; regression; cache","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-02","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Web Information Systems","",""

(mentor)","2012","Hong Kong for me is a fascinating city; it embodies many contradictory conditions while at the same time acts as a palimpsest -- a readable, but layered, whole. The city exists as a lamination of eastern and western forces that can be seen in both the social and built environment of the city. As the city has grown and become wealthier, these contradictions have intensified, and become increasingly asserted onto the built environment. As a result, a growing asymmetry exists between globalized space and local spaces. Such is the case with the site I have chosen, as 40 storey high-rise towers are being constructed within an existing fabric of 4-7 storey shop houses. For the design, I was inspired by the contradictory conditions mentioned above. The starting point for my research was in the most general sense a study of residential typology. I began with an analysis of the existing neigbourhood fabric to see which typologies were most common and what the specific characteristics of each type are. From this, I was motivated to investigate the forces which catalysed change in typology, many of which were related to demographic [population] and economic changes. Furthermore, research into the relationship between architecture and typology lead me to question the role of the luxury high-rise residential tower given the growing wealth disparity and increasing need for affordable housing in the city centre. Continuing along with the theme of typology, I began to investigate some traditional Chinese dwelling typologies such as the tu lou and siheyuan as a starting point for the design work. The courtyard house [siheyuan] was the most interesting because of the gradation of privacy embedded in the architectural layout. The courtyard house then became the basis for the design, and the public/private relationship was flipped to the vertical in order to develop the formal nature of the building. This reconceptualization of the courtyard house provides a new alternative to the isolated high-rise typologies prevalent in Hong Kong and infuses public space, green space and flexible dwelling typologies into the design.","architecture; asia; dwelling; mixed-use; typology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-30","Architecture","Architecture","","DSD Architecture Thinking","",""

However, the COTS parts are not originally designed to withstand the space radiation environment. Traditional fault-tolerance practices rely on expensive radiation tests or are based on circuit-level knowledge which are not easily available. This work proposes a novel simulation-based statistical approach to assist the satellite designers in performing OBC fault-tolerance analysis. The presented novel approach is based on high-level system modeling and an object-oriented fault injection mechanism. Such a technique allows the comparison between fault-tolerance techniques and reveals the consequences of radiation effects in the COTS parts at early development stages. The work covers the implementation of the proposed simulation framework which includes the OBC and fault modeling. The fault models are based on the conducted radiation environment analysis. The range of software and hardware fault detection and mitigation techniques are investigated as case studies. They include time and hardware Triple-Modular Redundancy, FPGA-based memory scrubbing with Hamming encoding, and watchdog/co-processor monitoring. The case studies reveal that the proposed approach can be used to choose suitable fault-tolerance techniques, increase their efficiency, and reduce the required hardware resources.

(mentor); Hallack, M. (mentor)","2012","The EU is currently undertaking key regulatory reforms to accomplish the Internal Gas Market. The European objective is to complete the EU gas market integration. A crucial element of such reforms is creating an appropriate environment based on two focuses: modernize and expand the European energy infrastructure. Precisely, special attention is paid to link national networks by creating cross-border infrastructure in order to achieve the EU energy policy objectives: competitiveness, sustainability and security of supply. However, there are some difficulties that must be overcome. Between them, the lack incentives to invest in cross-border infrastructure due to the uncertainties in the future energy outlook and the financial risks attached to them. With the aim of encouraging different participants to invest in gas infrastructure, the EC and some Gas Regulatory Authorities have formulated a number of infrastructure development plans. Nevertheless, there is a need for designing new incentives and mechanisms to obtain the required level of investment. Then, Open Season is viewed as a key decision making Investment mechanism based on market preferences where the capacity is allocated ex-ante. The question that rises up is if it is reliable to trust on the market for the decision-making process. The analysis of the Open Season is based on a case study in this thesis. It is the case of the Open Season between Spain and France, where a lot of participants take place on it (TSOs and regulatory authorities from both countries, third parties interested, etc.). It is a representative case since the gas consumption in Spain and France is the 17% of the EU. Spain is connected with Algeria and France with numerous European countries. However, there is a light link between them despite potential advantages that a stronger interconnection may offer: access of inner EU countries to LNG capacity and Supply diversification. The main recognized problem is that the pricing system is different in each country. The postage stamp is established in Spain while France is based on an entry-exit system. Then, is the open season a reliable mechanism for investment under the EU framework? The analysis will conclude arguing that the Open Season may be an efficient investment mechanism in a more homogenous European market. However, the differences between the national markets do not give enough room for Open Season under the current European framework. A higher level of centralization for investment decisions is needed (i.e. European central planning on investment).","open season; gas infrastructure; cross-border investment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","In this report I present the results from the mathematical analysis of a model neuronal network introduced by Ermentrout and Curtu, extended to two space dimensions. The model can be seen as a simple model of a cortical sheet that describes the firing rate activity of two populations of neurons coupled together, one excitatory that displays linear adaptation and the other one inhibitory. The dynamics of the activity is described by a system of nonlocal partial integro-differential equations in which a nonlinear sigmoidal shaped firing rate function is included. The (synaptic) coupling between the neurons is characterized by local excitation and long range inhibition. Running numerical simulations with this model shows that a travelling hexagonal activity pattern is a stable solution of the model given certain sets of values for the parameters of the model. During this project I have investigated the mechanism behind the formation of these patterns as solutions of the model. The results from this investigation are presented in this report. In order to investigate the mechanism I have used methods from nonlinear dynamical systems, pattern formation and bifurcation theory to analyze the model. I started by performing a linear stability analysis around the uniform quiescent state of the model (which is stable before the bifurcation points). From this analysis I could deduce the different types of bifurcation that could take place in the model. I decided to focus on the analysis of the Hopf bifurcation in order to investigate which types of spatio-temporal hexagonal pattern can be obtained in the model as a consequence of this type of bifurcation. Subsequently I performed a singular perturbation analysis to obtain the general solution of the model corresponding to spatio-temporal hexagonal activity patterns. Then I determined equilibrium solutions of this general solution which correspond with a travelling hexagonal activity pattern and a stationary, regularly oscillating hexagonal activity pattern. By finding these solutions through this analysis, it has become clear what the overall mechanism is behind their formation and why these solutions behave the way they do. Due to the fact that the stability of the trivial solution is lost at pure imaginary pairs of eigenvalues, spatio-temporal patterns can start bifurcating from the uniform quiescent state of the model. The exact shape of the function used to describe the coupling between the neurons in the model determines the shape of the activity patterns that can form in the model and the nonlinear sigmoidal shaped firing rate function prevents the solutions from growing without bounds. The exact values of the parameters of the model determine the stability of the activity patterns. It is interesting to note that the oscillating hexagonal activity pattern is a solution I've never found in numerical simulations. Due to a lack of time at present and the complexity of the problem at hand I have not been able to determine the exact stability conditions on the parameters of the model for each of the two found equilibrium solutions. However, an algorithm is presented to determine these conditions. With these stability conditions it must be possible to also find the oscillating pattern as a stable solution in numerical simulations with the model.","Model Neuronal Network; Firing Rate Model; Turing-Hopf Bifurcation; Singular Perturbation Analysis; Pattern Formation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2012-03-13","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","Mathematical Physics","",""

(mentor); Özcan Vieira, E. (mentor)","2012","1.Assignment In deliberation with Miele and the TU Delft an assignment was formulated for this graduation project, focusing on a new oven concept. The title of the assignment is: The oven, rebirth of the communal social center within a household 1.1 Introduction The oven, stove or fireplace has been the central meeting place within living areas for over thousands of years. This is the place where people get together and the communal food is prepared. Next to the primary function of heating food, the oven also generates warmth, light and smell, which provides comfort, protection, coziness and intimacy. For centuries the food preparation in the common home took place within the main living area. Over the last two centuries the preparation started to take place within a separated area, the kitchen. In the 50’s the first serving hatches were introduced, having the living and cooking area partly connected by a small opening in the wall. It has only been for the last ten years that the new trend of open-plan-living has fully submerged the cooking and living area once again. In the foreseeable future this trend is expected to increase even more in popularity. 1.2 Problem definition Currently the oven is still a place where people get together. It is a place within households where people work together and create their food. The communal activity bonds people. It can vary from preparing a quick lasagna together, to baking cookies on Sunday. Because of the social aspect people have positive association and memories about being together, the baking smells, the warmth etc. Despite of all this, the oven as a product, has often lost its central position within households, especially compared to its position a century ago. Nowadays most ovens are electric, build-in and lack the atmospheric qualities that for example wood-fired stoves have. The oven is often purely designed on its baking functionalities and rarely responds or does not respond at all to all the potential user-product interactions. The oven has so much potential to interact with its users. It is one of the few products that stimulates a process that involves all the human senses. Currently there is not really an oven on the market that reacts to this. The new trend of open-plan-living puts the oven in the centre of the living area once again, asking for a social communal role of the oven. Having the kitchen and living area within one room, means that products should fit two different sets of interactions. The ''living'' aspect demands a new vision on interaction and therefore an entirely new type of oven. 1.3 Project goal The goal is to reestablish the central communal role of the oven within households, with an innovative concept. The oven should be designed to fit a combined ''cooking'' and ''living'' environment. It should increase the frequency of oven use and the level of social activity. The interaction with the new concept should have more affinity with all the senses that are involved in the usage.","oven; household","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Talking about the great dilemmas of the modern world like pollution, over population and resource depletion we are also confronted with them in daily life at a lower level. For instance people in the train who love to listen to load music through their headphones and in mean time force many travelers surrounding to ‘enjoy’ the music as well. Or people who are always late for a meeting and let the rest wait because they think their time is very important and scare. Dilemmas like these are always resulting of a conflict of interest between the individual and the collective. The individual acts with short-term self-focused interest, while the society is better served with long-term collective-focused behavior. It is very convenient for me to throw my gum at the street instead of in the bin, but if we all act this way the streets will be covered with gum, which attracts more waste on the longer term. However, if I throw my gum at the street, I first of all act without thinking and second of all act without realizing the consequences on the longer term. As most of our behavior, some psychologists say even 99%, also this behavior is the result of unaware brainwork. Not the awareness but the unawareness is the master in our brains. So if most of our behavior is caused the unawareness, why are products like conventional campaigns focusing on changing the behavior in an aware way. If we want to change the behavior of people in social dilemmas we have to do it by approaching the unawareness, not by means of any text or sign, but by means of products. Since products have proven to influence our behavior without us even realizing it, why are we not applying this power in situations of social dilemmas jet? Should designers not take their responsibility and do ‘good’ for society? Besides applying our knowledge and capabilities in the commercial world, I suggest we apply it in the world cooping with social dilemmas. Many examples in the world of marketing are based on attacking the unawareness. The many researches done on the influence of different colors and shapes on the behavior of people or the regulations the government implies on clandestine advertising and priming, show how much we can influence people by the unawareness. This is how the hypothesis of this research comes to existence: Design products are more effective in influencing behavior in social dilemmas than conventional campaigns with signs and written text are. To examine if this hypothesis is true an experiment is set up where by means of two products based on design and two products based on signs and text are included. At the central canteen of the Haagse Hogeschool, every product is tested for a week and the influence of it on the students leaving behind waste is measured. However, the results of the experiment show no significance, meaning no valuable differences in the amount of waste left by the students caused by the influence of the different stimuli. However, this does not imply no interesting results we included at all. This lack of significance is either resulting from the set up of the experiment or the origin of the behavior of the students in the environment of the canteen. Different uncontrollable variables were included in the environment and had an influence on the students and their behavior. Besides since many students visit the canteen pretty often, the behavior possibly is based on situational norms and habits. Changing a habit or a situational norm requires a repeating adjusted interaction to eventually change the behavior. This report will dive in to the literature the hypothesis is based on followed by the set up of the experiment. The four stimuli included in this experiment will be illustrated by explaining the behavioral motivation they are based on and in what way they are expected to influence the behavior of the students. The analysis of the experiment is performed with various analyses of which the ‘results’ chapter will show the most important outcomes. The general conclusion and discussion on the various elements of the experiment are given in the chapter ‘discussion’ followed by the recommendations for a next experiment based on this one. Because, since no significance was resulting from this experiment, we are still convinced the power of design is immense and should be applied in changing the behavior in social dilemmas.","social dilemma; influencing behavior; unawareness; experiment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Jaureguy-Naudin, M. (mentor)","2012","Energy dependence, GHG emissions and fuel scarcity are on the principal concerns in Europe. To solve the problem Europe is developing laws and agreements for a future green and high efficiency energy mix. To achieve 2020 and 2050 energy goals actual model of consumption is not valid and some change has to be made in all the sectors, 48% of energy resources are located on the thermal sector which is one the principal GHG emissions producers. The principal fuel sources for heat production in Europe are: natural gas, coal, petrol and biomass. In order to fight against climate change and to reduce energy consumption thermal sector is increasing the efficiency on it cycles and shifting to less pollutant fuels, such as natural gas or biomass. One of the solutions to increase the efficiency on thermal cycles is cogeneration or Combine Heat and Power (CHP), the simultaneous production of electricity and heat. The principle behind the use of CHP is the attempt to maximize the use the fuels that have to be burned to cover the heat necessities. The act of burning is what determines the amount of electricity a cogeneration plant can produce. Main Observations CHP increases energy efficiency over separate generation. The efficient use of fuel brings lower consumption to cover the necessities of heat and electricity reducing CO2 emissions and helping to achieve environmental goals like the Kyoto Protocol or the 2020 European objectives. CHP reduces the energy dependence of a country due to its lower consumption, and it provides cost savings for the generator that increases industry competiveness. CHP is a technology that can run with a high variety of fuels, such as coal, waster or biomass, and it run in different scales of power and temperature, providing a solution for almost any kind of demand for heat. Cogeneration location close to final consumers is moving traditional electricity generation model from a centralized perspective to a decentralized one, providing an increase on the system reliability. The fuels used in cogeneration can be divided in two principal groups: non renewable, principally fossil fuel such as natural gas and coal, and renewable fuels, such as biomass, geothermal or solar power. Cogeneration is running in most of the countries with support schemes, but under the correct market conditions, enough thermal demand and a correct price of the electricity, can be profitable on the spot market. The lack of correlation between heat peak demand and electricity peak demand makes necessary other sources of generation and put in a high risk the system in countries with a high share of CHP, the problem is higher with an important share of intermittent renewable sources. Main recommendations Actual step model of subsidies is not the correct one because does not help to achieve the maximum efficiency of the cycle due to the capacity limitation. In countries like Spain cogeneration is only developed for scale below 50 MW and avoiding the installation on big plants. The development of a correct support scheme will provide benefits to the countries due to energy savings and avoid emissions. European grid integration is fundamental to the full development of green and high efficiency technologies in order to absorb all the energy resources and relocated in the continent. The last recommendation is the investment in R&D produces an important advance of the technology, a better use of the resource and it allows to achieve the energy efficiency goals. EU should impulse a police for R&D on energy efficiency because the technology can create an important industry in the continent with thousands of employees.","Cogeneration; CHP; European energy laws; High efficiency; Trigeneration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","EPA","",""

(mentor)","2012","Self-learning controllers offer various strong benefits over conventional controllers, the most important one being their ability to adapt to unexpected circumstances. Their application is however limited, the most important reason being that, for self-learning controllers to work on continuous domains, nonlinear function approximators are required, and as soon as nonlinear function approximators are involved, it is uncertain whether convergence will occur. This project has as goal to contribute towards achieving convergence guarantees. The first focus lies on using reinforcement learning, combined with neural network function approximation, to create self-learning controllers. A reinforcement learning controller architecture has been set up which is capable of controlling systems with continuous states and actions. Also an extension has been made that enables the controller to freely vary its timestep without any significant consequences. A literature research has shown that there are no convergence proofs yet of practically feasible reinforcement learning controllers with nonlinear function approximators. Several proofs of convergence for the case of linear function approximators have been provided. Also, a proof exists that a certain reinforcement learning controller algorithm with nonlinear function approximation converges. However, the corresponding learning algorithm requires an infinite amount of iterations for the value function to converge even before the policy is updated, making it practically unfeasible. The reasons why convergence often does not occur for reinforcement learning controllers with neural network function approximators include overestimated value functions, incorrect generalization, function approximators incapable of approximating the actual value function and error amplification due to bootstrapping. Furthermore, when convergence does occur, it’s not necessarily to a global optimum. Ideas to solve these issues have been offered, but it is still far from certain whether these ideas will work. Furthermore, they will make the algorithm very complex. Proving that the resulting algorithm will converge, even if it’s only convergence to a local optimum, will prove to be extremely difficult, if it is at all possible. Hence reinforcement learning controllers with neural network function approximators do not seem to be appropriate if convergence to the global optimum needs to be ensured. The literature research has also revealed that so far no attempt has been made in combining reinforcement learning with interval analysis. To investigate the possibilities of combining these two fields, the interval Q-learning algorithm has been designed. This algorithm combines a discrete version of Q-learning with interval analysis techniques. This algorithm has proven convergence for the discrete case. Subsequently, the discrete interval Q-learning algorithm has been expanded to the continuous domain. This was done using the main RL value assumption, which assumes that the derivatives of the value function with respect to every state parameter and action parameter have known bounds. The resulting continuous interval Q-learning algorithm was shown to have proven convergence to the optimal value function. Furthermore, bounds on how fast the algorithm converges were given. The most important downside of the first version of the continuous interval Q-learning algorithm was its slow run-time. This made the algorithm practically infeasible. To still meet the goals of the project, a different function approximator was designed. This function approximator used many small blocks to bound the optimal value function in every part of the state-action-space. Furthermore, the number of blocks was increased dynamically as the algorithm learned, thus giving the function approximator a theoretically unlimited accuracy. Though the resulting algorithm used information slightly less efficiently than its precursor, its run-time was significantly improved. It became practically feasible to apply this algorithm. In the end of the report, the algorithm has been applied to a few simple test problems. An important parameter here was the dimension D of the problem, which equals the sum of the number of state and action parameters. For two- and three-dimensional problems, the algorithm was able to sufficiently bound the optimal value function quite quickly, resulting in a controller with satisfactory performance. For the cart and pendulum system, which is a five-dimensional problem, this turned out to be different. A long training (in the order of several hours or more) will be required before a satisfactory performance can be obtained. However, since the algorithm has proven convergence to the globally optimal policy, this does not necessarily have to be a big problem. Finally, it is mentioned that this thesis report has introduced the world’s first combination of reinforcement learning and interval analysis. It also introduced the world’s first practically feasible continuous RL controller with proven convergence to the global optimum. The key to accomplishing such a controller turned out to be (A) letting go of conventional ways of designing continuous RL controllers, and (B) quantifying the assumption that the value Q of two nearby states are similar through the main RL value assumption.","reinforcement learning; interval analysis; self-learning controllers; proven convergence; interval Q-learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-06-01","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Simulation","","","",""

(mentor); Jellema, A.H. (mentor); Bosch, M. (mentor)","2012","In this graduation report the design of a new generation incubator covers is described. In the Netherlands about 8% of all infants are born premature each year. A little 3000 of these infants are extremely premature; they are born before 32 weeks of pregnancy. Premature infants have to spend the beginning of their life in an incubator. The premature infants, of whom the vital functions are either disturbed in a life-threatening way or inconstant, are admitted on a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). These infants are continuously observed, nursed and medically treated. These treatments can be experienced as unpleasant or even painful. Premature infants are at great risk for short and long term complications. The immaturity of the nervous system has a large impact on the development of the infant. The last three months of a normal pregnancy are crucial for the development of the brain. However, even if an infant is born preterm, his brain still develops. Unfortunately there are some factors that can have a negative influence on the development, for example sensory perception and stress. On a NICU the infant is currently confronted with too much or inappropriate stimuli like sound and light, which cause stress. The infant needs all his energy to grow; dealing with outside stimuli is harmful for his development. The NICU has an incubator cover in use to protect the infants from too many light impulses. However, due to the hygiene requirements these covers are washed so many times that they are worn-out. Furthermore, the irregular shape of the Giraffe® Omnibed demands a custom-made product. In order to develop a new product to protect the infants from external stimuli a lot of research had to be done. Next to literature research and expert meetings, a qualitative explorative research was carried out. The gathered information led to a list of requirements. Five of those requirements were used for further elaboration. Subsequently, ideas were generated on the basis of those requirements. From the final ideas, three ideas were chosen to function as the basis for the concepts. From the four concepts that were created, one concept was chosen for elaboration. The end result of this project is a mock-up of a new incubator cover that fits the Giraffe® Omnibed incubator. The cover is made of fabric in combination with magnets and ferromagnetic material. The product was evaluated and recommendations are given to improve the new incubator cover.","NICU; Medisign; Premature; Light; Incubator Cover; IPD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","Master specialisation Medisign","",""

(mentor); Van Oosterom, P. (mentor); Lemmens, R. (mentor)","2012","The INSPIRE initiative sets up a framework for the creation of an European Spatial Data Infrastructure (ESDI), which will enable the sharing of environmental spatial information among public sector organisations and better facilitate public access in general to spatial information across Europe. To do so, several common specifications have been developed in a wide range of areas including data, metadata, and network services. The most challenging aspect of INSPIRE will probably be harmonising the actual data models across Europe to the common INSPIRE ones, giving the amount of time allocated for this process. This task is not only challenging because of the amount of data that will be involved in the process, but also because of the very varied source data models and amount of data providers that will be involved at various stages and having to cooperate at European level under a unique framework. Therefore, the main question that arises, and that is on the mind of many data providers across Europe, is how is that really achieved and what does it involve? This thesis aims to clarify that aspect by focusing on data transformation and conformance testing. The research follows a stepped approach, first of all by putting into the INSPIRE context, concepts like interoperability and data harmonisation, extending to the importance of geographic information standards in this sense, as well as the ultimate goal of a spatial data infrastructure. A case study is considered, where at first, source data from the UK mapping agency, Ordnance Survey, that falls into the scope of one of the INSPIRE thematic themes, namely Administrative Units, is analysed and compared to the target data model proposed by INSPIRE, trying to identify similarities and differences that may pose problems. The process continues with identifying software tools that are capable to perform data transformation based on INSPIRE requirements, and eventually using one of them to transform the data. After the transformation, encountered bottlenecks are discussed, both from the source data side, but also from the target data model side. The last step is to formally test the produced datasets as required by the standards that INSPIRE rely upon, by means of an Abstract Test Suite (ATS) and Executable Test Suite (ETS). This is maybe one of the crucial aspects of INSPIRE data harmonisation process, as there is still some ambiguity between legally binding and not legally binding requirements, an aspect that will directly influence testing and its interpretation, hence the obligations of each data provider. The thesis will conclude with observations that are relevant not only for the Administrative Units theme, but also for the wider scope of INSPIRE data transformation and conformance testing. Main bottlenecks are discussed, but also recommendations are given that would definitely be relevant for further research, as well as for the INSPIRE community.","INSPIRE; data harmonisation; transformation; interoperability; standards; spatial data infrastructure; conformance; compliance; abstract test suite; executable test suite","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","GIS technology","","GIMA","",""
