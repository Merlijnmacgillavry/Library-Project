(mentor); Badke-Schaub, P.G. (mentor)","2014","This study researches the effect of visual and verbal facilitation in interdisciplinary design sketching on shared understanding and design creativity. Based on literature research and a field study, a sketch-focused facilitation protocol is developed which guides a facilitator in using sketching as a facilitation tool during creative sessions. The protocol is tested by conducting twenty between-group experiments with (non-design) Master students from Delft University of Technology, Netherlands. Each group consisted of two participants who responded to a design brief. Two conditions were tested in the experiments: visual and verbal facilitation. In the visual facilitation condition, the groups were guided by means of sketching while in the verbal condition the groups were guided verbally. The results show that shared understanding is significantly higher when following the sketch-focused facilitation protocol. However, visual facilitation resulted in lower creativity—in particular, novelty. These findings suggest that visual facilitation might be an effective method for constructing shared understanding during interdisciplinary design collaboration. They also suggest that a high level of sharedness between team members negatively affects design creativity. The relationship between shared understanding and creativity appears to be nuanced and requires further systematic exploration.","shared understanding; sketching; interdisciplinary; mental models; facilitated design meetings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2014","The amounts of genetic data that are produced is steadily increasing. New methods to sequence genetic data are invented and existing methods are refined, resulting in the generation of more and larger datasets. To extract useful data from these growing datasets, the algorithms processing them have to support the new and larger datasets. In this thesis, four zebrafish NanoCAGE datasets have been processed using new algorithms to map the genetic expression to known genes, discover unknown gene candidates and extract the occurrence of five Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs). Also, the infected and control datasets have been compared to find infection induced genes. An unknown gene candidate has been found that appears to be highly expressed. The number of reads of that gene candidate is in the same order of the number of reads of the most expressed gene and in 3 out of 4 datasets it has more reads. A large number of other gene candidates have been found, of which more than 100 have more than 1000 matched reads. Furthermore, the TATA box TFBS occurs frequently upstream of highly transcribed locations on the genome. In the adult datasets, more than 40% of the locations on the genome with more than 100000 reads have a TATA box at the expected distance from the start of the reads and in the embryo datasets that percentage is more than 25%. In conclusion, the NanoCAGE method and the resulting datasets show to be valuable in the research of genetic expression and genetic regulation mechanisms.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

The overall objective is to launch fewer, but bigger projects within the European region. Unilever Europe owns over 400 products including foods, beverages, cleaning agents and personal care products. In 2012 and 2013, approximately 50 priority projects, so called big bets projects, were launched across a majority of EU markets. The performance of these projects has been measured on a monthly basis . Although tracking has helped to understand to what degree these priority projects meet their targets, there is limited understanding why certain projects do and others do not meet their set targets. Understanding why projects (do not) meet targets helps to develop successful products and helps Unilever project teams to decide on which projects to focus and which projects to discard at an early stage in the product development process. When these insights are implemented in the Innovation Deployment Process, project teams can become more selective and will enable these teams to decide to shutdown projects that are bound to perform less well compared to other projects in the pipeline. Instead they can focus on products that will be beneficial to Unilever’s total product portfolio and profits. The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding why Unilever projects (fail to) meet set targets after launch, by analyzing the company’s current Innovation Deployment Process using both qualitative and quantitative methods, allowing Unilever to sharpen its target setting process.","Target Setting Process; Strategy; Innovation Deployment Process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor); Wiegmans, B.W. (mentor); Van Duin, J.H.R. (mentor); Veldman, S.J. (mentor); Bückmann, E.H. (mentor)","2014","Over the last two decades, global container transport has grown rapidly, and transport between Asia and Europe in particular. This increase in container transport has led to fierce competition between container ports. The competition between container ports is affected by various factors in the container transport sector. Changes in these factors can have significant influence on ports and their competitiveness. Major changes include, but are not limited to: increasing ship size, global warming, policy changes and the uncertainty concerning the volatility oil prices. This study focusses on the design and development of a port competition model that is able to simulate impacts of major changes on container port imports, in order to make analysis of container port development for the European mainland. Port competition is often modelled as a port choice problem, using the widely applied multinomial logit discrete choice model. Twelve port choice factors are selected from literature to model port choice: maritime costs, hinterland costs, port costs, maritime transport time, hinterland transport time, port dwell time, number of deep sea port calls, number of short sea services, water depth, number of inland waterway services, number of rail services, and demand for containers. Using the quantified port choice factors and a constructed OD matrix as input, a weighted regression analysis is applied to determine the statistical significance and weights of the twelve port choice factors. The OD matrix is constructed using a doubly constrained distribution model as actual OD data on container flows is unknown. The statistical analysis resulted in five significant port choice factors: maritime transport costs, hinterland transport costs, hinterland transport time, number of deep sea port calls, and a negative dummy variable for rail transport. The port competition model has an R2 value of 0.77, which means that the model explains 77% of the variance in the port imports. The developed port competition model is used to determine the effects of changes in the container transport sector. The application of the port competition model is tested using variable oil prices, in order to analyse the development of container imports per coastline. The results show that higher oil prices lead to an increase in import for the Mediterranean ports and unchanged import for the North Sea and Black Sea ports. The ports along the Baltic Sea, Adriatic Sea and the Atlantic see their container imports decrease with increasing oil prices. For Switzerland, located in the heart of Europe, the shift of imports per coastline is significant. Higher oil prices lead to an increased import from the Mediterranean ports and a decline in imports from the North Sea ports. Besides port imports, modal split changes and the use of feeder services are also calculated by the model. An increasing oil price results in a higher use of inland waterway and rail transport, at the expense of road transport. The developed port competition model can analyse the effects of global trends and policy changes concerning the container transport sector on the imports per port, modal split changes and the use of feeder services, for the European mainland. The model can be applied to determine impacts on port competitiveness or support decision making for: policy changes, investments in infrastructure, or shipping trends. Recommendations for future model improvements and expansion include: using more port choice factors, include port exports, and include container transport from other parts of the world besides Asia. From a scientific and business perspective, it is recommended that bill of lading data, gathered by customs which includes origin destination data, is made publicly available.","Transport modelling; hinterland transport; maritime transport; container transport; container port","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure & Logistics","",""

Where the first doublets were drilled in the West Netherlands Basin is now almost fully developed. Other areas in the Netherlands have also taken interest and are starting to evaluate this possibility. The Koekoekspolder in Overijssel is such a project where the aim is to develop a system producing from the Rotliegend Aeolian Sandstone. This Sandstone is situated at depths of around 2000 meters and holds formation water in the range of 65-73 degrees Celsius. This formation with thicknesses of 90-120 meters in the area has been studied for the purpose of Geothermal development. To understand the flow through this aquifer the geological model must be understood. Study of core, cuttings, seismic and well data showed that the Rotliegend is an Aeolian sandstone with bimodal lamination. This bimodal parallel lamination with predominantly anhydrite pseudo cement present in the coarse laminae have been deposited as sandsheets. The anhydrite is re-crystallized from detrital gypsum grains that has been blown during periods of increased wind intensity from its proximal Anhydrite/Gypsum crusts source. The fine grain laminae that consists of very fine to fine quartz grains have mainly carbonate cement. This carbonate cement can be attributed to diagenesis where precipitation of carbonate cement from formation water took place. The Rotliegend Aeolian reservoirs occasionally contain zones of high density. Zones with an increased density have been attributed to the presence of anhydrite/gypsum. These zones that may reach thicknesses of 15 meters are interpreted as nodular gypsum growth or as gypsum dunes.","Rotliegend; Aeolian; Sandstone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Applied Geology; Reservoir Geology","",""

(mentor)","2014","To obtain the absolute truth about the performance of a noise reduction method one requires to perform a listening experiment. As listening experiments are often time consuming and expensive there exists a need to replace these experiments by instrumental measures. Consequently, research has provided various instrumental measures which can been used in order to predict speech-quality or-speech intelligibility. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the performance of a broad range of established instrumental measures in terms of their ability to predict the amount of musical noise present in enhanced noisy speech signals. The performance of the instrumental measures is evaluated using musical noise quantity scores obtained from a specially designed listening experiment which was performed by normal-hearing listeners. The investigated stimuli, which contain various amounts contain musical noise, are produced using the spectral subtraction noise reduction method. Of all considered standard measures, a mean squared distortion measure, a SNR based method, the PESQ measure, and the STOI measure yield the highest correlations with the listening experiments scores. These results confirm the ability of instrumental measures to predict the amount of musical noise, but further evaluation shows limitations to their applicability as the results suggest that optimization of the over-subtraction parameter for a minimum amount of musical noise and maximal speech-quality or intelligibly simultaneously, is not possible. Instead the results show that maximal speech-quality or intelligibility is obtained when a stimulus contains the highest amount of musical noise. To gain more insight of the amount of musical noise in a stimulus, a novel measure, based on the characteristics of musical noise in time and frequency, is proposed. This measure incorporates a parametric outlier detection method to classify musical components. High correlations with the outcome of the listening experiment are obtained, i.e. rho = 0.90 for enhanced noisy speech signals with various input SNR.","instrumental measure; kurtosis; listening experiment; outlier detection; musical noise","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Signal & Information Processing Lab","","Multimedia Signal Processing Group","",""

(mentor); Roscam Abbing, E. (mentor)","2014","XYZ Corporation is a Healthcare business. They have as main product a health management system that aims at supporting hospitals in process integration and control, information management, and decision-making. Previous research at the company found that end users are frustrated because they cannot leverage its full potential due to its complex and ineffective interface, which hampers the system’s adoption. The complexity is mainly an outcome of the large number of customizations performed in the system. Customization is part of its software maintenance service model, and it has being offered as a way to ensure support for specifics of client processes. The large number of requests for customization is also adversely affecting the development process in XYZ Corporation. R&D efforts are focused mostly in customization, which affects its overall performance and productivity. The aim of this project was to redesign the development process and propose a more proactive way to approach customization requests in XYZ Corporation. During the exploratory phase of this study, literature review and field research activities were conducted. The literature review was conducted mainly in the software engineering and design domains to develop a conceptual framework and identify touch-points between user-centered design and customization strategies. A participatory design mindset guided the study; the field research was entailed generative research, and the ideation phase was entailed co-creation with stakeholders. To understand its development process, and the challenges that were associated with it, process mapping sessions were conducted initially with R&D staff at the organization’s headquarters. It was concluded that the challenges were not specifically related to R&D activities. Therefore, more process mapping sessions were conducted with other internal and external (i.e. hospitals) stakeholders. After analyzing the data gathered in the field research, seven challenges in its development process were identified, and their causes were investigated. The main causes were identified as: lack of knowledge and understanding of clinical processes and best practices; lack of a standardized workflow analysis method; difficulty in filtering of customization of tickets; high new version release frequency; lack of knowledge of software by internal staff and client IT units’ staff; and lack of alignment between organization areas’ processes. The challenges and causes were visualized in story narratives. The stories, together with solution seeds that were based on the literature review findings, served as input for the subsequent co-create phase. In the co-create phase, a co-design workshop was conducted with the organization’s key internal stakeholders. As a result, nine initiatives, which aim to achieve a more proactive rather than a reactive development process with respect to customization requests, were proposed. Two initiatives intend to lower the customization requests by promoting a zero tickets mindset, and establishing customization premises to facilitate tickets filtering and alignment across areas. The other initiatives intend to collaboratively improve the quality of specific activities by standardizing a shared tool for client’s workflows analysis and coaching key roles to foster expertise. The most relevant initiatives intend to change the release frequency and align field marketing, R&D, and customer services processes by introducing a participatory approach to project scoping, prioritization and planning. Finally, based on the co-designed initiatives, an optimized development process was synthesized. A deployment strategy for the initiatives that is actionable by the organization was also constructed. The initial version of the redesigned development process was further refined and validated with two directors and two managers from key areas and units. It is expected that the implementation of the initiatives would result in the focalization of efforts to develop only meaningful customizations. The expected impact is the freeing up of resources for allocation in new projects to foster innovation and to improve the software user interface effectiveness and coherence.","optimize processes; design research; organizational analysis; development process; participatory design; generative research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Bijlaard, F.S.K. (mentor); Van Bochove, G.G. (mentor); Houben, L.J.M. (mentor); Kolstein, M.H. (mentor)","2014","Fatigue damage is a common problem in a lot of bridges with orthotropic steel decks. Frequent maintenance is required to prevent aggravation of the problems, which gives a lot of nuisance for the traffic using the bridge. This comes especially into play at large (river) crossings where not many alternatives are available. Therefore, methods are investigated for strengthening of those bridges in such a way that the magnitude and frequency of maintenance works can be reduced. In 2012, research work which focussed on the strengthening of bridges with movable steel decks (where usually a surface treatment is applied instead of an asphaltic surfacing) was finished, which showed very promising results. FEM modelling, laboratory tests and the application on a bridge deck in use all showed significant stress reductions. This thesis investigates the applicability of the above described renovation method for fixed bridges where an asphaltic wearing course should be taken into account. This does result in extra dead load on the renovated deck. Furthermore, the occurring stresses in the surfacing should now be taken into account. To investigate this structure, a characteristic part of the bridge deck (the deck plate between two stiffener webs) is simplified to a simply supported beam. The proposed renovation method is based on the addition of an extra steel plate with a polyurethane core between the original deck and this additional plate. A thicker core means more mass, but it also increases the bending stiffness of the whole structure. The extra mass from the reinforcement has to be compensated so that the dead load on the main girders and foundation is not increased. This demands special properties of the surface layer. For the wearing course, Brugflex is selected. This asphalt mix developed by Heijmans is stiff in vertical direction, but flexible in horizontal direction so that a good resistance against both rutting and fatigue cracking is obtained. For the membrane between the steel and asphalt, Parafor Ponts is selected. This bituminous membrane from the Icopal Group provides a good cohesion between the wearing course and the deck plate and has excellent waterproofing properties. It was chosen to use a finite element analysis approach to investigate the behaviour of the renovated structure, when subjected to a moving load. First, a lot of tests had to be executed to identify the membrane shear and tension properties at different temperatures and deformation rates. Finally those test results were combined to predict the properties for any arbitrary temperature and deformation rate. For the other materials, those characteristic properties were already defined. Finally, the renovated structure was modelled as a simple supported beam. Besides a reference model, similar to the surfacing on the Van Brienenoordbrug, five different geometries with varying asphalt thicknesses were constructed. It was tried to give all those renovated geometries a similar mass as the reference model, which was achieved by varying the core thickness between the two steel plates. The finite element analysis showed some promising results. With respect to the reference model, the bending stresses in the steel and asphalt were significantly reduced. Especially the decreased tension stress in the asphalt is important regarding fatigue cracks. Also the shear stresses in the membrane were considerably lower than in the reference model. Overall, the proposed renovation method showed encouraging results, which recommend further research. In the future, this renovation method might probably be a good option when an existing orthotropic bridge deck suffering fatigue has to be strengthened.","Asphalt; Steel; Bridge; Deck; Abaqus; FEM; Prony","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Road and Railroad Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2014","In the last few years the amount of witnessed accidents (such as stolen information) following from cyber-attacks has increased. It is considered that organisations cannot keep up with adversaries by themselves anymore. For that reason organisations would have to collaborate with each other, by sharing information, to improve each other’s awareness of cyber security related matters. However, it is unknown how such collaborations would have to look like. The collaborations that are already implemented differ quite a bit. Some are very large, consisting of organisations that are active in different sectors, and other collaborations are actually small and ad-hoc collaborations between rather similar organisations. This research project focused on identifying factors that determine the design of a collaboration. The main goal was to determine what the default collaboration design should be in order for organisations to be able to share pragmatic information. The main findings are that collaborations should be rather small for organisations to be able and willing to productively share information with each other. With large collaborations the differences between organisations will increase. Their views on the reality of cyber security differ in various ways. Because of this, the ability of the organisations to productively share information is affected. But furthermore, with increases in differences between organisations, the willingness of such organisations to share sensitive information can be affected. They have a harder time assessing trustworthiness. For that reason they might opt for extensive use of contracts (with negative consequences in the long run) or refrain from sharing the sensitive information. Future research should focus on validating the findings of this research empirically. But also future research should further study the constituents of pragmatic information sharing collaborations.","situation awareness; information sharing; cyber security; trust; collaboration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-02-25","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor)","2014","Increasingly engineers in, for example, Aerospace Engineering create software to support their daily engineering activities. This is referred to as Engineering Automation. A prime example of Engineering Automation is Knowledge Based Engineering. It is desirable to reuse and share this software, rather than to discard it soon after its creation. Unfortunately, the overall level of sharing and reuse in daily engineering automation practice is currently low. Producing reusable applications proves to be difficult for engineering automation developers. An initial study comprising a literature review and expert interviews showed that the two main issues are the understandability and validity of the software and documentation. The study also provided insight in the current Engineering Automation culture. The most important aspect identified is the lack of incentives for software activities other than coding itself. Based on the initial study, a software design tool based on incremental code and design documentation generation was selected as the most suitable approach to start tackling the issues identified. To contribute to understandability and validity, and ultimately reuse, the tool aims to encourage the creation of accurate design documentation and to encourage the creation of that documentation before implementing the corresponding code. Creating a design beforehand encourages a well thought and understandable application structure, yet this is rarely done in an Engineering Automation context. The approach was implemented for a specific community of Engineering Automation developers, namely users of the GenDL software framework. The resulting tool, GenDL Designer, features a simplified version of the Unified Modeling Language, continuous consistency checking with the code and support for incremental resolution of inconsistencies, e.g. by generating code skeleton fragments or by proposing design diagram modifications. GenDL Designer was developed with Engineering Automation developers in mind and therefore differs significantly from general software engineering tools with similar objectives. To address the potential and feasibility of incremental code and design documentation generation for engineering automation development, a large-scale academic experiment with GenDL Designer is planned in spring 2014. In anticipation of that, trial runs were held, which only allow for preliminary conclusions. GenDL Designer seems to encourage the creation of accurate design documentation and seems to encourage designing before implementing. The principle of incremental code and design documentation generation appears to have the potential to improve the understandability of applications, the validity of their documentation and even the validity of the code itself, due to the improved transparency that uncovers defects. Finally, introducing incremental code and design documentation generation in an engineering automation context appears to be feasible, but some potential users will not be convinced with a short introduction alone. These promising but preliminary findings will hopefully be confirmed with the large scale academic experiment and later on with experiments in industry.","Engineering Automation; Model-Based System Engineering; Code generation; Professional End-User Development; Software Reuse","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","System Engineering and Aircraft Design","",""

The module is equipped with a low noise CCD camera, a high power white light source, and appropriate wavelength filters. Optical imaging capabilities of this multi-modality platform were evaluated in the context of U-SPECT findings using a tissue equivalent gel phantom containing a diagonally placed capillary filled with a fluorescent dye and 99mTc. This was followed by in vivo studies in mice, implanted with a bioluminescent 4T1-luc+ tumor, using the angiogenesis tracer 111In-MSAP-RGD; this tracer contains both a fluorescent and a radioactive moiety. For reference, optical images were also acquired on an IVIS Spectrum (Caliper LifeSciences Inc.). Results: Both the phantom and mouse studies show that, other than the SPECT images, bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging only is of value when the signal origin is superficial. When a multimodal imaging agent is used, the 3D in depth view provided by SPECT can be used to improve the interpretation of fluorescence imaging findings. An important feature here is tracer accumulation in non-target organs such as liver and kidneys. Herein, the quality of the bioluminescence and fluorescence images of the optical module was comparable to those obtained with the IVIS. The Optical module can also be used separately so that SPECT and OI can be performed in parallel with the same hardware. Conclusions: U-SPECT-BioFluo allows for the complementary imaging of bioluminescent, fluorescent and high resolution SPECT signatures in a single scan session. Integration of these modalities helps to improve logistics during mouse imaging studies using multiple and multimodal tracers.","SPECT; bioluminescence; fluorescence; multi-modal; imaging; medical","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-02-25","Applied Sciences","RST/Radiation, Science and Technology","","Radiation, Detection and Medical Imaging","",""

(mentor); Pardoel, F. (mentor)","2014","Despite extensive research that has been conducted during the past twenty years, the exact geological history of the Greater Ameland Area remains enigmatic. Sediment distribution and diagenetic processes cause marked and unexpected variation in well productivity in the study area. However, the exact causes for this are not fully understood. The goal of this thesis is to build on current understanding so as to improve geological understanding of reservoir quality distribution, specifically in terms of sedimentology and structural evolution so as to better explain production behaviour in the Greater Ameland Area. During reservoir rock deposition the Greater Ameland Area was situated in the distal part of the Southern Permian Basin, an elongate E-W trending land-locked basin extending from Poland to the UK. Gas is currently produced from distal Rotliegend aeolian sandstones that exhibit relatively poor porosity and permeability properties. Literature research, extensive core study, well correlation, seismic interpretation and various techniques for heterogeneity quantification are the main methods that were used for the research described in this thesis. This thesis presents a newly devised facies classification, based on soft sediment deformation intensity, which provides increased insight into specific details of the sedimentary environment prevailing during the deposition of Upper Rotliegend reservoir sandstones. Climatic variations are dominant in governing sedimentary processes by means of water table fluctuations, seconded by palaeotopographic variation that locally leads to differences in base level. Soft sediment deformation complicates the relationship between depositional processes and reservoir quality distribution. The study has not identified any conclusive findings in terms of how this complication can be incorporated in reservoir quality modelling. Heterogeneity quantification is instrumental for understanding and predicting reservoir quality distribution, but the various methods that were applied provide unequivocal results. Sediment distribution, and hence the areal distribution of reservoir quality was influenced by the pre-existing Variscan structural framework and associated palaeotopography. This is expressed by onlap of Permian sediments on Carboniferous deposits, and by distinct thickness variations within the Upper Rotliegend. The study results provide better insight into sedimentological processes during deposition of Permian Rotliegend reservoir rocks and the resulting reservoir quality distribution in a distal aeolian-fluvial setting.","Permian; Rotliegend; reservoir geology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences","",""

In order to be truly autonomous, the robot must be able to perform its tasks in an unknown environment. Using SLAM, the robot has to make search decisions with increasing knowledge of the environment. Today, mostly Next Best View algorithms are used to achieve this feat. These are heuristic based algorithms, which balance between heuristic measures like information gain and traveling time. The action if often chosen greedily. In this thesis a novel approach is taken. POMDPs are used to model the problem of object search. Representing the changing environment explicitly in a POMDP is not feasible, since the number of possible layouts of the environment is just too great. Instead an instance of the POMDP model and the solution are recalculated every time step. Six different POMDP models were designed for known environments and three models for unknown environments. These were tested in a simulated environment and compared to a baseline Next Best View algorithm. Surprisingly, reasoning about unexplored environments was shown not to be necessary for a good result. It has been shown that although NBV works fast, the POMDP clearly gives a better solution, with an average search path that is almost twice as short.","POMDP Search Robot","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-05","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

The model is able to extract game play as well as social and Quality of Service (QoS) metrics from network traces. Furthermore, we examine whether or not playing with a friend enhances the player's QoE or boosts the gaming performance. Additionally, it is also useful to determine if a specificaction is correlated to the player's QoE. To answer this question, we conducted an experiment with a total of 24 players. It was feasible to show that socialization definitely has an impact on the player's QoE and that players playing with friends perform better in the game. Socialization contributes to a 10% better QoE and players playing with friends advance between 50% to 214% faster in the game. It was also shown that players then perceive the game to be more attractive, easy and exciting.

(mentor); De Jong, M. (mentor); Groeneweg, J. (mentor)","2014","Large capital and maintenance dredging operations are required to ensure the accessibility of many ports. The expenses associated with the dredging operations can have a significant impact on the finances of these ports. Therefore, considerable attention to the design of the width and depth aspects of access channels is justifiable. This study considered this topic within the framework of an Additional Master Thesis (3-month internship). The objectives of the study are: i) to verify the influence of different processes and sources of uncertainties in the evaluation of minimum depth requirements; and ii) to investigate the advantages and drawbacks of different methods of depth requirement evaluation. The Port of Tubarão (Southeast Brazil) is used as a case study to verify processes and methods. Four different approaches were considered to evaluate depth requirements for the access channel of the Port. These methods are based on either deterministic and/or probabilistic methods, and on approaches without or including wave influences. The results for the case study indicate that ship motions due to waves have a minor influence on the required channel depth at that location during most of the time. However, in certain wave conditions (not only in terms of wave height, but also wave period and wave direction relative to the manoeuvring ship) vertical ship motions become the dominant issue regarding depth requirements; consequently waves should be included in a practical evaluation over time. In probabilistic approaches more knowledge can be incorporated in the analysis, however, this requires detailed information. The deterministic approach, on the other hand, is simpler to use and gives good insight about the main driving variables. Although, the main drawback of deterministic methods is that the reliability of the evaluation cannot be accessed, or that conservative assumptions need to be made. This may be uneconomical. The use of a probabilistic method for the case study led to a more optimized use of the channel in terms of accessibility in comparison to the results obtained with the deterministic method. Nevertheless, those results depend largely on the safety factors assumed in the deterministic computations relative to the probability distributions considered in the deterministic approach. Alternatively, the safety margins can be computed or calibrated for specific cases based on probabilistic calculations. In that case the results of deterministic and probabilistic methods can be similar, ensuring the required reliability of the practical deterministic approach, but not being excessively restrictive.","depth requirements; access channel; probabilistic; optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Ports and Waterways","",""

Few recent examples are Roomba vacuum cleaner robot for homes, industrial robots for production lines and unmanned robots for dangerous environments, such as NASA Mars Rover. One important aspect of robotics is the intelligence mechanism. However it is not always easy to design controllers and decision makers since mechanical designs of robots are becoming more complex as well as robotic tasks. Furthermore robots are expected to be able to cope with unforeseen interaction in these environments. Therefore a different approach than hard-coding the robotic agents beforehand should be used, such as learning. The learning approach has its own difficulties, such as long learning sessions and not being able to transfer knowledge to new tasks efficiently to avoid performing another learning session. Usage of affordance concept is a solution for these difficulties since it maintains some kind of transition model of the environment and the robot. Affordance concept in combination with action planning enables to use the knowledge gained in previous tasks, environments or robots. This reduces or completely eliminates the learning time required for the new task, environment or robot. This methodology also enables agents to successfully perform tasks in environments which have known properties but are new to the agent without additional learning, which is not always the case with transfer learning for Reinforcement Learning (RL) [1]. By successfully it is meant that the agent completes the task in an optimal manner. For example in a navigation task this will be reaching the destination in shortest time or lowest amount of steps. Knowledge transfer between robotic agents will ideally decrease the required learning time and trials of new robotic agents in an environment. This can be done via passing some of the learned knowledge from the robotic agents which are already functioning in that very same environment. An agent which hasn’t learned anything about the environment will not even know the basic properties, such as a wall is not being pushable and a docking station affords charging. A common representation will be time saving for all agents that will benefit from such information. Indeed this is the case with the results presented in this thesis work.","robot; affordance learning; affordance transfer; use of affordance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems and Control","",""

Simultaneously, a methodology is structured in order to optimize step by step the thermal performance of the reference building aiming to net zero energy or even to surplus energy. This methodology could be used as a guide for building engineers and designers for future projects. Window-to-wall ratio, solar shading, thermal mass and ventilation strategies are the main parameters evaluated. Passive strategies comprise the main focus of the study whereas active strategies in form of PV solar panels are supplementary in order to satisfy the annual energy demand and improvise the thermal comfort of the reference model under investigation. Carbon Profiling, considering embodied energy of the materials, is included as a criterion for the final optimization. Literature review on passive building envelope strategies, case studies in the Netherlands and in Europe, Passive House standard, Energy Codes and Green Village requirements are the most important aspects that determined the procedure of this study. The base model refers to a Passive House medium weight construction. Window-to-wall ratio aspect and solar shading application are the first parameters to be evaluated. After defining the first base model, different materials as thermal mass types, combined with ventilation strategies, are compared. A final solution is chosen as a proposal for the Green Village office for a period of ten years. The proposal is based on Passive House criteria, regarding low operational energy, embodied energy and thermal comfort. Thermal models are simulated by EnergyPlus with DesignBuilder as user-interface. The output is mainly annual heating and cooling energy demands. Artificial lighting and thermal comfort distribution are also taken into consideration.","building envelope; passive house; Green Village Project; parametric analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Building Technology & Physics","",""

Previous studies used a simple mass-spring-damper (MBK) mechanical model to describe the ankle admittance estimated from small mechanical displacements around a constant mean joint angle i.e. working point. Van Eesbeek used the MBK to describe the admittance for several working points over a wide range of motion (RoM) of the passive ankle using a piece-wise linear approach (LPV). However, the MBK model appeared not sufficient to describe the behavior of the ankle in all working points. This discrepancy was the reason for this study, whose goal is to derive a better model structure for the passive ankle over a large RoM. Results show that a mechanical model made up of 2 springs, 1 damper and 1 mass can approximate the ankle admittance more accurately than a MBK model in each working point. The second spring was meant to approximate the mechanical properties of the Achilles tendon. The result endorses the importance of the tendon mechanical properties when estimating the passive ankle admittance. In addition, it may question the validity of older studies that used MBK mechanical models to estimate joint mechanical properties.","ankle admittance; system identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-04-13","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Christiaans, H.H.C.M. (mentor)","2014","This Industrial Design Engineering graduation project is part of the Master´s programme Integrated Product Design (specialization Retail Design) at the TU Delft. The assignment was commissioned by the branding and design agency Tomorrow Design for the new formula of bookstore chain Polare, which combines former bookstore chains Selexyz and De Slegte, and has the goal to become the most modern bookstore in the Netherlands by integrating digitization in its stores. This graduation report investigates the current situation of the company Polare and its context, in order to integrate digitization into the physical retail environment on the basis of the following research question: “How can the hesitation and reluctance among booksellers and readers to accept digitization be overcome and turned into enthusiasm?” This report is built up in five parts, Explore, Create, Develop, Deliver, and Evaluate. The first part, Explore, deals with the company analysis and provides an answer to the research question by looking at several aspects. The Explore phase leads to valuable insights and guidelines to operate a best practice bookstore. It also provides the following answer to the research question: Reluctance to accept digitization is caused by uncertainty about the future of the book, as many people fear the e-book will replace the physical book. Additionally, digital formats are often negatively associated with entertainment. The image of digitization can be improved by positioning the e-book as an addition instead of a replacement, while using the right cultural associations. Acceptance of digitization can be increased by providing knowledge about digital reading to reduce uncertainty and by allowing customer to try out e-reading devices. The conclusions from the Explore phase are directly translated into a Design Brief, which includes the assignment to create multiple solutions that can be integrated into the Flagship store to improve the image of digitization. Technology should be used in order to provide an improved service and experience by combining the benefits of online and offline shopping. Additionally, the accessibility and approachability of the store should be improved to attract new target groups. The ideas are assessed by the following criteria: Accessibility, service, image, brand awareness, certainty, and experience. During the second part, Create, ideas are generated by a brainstorm session based on the Design Brief, and additionally, reference images of existing projects and various rounds of sketching lead to multiple solutions for the entire store in the following clusters: Store lay-out, monitoring, e-books, image of digital books, attracting new customers, store windows, and online/offline integration. The Master’s programme Integrated Product Design usually deals with the detailed development of a single product. Therefore, instead of developing the entire store, a single component is chosen to be further developed: The Scriptorium+ concept. Based on the original monk’s writing desk, the scriptorium, the concept combines a console to exhibit all versions of a story, with a marketing campaign to attract a new and younger target group, using visually appealing trailers and images of well-known movies that are based on a book. During the third part, Develop, the aspects of the concept that are developed include the shape, color and material of the console, which are based on the existing bookcases and the Polare house for the Flagship store. By using the same dimensions and black MDF material as the bookcases, and a clear reference to the shape of Polare house, the module is able to become the bridge between the traditional and the modern bookstore. Additionally, the modularity of both the floor plan and the product lay-out is elaborated, story components are gathered, ergonomics are tested with a mock-up test, and the dimensions are determined. A considerable amount of attention is paid to the integration of online shopping benefits through the availability of in-store touch screen computers. In the fourth part, Deliver, the result of all the preceding steps is presented by means of visualizations and short descriptions. The final concept is able to attract a new target group, while retaining the traditional customers of Polare. The new target group becomes acquainted with Polare through a marketing campaign that uses both traditional (posters, advertisements, television) and modern communication channels (YouTube, social media). Visually appealing trailers and images are used to create an interest in books through the recognition of well-known movies. In the store, the scriptorium console provides a dynamic and interactive experience through the use of electronic devices, a sound dome and trailers on the screen. Information is provided to increase the level of knowledge about digital reading. It is possible to try out in order to become acquainted with digital reading, which takes away preconceptions and enhances acceptance for traditional customers. By providing all versions of a single story, along with relevant non-book products and merchandise, the e-book is positioned as an addition to the product range of Polare, where customers are able to make a choice for a particular format based on their own preference. The concept also includes a touch screen computer that enables customers to experience the benefits of online shopping in the store by disclosing the long tail assortment, media reviews, recommendations, and detailed information. The modular component lay-out and floor plan make sure that the concept is able to adapt to different store lay-outs, and allow the scriptorium console to be used in temporary pop-up stores. This makes it possible for Polare to reach out to smaller city centres in order to increase national brand awareness, which is necessary to build a successful online platform. In the fifth part, Evaluate, the concept is validated. The final concept is developed up until a point where a prototype can be constructed. By means of a full-scale prototype of a single module, the concept is tested in the faculty bookstore Waltman. Results from the questionnaire show that the interest in the story increases, even when customers are already familiar with it. Respondents agree that the concept would be an addition to the shopping experience. It is recommended that Polare invests in more retail components in order to successfully integrate digitization in Bookstore 2.0.","retail; bookstore; reluctance; books; digitization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

As a related technique field, lighting control system has also draw more and more attention; therefore intelligent lighting control systems are needed. Nowadays, several famous lighting companies are working on a next generation of lighting control system, which apply not only a distributed network structure but also wireless communication. Rather than controlling by a single node, a distributed system will finish controlling operation in different control units. This guarantees the distributed system to be more robust and efficient. Wireless technology is also essential for a system because it is infeasible to connect distributed devices with cables. Of all the wireless communication standards, the zigbee protocol is regarded as the best solution for a lighting control system. This is because the zigbee protocol has features of low-rate and low-cost, which perfectly fit the features of a sensor network. However, this application also leads to a problem which cannot be ignored, the coexistence problem with other wireless protocols. Because both of the zigbee and other wireless protocols operate in the ISM 2.4 GHz frequency band, the coexistence problem happens. With different modulation and frequency spreading methods, different protocols will not detect each other correctly, for example if there are two different protocol packets being transmitted, a packet collision will happen. This problem is much more serious for the zigbee service, because the interference from wifi devices will be unacceptable for a zigbee transmission. How to solve this coexistence problem between zigbee and wifi devices in an indoor lighting environment is the main research question of this thesis. In this thesis, several solutions for the coexistence problem between zigbee and wifi are proposed and analyzed. With their different advantages and drawbacks, each of these methods has its own application scene. After comparing, the “Transmission Time Reservation” method has been proved to be a feasible solution as to the assumed problem, which has also been tested by simulations. Within this method, a gateway node between the zigbee and wifi network is designed cooperatively. Whenever there is a zigbee request, this node is programmed to do the reservation operation with the wifi AP node. The results of NS3 simulations and comparative tests have also shown that this method is effective to solve the coexistence problem in an indoor environment.","lighting control; centralized & distributed; zigbee & wifi; coexistence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-04-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Electrical Engineering","",""

For this purpose, a non-invasive keypoint-based cell viability determination method without the use of viability stains, has been developed. This method formulates unstained non-viable cell detection as a supervised, binary pattern recognition problem and presents a set of features that are suitable for distinguishing between unstained viable and non-viable cells in bright-field micrographs. Experimental results for a representative sample of micrographs are compared with the ground truth non-viable cell count obtained from fluorescent micrographs. Despite the low contrast and high variability in appearance of cells in bright-field images, the method yield a classification rate in excess of 88% for non-viable versus viable-suspended cells and of more than 65% for nonviable versus viable-adherent cells . Thus, the developed method has been proven to be a feasible alternative for cell viability determination in bright-field micrographs.","Unstained; Cell Viability; Scale-invariant feature transform; Colour texture features; Bright-field images","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","Computer Simulation for Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van der Seijs, M.V. (mentor)","2014","The dynamics of systems can be analysed by combining the dynamics of its components. This method is generally know as dynamic substructuring. It allows for efficient computation of the dynamics of structures that would otherwise be to complex to determine. Most dynamic substructuring approaches use the frequency domain for the re-assembling of the subcomponents. Recently, a different implementation of the dynamic substructuring method has been introduced: impulse based substructuring (IBS). It uses impulse response function in the time-domain for representing the dynamics of the subcomponents, obtained by numerical models or experimental testing. Compared to the frequency domain methods, the impulse based substructuring scheme proves to be advantageous when analysing the high-frequency characteristics of a system. The high-frequency dynamics are excited when the system is subjected to blasts, shocks or impulsive loading. Due to the sensitivity of the impulse based substructure scheme, experimentally obtained impulse response functions can not be used for describing the dynamics of a subsystem. The focus of this thesis is developing a direct time-domain technique for determining the experimental impulse response. This is realised by introducing the inverse finite impulse response force filter, which operates independent of the output system response. This time-domain approach will avoid frequency domain induced errors, i.e. windowing, anti-aliasing and Fourier transforms, in the effort of determining a highly accurate impulse response functions. The quality of the time-domain acquired impulse response, as well as the measurement induced errors are tested on the impulse based substructuring scheme. The procedures are illustrated by application to an one-dimensional bar. The inverse force filter is successful in finding the experimental (averaged) impulse response. The accuracy of the filter depends on the length of the filter and the conditioning of the force auto correlation matrix. The eigenvalue decomposition of this matrix led to the formulation of a selection criteria between replicate measurements and a filtering operation. The inverse filter can also be defined by using a Fourier transform and its inverse. If both methods are compared, it is shown that the time-domain approach is less accurate and time efficient. The direct time-domain approach did not change the impulse response in such an extend that coupling by the impulse based substructuring scheme was possible. Since coupling between numerically simulated data is possible, measurement errors are introduced on the impulse response functions to test their sensitivity to the IBS scheme. It is observed that a small error on the exponential decay, of the perfect impulse response, directly resulted in uncoupled full system responses. This led to the identification of the modal parameters of the measurement to get rid of these amplitude errors, by means of the least squares complex exponential method. The perfect synthesised impulse response are successful in finding a coupled full system response. Experimental dynamic substructuring only finds the full coupled response if a clean synthesised impulse response function of the subcomponents is used. It can also be concluded that the inverse filter is not as accurate as its frequency domain counterpart. However, the inverse force filter will make deconvolution of small parts of the output response possible. This is desirable when testing lightly damped structures.","Dynamic substructuring; Experimental; Impulse response; Deconvolution; Time-domain; Inverse finite impulse response filter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","EM","",""

(mentor); Goto, L. (mentor); Goossens, R.H.M. (mentor)","2014","This report presents the graduation project of Hanneke Hoogewerf, master student Integrated Product Design at the Delft University of Technology. This project is titled ““The design of non-invasive pediatric vision screener that detects refractive errors, Strabismus and Amblyopia in children from urban and rural India.” In India, approximately 36 million children suffer from low vision, mainly caused by refractive errors, Amblyopia and Strabismus. Especially Amblyopia is important to detect in young children as this ailment causes irreversible damage to the child’s sight when it is not treated before the child’s 8th year. This can lead to one-eye-blindness, increasing the child’s chances on full blindness during its future life. Thereby, low vision can lead to a loss of productivity in school, deteriorating the child’s future perspective. Unfortunately India lacks tremendously when it comes to healthcare delivery to especially the poorer groups in society, leaving many cases of low vision in children undetected and untreated. Forus Health Pvt. Ltd. Is a start-up company in Bangalore, India, with the mission “to address the healthcare delivery crisis in the developing world through innovative and inclusive product design and service deployment.” By introducing a non-invasive pediatric vision screener, Forus Health wants to enable people without medical backgrounds to perform pediatric eye-screenings and trough this principle screen as many children as possible. As this project implies a design of a screener that will be used by people who are unfamiliar with the concept of vision screening, it is important that the design meets the operator’s needs and capacity when it comes to product-operation. Therefore IDEO’s Toolkit for Human-Centered-Design is used to obtain information on the target group via the Human-Centered-Design approach. A final concept design for the pediatric vision screener will be presented that is established based on the information gained on the target group and the environmental factors of rural- and urban-India. This design encounters; - An interface specially designed for use by people with poor experience in operating electrical devices. The interface guides the inexperience user step by step through the process. - An ergonomic housing design of the pediatric vision screener, housing the working principle designed at Forus Health whilst facilitating a firm and stable grip for the Indian user. - An implemented trigger for attracting the sight from children who are not familiar to medical examinations and find large devices intimidating. The product was evaluated in an earlier phase in India through user tests with possible operators and children. The final interface design was tested with elderly Dutch people because of their comparable IT-literacy to the Indian target group. The housing design was tested on Indian students of the Delft University of Technology, to meet the anatomical properties of the target group. Findings of this user test are translated into recommendations for further development. Moreover recommendations are given on the future manufacturing and on the business & marketing development. Of all applied methods, IDEO’s toolkit for Human-Centered-Design was the most helpful for communicating complex and unfamiliar principles to the target group by the use of metaphors. Also the tips given on research in rural areas with respect to the approach of the target group were of great help whilst performing user-research in rural India.","India; Refractive Errors; Amblyopia; Strabismus; Human Centered Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Kamp, L. (mentor); Cunningham, S. (mentor)","2014","Innovation is considered to be the major force in economic growth. However, the processes are extremely complex and characterized with high level of uncertainty. How can we increase our understanding about innovation process? The core of modern thinking about innovation process is to understand what factors shaping and influencing innovation. The study attempts to design an information tool consists of a common set of explanatory factors which can be used to carry out descriptive and explanatory analysis of a specific technology in a country. Main concepts from two major strands of innovation literatures: systems of innovation approaches and technological transition were used as the base to design the tool. The tool consists of indicator data for two main components of innovation system: structural and system components. The tool suggests using multiple methods of data collection (methodological triangulation) including: desk research, interview, and observation. However, for the current study, most of the information about innovation components can be collected through desk research by providing possible data sources that were chosen based on reliability and trustworthiness level. After mapping the information for every component, an analyst needs to map the interaction pattern between the components and identifies the motors of innovation which are important steps to understand the dynamics of the innovation system including the blocking and inducement mechanism. The tool was implemented to investigate PEMFC innovation system for transport sector in Japan and the Netherlands. The insight derived from the tool implementation is the ability to see how an innovation system is developed based on local social and economic condition. However, though part of the innovations are genuinely domestic; every country has the ability to adapt, diffuse, and utilize the product, process, be part of organization, and even got influenced by institutions developed abroad. With the information tool, innovation system can be studied in a more comprehensive way and the comparison between innovation systems in different countries becomes easier. However, the content of the information tool still need to be strengthened through interview or Delphi method with Policy Study experts and more case studies still need to be done to test the tool.","innovation; systems of innovation approach; technological transition; multi level perspective; functions of innovation system; fuel cell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy, and Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor)","2014","In the Netherlands and all over the world congestion is still an everyday occurrence. In order to reduce this congestion the capacity of the freeways is increased and dynamic traffic management measures (DTM) are applied. One of these DTMs is ramp metering. Ramp metering systems decrease the inflow to the freeway in order to prevent the demand from exceeding the capacity of the freeway. However, the time that a ramp metering system can be active is limited. The use of navigation systems can also help reduce congestion. More and more road users have the possibility to use navigation systems in their car. These navigation systems are currently only designed to find the fastest route to a destination. But the possibilities for data exchange with these systems are increasing. A very interesting subject of study will be to examine the possibilities of combining the world of DTM and navigation systems in order to optimize the performance of the network which would lead to a reduction in vehicle loss hours. This issue takes a central place in the research in this report. The main question is to develop a routing control system that is able to improve the network performance by better utilizing the storage capacity of the on-ramps by rerouting road users at the secondary road network. This research is undertaken by first analysing the problem of limited storage space from a traffic management and control engineering point of view. This is followed by the development of a routing control system that should improve the network performance and finally the network performance is tested in an example model to verify the expectations. From a traffic management point of view the main problem is an exceeding of the flow capacity of the freeway. This is due to the sum of the flow on the freeway and the flow of the on-ramp being greater than the freeway’s capacity. As an intervention, the ramp flow is limited by the ramp metering system, but this can only be done very briefly, due to the limitation in the available storage space at the on-ramp (to prevent spill back onto the secondary road network). To increase this time, the storage capacity can be increased by a physical increase of the length of the on-ramp, the flow of the freeway can be decreased (by coordination of upstream on-ramps for example) or the demand of the on-ramp can be decreased. This decrease of the ramp demand could theoretically be obtained by rerouting traffic by the use of data of the ramp metering systems, in in-car navigation systems as is the subject of this study. To be able to reroute drivers a control system has to be set. The target of this control system is to improve the network performance by giving some alternative route advice. To achieve a realistic alternative some information of the driver is needed (current location and route to his destination) and information of the network should be used (network topology and actual flows and speeds of the various roads). Based on this information the controller itself can be elaborated. In this controller the following four steps can be distinguished: - Determination of problems at the various on-ramps In order to be able to choose between rerouting traffic or not, an estimation of the potential problem at the on-ramp needs to be made. To be able to come to a good approximation of the network situation, a prediction model must be used. From this prediction it can be determined if there is a problem at the on-ramp. There is a problem if the size of the queue exceeds the critical queue length. This critical queue length is a threshold level that is some vehicles below the maximum. - Select vehicles that contribute to that problem Based on the determination of the problem, all vehicles (with a navigation system) that contribute to this problem can be selected in the network. - Search for realistic route alternatives An alternative route needs to be searched for the vehicles that contribute to the problem. This alternative route needs to comply with two conditions: o Additional travel time with respect to original route should be below the threshold difference (for example 5 minutes) o No problems at the alternative route (queue length at possible other on-ramp also below the critical threshold level) should occur - Reroute vehicles If all the conditions, mentioned above, are complied with, vehicles will be rerouted to prevent the queue at the on-ramp from exceeding the critical queue length. Finally the performance of the control system is tested in an evaluation study. The routing control system has improved the network performance at the various scenarios. As expected the storage capacity of the various on-ramps was better utilized and that results in a delayed occurrence of the queue at the freeway. The size of the improvements depends greatly on the availability of realistic route alternatives. A network is needed with various routes to the freeway with a small difference in the travel times between the various routes. The performance also depends on the distribution of the traffic over the various routes and especially the on-ramps. The greater the differences in the ramp demands, the worse the coordination of the on-ramps become to achieving the optimal result itself. This is due to the limitation in the minimal ramp flow and the variations in the size of the storage capacities at the various on-ramps. Besides the network performance the travel time reliability has also improved. The travel time reliability is the variance in the travel time over a certain route within the model period. The reliability is better, since the travel times vary to a lesser degree and the maximum travel time is decreased. Due to the largest variation in the travel time of vehicles at the freeway (because of the queue at the freeway) the improvement in the reliability of the travel time of road users that do not have to pass an on-ramp is the greatest. It can be recommended to further research this topic. The scope of this study is limited to rerouting traffic from the main on-ramp under the conditions that have been mentioned above. Maybe other road users can also be rerouted (traffic freeway, road users with an upstream on-ramp on their route) to improve the network performance. Driver behaviour (acceptance of additional travel time, proportion of drivers with access to a navigation system, willingness to follow of alternative route advice) is also a potential topic for further investigation. Besides that an additional evaluation can be done to obtain extensive conclusions and the possibilities to implement the system in practise should be researched further.","ramp metering; navigation systems; route advice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Traffic management","",""

(mentor); Scarano, F. (mentor)","2014","Measurement rate limitations of time-resolved 3D-3C velocity measurements by tomographic PIV limit application of the technique to small measurement volumes and low speed flows (~10 m/s). To reduce the challenging repetition rate requirements historically set by the Nyquist criterion, in the present thesis work a novel method is proposed, combining PIV measurements with numerical simulation of the vorticity transport equation using a hybrid vortex particle discretization. The principle of the time-supersampling method is that the spatial information available by the measurements can be leveraged to increase the temporal-resolution. The solution of the governing equations is based on the Vortex-in-Cell (VIC) method and the unsteady numerical simulation of the temporal evolution of the measured flow is applied within the 3D measurement domain. Both forward and backward time-integration is performed between pairs of consecutive measurements. The accuracy of the proposed time-supersampling method is studied with two experimental datasets obtained from time-resolved tomographic PIV measurements: a turbulent wake, and a circular jet. The results are compared to linear interpolation, advection-based supersampling, and measurement data at high sampling rate. In both flows the ability to reconstruct detailed temporal dynamics from data sampled at a rate far below the Nyquist frequency is demonstrated. The study demonstrates that measurement rate requirements can be strongly reduced when the measurements are super-sampled with the proposed time-supersampling method, thereby extending the range of application of tomographic PIV. In addition, an alternative application of the approach in the field of noise reduction and application to instantaneous measurements is illustrated. The latter can on the one hand allow for a significantly improved predictor for fluid trajectory correlation methods and on the other hand when validated can pose a radically simplified approach for calculation of the instantaneous and unsteady pressure field from single tomographic PIV snapshots, in comparison to multi-pulse systems.","Tomographic PIV; Navier-Stokes; Particle Image Velocimetry; CFD; Vortex-in-Cell; Turbulence; Unsteady; Temporal resolution; Data Assimilation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics","","","",""

(mentor); Loth, M. (mentor)","2014","The summary of the problem: Boarding school compounds in Kenya have organic resources, subdivided in humanure, kitchen leftovers and manure. Focus is on the humanure (faeces and the urine), which turns out to be the biggest resource stream. In current waste disposal systems energy potential and soil nutrients are spoiled. An example is a compound of 1000 students in the age category of 12 to 18 years producing 1500 litre excreta a day. The faeces equal a potential of 27-m3 biogas /day. This amount of energy is 8% of the daily energy need. The biogas production increases if co-digestion with other organic resources is executed; up to 20% is in reach. If realized, it will lead to cost savings on the use of cooking wood. Open defecation is practiced and the humanure is collected in pits or sewage tanks scattered all over the compound. Once full expensive disposal services are needed. Pit latrines are prone to flooding in rainy seasons, but in general these facilities cause strong odour and indecent appearances on the compound. Sub-problem: extensive use of cooking wood which feeds deforestation. This leads to the point of departure from the design phase into the design challenge. The challenge is finding alternatives for pit latrine and sewage tank use with existing SimGas technology. The company has developed and introduced a biogas-generating product that is modular and scalable to the market. The GesiShamba digester and anaerobic digestion technology will be used as starting point. The solution for the problem: This project sets a normative vision for the future and sketches the goal for a socio technical system of a school compound to be achieved. The desired scenario can be seen in the system maps above, whereby eventually a complete organic circular economy will be is established. The main elements of this system will be urine separation technologies, a biogas digester system and processing equipment on the compound to sanitize the humanure or excreta. The out coming substrate out of thee processes will be input for soil enrichment and farming land activities. The users still are the spill of the system. Next section will elaborate on the central element in the system: the the humanure carrousel. It is a crucial element in the system. Instead of numerous pits on the compound, a shuffle will take place in the organisation and planning. A circular form is the foundation of the concepts. In this way the faeces inlets are situated towards the centre point of the circle to support an important guideline, which is limiting the use of piping and tubing from the toilets to reactor in order to prevent possible clogging in the capture phase.","biogas sanitation; Kenya; latrine design; SimGas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-02-12","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Lodewijks, G. (mentor); Negenborn, R.R. (mentor); van Schuylenburg, M (mentor)","2014","Over the past decades there has been an increasing demand in global containerized transport. Because of this demand the Port of Rotterdam was forced to expand its Maasvlakte 1 with the new Maasvlakte 2. It is expected that in 2040 the combined Maasvlakte 1 + 2 will handle at least 30 million TEU, which is almost four times as much as the entire Port of Rotterdam is handling now [10]. With this rise in container transport and new container terminals being built at the Maasvlakte 2, there will also be a rise in Inter Terminal Transport (ITT). Inter terminal transport is the transport of containers between terminals in a port. The ITT system for the Maasvlakte is being analyzed within the project \Inter-terminal transport on Maasvlakte 1 and 2 in 2030 - Towards a multidisciplinary and innovative approach on future inter-terminal transport options."". It is a joint project between Delft University of Technology, Erasmus University Rotterdam and the Port of Rotterdam Authority. The goal of the project is to develop innovative, non-conventional concepts for ITT for the port of Rotterdam. Within this project, expected transport demand scenarios for 2030 have been defined by Rick Jansen [27]. An integer programming model was used by Frans Nieuwkoop [41] to find rough estimations of the optimal transport configurations for the given transport demand scenarios. The question that remains is \Which of the defined ITT vehicle configurations is the best configuration seen from an operational perspective?""...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-02-10","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

The key lies in the fact that they are brand-based thinkers. Brand Sync helps these talented designers by improving their ability to perceive and understand the world from the point-of-view of the brand. By using metaphorical associations, the tool helps bring a new and meaningful perspective to what the brand’s role in the life of its customers could be and how to manifest it in everything it does.","brand-based thinking; design tool; metaphors; associative thinking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2014","The countries who have signed the Malta convention in 1992 are committed to preserve in situ archeological sites instead of excavating them and wasting them for future generations. Unfortunately there are no tools available to predict the impact of civil engineering constructions on buried archeological sites. This report is focused on the mechanical behavior of charred organic matter. Small charred organic particles (seeds, nut shells or wood fragments) are among the most vulnerable archeological remains that are often investigated in archeological studies. Their study reveals, for example, information on the way of subsidence of former generations or help to determine the degree of conservation of an archeological site. Assemblies of charred particles were subjected, mixed on not with sand to 1D compression tests to understand the influence of void ratio, particle size distribution and the protective function of surrounding soil (sand) on particle damage. To characterize the integrity of the particles during scanning, we scanned a sample at several stages of loading in a micro-CT scanner. We assumed that particles fragmented in small pieces have lost their archeological value since they cannot be recovered during traditional archeological survey by sieving. As we had a limited source of real archeological charred particles, we investigated the possibility of using analogs (processed cereals) in trial mechanical tests. We assessed the resemblance between both materials by comparing their responses to individual crushing tests. We also investigated the possibility to reconstitute mixtures of clay and charcoal with a geotechnical centrifuge. The following conclusions have been drawn. When loading a sample of charcoal particles to 320 kPa in steps of 80 kPa, first rearrangement of the particles takes place. The particles will compact until failure occurs. The deformations of the particles vary from tensile failure, indenting neighboring particles, splitting and crushing of the individual particles. The maximum force which an individual particle can bear is about 0.012N. The analog material tested during this project is weaker than the material of interest so we can conclude that if the analog material can bear a certain force the charcoal will definitely stay intact under such conditions. The different conditions such as void ratio, magnitudes and strength of the particles play an important role in preservation.","1D loading compression charred particles","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Secion Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2014","Huisman is a globally operating company producing mainly innovative equipment for the offshore industry. Fujian Huisman Steel Manufacturing or Huisman China is one of the production facilities of Huisman. Huisman China has grown enormously the last 6 years. This has consequences for the production and the coordination. Most problem are visible in the production stage however the problem itself come from the coordination of production, resulting in non-specific work orders/planning, moderate overview, poor traceability of material and difficulty to focus with as consequences room for improvement in efficiency of used resources. It is not a single problem that causes these problems at Huisman China but a combination of factors, starting with the output of engineering up to the way of coordinating production. The engineering structure is currently flat, no hierarchy in drawings nor partslists. The drawings can contain multiple weldments and assemblies. Planning department assigns resources and coordinates all fabrication, except single part production. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is used for this coordination, containing tasks and material. The tasks/work orders are based on the engineering output. Since work orders are based on drawings, also one work order can be for multiple weldments, even though the weldments have different routing and demand times. Resulting in a material demand that is too high for the ongoing activities, material is laying in the workshops without being necessary causing bad overview and an inefficient single part production. Currently most delay for production occurs through missing material and incorrect work orders. In planning no difference is made between the fabrication that demand most of the resources and simpler activities, all tasks are listed in one Work Breakdown Structure including the related material. But production can be seen as two steps, creating the Main Structure, the basis of an order and expanding/outfitting the Main Structure with added material…","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-02-06","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Roscam Abbing, E. (mentor)","2014","SimGas provides households in developing countries with clean and affordable energy and sanitation solutions that improve their lives and income positions. Their solution is domestic biogas plants. In March 2012, SimGas launched their first affordable, domestic biogas plant in Tanzania, by Joint Venture SimGas East Africa Ltd. Next on the agenda is to develop new applications of biogas plants and to expand to other regions. This study looks into the possibilities of expansion to Gujarat, India, ultimately paving the way for pilots of SimGas biogas plants in Gujarat, India. The main research question is: How to develop an introduction strategy in the biogas market in Gujarat, India, for the current products offered by SimGas, such that it that meets the local context and such that it allows for a financially sustainable business? There are three partial solutions to the research question: 1) The identified potential customers: The identified potential customer groups are: Customer group 1: Lower-middle class households holding cattle Customer group 2: Mid-middle class households holding cattle Customer group 3: Upper-middle class households holding cattle Customer group 4: Lower-middle class households living in peri-urban areas Customer group 5: Mid-middle class households living in urban areas Customer group 6: SMEs situated in urban areas 2) SimGas’ best response to the needs of the identified customer groups: The propositions for rural, small-holder households in lower-middle class and possibly mid-middle class (i.e., customer groups 1 and 2) are: ? Lower-income class customers purchase a SimGas biogas plant that has been granted an additional subsidy as part of a rural development program of a local NGO. The customer pays a ‘symbolic’ amount that guarantees ownership. ? Customers rent SimGas biogas plants from their local dairy cooperative, according to their needs and available physical and financial resources (which differ per season). The local dairy cooperative gains ownership. ? Joint families and neighboring households purchase a SimGas biogas plant (at their local dairy cooperative) to share. They can thereby split the costs, split the loan, split demand by cooking together, and together provide for sufficient plant feed (which is limited for rural lower-middle class). The propositions for rural, small-holder households in mid-middle class and upper-middle class (i.e., customer groups 2 and 3) are: ? Customers purchase SimGas biogas plants at their local dairy cooperative and thereby gain ownership of the biogas plant. ? Chiefs (who belong to customer group 3) are given a fee in exchange for demonstrations to their villagers. The propositions for urban SMEs (i.e., customer group 6) are: ? SMEs purchase the SimGas biogas plants directly from SimGas’ Joint Venture (see Introduction Strategy). The SMEs are given a fee in exchange for organized demonstrations for employees and guests. ? Larger SMEs are offered sets of multiple biogas plants (up to a certain, workable extent) to meet the higher demand of cooking fuel. ? SMEs without garden are offered to sell their slurry to SimGas. 3) An introduction strategy for SimGas: The proposed introduction strategy involves propositions for a partnerships and the necessary tactics to allow for an introduction of SimGas biogas plants in Gujarat: In the first one and a half years, ? In cooperation with Finish Society – a local NGO (Non-Governmental Organization) that is active in the provision of sanitation solutions with financial inclusion, SimGas set up pilots that are stationed at several dairy cooperatives throughout Gujarat. In the meantime, SimGas acquires subsidy approval which allows SimGas to set competitive prices to make their products affordable for the potential customer groups. ? SimGas establishes a Joint Venture (JV) together with Finish Society. The JV partners with local dairy cooperatives and NGOs to provide access to the identified customer groups. The JV is responsible for distribution, installation, training and after-sales service to ensure product and service quality. ? The JV targets the rural customer groups first, within which the upper-middle class is prioritized, followed by the mid-middle class and the lower-middle class. This sequence accords with the socio-cultural phenomenon where lower classes generally feel strong aspiration towards the class above them. ? The first sales are made to the chiefs of rural villages, who belong to the upper-middle class. Their biogas plants act in demonstrations targeted at the lower- and mid-middle class, who are likely follow the chief’s example. In the following three years, ? From the identified urban customer groups, the SMEs are targeted first as SMEs conveniently provide for exposure. This facilitates the transition to the (peri-)urban customer groups . ? The JV establishes a partnership with SEWA MHT – a well-known local women’s association that facilitates access to services regarding housing, energy and finance – to gain access to the (peri-)urban customers. The implementation of the proposed solutions and corresponding introduction strategy will: ? Provide SimGas with a strong competitive position in the Gujarat biogas market as they offer products that have the best price-quality ratio available, while partnering with local dairy cooperatives that are part of a widespread and prestigious network. The partnership provides access to the rural customer groups, strengthens the SimGas brand and forms a protective shield against IP theft and undesirable political interference. On the long run, it will open doors to new business opportunities within and beyond Gujarat. ? Provide the customer groups with propositions that are tailored to their needs, their local context and to their physical and financial resources. This contributes to building and restoring customer trust and customer loyalty, which allows SimGas to offer newly developed biogas applications to the same customers. ? Create a market for biogas plants in urban areas where SimGas gains the position of the trailblazer. Although seemingly risky, this will create new opportunities worth exploring. ? Enrich potential partners with SimGas’ reliable, international network that works strictly by high quality standards in product development as well as in business development. ? Will attract investors that can boost product introduction and further product development as a result of SimGas’ efforts in Gujarat.","Introduction Strategy; Strategic Product Design; Biogas; India","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2014","At the chair of Space Systems Engineering, students and staff work on the development of small propulsion systems in a wide thrust capability. Especially in recent years low thrust propulsion systems have gained an increased amount of interest in the entire department of Space Engineering. To support the development of these propulsion systems, there is a need for the testing of micropropulsion systems that provide a thrust in the 1 ?N to 5 mN range. This capability complements the existing measurement equipment of the Delft Aerospace Rocket Thrust Stand facility of 0.5 mN to 1 N. To provide a solution to this need, the research question for this research is phrased as: ""How can the DARTS facility be upgraded to measure thrust levels in the 1 ?N to 5 mN range and impulse bits in the 1 ?Ns to 1 mNs range?"". Using numerical modelling the answer to that question is found in an upgraded design of the TB-2m thrust stand that was developed in 2010 by Perez-Grande. By introducing several improvements, amongst which are the replacement of the sensor system by a capacitive displacement sensor and the use of a segmented counter mass, the range of the TB-2m has been extended and the accuracy has been improved to meet the new requirements. A complementary calibration system is designed that allows an in situ calibration for the measurement of both the thrust and impulse bits. Where typical calibration actuators supply a force that is non-linear with engagement distance and have to rely on displacement measurements to linearize the calibration force, the new actuator is able to provide a force that is independent on the distance to the target. Using a specially designed solenoid that has a linearly varying turn-density along its length, the magnetic field is shaped to provide a constant magnetic gradient. The thrust stand and calibration system are manufactured and tested. Using a previously tested cold gas thruster that is provided by Bradford Engineering, the complete thrust measurement system is validated with hardware-in-the-loop. This process has shown that the pendulum is in a state constant of oscillation. It is expected that this oscillation is removed by the introduction of a Foucault damper in the next design iteration. The validation process has shown that the thrust range is on par with the requirements. Also impulse bits can be measured, but the constant state of oscillation prohibited the detection of the smallest impulse bits of 1 ?Ns. Future experiments have to show whether the required and predicted accuracies are achieved.","thrust; measurement; thrust stand; micropropulsion; variable turn-density coil; micro propulsion; calibration; actuator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-02-06","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Space Systems Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2014","The pharmaceutical industry has been spending an increasing amount of money on R&D over the years. However, fewer drugs have been approved by the FDA and the EMA recently. This lack in innovation performance is a problem which needs to be solved in order to continue finding medicines for cureless diseases. Innovation lies at the heart of the problem. It is for this reason that we need to understand more about the innovation management of the pharmaceutical industry. The scientific literature is scattered and a more general list of critical factors would help in improving the innovation performance of these companies. Therefore the main question of this thesis is defined as: “What are the internal critical success factors for innovation management in the pharmaceutical industry?” This thesis includes an explorative research by interviewing fifteen managers of drug developing companies in the Leiden Bio Science Park in the Netherlands. During these interviews the focus was put on five factors; knowledge processes, knowledge network, motivation, innovation performance and company characteristics. The results show that there is a sharp distinction between large pharmaceutical companies and Small and Medium Sized Biopharmaceutical/Biotechnology Enterprises (SMBEs). These differences are mostly found in the knowledge processes, the knowledge networks and in the motivation of research employees. Also, three R&D phases can be distinguished by looking at the same focus points. The results presented in this research come from a small dataset. In further research it is recommended to measure the same aspects on a larger scale confirming the findings of this research. Also innovation performance can then be measured more accurately and related to the found critical factors.","knowledge management; absorptive capacity; motivation; innovation performance; pharmaceutical industry; biotechnology; small and medium sized enterprises","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of Technology and Innovation","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor)","2014","Seaway Heavy Lifting is an offshore contractor that transports, installs and decommissions offshore oil and gas platforms and offshore wind turbines. During transport, objects need to be secured on the deck, the so-called seafastening. In particular for parts of offshore wind turbines, called Transition Pieces, this proves to be difficult. The Transition Pieces are on average 25 m high tubular structures and weight 300 mT. The outside is covered with a special coating and various attachments, such as boat landings, ladders, and anodes for corrosion protection. The inside of the Transition Pieces contains various structures and equipment, such as groutskirts, shear keys, J-tubes and internal platforms. Seaway Heavy Lifting currently uses clamps on the lower flange to secure the Transition Pieces in an upright position to the deck of the ship. This causes relative high stresses in the flange and weld and turned out to be a critical limiting factor during transportation for several projects. Due to this limitation, the workability of the vessels is suboptimal. Many other offshore contractors use the same or similar method of clamping the lower flange to the deck. A new method for seafastening Transition Pieces is proposed to improve the securing strength, the safety, and workability of the vessels. This new method comprises of a tubular element, much like the monopile on which the Transition Piece will stand once on offshore location, welded onto the grillage. The Transition Piece can then be lifted over this tubular element. Mounted on the tubular element are hydraulic cylinders that extend outwards towards the inner wall of the Transition Piece. By exerting a force to the inner wall, the Transition Piece is effectively secured to the vessel. This method avoids using the rather weak lower flange. Strength calculations have shown that this new method can withstand accelerations and accompanying forces caused by the ships motions that are nearly twice as high as the current method allows. Because the new method is fully automated, it requires no manual labour and the seafastening can be activated and deactivated quickly, thus saving critical crane time. It also reduces the time frame where the Transition Pieces stands on the deck unsecured, as is the case with the current method which uses clamps and bolts, thus improving safety. This thesis covers the invention of the new method, calculating the critical structural parts, and detailing those element that are crucial to the design. Currently, a patent applications is pending.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""
