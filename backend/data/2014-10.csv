(mentor); Van de Geer, S.G. (mentor); Chen, F. (mentor)","2014","This report discusses the development of a foldable baby bed for the consumer market in the UK. It is executed for Oxford Space Structures Ltd. as a graduation project for Industrial Design Engineering at the Delft University of Technology. A folding mechanism extracted from an ESA patent serves as the starting point for this project. It is developed from early sketches up to a functioning prototype. The approach to the project is based on design methods from Roozenburg and Eekels, Verganti and Hekkert and Van Dijk. In the end a reflection considers both the product and the process. Technical analysis of the mechanism, competitor analysis in the UK market and user research with UK parents concluded the following: - Ease of folding and deploying is the Unique Selling Point - The product should be marketed towards use in and around the house; not as a travel cot but as a home cot - Safety standards set elaborate requirements for market entry The concept of fabric in hanging in a frame is optimal for strength and stiffness combined with low weight. Both fabric and mattress fold in along with the structure. This allows the product to be ready for use or stored away within seconds. Specific attention is given to the hinges and connections in the frame; the functionality and feasibility of the concepts is key. Several 1:1 models test and validate the working principles and lead to a prototype that provides a proof of concept. A last problem with the synchronized folding of the structure is solves in the final design proposal. The final design consists of a lightweight aluminium bars, connected by plastic parts. The ring shaped hinges in the middle act as use cues for locking the product in deployed position. Their internal mechanism allows secure assembly and proper functioning whilst keeping a smooth outer surface for safety. The fabric hanging by the rim of the frame allows folding into a 150mm flat package and give the product its distinct shape.","Travel Cot; baby care; hinges; space technology; baby bed; VIP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2014","Al jaren bestaat er het dilemma hoe er omgegaan zou moeten worden met achterstandsbuurten. Al in 1961 betoogt Jane Jacobs dat een zo groot mogelijke diversiteit wat betreft bevolking, functies en architectuur bijdragen aan een goede wijk. Door deze diversiteit zullen levendigheid, creativiteit, veiligheid en sociale interactie bevordert worden. Een goede plaatsing van wijkeconomie in de woonwijk kan deze waarden sterk naar voren laten komen vanwege de sociale voordelen die het met zich mee brengt. Zo wordt het sociaal kapitaal binnen de woonwijk vergroot en komt er meer activiteit op straat door de aanloop van de ondernemingen. Hierdoor ontstaan er meer ontmoetingsplekken in de wijk en is er meer sociale controle. Daarnaast houden ondenemers zich bezig met het schoon, heel en veilig houden van hun omgeving. Het blijkt dat ‘zien ondernemen is doen ondernemen’. Er ontstaat een meer stimulerende omgeving voor de bewoners van de wijk. De wijk en buurt die dienen als casus voor het onderzoek zijn de wijk Carnisse met daarin gelegen de Eilandenbuurt in Rotterdam-Zuid. Deze wijk wordt in zijn geheel geduid als achterstandswijk. De vraag is hoe een goede plaatsing van wijkeconomie hier vorm zal kunnen krijgen. De hoofdvraag die de basis vormt voor dit onderzoeksrapport luidt daarom als volgt: hoe kan er door middel van architectuur ruimte gecreëerd worden voor ondernemingen in de wijk Carnisse op een manier die aansluit bij de behoeften van de wijk met haar bewoners en ondernemers? Om daar antwoord op te kunnen geven door middel van een ontwerp is er eerst onderzoek gedaan naar hoe de huidige ondernemers zich organiseren binnen de woonwijk. Aan de hand van twaalf interviews met ondernemers uit de wijk Carnisse zijn er zes thema’s naar voren gekomen die belangrijk zijn voor de ondernemers van de woonwijk. Zo blijken reprociteit in sociale controle, mogelijke adaptiviteit van de benodigde ruimte, de ontsluiting van de locatie en de reikwijdte van de onderneming wat betreft het klantenbestand belangrijk. Ook de gecreëerde overgang tussen de openbare ruimte en de onderneming en de relatie tussen de ‘back’en de ‘front’ van de onderneming blijken belangrijke karaktereigenschappen van de bedrijven te zijn. Om de ondernemer als belangrijke actor voor het creëren van levendigheid, creativiteit, veiligheid en sociale interactie in de wijk te behouden of naar de wijk toe te krijgen, zijn deze waarden meegenomen in het maken van een ontwerp. Om het doel van het verbeteren van de situatie in een achterstandswijk te kunnen bereiken is er gekozen om een lint van ondernemingen te realiseren haaks op de bestaande bebouwing. Hiermee worden de sociale voordelen zoveel mogelijk verspreid over de buurt, maar wordt er toch geclusterd in een lint vanwege de economische voordelen die dit voor de ondernemingen heeft. Doordat het lint dwars door de bestaande bebouwing zal snijden, worden meerdere binnenterreinen openbaar. Deze binnenterreinen zijn met elkaar verbonden door een visuele as van het ene binnenterrein naar het andere. Dit versterkt het cluster, de spreiding en de identiteit. De huidige straatprofielen blijven zoveel mogelijk in tact. De ondernemingen zullen zich midden in de woonstraten bevinden, waardoor de controle op straat heel direct is en de bewoners de ondernemingen regelmatig vluchtig contact zullen hebben met de voorbijgaande bewoners. Het opensnijden van de binnenterreinen biedt ruimte voor extra parkeergelegenheid en een kleine publieke ruimte voor ontmoeting. De samenvoeging van bedrijfsruimtes is mogelijk en bij uitbreiding zullen de ‘back’ en de ‘front’ meer gescheiden kunnen functioneren. De ruimte voor uiting van bedrijven in de publieke ruimte zal worden aangegeven door bouwkundige elementen. Een lint is de uiteindelijke vorm die het ontwerp aan zou kunnen nemen. Er zal gestart worden met de ingreep in twee van de huidige bouwstroken. Deze ingreep kan op zichzelf functioneren en bij succes zal in het volgende blok weer een ingreep plaats kunnen vinden. Er kan voor gekozen worden de grootte van de ruimtes aan te passen naar de vraag. Zo kan het lint langzaam groeien op basis van de vraag en de behoefte aan het soort ruimte. Belangrijk is dat een enkele ingreep op zichzelf kan functioneren. Het is trial-and-error-architectuur. De voorgestelde oplossing is een basis waarop in de praktijk lichte variaties aangebracht kunnen worden als de vraag naar ruimte veranderd. Het lint groeit naar behoefte van de buurt met haar ondernemers en bewoners. Het ontwerp is een volgende schakel zin de ketting van ontwerpen voor (achterstands)buurten op basis van de ideeën van Jane Jacobs. Het lint zal de sociale interactie in de buurt vergroten, de veiligheid op straat verbeteren en de activiteit die ondernemingen met zich meebrengen zullen de levendigheid vergroten. Bewoners zullen zich weer thuis gaan voelen in hun eigen buurt door de groeiende soicale binding met hun woonomgeving.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Veldacademie","",""

(mentor); Hermans, L. (mentor); Van de Giesen, N. (mentor)","2014","The thesis presents a study on the inequities in drinking water access and its consequent impact on drinking water security in three peri-urban villages around the city of Hyderabad in India namely, Gagillapur, Chintalcheru and Erdhanoor. It explains the existing drinking water situation and the reason behind existence of inequities in accessing drinking water in the three study areas. Field research was conducted in the three villages in which mainly qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews and participatory observations. The social and economic setting of the villages and the impact of urbanization on the access to drinking water was studied. The study showed that that even though all three villages have similar peri-urban characteristics, the scale of drinking water security differed by a vast magnitude. The main factors that affect drinking water security have been identified as the caste and ethnicity, process of urbanization and the existing institutions. Erdhanoor displayed a highly fragmented society where a person’s caste determined his access to drinking water resources whereas Gagillapur and Chintalcheru did not have any visible discrimination in water access due to caste. The on-going urbanization process has led to depleting ground water levels, increasing population density, pollution of surface and ground water and changing social and economic scenario of the peri urban areas. With respect to institutions, I found that the Panchayat is responsible for deciding the supply and distribution of drinking water in all three villages. In Gagillapur, the main drinking water source is through vendors who sell water in 20 litre cans. In Chintalcheru, drinking water is supplied via a piped distribution system after treating the ground water with chlorine. Erdhanoor village is supplied with two sources of drinking water – ground water and water from the municipality in Hyderabad as the village is classified as a highly polluted zone. From this research it is seen that water access is deeply rooted in the existing institutions, relevant communities, the social, economic and geographical setting of the area. The peri-urban context of the study throws light on the changing environment, social structures, institutions and beliefs and their consequent effect on access to drinking water. This research also throws light on the fact that access to drinking water in these villages is largely determined by the complex web of power, politics and money and how institutions tend to tilt in favor of the rich and the powerful","drinking water security; peri urban; India","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor)","2014","This master thesis is concerned with optimal boundary point and function control problems for linear elliptic equations subject to control constraints. The elliptic partial differential equation with Robin boundary condition is considered. The control is chosen as a linear combination of the Dirac delta functions in the point control problem. The weak formulation and optimality conditions are obtained for the function control problem. The main goal is to examine the existence of the weak solution and to derive optimality conditions of boundary point control. Introducing sufficient discretization methods such as a finite volume and a finite element methods, we obtain finite dimensional problem. We apply efficient numerical methods including primal-dual active set strategy, projected gradient and conjugate gradient methods. The test examples are presented clarifying the performance of numerical methods mentioned earlier. The conjugate gradient method is compared to the unconstrained matlab function QUADPROG and primal-dual active set strategy is compared to the constrained QUADPROG. The projected conjugate gradient method is applied to improve the projected gradient method. Due to its importance, the sparse point and function control problems are studied. We apply primal-dual active set strategy where the sparse parameter f is chosen differently. All of the results are presented in both point and function control problems.","Optimal control of partial differential equations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-02-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","Erasmus Mundus COSSE","",""

(mentor)","2014","The goal of this thesis, to assess the potential of a new silica-based nanoparticle to increase foam viscosity in a porous medium, has been achieved. A method was developed to reduce filtration effects which allowed the conduction of repeatable foam-scan experiments in a laboratory. Through conduction of multiple core-flooding experiments it has been observed that adding nanoparticles with a concentration of 5 g/L did indeed enhance foam viscosity for cases where the nanoparticles were able to flow through the core. The particles were able to flow through the Bentheimer Sandstone with a permeability of around 2 Darcy, and the Mergel Chalk with a permeability of around 5,5 Darcy. The Estaillades Limestone with a permeability of around 0.1 Darcy proved to be difficult for the particles to flow through. Therefore the nanoparticle foam was not found to be more viscous when flowing through this medium. Through the conduction of a secondary experiment drainage reduction was found to be a mechanism with which nanoparticles enhance foam strength. In an experiment where drainage was measured, nanoparticle foam was found to be up to 300% more wet than non-nanoparticle foam under the same conditions, indicating slower drainage. Therefore it is believed that also in a porous medium these particles help to reduce the rate at which foam lamellae are drained. The effect on foam viscosity of changing salt concentration, temperature, gas, rock type and surfactant concentration has been identified and explained. A notable outcome is that increasing surfactant concentration above CMC did not enhance viscosity but only increased the gas fractional flow at which the highest viscosity occurred. Adding nanoparticles did enhance viscosity, in the case of the Chalk very significantly. Therefore it is believed there is great potential between the synergy of surfactants and nanoparticles. Rather than simply replacing surfactants, the new silica-based particle provides a mechanism which aids foam generation in a unique way.","foam; nanoparticle; EOR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-10","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Sanabria-Walter, C. (mentor)","2014","With increasing fuel prices and growing interest in environmentally friendly transportation the aerospace industry has set ambitious targets for all electric flight. At the same time there is growing interest in the rotorcraft market that is expected to grow significantly in the next decades. Although the technology for all-electric flight is not yet mature, hybrid solutions for aircraft and rotorcraft are suggested. A hybrid helicopter concept has been suggested by Airbus Group Innovations, which is designed to reduce the operational fuel costs through a serial hybrid powertrain. One of the main components of such a powertrain is the main rotor electric drive. The main limiting factor of using electrical machines for aerospace propulsion however is the limited torque density of electrical machines. Electrical machines consist of the active material and structural support material that keeps a machine together and both parts are of great importance in achieving high torque densities. A solution consisting of a high pole number, segmented stator, large diameter, low air-gap, flux switching machine has been suggested as the main motor of the hybrid helicopter. Stator segments of this machine are individually suspended utilizing air-bearings. This thesis focuses on examining the behavior of such a stator support concept and the feasibility of achieving a very low air-gap in a large diameter machine through coupled electromagnetic and structural finite element simulations. First an electromagnetic finite element model of the machine is created and a thorough analysis of different resulting forces for various air-gap lengths and operating conditions is conducted. After the electromagnetic forces are investigated, a structural model of the machine and the existing support structure is created. Structural behavior is examined with a weak coupling between the structural and the electromagnetic models. Modal analysis of the structure is also conducted to get an overview of the dynamic behavior. The simulation results in standstill are then compared to experimental measurements. Finally, using the conclusions of the investigation, a new lightweight support concept is designed and analyzed. Total machine weight and performance estimation with this new concept is performed.","hybrid helicopter; weak coupling; electrical machines; structural analysis; aircraft propulsion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Processing","","Electrical Power Engineering","",""

The supplier development program is designed to create and maintain a network of competent suppliers, which has a major influence on the competitive advantages of a buying company. The existing literatures on supplier development all adopt “one-size-fit-all” strategies. However, to allocate scarce resources more efficiently suppliers need to be strategically segmented and improved by tailored strategies. Moreover, a strong and close supplier-buyer relationship, to a great extent depending on supplier willingness, also plays a key role for buying companies to achieve lead position in the market. However, the existing literatures usually only focus on supplier capabilities development while neglect supplier willingness improvement. To address these practical problems, this research proposes a strategic method that considers capabilities and willingness as two dimensions for segmenting and developing suppliers and links supplier development to supplier segmentation to achieve an effective and efficient supplier development. In the proposed methodology, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) using fuzzy preference programming (FPP) and Best-Worst Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Method are utilized to solve the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem of supplier evaluation. A supplier development conceptual model is proposed to develop suppliers in different segments. The proposed framework is further applied in a real world case with experience from a mid-size high tech company as input to validate the model.","supplier segmentation; supplier development; AHP; fuzzy AHP using FPP; BWM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport and Logistics","","Management of Technology","",""

The title of the project is: Adaptaball - The design of a product to train the adaptability of football players In the past football players trained in general on natural turf pitch, and nowadays mostly on artificial turf. These surfaces differ from each other; the ball interaction on the one is not the same on the other. Natural turf can cause the ball to move unexpectedly. On artificial turf the interaction of the ball with the pitch is more predictable. The shift from natural more unpredictable surface to artificial predictable surface deteriorates the adaptability of the players. Adaptability is the ability to adapt to change, the change of surface, the change of ball, the change of weather condition, basically the change of anything. What Charles Darwin ones stated: “It’s not the strongest of species that survives nor the smartest that survives, it is the one most adaptable to change”. ASM adopted this and believes that if athletes are great adapters they improve their overall skills. The distilled design assignment is: Design a ball that is able to train the adaptability of young football players. Therefore “The AdaptaBall”. The potential users are basically all youth football players ranging from the amateur to the professional level from 6 to 18 years old. If the ball interaction changes the players constantly needs to adapt and improves the adaptability. The most potential to improve the adaptability is in receiving the ball. If the trajectory of the ball is manipulated the player needs to adapt and trains the adaptability during receiving the ball. Footballs consist of an outer layer of panels, an inner layer of fabric and on the inside a pressurized bladder. The panels are stitched to create the ball shape. Manipulating the elements of the ball could result in adjusted behaviour. Investigating manipulated footballs resulted that changing the centre of gravity of the ball is the most effective to create adjusted behaviour. The centre of gravity can be changed by adding material between the panels and the bladder of the ball. The selected material is silicone; the material is dens and flexible. Silicone could be inserted in regular training balls to manipulate the behaviour. The costs are low and the production method is simple. The behaviour of the ball is manipulated in three degrees of freedom, dependent on the position of the centre of gravity. The amount of silicone injected influences the level of difficulty. Three levels of difficulty are selected, to allow training different skill levels or use the ball in different training exercises. It is not investigated if the AdaptaBall improves the adaptability and therefore the overall football skills but until now it is a great success. The Dutch national team will train with the ball in November 2014.","adaptability; football; Athletic Skills Model; ball","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

The aim of this study is to perform a numerical investigation into the reflection and transmission of the different waves forcing in a porous breakwaters. There are different types of numerical models available for solving the behaviour of waves in coastal regions and harbours. The most known numerical models are Boussinesq type wave models and non-hydrostatic wave models. In this study, the non-hydrostatic approach is chosen. Last years developments shows that this approach is competitive to Boussinesq type wave models in terms of robustness and the computational resource required to attain reliable outcomes in challenging wave and flow conditions. The simulations are performed with the non-hydrostatic model called SWASH, because it is a model that still is in development a validation of the model with this study is beneficial for the development. The influence of wave conditions and breakwater characterises on the reflection and transmissions are examined. In a number of cases the influence of the porosity, wave height, wave period and the width of the breakwater on reflection are investigated. The model predictions are found to be consistent with lab experiment, analytical solutions and empirical formulations. The reflection and transmission of bound long waves were also studied. The influence of the relative depth (kh) on the reflection and transmission was investigated. The model predications on the reflection of the bound long waves are found to be consistent with lab experiment. The model prediction deviates not more than 15 percent of the experimental results. On the other hand, the transmission of short waves and bound long waves were inconsistent with lab experiment. The most likely explanation for this inconsistency is the large deviation between the breakwater geometry used in SWASH and the experiment. In SWASH it is not possible to vary the porosity in vertical direction, so it was necessary to schematize the breakwater since the used breakwater in the experiment composed of two different porosities.","SWASH; porous flow; reflection and transmission","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental fluid mechanics","",""

(mentor)","2014","CO2 emission is increasing globally, resulting in a global increase in temperature and as a result climate change. CO2 storage in the subsurface is an option/ transitional measure to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere and mitigate the climate change issue. Generally, for CO2 storage to be a viable option, it must be ensured that the stored gasses should be at least 10.000 years safe in the subsurface. Simulating long-term storage of CO2 in the laboratory for 10.000 years in storage experiments is not feasible and therefore a good option is to analyze rock samples that have naturally been exposed to CO2 for such a large time frame. Such a CO2 aquifer can be found in eolian sandstones in Utah, USA. Due to the occurrence of fractures in these sandstones, CO2 bearing water has flown through these sandstones resulting in possible reaction and carbonate precipitation in the pores. In this study, the main points of interest are the determination of volume fractions of various components like porosity, carbonate precipitation close to and far from the fractures, by the use of Micro Computed Tomography (Micro CT). Micro CT results are compared to conventional lab (macroscopic) technology. The ultimate goals of this research are gaining actual insight/ data on what the result is if CO2 storage is conducted and insight and recommendation regarding the use of Micro CT technology. The first conclusion on results regards calibration. Calibration difficulties in Micro CT technique generate noise. If calculating the fraction of components, noise has no influence on the fraction result. If connectivity analysis is conducted, noise will influence the result and should therefore be filtered. Sensitivity analysis for resolution shows that 2.5 ?m is a suitable resolution to image these eolian sandstones and the smaller the samples are the higher resolution can be acquired. Lab based methods for porosity (Pycnometer, Wet Test and Hg Shell Test) generally agree with each other. The image based methods (2D and 3D) also agree with each other. The lab based methods and image based methods do not exactly agree with each other. The correlations regarding permeability, porosity and particles per volume show exponential relations. After conducting 3D grain analysis, the effect of carbonate precipitation is quantified. Because of the precipitation between grains, the grains tend to ‘deform’, which creates higher surface area and volume. The exact influence of a fracture on carbonate precipitation can be summarized to be minimal. In the case of sample car614 the influence is clearly seen, but in all other samples the fracture seems to have had no influence or overruled by other (depositional) phenomena.","CO2; storage; micro CT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2014","When a team of autonomous mobile robots (MRs) has to perform a mission of a duration that exceeds their energy capacities, the mission can only be fulfilled if the MRs are resupplied. Nowadays most MRs are powered by batteries, which can either be recharged, or replaced. Since it is not necessary that the MRs are battery powered, we will use the general term refuelling instead of recharging. In general there are two options for MRs to refuel themselves: by travelling to a fuelling station (FS) that is situated at a fixed location, or rendezvousing with a mobile fuelling station (MFS). When multiple MRs operate in the same environment, it is desired that the MRs share the available FSs instead of each MR having its own dedicated FS. Sharing the FSs will reduce the purchase and maintenance costs, and less space will be needed for the placement of FSs. The FSs considered during this thesis, can only refuel a single robot at a time. This raises the need for properly scheduling the refuelling activities, such that the FSs are shared in an efficient manner, and depletion of the MRs can be prevented. This thesis presents several methods to schedule the refuelling activities of multiple heterogeneous autonomous MRs. The scheduling is focused on the selection of the refuel events, and the allocation of the FSs as a shared resource. The following problem is considered: For an environment which contains an arbitrary number of FSs, and MRs, the refuelling activities should be scheduled in such a way that the overall mission time is minimized. Each mission entails an assignment of a unique set of waypoints for each MR which have to be visited in a pre-determined order, in order to complete the mission. The total mission is accomplished when the last MR is completely refuelled, after visiting its last waypoint. Scheduling the refuelling activities using a time-based metric is complicated compared to a distance-based metric. Since a FS can refuel only a single MR at a time, the duration that each MR spends refuelling, and the ordering in which the MRs are refuelling have to be taken into account. Furthermore since the MRs share the FSs, each refuel event of one MR can affect all future refuel events of all other MRs. Global optimal solutions for this problem can be found by using a centralized approach as shown in this thesis. However, since all refuel events of all MRs can influence each other, the complexity increases very quickly when the problem size increases. In order to obtain a global optimum, all possible refuel events have to be taken into account. Due to the computational complexity, the problem size that can be solved by this approach is limited. In order to solve larger scale problems, a trade-off has been made between computation time and solution quality. A distributed, and hierarchical architecture are proposed, in order to distribute the computations and decision making over the robotic team. The core of the distributed approach is that MRs make individual decisions based on local knowledge. The decision making of the hierarchical approach is done for individuals or clusters of MRs. Simulation case studies indicate that these decentralized approaches can be used to solve large scale problems in real-time, at the cost of a suboptimal solution.","mobile robot; autonomous; scheduling; refuelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems and Control","",""

ADCs usually are designed to meet the application driven specifications such as dynamic range (DR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR), spurious free dynamic range (SFDR), integral and differential nonlinearities (INL and DNL). They should be as much energy efficient as possible when meeting these requirements. Thus, the focus of the ADC design was improved energy efficiency lately. Although low-to-medium resolution ADCs have been improved, high resolution ADCs still lag behind. This thesis presents an energy efficient high-resolution ADC, i.e. zoom ADC, for audio applications achieving 102dB DR 97dB SNR and 92dB SNDR while consuming only 2.07mW.

(mentor)","2014","New Product or System development in a manufacturing industry is realized through the culminated efforts of different functional units, namely the Research and Development unit, the Supply Chain unit, the Design and Engineering Team, and finally the Manufacturing and Assembly units. The Design, Engineering and Development phase is a critical part of the entire product development lifecycle since it’s a process in which conceptualized ideas of the Research and Development unit or the Technological centers are given shape in the form of the first blue prints, which is further developed into the physical structure itself. The technical complexity of realizing a new technology, the interfaces and interdependencies amongst the different functional silos of the organization and the complexity of dealing with external suppliers and vendors leads to risks in the process of product development. These risks hamper the project in terms of quality of the product or system to be achieved, cost management and the time management of the project. Therefore it is necessary to adopt and practice certain important risk management activities which helps to be prepared to face such risks. Study of literature helped to realize that it is known what risk management is, and why it should be applied. However there is a gap of knowledge of how and what are the most effective and necessary risk management activities that should be adopted and practiced. An explorative multiple case study amongst three well established manufacturing organizations was carried out to study what are the best risk management activities practiced and adopted to manage risks on grounds of technological complexities, complexities and interfaces amongst the different functional silos in the organization and the risks which arose while dealing with the suppliers and vendors. The literature was used to develop the research protocol based on the risk management lifecycle. The protocol helped to build constructive questions which was used to investigate two past executed projects from each of the organizations chosen in the sample. The cases studied had realized at least the first prototype or the concept design successfully . Theory of consolidation was used to narrow down to twenty seven risk management activities. The next step in the research was to establish the most effective combinations of risk management activities. Using the concepts of fuzzy sets qualitative comparative analysis, the independent risk management activities were dealt as input conditions and the project outcomes in the context of quality of the product developed, the cost management of the project and the time management of the project was dealt as the dependent variable. The fsQCA tool was used to carry out the analysis by framing fuzzy data sets of the different conditions catering to technological risks, internal organizational risks and the external organization in the form of suppliers and vendors. The fsQCA analysis using the set and subset theory, analyzed the maximum consistency and coverage of the different combinations of the Risk management activities. This helped to conclude on the most important risk management activities on grounds of technical risks, internal organizational risks and the external organizational risks. The qualitative judgement of the cases helped to identify certain risk management activities which is essential to be practiced in order to make the combinations of the risk activities identified by fsQCA successful. The combination of the fsQCA analysis and the qualitative judgement helped to build up the Technological Risk activity model, the Internal organizational risk activity model and the External organizational risk activity model. These mentioned risk activity model are the main deliverables of the research on managerial terms. The fsQCA and the qualitative judgement further helps to establish relations between the independent risk activities and the dependent project outcomes which can be defined as the contribution to science. The added advantages and the contributions of the risk activities on the dependent project outcomes have also been discussed in the research. The study of the past executed projects help to conclude that risk management as followed in the literature is more algorithmic in nature with pre-defined steps, whereas risk management in actual practice is more aligned in towards a project management approach. The risk management framework followed in the organization is highly influenced by the driver of the project which could be quality, cost or time management of the project. The author deduces that larger the size of the organization, the more structured and streamlined is the risk management framework. Smaller the size of the organization, more informal is the risk management. In such organizations the risk management is almost carried out from the perspective of project management. Through the research it is realized that there are no perfect risk management activities, since even after taking immense precautions and adopting a vigorous risk management framework, the project can eventually meet some un conceived risks, which might completely hamper the process of execution. Therefore the prescription model recommended in the research, would enable the organization to be well equipped to face and counter the risks that evolve in the process of product development. The risk management activities as prescribed through the model should be primarily disciplined or institutionalized in the manufacturing processes.","Risk Management Activities; Technological Risks; Internal Organizational Risks; External Organizational Risks; Project Outcomes; Quality; Cost; Time","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy, Law, Organization and Gaming","","Msc.

(mentor); Terwel, K.C. (mentor); Hordijk, D.A. (mentor)","2014","The last years have seen a few severe cases of structural damage to buildings in the Netherlands. A recent case was the shopping mall ‘t Loon in Heerlen. It would be beneficial if structural failures could be avoided, or at least be predicted. New satellite technology, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), proves that it is possible to detect structural deformation in buildings at the level of millimeters and to receive weekly updates. TU Delft has shown that for the Heerlen case, the deformation could already be detected years before the collapse. The InSAR data was also used for forensic research at Heerlen. The previously discussed developments resulted in the main research question of this thesis: How can InSAR data contribute to forensic engineering and building monitoring in general? The objective is to determine in which cases data provided by radar interferometry can be used, and how this data should be interpreted for building monitoring and forensic engineering. A literature review is conducted to identify the general properties and limitations of InSAR. To research the potential contribution to forensic engineering, an analysis of a damage database is made to determine InSAR’s potential as a forensic engineering tool. The database is assessed according to the guiding principles of forensic engineering using InSAR as laid out by this thesis: opportunistic character, large deformations and no sudden deformations. A research methodology for forensic engineering with InSAR is proposed and tested with a couple of case studies. Building monitoring is subdivided into object-driven building monitoring and data-driven building monitoring. Conventional building monitoring techniques are analysed to research the potential of InSAR as a building monitoring tool. To research object-driven building monitoring, a literature study is conducted to examine the different variables that cause building movement that influence the InSAR data. One dominant variable is analysed to research the relation between a variable and the InSAR data. To research data-driven buildings monitoring, general building limits for deformations are discussed. InSAR data of Delft, provided by the TerraSAR-x satellite, is used to analyse the potential of InSAR as a data-driven building monitoring tool. Deformation areas with very high deformation rates are examined to find out how to work with InSAR as a data-driven building monitoring tool. ? The development of the movements caused by torsion, inelastic deformation, fracture, second order effects and buckling are hard to detect with InSAR. Deformation caused by failure needs to be visible on the outer shell of the structure. Damage on the outer shell is visible to InSAR, as are damages that influence the supporting structure of the building. Deformations of the supporting structure can be damped in the outer shell; this is caused by the structural integrity. One fifth of the damage cases of the damage database have potential to be researched with InSAR. Only failures caused by aging and structural errors were suitable for research. Deformation measurements for buildings is one of the building monitoring fields in which InSAR can compete. Competitors in this field are Lidar, photogrammetry, levelling, and tachymetry. One of the main advantages of monitoring with InSAR is that large areas can be monitored with one measurement, and no one needs to be present at the site. Object-driven monitoring of buildings can be done by monitoring a building and identifying explanations for building movements. The movement of a Persistent Scatter point (PS-point) is caused by forces that work on a building and by the resistance of the building. Forces that do not change over time will not make the building move, unless there is degradation of the building elements. InSAR measurements are most suitable for vertical deflection monitoring because of the sensitivity of the satellite measurements. Factors that are suitable to monitor with InSAR are temperature, settlement and groundwater change. Data-driven monitoring is most suitable for monitoring foundation problems. The movements are often gradual over time, and large deformations limits are allowed. Attention should be paid to the translation of the top structure of the movement. Movements of 3 mm/year of a PS-point in vertical direction, or 1.5 mm/year relative to another PS-point on a building, are alarming. InSAR can become an addition to conventional monitoring techniques for building research. For forensic engineering InSAR can indicate which parts of building elements were influenced by the failure, and when deformation started to develop. InSAR can support evidence for the possible cause of the failure, when the failure is expressed in deformation. For building monitoring InSAR may support the indication of the development of deformation that may cause damage. The monitoring of vertical deformations is limited by the sensitivity and the phase ambiguity. These boundaries make InSAR most suitable for monitoring gradual deformations, often found in deformations of foundations.","InSAR; monitoring; deformation monitoring; building failure; structural failure; forensic; deformation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Design","",""

Multiphyiscal topology optimization, as applied to the problem, comes with many challenges, under which is the manufacturability of its final design. A new penalization method is proposed, that ensures that the final design contains no intermediate densities, which are common to multiphysical topology optimization, even with SIMP or RAMP penalization. The new penalization method aims at creating intermediate material that is adverse to the optimization problem, causing it to avoid intermediate material. On a test case it was shown capable of creating a well performing black and white design, where grey penalization failed to maintain the performance of the design. Furthermore, an interpretation of the adjoint in the sensitivity analysis is given.","Topology optimization; penalization; transient; Thermo-mechanical","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-30","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2014","One aspect that significantly influences the operational safety of a fast sailing vessel is its behaviour in steep stern quartering waves. Especially course stability plays a great roll when it comes to preventing uncontrollable and potentially dangerous situations in these sea states. During the design process of such a vessel, it is of interest predict its behaviour mentioned conditions, give an idea about which conditions are still save for operation and in a next step, try to maximise the set of those conditions. Due to the computational power of modern desktop computers, one way for obtaining such a prediction within a limited time frame are time domain potential ow simulations. Through reproduction of series of model tests, captive and free sailing, with and without waves, this report gives a thorough validation of such a potential ow code for following sea states up to conditions that possibly lead to a capsize of the vessel. The main conclusion is that the motions of a vessel in the tested conditions are predicted well by the simulation in all tested sea states. The risk of exceeding certain motion amplitudes is very similar in simulations and model tests. Nevertheless, there exist a couple of findings in the simulation results that are worth mentioning. The prediction of dynamic trim and sinkage is a weak point for the tested potential ow code. Vessels in the simulation consistently show larger dynamic rise and less bow up trim. The exact reason of this inaccuracy remains unknown. Furthermore, the results of free sailing conditions including irregular waves showed an extreme sensitivity for small variations in the simulation input. Especially since in without exception the input that matched the model test the closest also lead to the best _t in the simulation results, further investigation would be interesting into whether this sensitivity actually exists in model tests or whether it is only a result of the chosen simulation method.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Ship Hydromechanics and Structures","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2014","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for science missions are becoming increasingly popular in the present context. Science missions require high altitude operation and long endurance (HALE). With rising awareness of climate change phenomenon it becomes imperative to look into more efficient and more sustainable means of powering these missions. A 'well-to-wheel' study is a comprehensive way of comparing different operations for powering a vehicle. For this study , the HALE UAV is powered by a solid oxide fuel cell and gas turbine (SOFC-GT) hybrid. The HALE UAV design is based on concept that has been developed before by NASA. It is also essential that a suitable fuel is selected for powering the hybrid system. Previous studies which were based on liquid hydrogen (LH2 ) concluded that liquefication of hydrogen as an avenue for major exergy losses. For the current study, use of compressed synthetic natural gas (SNG) is analysed. Exergy analysis is carried out for fuel production and the hybrid system operation at cruise altitude. To begin with, syngas is synthesised from woody biomass through gasification. The syngas is then converted into SNG and compressed for storage. This SNG is utilised in the SOFC-GT hybrid. Design calculations are made for the take -off stage. Effect of pressure variation is studied to get the optimum system size. Then the performance of the system is analysed in the cruising stage to estimate the endurance of the flight. Exergy efficiency analysis and mission endurance calculations are made for the system during cruising conditions as a means to evaluate the system performance. The effect of position of air preheater is studied in two different configurations. The exergy efficiency for compressed SNG synthesis is 59.7% and the SOFC-GT operation at cruise is 69.6% effcient. A total 'well-to-wheel ' effciency of 41.6 % is attained. Based on the results of the analysis carried out thus far, the mass for the system components is estimated. Volumetric estimates are also made and the system is fitted in the nacelle volume as defined in NASA concept. The results are eventually compared to the system working on LH2 . The results from compressed SNG study show that specific energy density of the fuel is important. The mass estimates show that the infrastructure required to carry the SNG fuel reduces the specific energy of the fuel. liquid fuels such as methanol should be analysed as another option.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Ten Veldhuis, J.A.E. (mentor); Spekkers, M.H. (mentor)","2014","As a result of expected increase of rainfall intensities due to climate change, there is an increasing demand for reliable flood damage models for urban areas. Most existing models focus on damage prediction using stage-damage curves, which mainly apply to fluvial or coastal floods on a regional scale. Pluvial flood- ing, however, often takes place at smaller spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, damage assessments for pluvial floods require more detailed approaches. Uncer- tainties in existing damage models for pluvial flooding are high due to the limited availability of reliable damage data and insufficient knowledge of the occurrence of the underlying damage processes. In this study, a database of insurance claims on water-related damages to building structure and content in Rotterdam was analysed, with the aim to study the extent to which failures of public sewer systems cause building damage. The insurance claims were manually classified in order to identify the damage causes, using additional data from municipality complaints. For this study only damage causes that relate to the functioning of the urban drainage system were considered, such as flooding via streets or sewer backups through toilets/sinks in houses. Rainfall data from weather radar were used to examine into relationships between insurance claims and extreme rainfall conditions. A Poisson generalized linear model is used to predict the number of sewer- related insurance claims per day. Two different rainfall characteristics were de- rived from the radar data as input variables for this model: (1) The calculated return period of the observed rainfall and (2) the effective rainfall volume, which is determined using a conceptual reservoir model of the sewer system with a fixed volume and outflow capacity. Effective rainfall is only generated when the storage of the sewer system is exceeded. A database of municipality complaints was analysed next to the insurance data, as an additional source of information about flooding from urban drainage systems. Complaints that were reported on the same day and near an insurance claim were studied qualitatively to investigate whether they were related to the same flood event. The complaint information was used to distinguish between flooding due to rainfall overloading of sewer systems, sewer malfunctioning or local blocked house connections. Results show that for rainfall events that exceeded sewer design standards, in around half of the cases the two sources of information complemented each other, indicating that the scale of the flood exceeded the household level. For claims associated with minor rainfall, which did not result in exceedance of the sewer design capacity, additional information is hardly found in the complaint data. This implies that for these claims, the damage is likely to be caused by local problems, for example blocked house connections.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-10-29","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor); Iosup, A. (mentor)","2014","With the decrease in cost of storage and computation of public clouds, even small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are able to process large amounts of data. This causes businesses to increase the amounts of data they collect, to sizes that are difficult for traditional database management systems to handle. Distributed SQL Query Engines (DSQEs), which can easily handle these kind of data sizes, are therefore increasingly used in a variety of domains. Especially users in small companies with little expertise may face the challenge of selecting an appropriate engine for their specific applications. A second problem lies with the variable performance of DSQEs. While all of the state-of-the-art DSQEs claim to have very fast response times, none of them has performance guarantees. This is a serious problem, because companies that use these systems as part of their business do need to provide these guarantees to their customers as stated in their Service Level Agreement (SLA). Although both industry and academia are attempting to come up with high level benchmarks, the performance of DSQEs has never been explored or compared in depth. We propose an empirical method for evaluating the performance of DSQEs with representative metrics, datasets, and system configurations. We implement a micro-benchmarking suite of three classes of SQL queries for both a synthetic and a real world dataset and we report response time, resource utilization, and scalability. We use our micro-benchmarking suite to analyze and compare three state-of-the-art engines, viz. Shark, Impala, and Hive. We gain valuable insights for each engine and we present a comprehensive comparison of these DSQEs. We find that different query engines have widely varying performance: Hive is always being outperformed by the other engines, but whether Impala or Shark is the best performer highly depends on the query type. In addition to the performance evaluation of DSQEs, we evaluate three query time predictors of which two are using machine learning, viz. multiple linear regression and support vector regression. These query time predictors can be used as input for scheduling policies in DSQEs. The scheduling policies can then change query execution order based on the predictions (e.g., give precedence to queries that take less time to complete). We find that both machine learning based predictors have acceptable performance, while a baseline naive predictor is more than two times less accurate on average.","Distributed SQL Query Engine; Performance Evaluation; Scalability; Query Time Predictor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Parallel and Distributed Systems Group","","Computer Science","",""

The technique enables connecting chips of the future directly to the main power source. This increases the power efficiency and the power density of the power delivery scheme. The needed special circuitry components like level shifters and voltage regulators have been designed and integrated into a standard digital SoC flow to demonstrate that voltage stacking can be used for any digital system. For comparison and also functional purposes, the designed system is reconfigurable between the conventional, high throughput, flat mode where all the power- and ground rails are common, and the low power, stacked mode where the power domains are stacked on top of each other.

It is seen as an experiment, knowledge which was gathered during research put to practice. The design is inserted into natural setting, which is on one side confronted by the uncontrolled sprawl of gated communities and the water basin on the other. What makes the space so particular and the choice of preference is its direct link to nature and water resources as the research area, and it’s being the fringe of the city. It is located at the periphery of Istanbul being the crucial element of the city. The site itself, acts as a buffer flood zone for Alibey river basin. This area was constructed as part of Alibey Rivers Dam. It was built in late 1960’s in order to fulfill the demands for water in Istanbul. Area is quite neglected, surrounded by faceless gated communities and barbed wire fences. As I have mentioned before, I find this site being a fringe, or a space in between, where city clashes into nature, as if the one side tries to take over the other and exactly at the line where water meets land the dike is placed. A very harsh and rational cut off, which serves the only purpose to keep the water, gathered in the basin, out from the city. On one hand, the area is completely artificial, made to serve the needs of the constantly increasing Istanbul population, but at the very same time is has the potential to become the space which rises the awareness towards nature, and creates the subtle dialog between the natural resources, which are depleting constantly and the built environment. I believe the qualities and potentials that site possesses makes the link between my research and the design. The design works as an extension of the existing water lock walls placed in the dike. Though at first glance, the walls should increase the separation between the two sides, but as my research showed, wall creates the precedent, firm and stable border. This allows space to be created in between where people could go and experience the worlds of nature and the built environment.

(mentor)","2014","The use of global precipitation datasets such as TRMM, WFD etc. for data scarce regions is gaining popularity since they provide forcing input for hydrological models. They make up for the lack of ground based data or the poor quality of whatever is available in many parts of the world. Using these datasets would be perfect if they were free of errors. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The geo-spatial data obtained from satellites or reanalysis products are not direct measures of precipitation. They are derived from atmospheric parameters such as cloud depth, brightness temperature etc. (Huffman 2007). The conversion of these to precipitation is done using complex algorithms. Efforts are made to calibrate this data but still errors sneak in. Similarly the interpolated gauge data like APHRODITE also has errors because of the inability of interpolation techniques to capture the high spatio-temporal variability in Precipitation. Hence the error estimation of these datasets remains a big problem. Lack of ground based data ensures there is no reference to check these global datasets against. In this research, Triple collocation technique is applied to 3 datasets namely APHRODITE, TRMM and WFD for the river basins in Myanmar. The technique gives an estimate of the residual errors in the 3 datasets (with uncorrelated errors) without using any ground measurements or true values (R. A. Roebeling 2012). This is the first time tit has been used to estimate errors in Precipitation datasets on a daily scale. Though the errors are not absolute, the results give an insight into the relative quality of these datasets. The errors have been calculated in space and time. Hence both temporal and spatial error characteristics are analysed. The study period is from 1998-2001. The results obtained show that for TRMM and WFD, the errors are concentrated and of higher magnitude. For APHRODITE, the errors are more evenly distributed in space. All three datasets showed high errors in the central dry parts and the delta region. Overall, APHRODITE seems to show lowest error values in space. The temporal error characteristics were also different for the 3 datasets. WFD showed highest average and maximum errors. TRMM had some very high error peaks but was in general better than WFD. Looking at the maximum and Average errors, APHRODITE seems to be the best of the three. WFD also shows some error peaks at the onset and end of Monsoon season. This shows its inability to estimate the localized pre and post monsoon storms. The assumption of uncorrelated errors was also verified post analysis. Errors for 2 locations, Bago and Yangon were used to make scatter plots. No strong correlation is visible in the scatter plots reinforcing the assumption that the errors are uncorrelated. The research shows that it is possible to make qualitative and quantitative inferences about the errors in the global precipitation datasets in the absence of in-situ measurements. Based on this research, it is concluded that overall, APHRODITE is the best of the 3 datasets. The possibility of a merged dataset formed by combining these 3 based on the error patterns observed in this study should be explored further.","TRMM; WFD; APHRODITE; Triple Collocation; Error Analysis; Precipitation Datasets; Hydrological Modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor)","2014","The long-haul flights of airlines are impacted by the en-route wind fields. Flights on the same route with different directions may have significantly different flight performances. It may benefit to airlines in terms of fuel cost and on-time performance if the optimal long-haul routes are able to plan. However, the wind direction and strength are varying in different regions, at different altitudes and different times. It is difficult to identify the most suitable trajectory in a complex wind field. Consequently, the trajectory optimization problem is proposed. The main goal of this study is to develop an optimization model to identify the near optimal trajectory with minimum consumption for long-haul flights taking into account en-route winds and a set of constraints based on ATC regulations. One of the methods to solve the problem is the genetic algorithm since it is a global search method. For this purpose the software tool NSGA is applied in this study. However, the computational process of NSGA is not very efficient due to the computational loss for infeasible solutions. In order to overcome the computational inefficiency of NSGA, a 2-phase approach is proposed. Phase 1 is to reduce the search scope for Phase 2, while the outcomes of Phase 2 are detailed solutions with the accurate fuel consumption and flight time of the trajectories. Moreover, approaches based on parameterization are introduced to minimize the number of infeasible solutions and the control parameters. The control variables of Phase 1 are the coordinates of waypoints, true airspeeds of segments, distances of vertical segments, and the altitude changing locations. Infeasible solutions may be generated with excess flight distance and/or random terminated locations. In order maintain the feasibility of evaluated solutions, an algorithm is introduced to locate the latitude feasible range of each waypoint. Additionally, approaches based on parameterization are introduced to ensure that the evaluated trajectories terminate at the city pair. By applying these approaches, the number of infeasible solutions due to the excess flight distance and/or random terminated locations is significantly reduced. Although the approaches proposed are able to reduce the number of the control parameters, long computational time is still required to evaluate each solution with a small time or distance step. In order to increase the computational speed, the equivalent wind speed and equivalent weight concepts are proposed in Phase 1. By applying this approach, the distance step is able to increase to a segment distance. The computational efficiency is increased. The outcomes of Phase 2 are detailed solutions. With the involved climbing and descent phases, the number of parameters in Phase 2 is more than the number of parameters in Phase 1. The search scope of Phase 2 is based on the outcomes of Phase 1 to obtain detailed solution within an acceptable computational time. In this study, the forward simulation is applied to ensure the feasibility of the flight altitude. However, the constant landing weight is hardly achieved by applying this algorithm. The transport losses may occur if there is fuel left when the aircraft arrives at the destination. In order to solve this problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed to adjust the initial take-off weight if the final landing weight is not within the expected range. The verification in this study shows that the designed tool is quality and credible. The tool is able to detect the tailwind and headwind in a real wind field. The outcomes of the tool are a little deviated to the optimal solution, but the deviation is acceptable after analysing. In this study, three routes are researched, which are Amsterdam and New York, Amsterdam and Johannesburg, Amsterdam and Singapore. The average saving in terms of flight time and fuel consumption of the optimized solutions are 3.16% and 3.1% respectively compared to the solutions with the great circle path and optimized vertical profile. The results achieved in this study are promising, but enhancements can be made in the some areas. The optimization processes discussed in this study were only performed for one type of aircraft. More aircraft models can be analysed to further prove the performance of the designed tool. The current program assumes a standard atmosphere. As the pressure and temperature are of great influence on both the air density which further impacts the performance of the engine. A more elaborate atmospheric model could be introduced to obtain more accurate solutions. The tool designed in this study is based on Matlab. With more efficient software, the computational time can be dramatically decreased. Additionally, the use of a better equipped computer with multi processers will significantly increase the computational efficiency. In addition, well-designed termination criterions are recommended when there are multi closed local optimal solutions in the search space, which will increase the computational efficiency during the optimization process.","trajectory optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Opeations","","Air Transport and Operations","",""

(mentor); Pruyt, E. (mentor)","2014","In this Master of Science thesis, the author introduces a new method to explore the consequences of uncertainty in System Dynamics (SD) models. This is important, as it allows the SD field to provide more robust decision support. The current methods search for relations between uncertainties and model outputs, without using the model equations. The research question is formulated as: How can the consequences of uncertainties be explored from the differential equations in SD models? The new method focusses on how the differential equations are influenced by uncertainties. This can later be translated to an impact on the output. Thesis thesis shows that, for a two dimensional analytic non-linear system with parameter uncertainty, a 1-on-1 mapping can be constructed that relates regions in the uncertain parameters space to properties of the differential equations. The properties that are used here are bifurcations; changes in properties of equilibrium points. All bifurcations for all equilibria in a system create a set of modes that represent the scope of the influence of the uncertain parameters. These modes have been made concise and insightful with several visualisation tools. When this method is applied to a small, but more complex SD model, a hybrid framework is adopted to account for conditional function. The simultaneous exploration of the changes in this hybrid partition and bifurcations lies outside the scope of this thesis. However, with the visualization tools that were employed before, a better understanding could be created in a base case with fixed parameter set. These visualisations allow to formulate more precise hypotheses about the influence of the uncertainty. In future research, it would be valuable to verify of these hypotheses could be answered under parameter uncertainty. In this way, the method has shown to contribute to the insightfulness of the consequences of parameter uncertainty in SD models.","SD (System Dynamics); Non-linear Systems; Uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems & Control","",""

(mentor)","2014","With the ever increasing demand of cars, safety is of prime concern to automobile manufactures across the world. Companies strive for the vision of ""Zero accidents"" through high quality and innovative products that reduce the frequency of accidents as well as their consequences. The auto industry has been exerting a myriad of state-of-the-art technologies to make automotive safety systems that reduce driver’s strain and fatigue and assist safe driving. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are technologies that capture the vehicle’s surrounding environment and assist the driver by keeping him informed about the current vehicle state, and if necessary intervene to prevent an impending danger, while the driver is in control of the vehicle at all times. Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC) systems enhance the handling and safety of the car by assisting the driver in maintaining control of the vehicle. However, these features are limited by lack of knowledge of the vehicle states. Some of the vehicle states like sideslip angle are not measurable due to technical or economic reasons. Therefore, these must be estimated by using the available measurements. Most of the existing sideslip angle estimators are based on lateral acceleration, but these estimators have estimation errors arising from roll and pitch dynamics. The purpose of this study is to develop an algorithm that estimates the vehicle sideslip angle and tire cornering stiffnesses using tire force measurements. This is achieved by implementing a model based deterministic approach. Kalman filters and their extensions used for state and parameter estimation are investigated. Finally, the developed system is implemented using a multibody vehicle simulator and tested for different maneuvers.","vehicle lateral dynamics; sideslip angle; tire cornering stiffness; unscented kalman filter; load sensing bearings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","M.Sc Mechanical Engineering","",""

The port of Rotterdam and its hinterland is an example of a surplus region. Empty container management is subject to keeping costs at a minimum, while meeting customer demand and off-dock empty depots, located near the ocean terminals, provide cheap storage and the facilitation of repair of damaged containers. When containers are damaged, the supply of empty containers is reduced, which means extra costs are made as demand does not reduce. Two options need to be weighed when deciding on the repair of containers within the region; should the container be repaired within the region at higher cost or transport to overseas regions at lower cost plus transport cost. To ensure demand is always met by the carrier a target stock level is implemented at empty depots and inland terminals. To be able to meet future demand, the Maersk Group is opening a new ocean terminal in Rotterdam port, which operates at a higher frequency and reliability, resulting in a change in operations regarding empty container steering, making it important to review current operations compared to future scenarios to determine cost optimum. The study focusses on the question: How can total costs be optimized on the steering of empty containers through empty depots, while keeping operations in the hinterland and terminals in mind? A multi-commodity model has been developed that takes two states of containers into account, viz. Damaged and non-damaged containers, in a network of off-dock empty depots, ocean terminals and inland terminals. Supply of empty containers is per node divided into damaged and non-damaged supply with a failure rate and send for repair or evacuation for overseas repair. The developed theoretical model has been implemented into as a DSS tool in Matlab 2014a, which is used to investigate current operations in comparison to various future scenarios, which look at ocean terminal and depot topologies, Target Stock Level scenarios and move type scenarios (altering the network to allow direct evacuation (inland terminal to ocean terminal without transport via the depots) or direct positioning (inland terminal to inland terminal without transport via the depots) From running the model the following conclusions have been developed. - Cost of container moves is subject to two handling and one transport unit cost per OD-pair. Depending on the distance a container is transported, the weight of transport and handling cost is shifted. - The cost aspect distribution (move vs. repair vs. storage cost) for dry containers 75/20/5 and for reefers is 50/45/5, resulting in a shift in focus from move cost to repair cost minimization per container type. - Depending on the composition of the network and the corresponding cost structure the DSS tool determines the combination of empty depots resulting in a cost optimum compared to the base year. For the Maersk Line case cost savings between 3-17% have been found depending on the network topology selected and on the container type investigated. - Target stock level heuristics do not improve the costs significantly, but does show the importance of correct selection of stock with respect to cost optimal empty container steering - Direct evacuation results in large cost savings, but should only be implemented during off-peak operation at the ocean terminal. - Direct positioning results in a cost saving of 13% - Reducing the failure rate by improving container quality results in cost savings - A balance exists between container repair at the port of Rotterdam and overseas, resulting in the requirement of global collaboration within a company to reduce costs.","empty containers; operational research; cost function; cost optimum; Maersk Line","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-02-28","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport and Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Tijssen, T. (mentor); Commandeur, T. (mentor); Lindenbergh, R. (mentor)","2014","Like many ICT related domains, hydrology enters the era of big data and managing large volume of data is a potential issue facing hydrologists. However at present, hydrologic data research is mostly concerned with data collection, interpretation, modelling and visualization. Management and query of large datasets do not draw much interest. The motivation of this research originates from a specific data management problem reflected by Hydrologic Research B.V. and that is, time series extraction costs intolerable time when the large multidimensional dataset is stored in NetCDF classic or 64-bit offset format. The essence of this issue lies in the contiguous storage structure adopted by NetCDF. So in this research, NetCDF-4 format and a multidimensional array database applying chunked storage structure are benchmarked to learn whether and how chunked storage structure can benefit queries executed by hydrologists. To achieve a convincing and representative benchmark result, expert consultancy was conducted to collect queries and sample datasets frequently handled by water experts. From the raw consultancy records, 5 classes of query were summarized and specific queries for benchmarking were devised. After this, 9 criteria were established to assess which multidimensional array database is most suitable for benchmarking and finally SciDB was chosen. To establish a fair benchmark test environment, HydroNET-4 system was utilized and adapters for NetCDF files and SciDB were developed to manage and query data. For final benchmark tests, influence of data compression on query, and scalability of diverse data solutions, i.e. 64-bit offset, NetCDF-4 and SciDB solutions were investigated. In addition, chunk size and dimensions order effect of SciDB arrays on query performance were also explored. It turns out that NetCDF-4 solution with a recommended chunk size has the best overall management and query performance among all solutions. SciDB arrays utilizing small chunk sizes present favorable performance. However with current implementation of SciDB, large amount of small chunks cause huge overload of main memory which constraints SciDB’s scalability. For SciDB, DEFLATE compression can either have negative or no effect on query performance. In time series extraction test, compression effect is found to be correlated with chunk size and the negative impact of compression on query decreases as chunk size reduces. It is deduced that with hypercubic and modest chunk sizes, the internal data structure of chunks in SciDB has no significant influence on query performance. The research demonstrates that for large data management and query, a file based solution can be a better choice than a database utilizing smart caching and indexing strategies. But due to the limited scope of the research, for instance no parallel query processing tested, more work need to be conducted in the future.","NetCDF; SciDB; chunked storage structure; benchmark test; hydrologic datasets; multidimensional array database","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Tassoul, M. (mentor)","2014","Austerity policies in the Netherlands cause citizens to become more responsible for social support, and to people in need of social support to keep living independently up to an older age. This led to the assignment by Zuidzorg to find new ways to encourage neighbourhood participation. Preliminary research and interviews with people in Budel, which is the context for this assignment, led to the insight that people who need additional support have a large social network. Support is however often not given, because of the facts that there is less trust between people from different generations, that the social network is often not available, that it that it is difficult to give to and receive, that in most cases no communal sharing occurs between neighbours, that there are not enough relations that inherit trust, that many people are lonely and that there is not enough motivation so support others. As an approach towards encouraging neighbourhood participation, the definition of social capital by Woolcock (1998) was used, i.e. the information, trust and norms of reciprocity of social networks. According to Fu (2004) these aspects are mutually reinforcing, which means that increasing social capital leads to greater participation. Trust can be increased by exposure, honest communication and following up on commitments (Sander & Lowley, 2006). Changing the norms of reciprocity was approached from a persuasive viewpoint, by giving people motivation, ability and triggers (Fogg, 2010) to give and receive support. Multiple ideas were generated, which led to three concepts being developed. Two of these concepts were developed into a campaign that carries the name bloeiend*. The first part of bloeiend* is a laser cut symbol of a flower, which can be pasted to any object or hung from e.g. a key chain. It is based on increasing trust by exposure and following up on commitments, and creates intrinsic motivation to support others by offering people a rationale and choice (Deci et al., 1994). The second element of bloeiend* is a calendar which daily offers something to think about or do, with the choice to act upon it. The daily quotes offer a rationale, thus together with making a choice create intrinsic motivation to give support, which increases trust. Almost half of the people in Budel is willing to participate in bloeiend*. It is expected that bloeiend* indeed leads to increased social capital and will be a stepping stone towards increased well-being.","social; participation; persuasion; social capital","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","DFI","","","","51.276392, 5.588416"

(mentor)","2014","The assessment of port marine operations performance by means of simulation is treated in this master thesis project. The navigational services provided to vessel at the access channels, from their arrival to the berthing operations and from unberthing to vessels departure, are investigated and evaluated. In the case study, FlexSim is used as the simulation tool. Since no previous marine operations performance assessment using FlexSim were found in literature, its application for this purpose is tested and evaluated. From the literature review, it is concluded that despite the fact that the use of logistic simulation models is increasing, and many practical applications are identified, the number of publications and academic studies is still limited. By describing extensively the methods used in this graduation project, it is expected that though a case study is analysed, the given research approach can be adapted and harnessed in other problems with similar aims. Case Study - The Port of Jebel Dhanna/Ruwais The production of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company is expected to increase and new terminals are planned at the Port of Jebel Dhanna/Ruwais in order to cope with this progress. The marine traffic is expected to be almost doubled from 2014 to 2030. The approach channels to the port are relatively long and occasionally limited in width and depth. Some sections are restricted to one-way traffic and priority is given to outgoing vessels. Additionally, tidal windows are imposed to deep draught vessels in depth restricted sections. With the expected increase in marine traffic, it is possible that congestion of the access channel will become a limiting factor. The evolution of the Port of Jebel Dhanna/Ruwais marine operations performance from 2014 to 2030 is evaluated based on FlexSim results. The conclusion is that performance is acceptable for the forecasted 2030 traffic and no real bottleneck at the access channels is identified; the berth unavailability is the main cause of delay. In order to be able to identify the marine operations bottleneck, the traffic is artificially increased. For the simulated fleet mix, the performance of the marine operations reaches an unacceptable level when 900 vessels per year are added to the 2030 forecast. The existing infrastructure is unable to cope with the demand when 1200 vessels per year are added to the 2030 forecast. In order to make it possible for the port to handle these 1200 extra vessels, three interventions are proposed: routing three vessel classes instead of one through a secondary channel; deepening one of the one-way sections; and widening one of the one-way sections. Six measures, formed by the combination of the three interventions are simulated. The most effective measure is the combination of the three of them; however, each measure has a different cost related to it; therefore, only a cost benefit analysis can indicate the best alternative. FlexSim Evaluation After performing all simulations involved in the graduation work, the FlexSim simulation software is considered to be adequate to perform port marine operations simulations. Realistic results are obtained with more than acceptable simulation times and with a moderate time for implementation, which decreases with the modeller increasing experience. However, the possibility of using default FlexSim functions for implementing the traffic regulations would be appreciated.","simulation; logistic; access channel; FlexSim; port performance; marine operations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Ports and Waterways","",""

The master thesis represents a completion of my master studies and is written in order to qualify for the degree of M.Sc., Master of Science in Structural Engineering at Delft University of Technology. Current work is done in close collaboration with Iv-Consult, an “Engineering Company with Passion for Technology” located in Papendrecht, The Netherlands. Its aim is to develop a semi-analytical tool for cost and time efficient design of plates stiffened with arbitrarily positioned very slender stiffeners in order to reduce the weight of structures where this is critical, such as cranes and tilting box girder beams. As plated structures become bigger and bigger, their self-weight reduction becomes more and more important. In order to achieve a maximum level of optimization with respect to self-weight, plates’ thickness is reduced and stiffeners are used to provide them stability. In current design practice, standards codes are used (like EN1993-1-5 ) that are known to be conservative and limited in order to cover all type of cases. In this kind of structures, there are many individual plates and therefore, non-linear FEM analysis of all of them becomes relatively time consuming and requires experienced engineers. Since the level of conservativeness of faster methods is dependent on plate configuration, for some cases, through a non-linear FEM analysis, the strength increase can be significant with respect to EN1993-1-5, while for others it is almost inexistent. The company wants to know what the approximate amount of this conservativeness is for a certain configuration so that it can assess on which cases is time and cost worthy to do a detailed nonlinear FE analysis and on which ones the gain is not worth the cost. In order to achieve this, a design tool is developed, under the name of Iv-Plate, having as foundation a semi-analytical method based on the principle of stationary potential energy combined with numerical solution. A method of reducing the structure’s own weight by using slender webs stiffeners is also analyzed and integrated within the tool.","plate buckling; slender stiffeners","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

There is a shift from mass consumption towards individual behaviors and highly personalized needs. Focusing exclusively on the design of physical products, like a lot of firms currently still do, results in the separate design of a product and ‘adding’ a service, which causes insufficient fulfillment of the customer requirements, since their needs were not incorporated during market research. Sticking to traditional product design will diminish a firm’s cash flow and therefore firms are seeking for ways to include service design in their business. Also npk design has noticed a shift in design practice from product design towards service design. Therefore, npk design wants to expand their working field to this field. However, they currently do not have a complete overview of the differences and similarities between the product design and service design process, since they lack experience in service design and do not have a design method to follow, like they do have for the product design process. In order to pursue service design a tool has been designed to help npk design tackle their main issue concerning PSS design: the involvement of stakeholders. This tool provides support with the facilitation of the involvement and keeping a better overview of the stakeholders involved during the PSS design project. In ten steps this tool will help you to determine together with your project team which stakeholder you should involve during the PSS design project and what roles the stakeholders will have to take on. By means of 5 prescheduled check-up meetings the stakeholders involved will be scrutinized and if necessary the strategy for the PSS design project concerning the involvement of stakeholders can be adapted. Furthermore, this tool helps to improve the understanding of the PSS design approach among the parties involved. By making the designers, client and other members of the project team more aware of the holistic nature of service design and the facilitating role that is required, the tool will help slowly internalizing the PSS design approach in order for it to become part of project member’s way of thinking.","PSS; Stakeholders; Innovation tool; npk design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","PIM","","","",""

The pathology can greatly affect social and physical perspectives for children and their family, such as education, school, profession, marital relationships, family dynamics. Recurrent hospitalization is required to provide effective medical treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The diagnosis is the first challenge for a family’s balance. The information can generate feelings of anxiety, depression, denial and anger among the members of a family. Painful procedures, hospitalizations, and uncertain prognoses are common stressors that can pose a substantial threat to the adjustment of children and families to the acceptance of their diagnosis (Sloper, 2000). Recurrent treatments to fight the disease are disruptive for the family’s daily rhythm. The treatments usually divide the family into two contexts, the home and the hospital, disrupting the core of the family physically and socially, and therefore causing many difficulties to occur for parents and children. Dynamics and family routines are severely affected by these hospitalization periods. Daily routines such as eating together, watching television, gardening, and sitting together on the couch are important for a household. These activities can carry strong psychosocial values for every member of a family, especially when children are present. Sharing family dynamics enhance family discussions and the sharing of experiences, giving family members a sense of belonging, togetherness and buffers against family stress (Markson, Fiese 2000). A lack of cohesiveness can cause problems such as maternal depression (Grootenhuis, Last, 1997). Despite the several communication technologies that is currently available, a lack of communication and physical presence can cause a big stress for families during hospitalization. The goal of this project is to provide a solution for families that are coping with a disrupted family situation due to childhood cancer. The focus will be oriented towards the design of a solution that will be effective in restoring the most disrupted aspects in the normal daily life of a family. The aim of this project is to enhance the sense of connectedness and presence within the household.","childhood cancer; connectedness; family; sensory design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

IPT is a method that is used to transfer power over large air gaps and has proven to be efficient, reliable and convenient in the charging of electric vehicles and also for factory automation systems and charging of consumer devices such as mobile phones. In some cases, it necessary to have transmitter and receiver topologies having multiple coils especially in a three phase IPT highway system or a table top IPT system for charging many consumer devices or mobile phones at the same time. Multi coil topologies are also used in lumped charge pad topologies to enable better misalignment tolerances. In such cases it is necessary to mutually decouple these multiple coils to avoid interactions that could affect the efficiency of power transfer. The current state of the art systems offer solutions that lead to the decoupling of multiple coils by their relative spatial position, and are hence limited. Multi coil systems operating at the same frequency also generate magnetic fields that add or cancel out each other, thereby changing the air gap magnetic field orientation depending on which coil is powered. A multi frequency IPT system developed in this thesis aims to provide a solution to the above challenges. A multi coil primary system with two coils carrying currents of different frequencies can be designed to transfer power independently without interactions between the two different frequency systems. This thesis develops this concept by first investigating the need for decoupling multi coil transmitter and receiver designs. Multi frequency IPT is then introduced and the design considerations are developed in order to achieve a frequency decoupled IPT system. Experimental results of the proposed multi frequency method using two transmitter coils are also presented. Finally, a comparison is provided between this proposed multi frequency method using two transmitter coils and another recently published method that amplifies the third harmonic along with the fundamental from the input inverter, thereby achieving multi frequency IPT using one transmitter coil.","Inductive Power Transfer; Multi-Frequency Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-04-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","DC Systems and Storage","",""

The internal excitation forces are characterised as a set of equivalent forces on the interface of the active component. These equivalent forces are determined from force and acceleration measurements at the interface of the active component and a test bench. The response of the total system is calculated with the dynamic properties at the component interface onwards to a point of interest in the vehicle. Two equivalent force determination schemes are applied on two test benches with different dynamic properties. The first method relies on direct interface force measurements, whereas the second procedure is based on a matrix inverse procedure on the assembly of the steering gear and the test bench. It is shown that these equivalent forces are indeed a property of the active component only.

(mentor)","2014","As the world demands cleaner, sustainable and economical energy sources, the wind energy academia and industry battles to increase performance and reduce costs. One of the promising fields of study is wind turbine wakes in wind farms. The position of the turbines within the layout affects the intensity of their wake effects, such as reduced wind speed or turbulence, therefore the choice of its position has an impact on wake losses and fatigue damage induced by wake-generated turbulence on the components. In this work, the possibility of wind turbine’s support structure cost reduction is explored by studying the effect on its design (and cost) caused by wake-generated turbulence. Furthermore, layout optimization considering wake losses and the wake-affected support structure cost was studied. To obtain insights about these effects, the turbulence intensity calculation and a simple support structure design were implemented into the wind farm design tool TeamPlay (by M. Zaaijer in the Wind Energy Research Group at TU Delft) and used to perform a series of case studies. The turbulence calculation was implemented following the IEC guidelines for any layout and wind direction distribution. The simple support structure design approach used in this work is based on two key aspects: (1) a base design obtained from Teamplay which does not account for fatigue and (2) the assumption of proportionality between fatigue equivalent load and turbulence. By using these tools, a location-specific support structure design within the wind farm was performed. Further, the weight and cost of the support structures was compared with the case in which all support structures have the same design obtained from the worst turbulence regime. It was found that wake-induced fatigue and its effect on the support structure design is not relevant for layout-spacing optimization because wake losses dominate the cost changes due to layout changes. Moreover, it was found that location-specific support structure design, according to their specific turbulence regime, would result in cost reductions that could account, as an upper limit, between 0.3 % and 0.7 % of the total capital costs in the studied cases. Finally, the cost reduction share of the total capital cost increases with increasing support structure size.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

One Carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer beam with dimensions 0.22x0.0041x0.0027m at the medial side and one at the lateral side of the upper arm delivers the required energy for balancing the arm. Experimental evaluation of a prototype demonstrated the technical principle; more than 87% of the moment around the shoulder was balanced between 0 and 1.1rad. A second prototype was built for preliminary evaluation of the concept in relation to the body. The width of the elastic and structural elements was more than four times smaller than in present arm supports.

It is important to understand that ovulation only occurs once a month. This is the only moment for a woman to get pregnant. Spermatozoa can survive up to 3-5 days within the body. An ovum only lives for about 24 hours. Knowing the fertile days is therefore crucial. Similar devices are a constant and daily reminder of not succeeding to get pregnant. ‘With CORA’ is designed with the intention: Wear to forget”. The cycle monitor needs to be inserted inside the vagina. At the end of the vagina is a cavity which is big enough to house the cycle monitor. The monitor measures by means of a temperature sensor the Basal Body Temperature (BBT). When ovulating the BBT shall increase with about 0.4 Degrees Celsius and shall decrease the first day of the menstrual days. The cycle monitor shall be inside the vagina until the first day of the menstrual days. During the menstrual cycle the monitor can be cleaned and charged. The day after the menstrual days the cycle monitor can be placed back inside the vagina. This is done by squeezing in the sides of the cycle monitor, placing it inside the vagina and pushing it with one finger further inside to the back. Due to its placement in the back, it is also possible to have intercourse while wearing the device. ‘With CORA’ does not only exist of a cycle monitor, but includes a charger and a mobile phone application. When ovulating the user will receive a notification saying that the fertile days are coming up. This way the couple has enough time to prepare to be intimate with each other. Because you will receive a notification you do not have to check daily if you are ovulating. This provides a less stressful situation. Although this project is based on couples who want to conceive, ‘With CORA’ can also be used by women who want to be in more control of their menstrual days or women who do not want to get pregnant. The cycle monitor is intended for couples who tend to get pregnant. By placing the cycle monitor inside the vagina and around the cervix the basal body temperature can be measured.","Vaginal cycle monitor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Olsthoorn, T.N. (mentor); Zaadnoordijk, W.J. (mentor); Heimovaara, T.J. (mentor)","2014","The subsurface in the Western part of the Netherlands is generally characterized as a regional aquifer, in which most of the lateral groundwater flow takes place, covered by a semi-permeable layer. The semi-permeable layer is often split into a phreatic layer on top of an aquitard (which has an even lower permeability). The phreatic layer and aquitard together are referred to as the top-system. The phreatic layer contains ditches and drains that transport excess water out of the area to, for example, a belt canal or a river. In regional groundwater models upscaling methods are applied to replace the top-system by a linear head-flux relationship (a Cauchy boundary condition) to take into account the interaction between many small surface water features and the groundwater in a lumped fashion. The upscaled system contains two parameters: the effective water level (p*) and the effective resistance (c*). The geology of the phreatic layer has a large influence on the value of these parameters, but existing upscaling methods are limited to homogeneous and isotropic phreatic layers. New formulas are derived for the effective parameters that take into account layered heterogeneity and vertical anisotropy. This multi-layer upscaling method is compared to an existing method, derived by de Lange, “A Cauchy boundary condition for the lumped interaction between an arbitrary number of surface waters and a regional aquifer”, Journal of Hydrology 266 (1999) (p. 250-261), which does not incorporate these aspects directly. Two upscaled models are created using the two upscaling methods and are compared to an analytic element model containing all features explicitly. The comparison is carried out for a cross-section with an extraction in the regional aquifer. In homogeneous isotropic phreatic layers both upscaling methods perform well. The drawdown in the regional aquifer differs by less than 3% as compared to the drawdown in the explicit model. When heterogeneity and anisotropy are introduced to the phreatic layer, the multi-layer method performs better with differences in drawdown remaining below 1%. The method by de Lange shows differences of up to 15%. The values of the effective parameters calculated by both models are similar in heterogeneous top-systems characterized by larger phreatic transmissivities, although the multi-layer method is almost always more accurate. For phreatic layers with smaller transmissivities, the multi-layer method yields significantly better estimates for the effective parameters. The new method does have limitations. It is less accurate in situations where surface water features are wide relative to the distance between them or when the bed resistance of the surface water features is large relative to the resistance of the aquitard. De Lange's approach is, in theory, applicable under those conditions, but does not take into account heterogeneity or vertical anisotropy. For most practical purposes, the multi-layer upscaling method is preferred and yields similar or more accurate results than de Lange's method.","upscaling; de Lange; groundwater; boundary condition; surface water; interaction; analytic element method; lump","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Geohydrology","",""

(mentor); Bijlaard, F.S.K. (mentor); Abspoel, R. (mentor); Hendriks, M.A.N. (mentor)","2014","In connections of steel structures stress concentrations occur due to the rapid geometric changes in the cross section. If the material has sufficient ductility then, due to plastic deformations, forces are redistributed so there will be equilibrium in the internal forces. In design codes this is accounted for by imposing certain requirements with respect to the tensile/yield strength ratio and minimal strain at fracture. This problem is of particular importance when high strength steels are used as questions are raised related to their ductility capacity. Over the past decades, high strength steel has gained significant ground in the steel structures market. A steel grade such as S355, which was considered to be a high strength steel 20 years ago, is now one of the predominant grades used for steel construction. In practice the occurrence of stress concentrations raises questions on how to deal with them and how to ensure a certain amount of ductility to avoid brittle fracture. In most cases an inelastic finite element analysis in shell elements and based on the nonlinear behaviour of the material is required in order to calculate the strains at the notch-tips and prove redistribution of stresses takes place. However this is a time consuming and costly procedure. This paper addresses such issues and, based on Neuber’s formula for nonlinear material behaviour, a new method is developed to calculate the strains at the locations of the stress concentrations. This new approach, entitled Stefanescu Method (SM), is based only on the results of the linear finite element analysis to estimate the value of the strains. The procedure is first developed in theory and applied to a simple case of a plate with a hole in tension because in this case the stress concentration factors are already known. The results of the SM are checked with those of an inelastic finite element analysis. Based on the simple case of a plate with a hole in tension, the SM approach gives good estimates of the strains up to a limit load value of approximately 90% of the smallest force that would cause yielding in any nominal section of the plate. The applicability of this method is extended to a bridge connection from a real life project (the A1/A6 Diemen-Almere Havendreef steel railway arch bridge developed by Iv-Infra). The method is first studied on a simplified geometry of the gusset plate from the bridge connection. As the method again yields good results it is extended to the more complex geometry of the bridge connection. Comparing the results of the SM with those of an IFEA, the method gives good estimates of the strains. Based on the models used it can be concluded that the SM method can be applied to estimate strains at the location of the stress concentrations under the conditions that the loads are known and these are below 90% of the smallest force that would cause yielding in any section of the elements subject to the stress concentrations. Also, this paper addresses the issue of the ultimate to yield strength ratio and to which extent this influences the ductility capacity of the material with respect to stress concentrations. For this purpose three different ratios were studied and their influence on the strains at the notch-tips is compared. With respect to stress concentrations and the local demand for ductility to redistribute stresses, the presence of strain hardening significantly increases the ductility capacity. The lack of strain hardening leads to low deformation capacities of the plates studied. The fu/fy parameter together with a minimum elongation at fracture can lead to very high ductility capacities of the elements.","Ductility; High Strength Steel; Yield-Tensile Ratio; Linear to Nonlinear Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","Seaway Heavy Lifting is an offshore contractor, involved in the wind energy market. Nowadays SHL is preparing on expanding T&I capabilities to include WTGs, after the experiences with foundations, platforms and met-masts. The company desires to enter in this market with innovative and highly efficient solutions. In order to achieve this goal, Oleg Strashnov HLV, SHL’s flagship, has been selected as the ideal means for this path. Indeed, the potential of such a vessel is seen, by the offshore experts, as possibly being applied to the T&I of WTGs in single pieces, including the nacelle. Current practice is to perform the scope in parts, by means of jack-up vessels, addressing a great amount of the work offshore. Offering an integrated solution would definitely mark a turning point for the market, providing that this new proposal has the economical and efficiency characteristics required. The main challenge for such a proposal, from the structural point of view, is to provide a proper sea-fastening for safe and stable logistical procedures, ensuring structural integrity of both vessel and transported elements. The goal of this thesis is to propose a sea-fastening solution able to meet such requirements. An articulated and detailed path has been followed, from general to more detailed analyses, in order to reach the proposed objectives. Firstly, the definition of the boundary conditions and company’s choices took place, according to the specific needs of the chosen vessel and the solution effectiveness requirements. Current offshore wind energy market situation and trends have been investigated and analysed, in order to find specific WTG designs to use for the study. After the definition of sea state conditions, vessel accelerations have been quantified and the most critical load combination for the WTGs was found. Then, possibilities of sea-fastening arrangements have been analysed, through a conceptual study. In order to deal with the destructive bending moment effects on the WTGs, the concept providing a free moment connection at foundation level has been selected. It was required to provide additional external structures, clamping the WTGs at a certain height, in order to doubly support the transported elements. A parametric study has been carried out to compare the best achievable solution using such a hinged bottom connection, against the best achievable solution adopting a fixed connection. Higher requirements in stiffness, for the external supporting structures, have been found in the case of fixed connection. Among other advantages, important steel savings resulted and it was ensured that final solution did not exceed them. Detailed design has been provided for bottom support, due to its challenges from a structural point of view. Besides rotation, main requirements were vertical and horizontal loads constraint. After a dedicated conceptual analysis, a combination of rubber and steel elements was found to be most effective for the purpose. Linear structural analysis have been carried out, supported by parametric studies. The unusual utilization of rubber for sea-fastening has been analysed and proven to be feasible. Starting from the defined model, additional studies for linear buckling and free vibration analyses followed. Subsequently, focus moved to the intermediate support connection. Where design was less detailed, because of the presence of features more related to mechanical engineering, considerations and suggestions have been proposed. An innovative flexible clamping connection has been designed and proven to be effective; this involved rubber fenders, steel rings and bracings. Finally, the design was carried out for the bottom grillage system, connecting the above sea-fastening to the vessel deck. Practical considerations led to a conservative solution, able to meet the structural integrity requirements and available for further optimisations. Once all the individual parts were designed, adaptation of initial assumptions and solution final assessment were proposed. With its 8050 tonnes of total weight, such a system is proven to provide safe and efficient T&I activities for six WTGs per voyage. Among the selected models, the ALSTOM 6MW is chosen for the analysis, because of its most onerous configuration. Structural feasibility and integrity are assessed through hand calculations and FEAs. Boundary conditions are all met and effective features are finally pointed out. Because of the choice of taking advantage of flexibility and the unusual application of rubber elements, the final solution demonstrates clear innovative features. According to the initial conditions, such a sea-fastening system provides a solution for extremely critical sea-states, probably unlikely to appear in real operations.","sea-fastening; offshore; WTG; T&I; assembled tower; wind turbine; SHL; flexible system; steel structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-10-24","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2014","This thesis proposes a traffic signal optimization method for balancing the interests of cyclists and motorized traffic. Traditionally, in bicycle traffic has not been given the same priority as motorized traffic in the signalization system planning. As a consequence, cyclists have to stop many times during their journey, which leads to a waste of energy and causes inconvenience, and at the same time experience long waiting times. In other words, stopping for a red light is a primary discouragement to cycling, since it costs a great deal of extra time and energy. This research relies on this ascertainment and focuses on designing a system which takes into account both types of road users, cyclists and motorized vehicles. Specifically, the proposed system receives the required data from the network, speeds of motorized vehicles and position of both road users, and based on a multi-objective optimization changes the green times of the traffic lights and gives comfortable speed advice to cyclists in order to cross the intersection without having to stop. For the aforementioned optimization the various objectives, namely delay of motorized vehicles and delay, number of stops and deviation between the desired and the advised speed of cyclists, are formulated and are combined as a weighted sum, as a function of green times and individual speed advice. The delay of both road users is formulated as the sum of the delay because of the traffic signal, the delay because of the queues formed at the intersection and the overflow delay, i.e. the additional delay caused when the arrival rate is greater than the service rate at the traffic signal. In regard to the number of stops, each cyclist receives a cost, every time that he has to stop. Last but not least, each cyclist has a desired speed and deviations of it come at a cost. This cost is higher for speeds higher than the desired speed than for speeds lower than the desired speed. The optimization is performed individually in each intersection when cyclists gets green. The time horizon length is set to 10 cycles and the first cycle of the resulting plan is implemented, before the computation is repeated. The cyclists and the motorized vehicles who arrive beyond horizon, receive a very high cost. Different scenarios are run in order to test the proposed system. In all scenarios, the average delay and the average number of stops of cyclists decrease, while the average delay and the average number of stops of motorized vehicles increase. The first two scenarios are used for the controller’s tuning and offer the first insight of the system. In the following two scenarios, the bicycle green wave is investigated. In the last two scenarios, two different components of the system, the number of stops of cyclists and the comfort of the speed advice are examined. Specifically, in the fifth scenario, the coefficient defining the relative importance of cyclist’s number of stops is investigated. Regardless of the value of the coefficient, the reduction of the average number of stops of cyclists is almost the same, with the highest value 69%. In the sixth scenario, the coefficient defining the relative importance of the deviation between the desired and the advised speed is examined. The higher the value of the coefficient, the smaller the deviation between the desired and the advised speed. Although, traditionally not much attention is paid to cyclists in the initial adjustment of the traffic light, the proposed traffic signal optimization method takes into account both types of road users, motorized traffic and cyclists. Reduction in the average delay and the average number of stops of cyclists can be achieved, however has as a consequence the increase of the average delay and the average number of stops of motorized traffic. The same is observed about the comfort of the speed advice. In conclusion, it is possible to improve the situation for cyclists, regarding their delay, number of stops and the comfort of their advised speed, however this improvement comes at a cost for motorized traffic.","cyclists; speed advice; traffic signal optimization; green wave","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport and Planning","",""

Another fun factor is the scooter on the back of the Buddy. The children can use the scooter to step around with in the hospital. Also with daily activities, the Buddy is helpful. The Buddy is steerable by children, they can go to the toilet alone without extra help needed. The shape of the Buddy is based on the wishes of the children. Round shapes and colours are used. They can even see a Beast in it! The Buddy can come with a whole new playing environment in the hospital. With the help of traffic lights and traffic singes the children can play together. There is even the possibility for a racing circuit because of the stability of the Buddy! Not only the children but also the nurses are helped with the new design of the IV pole. The Buddy provides them an easy way to have an overview of the equipment needed for chemotherapy. A colour system is conceived to help the nurses to get a overview. Also the nurses are not hindered by the Kanjerketting anymore since there is a special place for the neckless. The price of the Buddy will be in the same range as other special IV poles.","IV pole; chemotherapy; design; the Buddy; children","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2014","Three degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) tool-based haptic interfaces are widely used in virtual environment to train operators, and for virtual prototyping and design. In some special cases with higher requirement on haptic fidelity, the tool needs to be modeled as an object with real volume rather than a single point. However, such object -to-object interaction will inherently involve reaction torques, which per definition cannot be reali zed by 3-DOF haptic interfaces. As a result, undesired system behavior such as vibration or sudden repulsion would occur whenever reaction torque is involved. In this paper , we proposed a penalty-based algorithm to realize stable yet convincing object-to-object interaction with 3-DOF haptic interfaces. The major contribution of this work is the regulation of excessive directional combined stiffness when multiple contact points are considered in the calculation of force feedback. In contrast to other 3-DOF rendering methods, our approach can generate translational movement to resemble the dynamics of end -effector during torque-involved interaction, while keeps the system stable throughout the whole task. A virtual peg-in-hole task was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. We used the geometrical constraints to calculate an ideal trajectory of the end-effector as a function of the peg’s orientation. The result shows that the end-effector’s trajectory resembled the ideal one as the virtual tool was rotated in the hole. We also showed that the regulated combined stiffness converged to a desired value so that the system stayed stable throughout the whole interaction","Haptic rendering; 3-DOF; combined stiffness; distributed contact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-10-22","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Talmon, A.M. (mentor); Nobel, A.J. (mentor); Verheij, H.J. (mentor)","2014","Pipelines and cables on the sea bottom are usually protected by a cover of dumped rock. In case of maintenance or removal works, this cover has to be removed in order to expose the pipeline. This removal can be performed by means of a mass flow excavation process, created with a submerged jet flow. However, the exact erosion processes of a gravel bed with a low pressure water jet are not yet fully understood; as a result, the production cannot be accurately predicted. The consisting theory about jetting in gravel is very limited. Most jet operations are performed in sand or clay, while the majority of the theory about erosion of gravel is based on relatively low energetic situations, such as rivers. Therefore, a literature study based on different aspects of hydraulic engineering is performed. The aim is to combine the theory of the various specialisations into one study, containing all relevant information. A preliminary test series with a scale of 1:30 is performed in order to get insight in the erosion processes of a vertical jet, horizontally moving in the same direction as the pipeline. This method is commonly used with jetting operations in sand, and forms therefore a logical starting point for the experiments. However, tests shows that this working method results in a low production and seems therefore ineffective for the removal of a dumped rock cover. Three test series focussing on alternative working methods are subsequently performed to determine the most feasible removal method. The trail direction of the nozzle, the jet angle relative to the bottom and the design of the nozzle are varied in these tests. These tests show that, depending on the flow and trail velocity, a trailing jet can behave as either a deflecting or a penetrating jet. Both jet behaviours have a different working method that is effective. The most feasible working method turns out to be a horizontal, penetrating, jet with a high hydraulic power, slowly moving along the pipeline. An erosion model is created in order to model the penetrating behaviour of a jet. It is found that the generally used pick-up function of Van Rijn is not applicable to a situation with a jet flow eroding grains with a large diameter. The pick-up function of Fernandez Luque results in more accurate outcomes of the model, although the modelling of the settling of the stones does still not correspond with the observed processes. A dimensionless erosion parameter Epen is defined as a function of the initial flow velocity, stand-off distance, jet diameter and trail velocity. This parameter can be used to predict the penetrating behaviour of a trailing jet.","jets; mass flow; dumped rock; erosion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-10-22","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Numerical simulations by means of an adaptive finite element model were performed to determine the effect of the patches’ electrode geometry on its energy harvesting capability.

Available submarine narrow shaped ploughs have different geometries and the influence of several variables in the design of these ploughs was analysed during this thesis. This was done to develop a plough pulling force model for generic narrow shaped plough geometries in clay soil conditions. Additionally, the specific geometric shape of the Sea Stallion 4 plough was analysed as this plough is used by VolkerWessels Boskalis Marine Solutions and no satisfactory model for predicting the required pulling forces in clay was available. The following variables in the geometries of the narrow shaped ploughs were analysed: adhesion area, ploughing angle, tip shape and additional cutting teeth. In addition to these geometric variables the influences by ploughing depth and ploughing velocity were also analysed. First, a literature study was performed in order to identify analytical models already available for submarine narrow shaped ploughs and models from other branches that probably could be used to predict the required ploughing forces for narrow shaped ploughs. The following theories and models were reviewed: submarine plough models, ultimate bearing capacity models, narrow tine models and strain-rate dependency models. Concurrently with the literature study, orientating experiments were performed in order to gain insight in the force magnitudes occurring in small scale experiments and in order to gain insight in the influence by size, length and tip of the analysed geometries. Knowledge gained by the literature study and orientating experiments was used to develop a more advanced experimental setup, in which all selected variables were analysed. Results from the experiments were compared to predictions made by the analytical models. From this comparison, it was concluded that an adapted ultimate bearing capacity theory is most appropriate to predict the required ploughing forces. As the more advanced experimental setup, the results gained with this setup and the conclusions of the research are confidential, the repository version of the report does not contain these parts.","ploughing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-10-21","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Cuppen, E. (mentor); Tavasszy, L.A. (mentor); Quak, H.J. (mentor)","2014","In order to find a solution for the negative externalities that come along with the urban freight demand due to increasing residents in urban areas a previous thesis of Roger Peters (2012), about the impact of municipal decisions on the city distribution system of Breda, concludes that road pricing together with the availability of an urban consolidation centre (UCC) is the best solution to create ideal conditions for scalability of bundling and reduce vehicle kilometres. The thesis falls short in the way it needs to be implemented and the consequences of the interventions in normal activities of the many stakeholders involved. Therefore, one of the recommendations made by Peters is to investigate what the effects are and whether this generates the shift that is intended. Because stakeholder participation in scalability is found very important, the challenge lies apparently in the identification of the variability in perspectives of stakeholders in the urban freight system and exploring how these can be served better with regard to scalability of urban consolidation concepts. Therefore this thesis explored the perspectives towards urban consolidation in order to reach the intended scalability of urban consolidation initiatives, by trying to give an answer on the research question “How can one deal with the diversity in perspectives towards urban consolidation, in order to achieve scalability in terms of enough volume, stakeholder participation and applicability to different environments?” In a literature review it is identified what already have been explored in this area in order to search for a method that is suitable for exploring the perspectives. The methodology that is identified as most suitable is Q methodological research. This method uses empirical evidence gathered from the whole urban freight domain without demanding a hypothetical direction, what results in a more comprehensive method with shared perspectives as outcome. However, Q methodological research requires a scientific framework together with interviews among important stakeholder groups to develop a comprehensive framework as input for the Q study, which is the scientific base of the methodology. The framework consists of customer scenarios to identify what the possible design principles are and business model value changes to identify how these principles have impact on the business of stakeholders involved. These principles and business model changes are the input for the Q methodological research. The input for this empirical analysis is statements that are gathered with this scientific base and with the use of expert interviews in addition. These statements were ranked on a scale in relation to each other. This gives a clear view of what respondents find more important in relation to the topic. From the empirical analysis four perspectives were identified. The names of the perspectives are given by the most dominant statements and the most diverging statements that represented that perspective, so that they represent their content. “Steering the traffic market” shows that restrictive measures are in favour, “Transaction cost economics” shows that parties find it too expensive to shift to urban consolidation because high investments, “Start at the parties with resources” shows that some producers provide opportunities for consolidation and “Restrictions are not done!” presents the lack of support for restrictive measures. Additional factors that were found important are neutrality, product differentiation, positive behaviour rewarding and harmonization between cities. How to deal with these perspectives in relation to the three dimensions of scalability was the main aim in this thesis. In relation to scalability in terms of volume one can best start at shippers. These shippers have the characteristics of large producers with a very differentiated and large product diversity and customers over the whole country so that dedicated or own transport does not have any effect for visibility as their product range is too wide. For other parties, time is an important aspect because of sunk costs and the value of control, visibility and service that is still very high rated at the moment due to the psychological phenomenon ‘justification behaviour’. Logistic service providers are expected to have too high costs to switch when the urban network is still too thin and retailers do not have the resources to make an UCC viable. If restrictions are imposed to contribute to the value propositions of local administrators, then one has to be aware of the effects because government failure lurks. The reasons can be short time horizons and unanticipated effects due to political motivations resp. complex material. In addition it shows that disparities are present between branch organisations and at least a part of the group they represent, what give rise to the question if they should be better linked. Additional services are found not critical and certainly not positive when it adds costs. In relation to applicability to different environments it was derived that system harmonization is important for logistic service providers and shippers in order to prevent that they have to deal with different system interfaces. Different system interfaces will cause that stakeholders are not willing to participate because it is too difficult to adjust to each system individually. IT integration for data communication is very important in the logistic chain. In this way products can be traced and responsibilities can be factored in. Also nation-wide coverage is necessary to assure before efficiency improvement can be guaranteed. This is still not the case and can be referred to as the ‘not invented here syndrome’. Even now certain psychological frameworks are discovered and confirmed in the urban freight dialogue it shows to be very limited what Green City Distribution can bring about in relation to their resources. However, it is important for them to focus on the group of shippers that is aware of the efficiency increase that comes along with urban consolidation if there is enough volume. They have to start at parties that do not have own or dedicated logistic activities, but use the open network. Besides, these parties should be large enough to generate volume. These shippers have the characteristics of large producers with a very differentiated and large product diversity and customers over the whole country so that dedicated or own transport does not have any effect for visibility as their product range is too wide, for instance P&G and Unilever. Because a lot of parties have a negative perception towards urban consolidation it is important to communicate the results of this research to make them aware of the fact that cost efficiency can be reached if parties work together and generate volume. The results of a Q study are very suitable to do so, because stakeholders can identify their selves with the explored ones. For UCC development in general it is advisable to collaborate together with other existing UCC initiatives. In this way a nation-wide coverage can be assured much faster and stakeholders engage earlier when systems are the same, for this they have to break through the ‘not invented here syndrome’.","Sustainability; Urban Freight Consolidation; Q-Methodology; Perspectives","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","T&L","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Veen, C. (mentor); Van der Ham, H.W.M. (mentor); Peerdeman, H.C. (mentor)","2014","The focus of this study is to research if ecc/frc is applicable for integral bridges. Integral bridge are bridges without or partly without intermediaries. A bridge normally consist of a substructure, superstructure and intermediaries. The superstructure comprises the bridge deck and the substructure consist of the abutments, piers and the foundation. The intermediaries are expansion joints and bearings which enables the bridge to deform and/ or to transfer the deformation and loading from the superstructure to the substructure. With or without intermediaries leads to different structural systems. A bridge with these intermediaries is called a ‘conventional bridge’ and a bridge without these intermediaries is called a ‘fully integral bridge’. There are also structural systems in between a conventional bridge and a fully integral bridge. (see chapter 1) Integral bridges have been built in the United States, Canada, Australia and several countries in Europe. The choice for an integral bridge over a conventional bridge depends strongly on the length of the bridge, the bridge location, the climate and the requirements of the bridge and the road. In some states of the U.S., integral bridges are preferred over conventional bridges. Hence, more than 1000 integral bridges have been built in the U.S. including the longest steel and concrete integral bridges. Some states in the U.S. prefer integral bridges over conventional bridges, because in their experience the elimination of expansion joints and bearings leads to a more durable structure and less maintenance. The maximum bridge length is disputed by the State engineers. Normally the allowable length is between 60 and 180 meter depending on the state limitations. (See section 3.1) Integral bridges are not used as a common practice in the Netherlands. The preferred structural system is a conventional bridge. The integral bridges that have been built, seem to be a choice of the designer. Most of the integral bridge that have been built, are single span bridges. (See section 3.1) All construction elements of an integral bridge are monolithically connected. This results in one integral system where there is interaction between the sub- and superstructure and between the bridge and the embankment soil. This is an important difference compared to a conventional bridge, where the sub- and superstructure function more like single structural systems. The structural system of an integral bridge can be schematized as a portal frame. In this case the beam of the portal frame is the superstructure and the columns comprise the substructure. In a portal frame, deformation in the beam will cause deformation in the columns. The deformation that occurs in the bridge deck of the integral bridge is caused by loading, temperature influences and time-related material effects. These loads and effects will cause the following rotations and displacements in the structure (see section 3.2): -Vertical displacement and rotation (weight of the bridge, asphalt, traffic) - Rotation (temperature gradient daily cycle) - Contraction (shrinkage, creep, elastic shortening prestressing) - Expansion (temperature yearly cycle) An integral bridge is a durable structure due to the absence of expansion joints and bearings. However, without expansion joints and bearings the bridge deforms into the soil due to the deformation of the bridge deck. The deformation of the bridge deck is caused by the temperature influences and time-related material effects. The time-related material effects are shrinkage, creep and elastic shortening in case of a prestressed concrete element. These effects are responsible for deformation of the bridge deck in time. The temperature influences lead to a cyclic behaviour. This behaviour could be divided in two cycles, namely a yearly and a daily cycle. Both cycles causes cyclic deformation of the bridge deck. This deformation of the bridge deck is only possible if the bridge is able to deform into the soil. This may imply certain problems, because the soil is not rheological. These problems are (See also section 0 and chapter 4): - Settlement of the soil close to the abutment ‘bump in the road’ - Asphalt/pavement problem - Foundation/piles - Early age cracking - Wing walls - Cracking of the abutment stem or the bridge deck at the abutment The major goal of this thesis is to investigate if the application of frc/ ecc in the connection of integral bridge has advantages. Fibre reinforced cementitious composites could be distinguished from conventional concrete due to the application of fibres. The application of fibres leads to some interesting properties, for example a higher strength, more ductility, more toughness, durability, higher stiffness and thermal resistance. FRC composites could be distinguished in ‘hardening and ‘softening’. An FRC composite has ‘hardening’ when the structural strength is equal to or greater than the cracking strength. This means that after the first ‘crack’ the tensile strength of the FRC composite is still increasing. This hardening can also occur under bending, and then the FRC composite is called ‘deflection-hardening’. When this hardening occurs under tension then the FRC composite is called ‘strain-hardening’. An FRC composites has ‘strain-softening’, when the tensile strength declines after the first crack. (see chapter 6) There is chosen to apply the FRC composites in the connection. A major motivation is to reduce reinforcement in the connection between the sub- and superstructure. This is firstly investigated by constructing strut-and-tie-models (STM) and string-panel model (SPM). The STM and SPM showed that influence of foundation pile on the connection is decisive. Two mechanisms could describe for the structural behaviour of the foundation pile in the connection. The first mechanism is the transfer of forces and moments by friction between the foundation pile and the surrounded concrete (Figure 7-4A) and the second mechanism is the transfer of forces and moments by a coupling force (Figure 7-4b). Both mechanisms are analysed by using the STM and SPM. This provided a good image of the flow of the forces and stresses in the connection. (See chapter 7 and appendix A) The 2D FEM is developed on basis of the results of the STM and the SPM and the building project ‘bridge Schokkeringweg’. The forces, the moment, the boundary conditions and the dimensions are based on the calculations of the ‘bridge Schokkeringweg’. The research focuses on the two mechanisms. Therefore, friction and cohesion between the foundation pile and the surrounded concrete and the horizontal reinforcement in this area are taken as variables. The results show that the strength of the connection depends mostly on the horizontal reinforcement and cohesion and friction have almost no influence. (More about the conclusions, see section 8.6) The next step was to investigate the effect of the FRC composites on the 2D FEM. The FRC composites used in this research are classified on basis of tensile strength, strain and ‘hardening or softening’. For this research, a 2D FEM with and without horizontal reinforcement in the area of the foundation pile is used. The results show that FRC composites leads to an improvement of the rotational stiffness of the connection and for 2D FEM without horizontal reinforcement also to a higher structural strength of the connection. However, the improvements are minor and therefore it is advised to not apply FRC composites in integral bridges.

(mentor); Van Duin, J.H.R. (mentor); Wiegmans, B. (mentor); Halim, R.A. (mentor)","2014","At present, the problem of the greenhouse effect pushes people to pay more attention to the effects of emission. Carbon dioxide is one of the main greenhouse gases. And freight transportation represents the primary contributor of CO2 emission compared to other sectors. Thus, the emission of container transport, which is the main method of transportation all over the world, is the main research object in this thesis. The impact of CO2 emission is a hot topic in transportation that will be highlighted in the near future. One question will challenge our conventional modeling and traffic operations: How can the World Container Model be extended to model the effects of CO2-emission cost and what effects on international container flows are expected? The World Container Model (WCM) is used as a fundamental model in this thesis. Due to the threat of climate change, changes in energy policy and so on, the future circumstances of container flows are less certain. The World Container Model (WCM) has been developed as an efficient tool to analyze possible shifts in future container transport demand and the impacts of relevant transport policies. It is a strategic model for the movement of containers on a global scale and predicts yearly container flows over the world’s shipping routes. However, the WCM does not take into account the effects of CO2 emission, which is not the expected model that operators want. The effects of CO2 emission in the transport process, especially the costs, play a more and more important role in the consideration of international container transport. During the process of choosing transport routes, there are some relationships with the effects of emission. That is to say, before transport routes are chosen, not only the cost of the transport but also the environmental effects will be taken into account in this thesis research. (Liao, Lu, & Tseng, Carbon dioxide emissions and inland container transport in Taiwan, 2011) In other words, an extended WCM is designed and developed that takes into account the costs of CO2 emission. The new model offers a desirable contribution that provides insight into a range of new possible structures of global trade patterns as well as consequences for the transportation system. The first part of the main research question is answered first. The World Container Model has been extended with a new scenario executed in the model. This new scenario is designed to add the cost of CO2 emission into the cost of travel time and transfer. There are three important factors in the function: maritime (0.025 euro per TUE), hinterland (0.57 euro per TEU) and transfer. During the process of calculation, these factors are changed by adding the respective unit cost of the corresponding CO2 emission (during maritime and hinterland transport, at terminal). In this way, the unit cost per container move increase. Then the effects of CO2 emission should be visible from the outcomes of the model. With this extended World Container Model, the second part of the main research question can be answered. From the outcomes, the effects of CO2 emission cost on international container flows can be analyzed. The outcomes reveal that the competitiveness of ports on a global scale changes. It is noteworthy that some ports, like Amsterdam, previously with small throughputs and transhipment, experience a new opportunity for development and prosperity. However, some important ports, like the port of Rotterdam, retain their competitiveness thanks to their advantages of geographic location and insistence on policies for controlling emission. In short, due to the impact on the cost of extra CO2 emitted, the routes of maritime container transport have been reselected and throughput has been redistributed. Afterwards, these effects are further analyzed in consideration of two scenarios. Based on the analysis and the scenarios that have been modeled using the extended World Container Model, the applicability of this model and the analysis for the effects of different policies and measures can be tested and verified. Scenario A: slow steaming (the speed of vessels slows down) Scenario B: CO2 price (the price of CO2 emission changes as time passes) For scenario A: most of the European ports retain their attractiveness, which is enhanced by the growth of their throughput. Meanwhile, with the decreasing speed, the throughputs of these ports will increase further. For instance, the port of Antwerp is one of the ports that will probably lose their competitiveness in container transportation in Europe, if the measure of slow steaming shall be taken to reduce the CO2 emission. The similar situation could also occur in the ports of Amsterdam, Le Havre and Bremen. For scenario B: with an increased CO2 tax, most of the European ports like Rotterdam and Hamburg will experience greater chances for development because of the large number of containers being imported and exported. In contrast, the ports of Antwerp, Amsterdam, Le Havre and Bremen show negative outcomes of throughputs from the extended World Container Model. This finding may imply that these ports will face challenges in response to an increase in the CO2 price in the future. In both scenarios, the ports of Antwerp, Amsterdam, Le Havre and Bremen show negative outcomes of throughputs from the extended World Container Model. On the contrary, other ports in Europe, like Rotterdam and Hamburg, retain their competitiveness in future international container traffic. The different situations may occur due to the effects of handling cost. For example, the handling cost at the port of Rotterdam is less expensive than that at the port of Antwerp, mainly because the port of Rotterdam has more efficient handling equipment and better hinterland connection. Finally, the method used to calculate the total volume of CO2 emission is introduced. It is achieved by data modeling on the basics of the extended WCM. The port of Rotterdam, as a case, is studied with analysis of all scenarios and the calculation of CO2 emission. For scenario A: with the speed of vessels slowing down, the throughputs of the port of Rotterdam increase. Beyond doubt, this results in the growth of CO2 emission at the area of the terminal. But for maritime container transport, the total volume of CO2 emission is decreased along with the speed cut, mainly because of the reduction in the number of routes towards and away from the port of Rotterdam (the number of routes to or from Rotterdam decreases from 2,290 to 2,140). For scenario B: with the growth of the CO2 tax, the port of Rotterdam still retains its attractiveness as one of the largest ports in the world. Its throughput and transhipment continue to increase. On the other side, for maritime transport, the CO2 emitted by containers moving towards and away from Rotterdam will be reduced as the CO2 tax increases. To conclude, this report has proposed a method of predicting global container transport that incorporates travel time and traffic CO2 emission in the composite route choice cost function, which provides reasonable suggestions on the effects of a given scenario to reduce the emission. According to the results of the scenarios, the port of Rotterdam will experience positive effects with the growth of throughput and transhipment. When considering increasing CO2 emission in the future, Rotterdam still needs to focus on improving the efficiency of handling at terminal. Such consideration depends on operation performances and terminal configurations. This measure works only over the long term and the costs are high but it is very effective. The impacts and probabilities should be adjusted over time. In response to increasing CO2 emission, the strategy should also focus on energy conservation and renewable energy. These considerations also correspond with the actual situation, which confirms the outcomes of our extended WCM reasonably. The other ports in Europe, like Antwerp, which exhibit negative effects as a result of scenarios, need to be more careful. The extended WCM in this research has shown that it can be used to assess the effects of a wide range of developments. As a strategic tool for policy development, it is able to assist the port to support decisions and take appropriate measures.","World Container Model; CO2 emission; Global network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","51.59318, 4.21288"

S. (mentor); Simao Ferreira, Carlos (mentor); Holierhoek, J.G. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Technical University of Denmark (degree granting institution)","2014","In an effort to achieve economic sustainability, the major challenge for offshore wind remains to bring down costs by approximately 35 % before 2020. With wind farm sites going into deeper waters, further from shore, with more difficult bottom conditions and rougher wave climate, costs are rising faster than the improvements in the technology are able to drive them down. Despite these obstacles, wind farms further offshore offer better wind resource, less socio-economic restrictions and diminished environmental impacts. To satiate this need, floating wind turbines provide a feasible promise. In the wake of current Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (Hawt) floating projects such as HyWind, IDEOL etc, the perceived positive impact of the floating system, especially for larger scale machines, is reduced due to large overturning moments and difficult accessibility of the \moving"" nacelle. A possible solution to these obstacles is presented by the DeepWind project which focuses on implementing a Floating Offshore Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (Fo-Vawt) on a spar structure. In this report, the economic feasibility of a Fo-Vawt concept in far offshore wind farm is assessed - from current to multi-megawatt rated power. The possible benefits of a Fo-Vawt are translated into cost indicators for the main aspects of an offshore wind farm project. The difference in turbine capex, perceived reductions in balance of plant costs and the impact on opex, is modelled into an engineering framework to determine the Levelised Cost of Energy. Considering mass and swept area as the base factors, the mass of the baseline DeepWind turbine design [66] is approximated and broken down into material and manufacturing costs with adjustments for inflation and other financial variables over the lifetime of the wind farm. Using ECN's omce package, a detailed operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) strategy is devised and implemented with respect to Vawt systems and a floating wind farm. The grid infrastructure, installation and project development costs are estimated using TU Delft's Offshore Wind Farm Design Emulator tool developed by Zaaijer [75]. All these components are combined to deduce the cost of energy for the DeepWind and the turbine capital costs for similar turbine designs. To study the design space of the cost model, a sensitivity study of the main presumptions was done along with an evaluation of LCoE impact from rotor, floater and generator design. Using geometric up-scaling methods, the baseline Fo-Vawt design was sized for higher rated power capacities and corresponding loads simulated using HAWC2. Considering a 245 MW wind farm, a workspace was created to assess where the greatest potential in cost reductions exist and provide impact trigger's for future research . It was seen that the turbine capital costs for a Vawt are not significantly higher than for a comparable state-of-the-art 5MW Hawt. The reliability of a Vawt is better and subsequently the wind farm has a higher availability, assuming the same technology maturity level as a present day Hawt. Although, possible higher fixed capital costs originate for the specialised supply chain to maintain floating turbines and the DeepWind subsystems. This on average pushes the annual opex beyond e120/kW. The capex/kW extends between e2520 to e2780/ kW for the 5 to 15 MW Fo-Vawt's respectively, leading to a Levelised Cost of Energy frome113.56 to 117.1 per MWh.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); De Gijt, J.G. (mentor); Van Tol, A.F. (mentor)","2014","Old quay walls are present in many cities in the Netherlands and characterise itself by a masonry top construction (sometimes with basalt on the water side to prevent erosion of the masonry) with a wooden relieving floor. Rows of wooden piles bear the top construction. Since these quay walls are generally more than 100 years old, extra inspections and deformation measurements are needed to prevent sudden failure of the walls. Some of the old quay walls do not meet current safety standards, but show little signs of poor condition. The replacement of all the walls at short notice would be costly. In this research it is assumed that hidden safeties play an important role in the better than expected condition of the old quay walls. The objective of the research is to investigate these hidden safeties in order to make a better prediction of the remaining lifespan of old quay walls. To unveil the hidden safeties, a case is linked to the research; the Nassaukade in Rotterdam (profiles 059-015 and 059-019). Four aspects which are investigated are; difference between the design surface load and the actual usage of the quay walls, undrained behaviour of the soils, the used soil parameters and the interaction between masonry and wood. Based on the casestudy it can be concluded that since old quay walls are generally more than 100 years old, historical investigation is needed to gain better insight in dimensions and materials of the old quay walls. New drawings do often not show the correct dimensions and materials. Old builder's specifications mostly contain this information. Besides this in Plaxis, when using undrained parameters instead of drained parameters the deformations are smaller and the safety factors are higher than with drained behaviour. With drained parameters the loads on the construction are very high and are in fact calculated as a permanent load. Also, using local test results instead of the national table (Table 1 of NEN 6740) with soil parameters to define the parameters for geotechnical calculations will lead to a more realistic soil model of that particular location. During the thesis, new parameter sets have been set up for 2 and 5% strain, leading to higher cohesion and E50 values of peat and clay (compared to the national table). During the thesis, different experimental set-ups are used to determine the shear friction coefficient between wood and masonry. Although there are exceptions due to a variance in quality of the wooden planks (and the ‘new’ age of the wood), the overall shear friction coefficient found in the tests performed in this research is 0.75. This is higher than the 0.4 and 0.5 that are normally used in the hand calculations and in Plaxis. This thesis identifies four hidden safeties in old quay walls. Each one of these separately can be implemented in current calculation methods. This could be a positive contribution towards estimating the remaining lifespan of quay walls.","Old quay walls; Nassaukade; Shear friction coefficient; Parameter sets","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

This thesis explores the use of the PS method to detect flaws in in-situ constructed foundation piles as an alternative to existing testing methods. An acoustic signal is introduced to the head of the pile with a hammer. An elastic wave propagates through the pile, and vibrations are radiated out into the soil. Neighbouring the pile, geophones are lowered or pushed into the ground such that the vibrations in the soil can be measured. Theoretically, the vibrations originating from the pile shaft should provide a blueprint of the pile's condition. Flaws will affect wave arrivals, damping, and cause reflections. However, difficulties arise if the soil should be considered heterogeneous or when vibrations of the shaft are masked by other vibrations originating from the surface or the pile toe. A computer model was made using an analytical approach to determine what vibrations may develop. This was followed by two field tests with the PS on an experimental pile field. From the results an understanding of vibrations in the pile and soil was developed and an attempt was made to detect any flaws. The procedure did not sufficiently measure the vibrations radiated from the pile shaft while avoiding interference from other vibration sources or soil heterogeneity. The field test did however provide a better understanding of the vibrations that develop in the soil. This provided improvements on the model, allowing for more extensive simulations. Based on these, possible improvements on the PS procedure were realised.","defects; Parallel seismic; detection; acoustics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

First, it explores how consumers respond to differences in the physical properties, the fidelity, of a prototype. Secondly this research investigates how consumers evaluations of radical new products respond to differences in language abstraction in explanatory texts. Three studies were conducted. The first study employed a 2 x 2 (prototype fidelity; high/low) x (language abstraction; concrete/abstract) between subjects design and measured attitude, advantages, purchase intention, usability, product comprehension, appearance and argument strength. The second study measured vividness of both texts. The third study employed a 1 x 2 (combined abstract-concrete text) x (prototype fidelity; high/low) between subjects design and measured product comprehension, product attitude advantages, performance and purchase intention. Results show that a low-fidelity three-dimensional prototype together with an explanatory text elicit the same product evaluations as a high fidelity prototype. Strategic product designers do not need to spend hours or days of their time and their budgets creating beautifully finished prototypes to present their new product idea to key stakeholders and potential investors: a fast 3D printed prototype with explanatory text is sufficient to get these people involved in the project. From the results it can be presumed that it is not only the vividness of a text that influences product evaluations; abstractness of the used language is also of influence.

With modern electronics, creating and sharing content has become very convenient, but this convenience has come at a price. Devices like smartphones that enable us to easily share content, are costly and complex. Devices like USB flash drives, on the other hand, are low cost and simple. However, they do lack the convenience of smartphones when it comes to sharing content. The wireless memory presented in this thesis aims to overcome the gap between simplicity and convenience. We have designed a worlds-first wireless memory system composed of two components: a reader and a tag. The tag is a simple device to store user content while, the reader is able to access and manipulate the content on the tag. This thesis details the components required for designing and implementing a wireless memory. This knowledge is then used to build a proof-of-concept wireless memory. The resulting design is capable of wirelessly powering the tag and exchanging end-to-end data with a maximum speed of 31 kBps for reading and 27 kBps for writing. The peak power measured in the experiments was 2450mW, with a system efficiency of 57 %. The peak efficiency was measured at 69 %.

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Weijers, J.B.A. (mentor); Huijskes, E.J. (mentor)","2014","Floods cause, even in modern countries, a lot of victims and damage every year. Generally, countries invest in prevention and protection, yet, also emergency response measures could be a (last) option. Regarding the latter, a distinction is made between preventive emergency measures (e.g. sand bags to raise the crest level of a flood defence) and curative emergency measures (e.g. measures to combat a breach in a flood defence). It can be stated that the knowledge about the closure of a dike breach and the implementation of emergency measures is not at the desired level. Besides, closing a breach is very difficult and it is rarely performed successfully. There is a need for research regarding emergency closure of dike breaches indicated by among others Dutch Water Boards. The problems of a dike breach can broadly be categorized in three fields: organizational problems, logistical problems and technical problems. This thesis focusses mainly on the technical problems, distinguishing breach characteristics and type of emergency measures. Therefore, in this thesis the research question is: What is the effectiveness and applicability of curative emergency measures, applied in developing breaches in a Dutch river or lake dike? To get a better understanding of the effect of emergency measures, simulations of developing breaches including emergency measures can be made with a numerical model. Simulations have several advantages. It allows identification of breach characteristics like duration and breach stages during closure attempts. Furthermore, it can be used to optimize closure strategies and measures and it can help flood managers to prepare for emergency situations. However, such a model is non-existent. Yet, XBeach is capable of simulating emergency measures as so-called non-erodible layers in developing breaches. With some modifications XBeach seems promising for simulating breach development with emergency measures. The modifications are based on XBeach’s limitations. First, emergency measures are implemented as non-erodible layers, these are however not adjustable in time. Running multiple simulations after each other representing the different closure phases, solves this problem. Second, the non-erodible layer is always stable. This means that the emergency measure can not move due to high flow velocities or scour during the simulation. This is the main limitation of XBeach for this research. To still be able to check the stability, separate calculations are done. Third, XBeach is not a 3D model. Therefore, emergency measures where a 3D effect (piping) plays an important role are not modelled. Fourth, XBeach is only capable of simulations with non-cohesive sand. To deal with this, a scaling from non-cohesive to cohesive timespans was made. For a breach closure in a sand dike, there is (likely too) little time. To estimate the time available in cohesive dikes, the timing is scaled to realistic proportions. Various curative measures exist. Simulated measures in this study in XBeach are a scaffold, Big Bags, a vessel and an emergency dike. The emergency dike seems to be the most promising measure. It makes use of the smaller flow velocities upstream of the breach. The breach dimensions stay smaller and the polder water level is lower. Point of attention is the static stability after the closure, with piping as the most important threat. Logistically seen, a complete closure with an emergency dike for a breach in a clay dike is plausible, using trucks to bring in Big Bags and helicopters to place them at the desired location. Next to these simulations, case studies of performed closures are evaluated, a field test is carried out and recommendations to set up a Decision Support System are done.","emergency closure; dike breach; emergency measure; curative measure; breach process; breach closure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

First the selection of a constitutive soil model, that captures adequately the known aspects of the mechanical behaviour of natural BC, is addressed. To this purpose, three conventional, drained, strain-controlled triaxial compression tests and one high pressure oedometer test, performed on intact BC samples originating from Essen (Belgium) which were extracted from the literature, were numerically simulated utilising the lab test facility of the PLAXIS 2D 2011 software. The Linear Elastic Perfectly Plastic-Mohr Coulomb model, the Modi?ed Cam-Clay model, the Soft Soil-Creep model and the Hardening Soil (HS) model were calibrated on the basis of the test results. Based on the comparison of the numerical results with the test data, it was concluded that the HS model performed best, especially in terms of reproducing the evolution of sti?ness and mobilised shear strength under triaxial compression, which are deemed to be the most predominant processes a?ecting the behaviour of the BC host rock due to a tunnel excavation. Subsequently, the level of in?uence of the geotechnical properties of BC, used as input parameters for the HS model, on the radial extent of the fully Plastic Zone (PZ) and of the Hydro-Mechanical (HM) disturbance, caused by an undrained tunnel excavation, is investigated. The level of in?uence of the soil properties on the magnitude of the hoop forces (N) in the tunnel liner and on the magnitude of the generated pore water pressures (u) around the excavation is examined as well. This was achieved by numerically simulating an undrained tunnel excavation in the BC host rock, in two-dimensional plane strain conditions, with the PLAXIS 2D 2011 ?nite element program. A mechanical sensitivity analysis was performed by varying, individually, selected HS model input parameters to upper and lower bound values. It was found that the thickness of the PZ was mainly in?uenced by the magnitude of the elastoplastic shear sti?ness of the material. The radial extent of the HM disturbance was mostly a?ected by the elastic shear sti?ness of the soil. Finally, the magnitude of N in the liner and the magnitude of u in the vicinity of the excavation were found to be primarily in?uenced by the value of the e?ective friction angle (?') of the BC material.","Boom Clay; geotechnical modelling; tunnelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""

However, innovation is an expensive and risky endeavor and current method and management tools have been widely criticized. The software industry has radically changed over the last decade. Approaches, such as soft- launching early-stage (beta) products on the market to see what sticks with consumers have essentially made innovation cheaper, easier, faster and less risky. This study investigates the implications of applying an early-stage soft-launch approach to consumer hardware products. A case study within a single corporate setting of a high tech consumer products company, found that the differences between hardware and software product development are so significant that methodologies and product development approaches do not translate directly between the two domains. Similarly, it was found that soft-launching products does not lower the required capital investments in tooling and manufacturing. Instead, for relatively a small investment, soft-launching offers companies an opportunity to reevaluate their go- to market strategy, business plan and potential barriers for adoption and commercial success prior to investing in a capital-intensive full-scale launch. Soft-launching was especially found to be useful for new ventures or innovations that create entirely new or disrupt existing markets, ecosystems or infrastructures, facing extremely high risk, that can only be managed if levels of external uncertainty is mitigated through market probing. Managers are advised that soft-launching is not a trial- and-error process; learning goals, KPI’s and a clear strategic intent has to be outlined prior soft-launching a product and the organization must be ready to pivot the product strategy based on the data provided by the soft- launch. Managers are also recommended to consider the impact soft-launching may have on a brand and customer satisfaction if market expectations are exaggerated or not met by the quality of the early-stage product.","Innovation Management; New Product Development; Design Strategy; Hardware; Uncertainty; Risk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2016-10-14","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","Wearable electronics is a nascent sector of technology that is already generating a lot of excitement and speculation as a clear candidate for (yet another) disruptive innovation. Data from the (social) Internet in combination with various deployments of ubiquitous computing such as the Internet of Things (IoT) together a promise of unprecedented intersection of the online and offline worlds, a new dimension rich with ambient information. Wearables present therefore an incredible opportunity to re-invent how we connect to ourselves and the world around us. And perhaps this is a timely intervention for modern civilisation. The technological aspect of modern socio-technical systems enables great flows of information, vastly extending human agency as well. Essential social processes are enabled and carried out over communication technologies; fundamental social structures are changing. However, the opportunities to witness one another, already tenuous in physical presence, do not smoothly transition into the new generation of technology-mediated interactions, be it person-to-person or person-to-system. It is only through the act of witnessing one another that people establish presence and develop trust, in ever-expanding merging biological, social and algorithmic realities. As a technological medium acting at the very boundary of the individual in both the physical and digital world, it would be interesting to design wearables that enhance witnessing in modern network(ed) societies. This work approaches the effort simultaneously from Policy Analysis, sociology and Science and Technology Studies (STS) perspectives. Key references include Marshall McLuhan (Medium Theory), Barry Wellman (Networked Individualism) and Caroline Nevejan (Witnessed Presence). This is coupled with a case-study of an upcoming wearable called BOND by Kwamecorp, a new media agency. BOND utilises the touch modality that wearables uniquely can harness, to send tickles between a pair of synced devices. The product is targeted at intimate couples. As such, both the wearable form-factor as well as the novel communication channel make BOND ideal for investigating witnessed presence in wearables. It was found that wearables in their mobility and portability can be imagined as technological organs on the modern human being. A useful design mantra for wearables was condensed as contextual embodied augmentation. Context-sensitivity demands specialised affordances; embodiment refers to intuitive extensions and calls to action that keep users immersed in the real world, as opposed to the reality-in-a-screen; and finally augmentation is recommended as a design principle such that wearables provide ways the enrich reality with information. Touch-modality is seen as a promising new avenue unique to wearables; digital stimuli can be ‘affective’ on users. Wearables in their selective and portable enhancement divorce traditionally conflated social function and physical place, condensing expertise into portable devices. In bridging the digital-physical world, wearables become the offline equivalent of digital ‘avatars’, which gain value by storing valuable personal information and furthermore using them to provide pointed affordances for (inter)actions in both online and offline worlds. An ethnographic study of Kwamecorp and a design history of BOND contributes an insider look at new technology development in a contemporary startup setting. Interviews conducted with nine designers from Kwamecorp are analysed to elucidate the design intentions of BOND. BOND’s Touch module is confirmed to facilitate witnessed presence by enhancing co-presence among interacting parties. This is enabled by a ‘quantum of presence’ interaction. This discretised form of connectivity is in line with a general trend of affordances to counterbalance the greater frequency of connection and communication in modern living. These kinds of communications, in their reduced format, are both easily deployable in wearables and, while the reduction in complexity can be ambiguous, it is a feature that invites more creative participation from both parties. Ultimately, the thesis is useful to anyone interested in developing both industrial and consumer applications with wearable electronics, those interested in how sociological insights can help actively in the design of new technologies for socio-technical systems, or as a primer for witnessed presence","witnessed presence; socio-technical systems; science and technology studies; policy analysis; new media; wearable electronics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

One of the environmental impacts related to dredging is increased suspended sediment concentration (SSC) levels, forming plumes of sediment. These so called dredge plumes originate from spillage of dredged material. Especially the fine sediment can stay in suspension on long time and spatial scales. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) are conducted prior to the project's start to assess impact of dredging activities. One of the concerns of an EIA is to determine dredge induced rise of SSC levels. Forecast modelling is often applied to simulate dredge plumes in order to verify SSC and sedimentation levels. However, due to large uncertainties about the project, input parameters and ambient parameters, forecast modelling of dredge plumes is often challenging. In this study the most important parameters involved in far-field dredge plume dispersion were identified. Furthermore, by means of a numerical model experiment the influence of these parameters on far-field plume results was tested. Subsequently, the model was compared to data from several measurement campaigns concerning dredge plumes. This helped to verify the applicability of the model and made comparison possible between the comparison model output and experimental results. Recommendations were developed, supporting more informed selection of modelling techniques and model input regarding forecast modelling far-field plume dispersion. All recommendations use the requested output as starting point, based on both parameter (concentration or flux) and plume age.","dredge plume; Delft3D; modelling; dredging plume","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-10-13","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The history of the Dam and its pivotal role in the development of Amsterdam is explained in short to gain an understanding of the spirit of the city and how the situation of the Dam-square came to be in 1900. Without this, the big changes on the square would be incomprehensible. Explained are the factors that contributed to the state of the Dam-square at that time and why this was so problematic. After this historic background, the situation of around 1900 is dissected and elaborated. The main story deals with the architectural competition that was held in 1908 and the aftermath which resulted from it. The competition was held to provide an answer to the ‘Damkwestie’ (Dam-issue). This issue was about the question of what the vision of the Dam-square should be and how it should be changed to accommodate the reality of the future. After this competition the situation changed considerably rendering the outcome of the competition almost useless. The newly added idea for the return of the town hall to the square, whether it be by regaining the Palace or a by building a new town hall, would be the main subject of discussion afterwards, as well as about the commission that was founded to provide an answer to this question. The main story of the text ends around 1914 with the start of the 1st World War. After that a short reflection is held about what happened after that period and how this affected the Dam-square in the present.","De Dam; Damplein; prijsvraag; moderne gemeente; raadhuis; publieke werken; Paleis op de Dam; gemeente; Raadhuis-Dam Commissie; Amsterdam; van der Mey (Meij); beurs; Berlage; Kromhout; Damkwestie","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","History","","AR2A010 Architectural History Thesis","",""

In the near future, this technology could enable devices containing LEDs –such as car lights, city lights, screens and home appliances– to form their own networks. VLC, however, is currently limited to point-to-point communication. To unleash the full potential of VLC, more advance network capabilities are required. This Master Thesis presents the design and implementation of a novel research platform aimed at distributed multi-hop visible light communication. Compared to state-of-the-art platforms, our platform provides similar data rates and coverage, but adds two unique characteristics: (i) 360 degree coverage, which is necessary to investigate an important property of LED communication: directionality, and (ii) a flexible design, which allows our platform to be connected to many experimental boards such as Arduino, Beaglebone, Raspberry Pi and sensor nodes. We evaluate the communication properties of our board (link quality, neighbor discovery and packet forwarding), and hope that our work will lower the entry barrier for members of the pervasive and networking communities to investigate and exploit future LED-based networks.","visible light communication; VLC; directional; networking; multihop networking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Software","","Embedded Systems","",""

Design/Methodology/Approach The study develops a theoretical overview based on the growing stream on knowledge processes in relation to innovation. The research features a case study of knowledge processes and innovation in a fast changing large-scale financial institution. Through analysing current knowledge processes in a large-scale financial corporation, the research illustrates how organizations can detect misalignments and improve their current knowledge practices to boost innovation. Findings Findings suggest knowledge acquisition (KA), knowledge sharing/transfer (KS/KT), knowledge integration (KI), and knowledge creation (KA) stimulate innovation. To maximise the benefits, coordination is needed among knowledge management initiatives and involved knowledge processes. Results suggest that observed problems at the case company are related to the size and complexity of the company rather than the type of industry. Research Limitation/implications The study is limited by the small size of the interviewees’ sample, so the results might not represent the conclusions. Practical Implications Numerous organizations and managers aim to increase their innovative capacity through the employment of specific knowledge processes. The study provides managers with a complete overview of knowledge processes in relation to innovation. Therefore, facilitate the detection of misalignment and potential improvements to their current practices to stimulate innovation. Findings suggest that financial institutions share common problems with other large-scale organizations from a broader spectrum of industries. Originality/value The study develops an integrated model on knowledge processes in relation to innovation outcomes undefined yet in current literature. The research contributes with an empirical case study to an area where the number of empirical studies is yet limited. It is a pioneering study on the use of knowledge processes to stimulate innovation, especially in financial institutions contexts.","knowledge processes; innovation; knowledge management; ideas management; knowledge sharing; knowledge creation; knowledge acquisition; knowledge integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Innovation","","MSc Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Breedveld, S. (mentor)","2014","Treatment plan generation in radiation therapy is a multicriteria optimization problem, in which multiple, often conflicting, criteria need to be optimized simultaneously. Several methods can be used to obtain Pareto optimal treatment plans, meaning that no criterion can be improved without deteriorating another criterion. The focus is on the 2-phase ?-constraint (2p?c) method and the reference point method (RPM), which both automatically generate Pareto optimal intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans. Although the plans of the 2p?c method are of high quality, several optimizations need to be performed. For the RPM, only a single optimization is needed per plan. The aim of this thesis is configure the RPM so that the resulting treatment plans are of the same quality as the treatment plans generated by the 2p?c method, and thereby reducing the computation time. The 2p?c method prioritizes the criteria and assigns goal values to them. Then, each criterion is iteratively optimized and constrained according to a rule (depending on whether the goal value was met or not). The number of optimizations needed scales linearly with the number of criteria. A specific configuration of the RPM, namely the lexicographic reference point method (LRPM), maintains the lexicographic ordering of the criteria. Both the 2p?c method and the LRPM have been tested on 30 prostate cancer patients and 2 head-and-neck cancer patients. For the 30 prostate cancer patients, all treatment plans generated by the LRPM were found of similar quality when compared to the plans generated by the 2p?c method. On average, the computation time of the LRPM was 3 minutes, which is a speed-up factor of nearly 12. For the 2 head-and-neck cancer patients, the plans of the LRPM were considered as good as or better than the plans of the 2p?c method with a speed-up factor for the computation time of 3-4.","multicriteria optimization; lexicographic reference point method; radiation therapy; treatment planning; fluence map optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-10-10","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Lei, T.E. (mentor); De Bruine, M. (mentor)","2014","In the beginning of 2014 the International Standard Organization launched the first version of the ISO 55000 series on asset management, which describes the requirements for an asset management system. The ISO claims important benefits for organizations implementing the ISO 55001, but empirical research to support these claims is lacking. This research establishes the most important impact factors of an AMS in terms of the positive and negative effects of the system. Also, the research provides insight into what is to be expected from the implementation of an asset management system in terms of the challenges and critical success factors. Finally, the research attempts to determine what specific aspects or company values of an organization are influenced by the AMS. The main research question was formulated: “How to create insight in the impact of implementing an asset management system (AMS)?” Based on extensive literature study on the impact of management systems in general and a context study of the sector of power and gas grid operators, the term impact has been defined as the influence of impact-factors in five categories (motivations, challenges, positive and negative effects and critical success factors) on four general company values for grid operators (reliability, safety, public image and regulatory requirements) and on three preconditions for existence of almost any organization (employee satisfaction, organizational effectiveness and financial efficiency). Possible impact factors have been identified from the literature study and provided the input for a questionnaire. Triangulation of results from semi-structured interviews with Dutch grid operators, Dutch survey respondents and foreign survey respondents produced lists of most relevant impact factors of implementing an asset management system for operators of power and gas grids in all five categories. The most relevant positive effects influence the organizational effectiveness of the organization by clarification of roles and responsibilities and improved transparency. Negative effects are the unexpected amount of time and effort and the friction among and double work for staff members due to the restructuring. Working up the quality of data on the assets together with realizing the necessary cultural changes have been the most relevant challenges for the grid operators and therefore effective leadership and ensuring commitment of all employees involved have proven to be the most relevant critical success factors. Overall, the grid operators are satisfied with the impact of implementing the asset management system. Interesting conclusions from these results include that although increases in financial and asset performance in terms of increased reliability and safety as a result of implementing an AMS are claimed by the norms, the results of these research do not unambiguously support these claims. In a next step to quantitatively measure the impact of an AMS, research or organizations should instead focus on measuring the increase in organizational effectiveness, with the reduction of time in management meetings spend on investment decisions and the investments saved or made due to the increased insight into asset-related risks as potential performance indicators. Also, the effect of time on the relevance of positive and negative effects seems limited over a period of about eight years. This might indicate that, due to the long lifetime of the assets in this sector, some effects take even longer to surface. Finally, the research support the claim that Dutch grid operators are relatively mature in asset management knowledge and procedures compared to most foreign grid operators. Most conclusions of this research are based on the perception of representatives of grid operators. As responses to the international survey came from all over the world, differences in definitions of asset management and asset management systems as well as differences in maturity in the concepts will have influenced the results. Furthermore, the respondents have positions in different departments and layers of their organizations and will therefore have rated impact from different perspectives, which will have also influenced the outcomes. Finally, the interviewed asset managers are promoters of the systems within their organization and might therefore be somewhat biased in assessing the relevance of asset management systems. Because of these reasons, the results and conclusions should be adopted with care. As the results point out that the positive effects of the system mainly influence the organizational effectiveness, which is an aspect that is mainly used by public organizations (Richard et al., 2008), further research should focus on the commercial impact of the system. Applying a similar methodology in a more private sector will create insight into the commercial value of an AMS. Also, in order to substantiate the findings in this research, further research should focus on analyzing statistical data. Because of the public character of the sector, a lot of data on the performance of the grid operators is available and analysis of this data could provide an objective contribution to assessing the impact of asset management systems.","Asset Management; Power and gas grid operators; Impact; Management Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy and Industry","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor); Jepma, E.J. (mentor); Willemsen, H. (mentor)","2014","This graduation report comprises a study on the feasibility of Kangaroo Transport of premature babies by ambulance, which was initiated by BabyBloom Healthcare. BabyBloom Healthcare is a company that specializes in creating child-, parent- and nurse friendly products for neonatology departments. This study results in a design proposal and a future vision for a new product that encompasses these values. Babies are supposed to be born at gestational age of 40 weeks, however 7.3% of all babies born in the Netherlands is born premature, which means before 37 weeks. At the moment babies can survive increasingly early and the threshold to start medical support is 24 weeks of gestation. Premature babies can be placed in an incubator to allow them to grow in a safe and controlled environment. Premature babies are often transported to other hospitals inside a transport incubator at least once during their hospital period. Transport can have several reasons such as capacity issues or the need for certain specialisms. Two major concerns of incubator transport are: Traffic safety. The baby is often transported without being restrained, which creates an unsafe situation in case of a car crash. Stress. The baby is often getting stressed due to high amount of vibrations, light, sounds, and transfers from and to different incubators. Kangaroo Care is a well-known technique within the neonatology in which a baby is placed skin-to-skin on the bare chest of the parent. The benefits for both baby and parent have been studied and confirmed. The most important effects are regulation of temperature, stabilization of heart and respiration rate and stimulation of bonding between baby and parent. Five sections structure the report. First, an extensive analysis was executed to understand the ambulance service and neonatal context including the associated stakeholders. A literature and qualitative study was performed comprising observations and non-structured interviews. Parents were interviewed and several hospitals and ambulance services were visited. Kangaroo Care and the use of Kangaroo Transport were also analyzed. Kangaroo Care at the hospital was often perceived as very convenient by parents, which resulted in the following design vision: “Kangaroo Transport should be experienced as Kangaroo Care in the hospital”. The decision was made to design for Intensive Care (IC) transport on a foldable ambulance stretcher, which was considered as the most challenging direction. To enable Kangaroo Transport two elements are required. The “Womb” fixates parent and baby, and the “Medical Equipment System” (MES) enables medical care during transport. The ideation section comprises brainstorm sessions that resulted in three idea directions of the Womb. The most promising one, the safety belt idea was chosen for further development. A creative session with nurses was performed to validate MES ideas and one concept was chosen. An iterative process was used at the development section to elaborate the Womb and MES. The idea direction became a concept, which was then immediately tested with a first prototype. The MES was also becoming more detailed in this phase, however, it has been decided that the main focus is the Womb since this future product is more interesting for BabyBloom Healthcare. The design proposal section includes the final result of the design process containing the BabyBloom Womb and the Kangaroo Transport stretcher (KTS). The BabyBloom Womb consists of a harness worn by the parent and a pouch in which the premature baby is readied. The baby can be placed on the retractable plateau of the KTS in case resuscitation, which is one of the three new-to-design accessories of the final KTS proposal. A prototype of the Womb was made to validate the proposal with stakeholders and to obtain a better understanding of the traffic safety. At last, the evaluation section consists of verification by the program of requirements and validation by user testing. The tests resulted in a future implementation plan and several design recommendations. Based on the positive feedback of several stakeholders, it can be concluded that Kangaroo Transport is feasible and can replace Incubator Transport. The baby is expected to experience less stress when moved with Kangaroo Transport and is more secure than before.","Kangaroo Transport; Neonatal Transport; Premature babies; Incubator Transport; Ambulance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-10-10","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2014","We developed bio-inspired reduced-order models of swimmers, consisting of a self-propelling pair of rotating cylinders. The aim of the project is twofold. First, simplified and non-deforming geometries can more easily be employed in small-scale robotic applications to solve relevant engineering problems. Second, they can serve as reduced physics models to efficiently simulate fluid-mediated interactions in schools of swimmers and perform learning studies involving multiple swimmers. In the first half of the thesis, we investigate the self-propulsion regimes of a pair of counter-rotating cylinders. For low rotation rates, the cylinders behave like a vortex dipole and the flow is characterized by an elliptical closed streamline surrounding the cylinders. For intermediate rotation rates, the cylinders move in the opposite direction and each has a different set of closed streamlines. Further increasing the rotation rate, the motion of the pair becomes unstable. We systematically explore the phase space defined by the non-dimensional centre-to-centre distance and the rotational Reynolds number, and find inverted exponential correlations that describe the transition between states. In the second half, we design three different locomotory modes of the cylinder pair, with few degrees of freedom, inspired by the movement of undulatory fish and jellyfish. The parameter spaces were explored with the CMA-ES stochastic optimization algorithm in order to find the best solutions in terms of maximum speed and efficiency. The undulatory fish-inspired motion achieves propulsion by shedding vorticity in a sequence of alternating sign vortices, similarly to its biologic counterpart. The jellyfish-inspired motion during each period sheds a vortex dipole, which generates a strong momentum flux in its wake and thus a large thrust, the definition of the swimming mode of jet-propelled oblate medusae.","vortex method; evolutionary strategy; counter rotating; cylinder; stability; bio-inspired locomotion; reduced order models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Solid and Fluid Mechanics","",""

It has recently been demonstrated that fuel cells can generate electricity, using ammonia as a fuel. The objective of this thesis research is to connect the necessity to remove organically bound-nitrogen and ammonium from sewage with the potential of reduced nitrogen, as incorporated in the compound ammonia, as a valuable and sustainable fuel for a fuel cell. The organically bound nitrogen present in sewage was converted into ammonium ions through anaerobic digestion in an Anaerobic Membrane BioReactor (AnMBR). These ammonium ions were separated from the AnMBR effluent using Ion Exchange (IE). Through a fractionized collection of the IE brine, the ammonium ions were concentrated and a distillation tower was used to further concentrate and convert the ammonium ions into a concentrated ammonia solution. This solution proved sufficiently rich in ammonia to be fed directly to a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), generating electricity. Thus, the described combination of technologies removed ammonium and organically bound nitrogen from the wastewater, producing an effluent with an extremely low ammonium concentration (<4 mg TN/L whereas 10 mg TN/L is allowable according to the discharge regulations) and electricity. The distillation tower proved to be the weakest link in the series of technologies considering the nitrogen recovery. However, the low nitrogen recovery can be attributed to the use of a non-optimal distillation tower design. A distillation tower is a frequently applied conventional technology, and therefore it is reasonable to assume the possibility of optimizing the nitrogen recovery and the energy demand. Assuming an optimized distillation tower and an integrated heat recovery design in between the SOFC and the distillation tower, it is theoretically possible to achieve a net electricity production while also meeting the nitrogen discharge regulations.","Sewer Mining; AnMBR; Ion Exchange; Distillation; Solid oxide fuel cell; waste to resource; sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-10-09","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

Currently Company X produces cat litter only from her bentonite, but other applications might be of economical interest to the company. After scoping down to 4 applications other than cat litter (drilling mud, foundry sand, soil improvement and bleaching earth), the possibility of processing bentonite to gain the physical properties required by these 4 applications was investigated. The information needed for this investigation is mostly gathered from scientific reports based on the processing of Country A bentonites. From the results from earlier researches on Country A bentonites it is concluded that Country A bentonites can be made suitable for all 4 applications through several processing steps. The second part of the report focuses on the market possibilities of the 5 applications (the cat litter application included). It is found that the bleaching earth and the drilling mud market are most likely to be fit for a market entry. It is also concluded that the bleaching earth application is of most economical interest when looked at the net present value of the investment after 15 years. The drilling mud application is of most economical interest when looked at the internal rate of investment. The soil improvement application requires almost no change in processing steps when compared to the production of cat litter and might therefore be of economical interest to Company X. There is a risk of turning up with a negative net present value (after 15 years) when Company X would choose to invest in the drilling mud, foundry sand and bleaching earth application. Therefore the final conclusion is that Company X should do a deeper investigation in the soil improvement application, since it is found that the economic potential is very high for this application. When this seems to be an unrealistic or economical uninteresting investment, Company X should investigate a further expansion of cat litter export.","Bentonite; characterisation; drilling fluid; foundry sand; soil improvement; bleaching earth; processing analysis; market analysis","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-09","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Resource Engineering","",""

Far going globalization makes markets highly competitive, putting the pressure on these organizations to be more innovative and improve the efficiency of its production processes in order to lower overall costs. These goals are aimed to be achieved by introducing elaborate continuous improvement strategies. Implementing such strategies however has far going implications on organizations, in terms of performance management, working culture, and organizational structure. Companies have often implemented one or more continuous improvement strategies. While these strategies promise to result in a perfect process, in practice this is not the case. Problems form when there is a significant gap between company goals and the actual operational performance. In that case a situation arises where not ideal operational performance can be caused by logistical malfunctions, a continuous improvement strategy that is not performing optimal, friction in the organizational structure, or even a combination of all. It is therefore difficult for organizations to identify what causes a non-optimal operational performance, given the complexity of the described environment. The objective of this research is to improve this operational performance by overcoming this knowledge gap. The following general research question is formulated to overcome this knowledge gap: How can large manufacturing companies identify causes of discrete production processes not performing in line with company goals? In this research a three step approach is used. The first step is to zoom out from the logistic process and analyze the characteristics of the organization and the used continuous improvement strategy. By comparing the organizational characteristics with academic literature, strengths and weaknesses of the organization can be identified, and also the corresponding opportunities and threats. The used continuous improvement strategy is analyzed, for it is never flawless. Methodologies keep evolving and improving, and new theories are being developed and tested every day. Looking critical at the used improvement strategy will provide insight in missed opportunities and the importance of certain focal points in the organization. The second step is linking these findings to an analysis of the logistical process. It is important to determine how the operational efficiency is defined and how it is measured. Step one might provide a different perspective for analysis or focal points. In this second step improvement projects can be selected and defined on an operational level. Step three consists of performing the selected improvement projects. It is important to incorporate the findings of step one into these projects. This way the findings in academic theory can be evaluated by testing in practice. This evaluation provides concrete feedback on the found causes of non-optimal performance of the production line. Combining these three steps will provide (i) a thorough analysis of the organization, (ii) identifications of barriers and enablers in the organization, and (iii) will present opportunities to improve the operational efficiency beyond the knowledge that is present in the organization. With the gained knowledge, step one can be repeated in order to create an iterative process for continuous improvement. This approach is conducted and tested at the Heineken brewery in Zoeterwoude, the Netherlands. During a six month period, a real life case study is performed at production line 81, a bottling line that packs beer into cases for export. First it is shown that it is important to take into account the different perspectives between management and operators. In order to improve the production line in a structural way it is essential to communicate with operators in such a way it aligns with their goals. Next to this it is found that there are opportunities in using the tools presented in the Theory of Constraints. Based on a bottleneck analysis, it is shown that the losses with the biggest impact on the total production line are found downstream of the designed bottleneck, signaling a hidden bottleneck. It is shown that the output performance can be significantly improved by diminishing the amount of breakdown in the machines downstream of this hidden bottleneck. The performance indicator “Operational Performance Indicator No Order No Activity” has increased with 6.34 percentage points and the deviation of this indicator has diminished with 1.63 percentage points. If this major increase can be maintained in the future, this improvement could save the organization  115,402 on a yearly basis in non-cash savings. This shows that using the Continuous Improvement strategy Total Productive Management is an effective tool for Heineken to structure its continuous improvement efforts. The foremost general recommendation in respect to strengthening the findings in this research is performing more similar case studies. A case study at a comparable manufacturing organization is necessary to compare results and draw conclusions on the extent to which the findings can be generalized. The expectation is that the found principal-agent dynamic at Heineken is strongly comparable to other large manufacturing organizations. If that is the case, this can be a highly interesting addition to the theory on organizational structures. For Heineken from a logistical point of view it is important to keep working on the newly identified bottlenecks, the Packer and Multipacker machines. Every minute won on these machines can directly benefit the operational efficiency of the entire line. These findings can also be applied at the other production lines in the brewery as well. This horizontal expansion can provide new insights into the general mechanisms of the entire brewery. For the long term it is recommended to involve the proposed rule of thumb in the monthly meeting between a rayon manager and the installation manager. Last, if Heineken wants to cope with the found principal-agent dilemma, a thorough behavioral change is required in the entire organization. It is recommended to implement a form of change management, for example the methodology founded by Kotter (1996).","Continuous Improvement; Total Productive Management; Theory of Constraints; Large Manufacturing Organizations; Real Life Case Study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-09","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport and Logistics","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

The traditional approach for fracture modelling is a combination of either curvature analysis and/or statistical extrapolation of fracture information from well or borehole logging. This approach however does not fully reflect the geological development of a structure. We created a fracture model of the Sehib anticline near Gafsa (Tunisia) based on kinematic evolution and compared it to fracture properties collected during a fieldwork. For this fracture model, we created first a structural model, a kinematic model and a geomechanical model of the structure. The last two models were used as an input for the fracture model. This led to two possible fracture sets each which seems plausible according to the fracture data of the fieldwork. We also created a third fracture set based on layer parallel shortening (LPS). The LPS set does influence the distribution of the other two fracture sets, but the exact area of effect is unknown.","fracture modelling; Move 3D; GoCad","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Applied Geology","","34.203183, 8.689050"

(mentor)","2014","Offshore Wind systems have recently gained popularity. However, as the distance from shore increase, different challenges arise. The use of HVDC link to shore helps to overcome most of the challenges. Current Source converters have long been used as HVDC converters despite of their large footprint and reactive power consumption challenges. Recent development in the converter led to the use of Voltage Source Converters (VSC). There are a number of VSC topologies proposed by the industry and academic researchers. The purpose of this thesis was to compare the dominant converter topologies and identify their merits. The work was done in three phases. Phase I was initial study and literature review where three dominant topologies were selected at the end. Two level VSC, Three level NPC, and Modular Multilevel Converter (M2C) were selected at the end of Phase I. Phase II involved detailed modelling and simulation of the selected converter topologies. The simulation was mainly focused on harmonics and losses. The M2C was found to produce lower harmonics and losses under the same operating conditions and using the same switching device. The M2C also exhibits modular design which gives it scalability. This is critical in todays power system which changes very frequently. The M2C was selected for next phase analysis because of the above and a number of other reasons. Phase III was the final part which included practical work on the selected topology. This task was undertaken on a small scale setup of M2C with 3 cells. The purpose of the setup was to verify theoretical results obtained from simulation. The results showed good correspondence with the ones obtained from simulation. The overall study pointed in the direction of M2C for future HVDC installations despite of the capacitor ripple and complex control challenges.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Electrical Sustainable Energy","",""

(mentor); Ludema, M.W. (mentor); Vrancken, J.L.M. (mentor)","2014","Van Nieuwpoort Transport (VNT) wants to optimise its logistics by applying the Balanced Scorecard (BSC). However applying the BSC to optimize VNT’s logistics presents five challenges: (i) no experience with the BSC, (ii) lacking performance drivers, (iii) traditional culture, (iv) ambiguous leadership commitment, (v) scarce staff-resources. The fourth and fifth challenges are of major concern because the conventional BSC-approach requires both leadership commitment and staff-resources. This report presents a BSC-proposal for optimising VNT’s logistics that is tested by a proof of concept. Based on desk research and interviews the conventional BSC-approach (Kaplan, 2010) can be adapted by a selection of frames – a modified BSC-frame, a logistics frame and a Performance measurement system-frame – to propose a suitable BSC to VNT for logistics optimisation. Nine opportunities (SWOT) for logistics optimization, of which three lack leadership commitment, are identified based on interviews, observation and data-analysis. A BSC, presented by a strategy-map consistent with eight out of nine opportunities, is proposed to VNT. The implementation plan is a roadmap to achieve the strategic goals for the perspectives of internal process and learning & growth of the strategy map. A Prototype-PMS that has the TMS as only data-source is designed, developed and used for evaluation. The practical utility is that logistics optimization by means of the proposed BSC is possible to some extent. The scientific utility is that the proof of concept shows the feasibility of the approach used in this situation. Therefore main conclusion is that a suitable BSC is proposed to optimise VNT’s logistics while taking into account that extensive triangulation limited internal –and structural validity of the implementation plan and PMS-prototype. Some recommendations are made to improve the validity and utility of the proposed BSC.","Balanced Scorecard; Logistics Optimisation; Performance Measurement System; Leadership Commitment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport and Logistics","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor); Van der Toorn, A. (mentor); Hoogenboom, P.C.J. (mentor); Esteban, M. (mentor)","2014","Introduction Typhoons and tsunamis are dangerous phenomena for our society and Japan has been exposed to both of these hazards. The risks of these hazards are getting bigger and bigger due to the growing population in the cities near these ‘dangerous’ coasts. This thesis focuses on the design of a storm surge barrier located in Tokyo bay to reduce the flooding risk of Tokyo and its surrounding areas, based on a global-to-detailed approach. Design framework The span between Yokosuka and Futtsu is considered as the most suitable location for the placement of a barrier. Typhoons had been considered as the main threat. Requirements: § Resist Ise-wan types of typhoon (1959) § Contain navigation channel sufficient for future usage § Maintain as much as possible water exchange between bay and sea Design process Based on the requirements and analysis it is chosen for a barrier that is partly closure dam and partly moveable barrier, from which the moveable barrier is placed above the under water dam at the deepest part of the span. Since this thesis focuses on the moveable barrier, the design process proceeds with only the design of the moveable barrier. As it is presumed that earthquakes will be critical for this project during the chosen design life, a new concept, the floating moveable barrier, is chosen for further design due to its great potential regarding earthquake resistance. Considering the cost and the preferred weight and size of the gate, the inflatable rubber gate is applied for the floating moveable barrier. A preliminary for this floating moveable barrier is drafted to find the required main dimensions and configurations. Based on this preliminary design it is found that by placing maximum 5 floating moveable barriers, both the navigation channel and the gap between the floating moveable barrier and the under water dam can be left open without the water level rise inside the protected area exceeds its acceptable limit. In the last design step the earthquake resistance of the floating moveable barrier regarding resonance is checked based on an analytical dynamic model. Based on the results from dynamic model the floating moveable barriers over the span is expected to be stable during the earthquakes. But because of the simplicity of the used model and limited validation material, more research regarding the dynamic behaviour of the floating barrier is needed. If the floating barriers appear to be unstable, the sag of the mooring line can be changed to adjust the stiffness of the system. Conclusion and recommendation Overall the floating moveable barrier has been considered as a technically feasible design and it has shown great potential in its effectiveness regarding the earthquake resistance and flexibility in maintenance and replacement. Recommendations for future research: § Check dynamic behaviour under both earthquake and storm conditions using more detailed numerical model including the contribution of the water damping and the sag of the mooring lines § Anchor design § Economical feasibility analysis § Possible closure methods for the gap between the underwater dam and the floating moveable barrier. § Possible erosion problems of the gap between the floating moveable barrier and the under water dam.","floating moveable barrier; Tokyo Bay; typhoon; tsunami; earthquake","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

(mentor)","2014","An organ-on-chip device, called Cytostretch (Philips NV), that is capable of mechanically stimulating cultured cells, is the subject of this study. The device comprises a microthin PolyDiMethylSiloxane membrane that is highly elastic, on which titanium nitride electrodes have been embedded. Its utility is projected in cardiac research to emulate the mechanically beating on the muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) of the beating heart and record the extracellular potentials simultaneously. The device is in its nascent state and requires validation through suitable experiments, for which a pneumatic apparatus was built. Following an overnight cyclic stretching, the membrane deforms permanently owing to hysteresis, which inhibits the formation of a uniform monolayer of cells on the membrane. There was a wide device-to-device variation in the noise levels at the electrodes in the MircoElectrode Array (MEA) recordings. Field potential recordings during spontaneous beating of cardiomyocytes cultured on the membrane were obtained successfully in the relaxed state of the membrane. The MEA recordings are however, accompanied by artefacts at the instance of stretching or relaxing the membrane which interfere with the field potential of the cardiomyocytes. The cardiomyocytes in the device died after their cyclic stretching, thought they were not detached from the membrane. In conclusion, the permanent deformation challenges the utility and re-usability of the device when uniform monolayer of cells is desired. Therefore, the mechanical properties of the membrane and metallic interconnect should be revised. The interference from the stretching artefacts hampers the quality of MEA recordings. The method of stretching needs revision to prevent damage to the cells and high frequency stretching artefacts. The susceptibility of the silicon chip toward optical noise during MEA recording omits the microscopic investigation together with MEA recording.","cardiomyocytes; stretching; organ-on-chip; Micro-Electrode Array; PDMS; solenoid valve; field potential; noise; artefacts","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-10-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical Engineering","","Instrumentation","",""

(mentor)","2014","Laminated composites is a material that is rapidly being adapted in the aircraft industry and new joining techniques are being researched for new structural designs. One such technique is adhesive bonding, which can result in decreased weight, fuel saving and improved strength of aircraft components. Robust strength and failure analysis methods are required to assess new designs beforehand. One of these methods is co-hesive zone modelling. Cohesive zone modelling is a technique based on cohesive forces and energy within a material or interface region which keeps material together. Damage can be tracked progressively along a region with cohesive elements and damage propagation can be monitored in a structure. This thesis work relies on cohesive zone modelling to monitor damage propagation of the bondline and in between plies of simple bonded joints, together with progressive failure criteria to assess any failure within the plies of a joint. A composite Cracked Lap Shear (CLS) specimen was tested with results of a possible crack jump from bondline to adherend. The objective of this thesis was to assess and recreate damage propagation and the possibility of a jumpof damage growth frombondline to adherend in theCLS specimen. Thiswas done by us-ing cohesive zone modelling and progressive failure criteriawith the finite element package MSC.Mentat and its solver MSC.Marc. A validation with another test report on mixed-mode bending and interlaminar failure was performed using a cohesive zone model with the settings MSC.Marc has to offer. This wielded accurate results in terms of loading and damage. With the aid of this validation, the options within the cohesive zone model which had the best results in the validation were used for simulations of the CLS specimen. Cohesive zone elements representing the bondline and the adhesive within the laminate adherends in the CLS model are used to assess cohesive and interlaminar failure, while progressive failure criteria are used to assess in-tralaminar failure. The results of the current simulation setupswere unsatisfying as the failure load and strain results had large errors. Further detailed analyses will be needed to recreate the multiple failure modes in the CLS specimen in MSC.Marc with acceptable results. On the other hand, the thesis has proven that MSC.Marc and its own cohesive zone model perform well enough for mixed-mode bending and interlaminar failure in simple geometries.","composites; failure; cohesive zone modelling; cohesive zone; cohesive; damage; laminate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Solid and Fluid Mechanics","","Engineering Dynamics","",""
