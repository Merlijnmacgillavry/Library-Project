(mentor)","2015","Owing to new regulations starting from 2025, all commercial canal boats have to comply to zero local emission standards in Amsterdam. It is therefore vital that a clear emission indicator is made available for vessels with a varying operational profile, such as canal boats. In this paper, it is argued that current indicators, such as the Energy Efficiency Design Index, are not suitable for these (passenger) vessels. This paper proposes environmental performance indicators that can quantify emissions, (non-dimensional) energy and fuel usage based on an operational profile set in the design phase. This profile includes part load operation and auxiliary consumers and it can compare new designed concepts with current baseline vessels based on the ‘benefit for society’ of different vessel types. In the proposed environmental performance indicators, several operational modes can be defined, in contrast with the currently proposed Energy Efficiency Design Index, which is a point index at 75% of installed power. To gauge not only local emissions but also global emissions, the environmental performance indicator methodology is used to determine a minimum efficiency from any power generation method. This minimum efficiency follows from a comparison between baseline vessels and concepts that are more energy efficient and emission friendly. The proposed environmental performance indicators were validated using measurements on typical propulsion configurations of canal boats in Amsterdam. Three full electric concepts were designed and compared with the measured baseline vessels. As full electric concepts do not have local emissions, the method of power generation must satisfy the requirement to have less global emissions than the mechanical baseline. Furthermore, an energy efficiency of at least 33% is calculated from a fossil-fuelled land-based power plant (including transport) to the boundary from quay to boat to be required for newly designed electric concepts to be more energy efficient than the mechanical baseline.","Emissions; energy chain index; fuel consumption; mechanical index; canal boat; passenger vessel; urban city centre","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-05-19","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","","",""

(mentor); De Wit, L.M.M. (mentor)","2015","In 1976, when The Body Shop was founded, the brand was a pioneer in developing natural cosmetics with strong ethical values. The result of their actions was even a ban on cosmetic brands that were testing on animals in the 1990’s. These strong values and ethical movements were the key feature of the brand, making them stand out against the competition. Anno 2015, however, these values and ethical responsibilities are no longer a unique selling point, since customers are expecting brands to be responsible, planet loving and ethical. The Body Shop has thereby lost its unique selling point and personality. Insights from interviews and competitor analysis have shown that The Body Shop used to be seen as a pioneer brand, but has lost its unique soul and spirit over the years. It doesn’t stand out from its competition anymore because of the lack of a clear and unique brand story. The brand is percieved as too colourful, too bold and unclear by its lapsed and potential customers. The stores are too overwhelming because of the large amount of products presented, giving it a cheap feeling and all the different colours making it too bold. The products are loved by the frequent customers because of their properties and benefits, however potential customers don’t try the products because the packaging and stores don’t appeal to them and the brand doesn’t convey a clear and distinct message that convinces the customers to buy at The Body Shop and not at competitors. These competitors all have a more specific and unique brand story and lifestyle to share, making those brand more clear, comprehensible and attractive for the customers. The Body Shop should find its old spirit again and become the pioneer brand it used to be. Focussing on not only saying to be responsible, but actively contribute to a more social and responsible world by really making a difference and stand up for its opinion. This is what used to make The Body Shop different from competition, what all participants value in the brand and what the brand should become again in order for them to find a unique positioning in the current market. The new brand identity will have a core focus on ‘do good’. The ‘do good’ aspect can be divided in two elements: ‘do good to yourself’ and ‘do good to others’. These represent the two elements in the new brand identity, luxury and responsibility. The ‘do good for yourself’ will be translated in the products, and focuses on convincing the customers of the products and their benefits for their skin. Three components support this element: the store, in which it is all about testing of the products; samples, allowing customers to test products at home as well; and the packaging and assortment, that will be clear and comprehensible, with a limited assortment with all core and classical products of The Body Shop. The ‘do good to others’ will be about the foundation of the brand and creating a ‘do good’ community. This aspect will be mainly communicated online by showing projects of The Body Shop through good photography and sharing charity initiatives of customers and employees (members of the community).","brand identity; retail design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2015","This study focused on a new method to find accurate performance measures of a mediolateral centre of mass(CoM)-controlled visual tracking task, which might be sensitive enough to detect problems in balance control early on. Visual tracking tasks, controlled by mediolateral CoM displacement, have shown promising results in this respect. The task was performed by twenty-one healthy subjects who had to track an unpredictable horizontally moving target on the screen with a tracker which was controlled by mediolateral CoM displacement. The test was performed under three conditions: The CoM displacement was controlled by either a static gain, an integrator or a double integrator before the displacement of the tracker was displayed on the screen. The results were analysed in the frequency domain. In this study the McRuer crossover-model, which was developed for aviation, was used to describe the frequency response of the participants while performing a visual tracking task in three test conditions. The three performance measures, the effective time delay, the crossover frequency and the cutoff frequency, were calculated from this estimator. The overall coherence of the double integrator condition was extremely low, so these results were not taken into discussion. Nevertheless, the McRuer crossover model appeared to be a good descriptor for the frequency response of the subjects during balance controlled visual tracking tasks in the static gain and integrator conditions. The test-retest reliability of the parameters was tested among nine of the subjects, no significant differences between the three tests were found. The crossover frequency and the cutoff frequency, of both the static gain and integrator conditions have their advantages and disadvantages on behalf of the early detection of people at risk of falling. However, the two test conditions should be repeated with a larger subject group, as well as a subject group with known impaired balance, to find out which performance measure is the most accurate and sensitive to detect problems in balance early on.","visual tracking task; McRuer Crossover model; mediolateral balance; centre of mass","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical Engineering","","Biomechatronics","",""

(mentor); Van Heur, R.J.H.G. (mentor); Bastiaansen, A. (mentor)","2015","Fokker Aerostructures is a world leading specialist in the application thermoplastic carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) material on control surfaces of business jets. They want to know if they can expand their business towards large commercial aircraft. First, an aircraft is chosen to function as platform for the design phase. Multiple concepts are developed and compared using a trade study. Initially, six potentially suitable aircraft were identified as possible platform. The aircraft are compared among their market potential, available knowledge and possible improvements. The Airbus A330 and A350 are both, according to the research, suitable aircraft. Because Airbus reveals they will focus on cost savings, the A350 is chosen to function as a platform, due to its expensive design of the rudder. Knowing the platform to design for, an extended analysis regarding manufacturing, reparation, inspection, weight, costs and post-buckling is performed. This analysis lead to a list of possible improvements and requirements (demands and wishes) that are used to guide the ideation and conceptualization phases. The design phase is divided into three levels: topological, typological and morphological. Every level results in structural, formal and material concepts, respectively. Evaluation regarding functionality and weight potential of the topological alternatives show that a rudder with a multi-rib frame and/or stiffened skins is viable. The typological alternatives focus on weight reduction of the ribs and skins, as those components are, according to a top-down weight estimation, the main contributors to the total weight of the rudder. Weight savings on the skins, by applying the post-buckling principle, or on the ribs, by using truss structural ribs, should finally lead to a reduction in costs. The more detailed, morphological alternatives are assessed among the requirements and reviewed by experts. Two feasible, detailed material concepts conclude the design phase. Material concept A is a thermoplastic post-buckled multi-rib design and material concept B contains an integrated spar and leading edges, truss structural ribs and separate trailing edge. Within the trade study, a bottom-up weight estimation shows that the proposed concepts reduces the weight by 29% and 17% for concept A and B, respectively, with respect to the current A350 rudder design. The data from the bottom-up weight estimation is used to make a Product Breakdown Structure (PBS), which serves as input for the Cost Estimation Model. The costs estimation shows a reduction in costs, the focus point of Airbus, of 28% and 20 % for material concept A and B, respectively, compared to the current A350 rudder. The skins of the current rudder are, compared to the post-buckling multi-rib design, very complex, which increases the costs of the manufacturing. The main material of material concept A is thermoplastic Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP), which is, in contrary to the current rudder that is made of thermoset CFRP, recyclable. Both the current as the newly developed concepts are considered as repair-friendly. The A350 would be the most suitable platform for Fokker to design a new rudder. Two feasible concepts are developed. The trade-study reveals that the newly designed concepts reduce weight (29%) and costs (28%) compared with the current A350 rudder design. The A350 rudder provides Fokker, therefore, with new market potential to expand their business.","Rudder; Aircraft Design; Market analysis; Concept development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design Engineering","","","",""

Even though the measurement period appeared to be of restricted length, the methodology can be considered promising.

But AM is also a relative new production process, that needs knowledge, a new way of thinking and experience to be successful. To help the company Zodiac Aerospace (ZA) start a new journey into AM, this project was conducted. Phase I - Analysis AM can create unique opportunities for the aerospace industry. For example its possibility to create free forms can provide lightweight, optimised designs and reduce assembly time by merging parts. It can also serve the demand from the industry towards customised designs and low batch sizes. But, since AM is in development, it still has some limitations that need to be taken into account. But because AM is growing, the developments can provide inspiration when designing for AM. Phase II: Selecting for AM and designing the AM tool Throughout brainstorms on multiple levels, parts interesting to produce with AM are selected from the galley. The ideas from this selection, together with the information from the analysis, seven categories are made of ‘reasons to use AM in aerospace’. With these categories a selection and advice tool was made for the engineers of ZA. The first part of the AM tool helps the user decide if AM is the right option for their (to be) designed product. The second part provides advice and selected information, based on the input provided by the user. Phase III: Case study To gain insights on the design process of AM and evaluate the AM tool, a case study was conducted on a cooling duct of the galley. The new duct design was optimised for airflow, using CFD simulations. AM can also generate added value in a part. In this case study, an insulation structure around the duct is created and a vibration absorbing structure at its connection to the chiller. Phase IV: evaluation and recommendation Finally, to introduce a new production method into a company takes time, investment and knowledge. In return, AM forms new possibilities for innovative products. It can solve current problems in the detail-orientated world of aerospace. Since AM is evolving towards a stable and mature process, it is a good time for ZA to step into the journey of Additive Manufacturing.","additive manufacturing; aerospace; Galley; Design-for-AM; AM-tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Applied Ergonomics and Design & Computer Aided Design Engineering","","","",""

It is also characterised by slow kinetics and corrosive properties. To improve this, MgH2 is ball milled (bm) to create nanoparticles and is encapsulated with sulphur (S). MgH2 samples with S are compared to samples without S. The samples are bm and tested inside HYDRA a temperature programmed desorption (TPD) setup. From the peak temperatures (Tp), which result from this method, an activation energy (Ea) can be calculated. Also the wt% H desorbed can be deduced with this setup. The TPD results show that there is not much difference in Ea of the samples with or without S. All fall within the margin of error. The wt% H desorbed shows the T during absorption was too low to get MgH2 back completely, there was still ?Mg present. The samples with S performed marginally better. The air resistance of the samples is tested by exposure to atmospheric conditions. The encapsulation of S is a protective layer against both the creation of MgO and Mg(OH)2. The results are measured using X-ray diffraction is performed and analysed using Rietveld refinement. The encapsulation of MgH2 nanoparticles using S did show good results protect against corrosion during air exposure. The samples with S showed less oxidation and slowed it down. The method should be improved to get better results. A good layer of S should protect better against oxidation and might even avoid it from occurring. More structural details are provided by SEM and to get more details on the elements present EDX is used. A layer was found on the outside of the particles and it shows the presence of S after the high temperature of desorption.","hydrogen; MgH2; encapsulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science & Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Hung, H. (mentor)","2015","Almost every mundane activity in which we engage during the day (e.g., walking, running, meeting other people etc.) leaves a trace in the form of data that can be collected, measured and shared as input to shape individual and social interactions. This data can be referred to as ‘activity traces’ (Dong 2014). A nascent application domain for these traces is ‘Social sensing’—that is, the ability to sense social structures in a social context. This thesis addressed the main research question: “How can connected object be used to support meaningful experiences of social sensing?” This project focussed on social sensing in situations of co-presence, and specifically on mingling events. A ‘mingling event’ is defined here as a large gathering of people in a relatively confined space. Pop Glass is an example of how activity traces can be used to evoke a meaningful experience of social sensing in a mingling event. When two users of Pop Glass share a toast their glasses will get the same colour. This creates a dynamic network of colours, which you are able to see and change. This concept was used in a study to investigate notions of “meaningfulness”. In giving meaning there is formal meaning (how we make experiences intelligible) and affective meaning (Our emotional responses to experiences). On a level of formal meaning sensing social structure through activity traces can be seen as a way of ordering information that connected objects carry out. An affective meaningful experience in a mingling event will mostly depend on the relevance of the conversation. However, the ability to sense social structure in a mingling event might cue you towards relevant people. The user study with Pop Glass aims on revealing its effects on the social experience of the crowd and how sense making played a role in it. 29 students participated in a staged network event with Pop Glass. They were measured by neck sensors and recorded by cameras and microphones. The lights of the glasses turned on half way through the event, so the experience with or without the lights could be tested. Participants were also asked to fill in a pre- and post-questionnaire. Afterwards 10 of them were interviewed about their experiences. Due to time constraints the Pop Glasses were programmed individually. This made them have lights that followed a random colour sequence with a random time interval. This did not harm the intentions of the test, because it was never tested if people saw a structure in the lights in the initial concept of Pop Glass. Two external research parties contributed in preparing the test and in analysing data. Researchers from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS), from Delft University of Technology led by Dr. Hung analysed proximity data and annotations of group size over time quantitatively. Dr. Day, ethnomethodologist and expert in interaction analysis from the department of Language and Communication at the University of Southern Denmark, conducted a conversation analysis based on scenes of the video and audio recordings of the event. A cluster method generated outcomes from the post-interviews. These served as the starting point for the results in this thesis. In the end Pop Glass seemed to have impacted the user’s social experience. People switched groups more often after the lights went on and the groups of participants became bigger for a short period. Both effects stagnated after some time. According to Day’s analysis the extraordinary behaviour of the glass seems to affect the way people use the glass and also how they?mingle. The glasses proved to be a topic of talk, a ‘toasting device’ and a boundary object even without the interactive lights inside the glass being on. When the glass turned on, new interactions seemed to occur. When finding meaning behind the ever-changing lights, Pop Glass was a perfect ‘talkable’ for participants. Besides, it did evoke people to tap their glasses with others, which seemed the key to make quick dis- or re-engagements. Insights from this user study resulted in a shift in perspective. Mingling events were not instigated by people’s formal understanding of the system, but more about their lack of. Their search for meaning proved to be a perfect networking tool. However the question remained how to keep a user interested in a product that it will never fully be understood. This revelation resulted in a set of paradoxical design guidelines that were aimed to support designers to design for meaningful experiences of social sensing in mingling events. In the first place the system should enable equal involvement from all people in the interaction space. Next to that there are three paradoxical design guidelines. The guideline ‘shaping interest’ aims on facilitating a sense making loop throughout their experience with the system. A product that compromises between a product that is transparent and ambiguous can do this. Second the system should ‘provide control’. Therefore it should ask for attention, but also be invisible. Lastly a product should ‘regulate belonging’ by making people feel one in a group, but also let them be the outlier. These guidelines were used in an iterative design process to generate a concept that is meant to inspire designers and researchers. This concept shared the same goal as Pop Glass. This resulted in Anthers. Anthers is a connected pin that will be worn by an attendee at a mingling event. Every attendee has a set of light particles in one colour; these will be exchanged with the people they talk to. In this way people will pollinate their conversation partners and therefore reveal their social traces. A video and mock-up of the concept were created and used in a review with 8 potential users. This resulted in mixed reactions. Most likely the way the concept was presented influenced people’s perspective. After all the video clarified all the functionalities of the concept. That is where the real challenge for ambiguous connected objects in mingling events lies: How to ‘sell’ a concept without revealing its core functionality, but only its potential result?","tangible interaction; social sensing; connected objects; sense making; meaningful experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Vegt, N.J.H. (mentor); Varkevisser, M. (mentor)","2015","This master thesis describes the design exploration of a co-creation workshop, namely ‘co-design fiction’, inspired by design fiction to engage the stakeholders, with an emphasis on strategic innovation of internet of things applications in crisis management. Introduction The project is initiated to brings insights for both the content of the design and research challenge and the method to explore it. Thales is interested in the explorations of strategic insights about new types of interactions principles with novel technologies in the context of future crisis management, which are valued for road-mapping and strategy development. Moreover, design fiction as a new design method is expected to be explored and used to envision futures vividly, with a sense of realism in which technological and societal trends merge. To conclude, the project assignment is formulated as: ‘Through a design fiction approach, to explore future interaction scenarios in crisis management for strategic innovation.’ Originally, the planning is to design future interaction scenarios and take the scenarios as triggers to stir discussions with multi-stakeholders in Thales in a workshop. Theoretical Background A literature review was conducted as the first step to bridge the background knowledge gap. To specify, three topics of crisis management, internet of things and embodied interaction were studied to gain the following insights for the project content. It is concluded that information sense-making for situation awareness and emergent collaboration are the two main design themes for interaction and user interface innovation in crisis management. In addition, internet of things is a promising technological environment to ground the design with its connectivity of everyday objects, human beings and virtual data and environments. Three main domains: smart objects, smart environment and empowered human are summarized as the practical applications. Also, several controversial issues around the technologies call for attention for the social impact. Furthermore, embodied interaction was studied as the future interaction style to lower the threshold of technology, characterized by its novel setting, engagement and connection of action and meaning. Three design themes are synthesized as thick practice, spatial interaction and embodied facilitation. For the proposed approach, design fiction was investigated with a link to future studies as a practice of this subject. As a ‘designerly way of research’, design fiction distinguishes itself with an emphasis on the engagement with multi-stakeholders, social concern for human and context feasibility of an emerging technology, and future-orientation. ‘Diegetic prototypes’ is the technique of design fiction. Technically, it is an iterative experimental process with four phases, idea generation, materialization, narrative and discussions. Forming “Co-design Fiction” On the basis of the theoretical insights, a design brief was formed as ‘ to envision intelligent objects and future scenarios in crisis management in a fictional world, in which the relationship between the embodied interaction style and paradigms and data-networks are explicated’. Next, a design strategy framework was formulated to guide the following design practices, including a top-down path as needs and information oriented and a bottom-up path as technology of IoT oriented. Through some ideation activities, both individually and collectively, several initial intelligent objects and scenarios ideas were generated. Yet, as an side but essential effect, the focus of the project was changed at this phase. Feedback from the participants in the ideation sessions indicated the necessity to incorporate the end users in the concept design activities. On top of that, the generative tool used in the sessions triggered the idea to conduct a co-creation workshop, namely “Co-design Fiction”, with the real emergency responders for its immersion and empathy. We believe the twist can bring about more interesting, meaningful and constructive insights and design directions. Therefore, the focus of the project was reshaped as : ‘develop a co-design fiction tool and workshop to discover opportunities for internet-of-things applications in crisis management.’ Co-design Fiction Workshop Development The development process of co-design fiction workshop started from a preliminary literature study about participatory design. Next, the initial design proposal of workshop process and props design was iterated in four play tests. Also after this phase the aim of the workshop was crystallised to merely bring about insights of user needs in crisis situations. Final Workshop Design In-house emergency response team (BHV) in TU Delft were chosen as the participants of the upcoming actual co-design fiction workshop, considering the feasibility to conduct an evaluation test with the end users. Accordingly, the final workshop process and props design were tailored to the BHVers’ experiences and knowledge. The research aim of the workshop is threefold: firstly, as ‘experts of crisis situations’, the participants are expected to bring insights on user needs, including shared concerns of situation awareness, interdependencies between people and between working tools in emergent collaboration; secondly, they should be engaged to express their thoughts smoothly and share their experiences both individually and collectively; thirdly, the workshop results should serve as a set-up for further design fiction practices in crisis management. For the design process, firstly, a fictional story of a big fire crisis happening before the upcoming IO festival in the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering was constructed to facilitate the props design. Next, the final design proposal were detailed and refined. To specify, the workshop contains four main phases, which are facilitated by various generative tool elements. 1. Welcome & introductions and Stage setting At the beginning, facilitator introduces the general information and schedule of the workshop. In addition, the overarching story setting is demonstrated in an act-out live play with storytelling tool examples, including the stage, character, object and information clouds, etc. 2. Task 1: Personal story telling Participants tell nested stories to reflect on their personal experiences, conclude several shared concerns collectively, and also bring about the working objects they normally use in similar situations. 3. Task 2: Story remix Participants vote for the most important shared concerns first. Next they take each shared concern as a lens to discuss the relevance with each nested story on the story timeline. As such, the create stories can be explored extensively and connected with each other, thereby generate the interdependencies. 4. Wrap-up To wrap up the session, facilitator explains to the participants that their contribution will serve as a starting point for further development of intelligent objects and future scenarios as internet of things applications in crisis management. Evaluation Workshop A final co-design fiction workshop was conducted with the BHV’ers in TU Delft. It holds twofold goal to validate the workshop process and props design and to gain insights about the user needs. Generally speaking, the participants could finish most of the task requirements and most tool elements worked as expected to trigger experience recalling and discussion. Yet, the actual workshop did reveal some unnoticed problems, together with unexpected surprises, which were not found in previous play tests. Besides, the group dynamic was influenced a bit due to the small group size of participants. An overview of stories constructed in the workshop, as well as the concerns and bottlenecks they proposed were demonstrated as the user insights conclusion. General Discussion Lastly, as a general discussion of the project, the project aim, process and the outcome are reflected. Next, recommendations for further development are provided, followed by a personal reflection of the project.","co-design fiction; co-creation; design fiction; crisis management; internet of things","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Mul, E.J.T. (mentor); Koudijzer, J. (mentor)","2015","The food and beverage industry often uses pneumatic cylinders to enable machinery in food processing plants to move. The requirements around hygiene are strict. This is to prevent consumer food from getting contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms. The food itself and the intensive chemical cleaning products used, form a harsh environment for the machinery. This project focussed on the design of a hygienic movement that can replace Festo’s pneumatic cylinders and will function in the environment of the food and beverage industry. A double-acting artificial muscle with high initial forces is developed. Festo’s current artificial muscle, the Fluidic muscle, generates a high initial force while contracting. This muscle makes a hygienic movement, because there are no sliding parts, but it can only deliver a pulling force. During this project, an origami inspired bellow is developed that delivers a pushing force inside the Fluidic muscle. The origami structure provides extra force because it is a mechanical force amplifier. During the project, the Nature Inspired Design (NID) method is used.

These wireless, ad-hoc, scalable mesh networks provide the infrastructure for numerous sensing and control applications. A key requirement for such networks is energy efficiency. Synchronization of nodes can significantly improve energy efficiency by enabling a tighter communication schedule. In this MSc project an improved synchronization algorithm for an existing MAC protocol is developed. After establishing a clock model and surveying the literature for existing algorithms, the synchronization problem is modelled from a control theoretic viewpoint. It is shown that the synchronization problem closely resembles the consensus problem, which is extensively covered in literature. This insight is used to prove stability of a class of synchronization algorithms -- including the existing algorithm -- under requirements on the communication topology that are easily satisfied. A set of improved algorithms is developed, and their performance is assessed in simulations. The best performers were tested experimentally on networks with up to 300 nodes. In conclusion, we have been able to create a substantial improvement over the existing synchronization algorithm, attaining a higher throughput and longer network lifetime. Experiments have shown however, that very large networks (>150 nodes) are not adequately described by our models and can display unexpected dynamics.","Wireless Sensor Networks; Synchronization; Distributed algorithms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","DCSC","","Systems & Control","",""

(mentor); Zarouchas, D. (mentor)","2015","Acoustic Emission (AE) based structural health monitoring systems have the potential to assess the state of metallic / composite structures and detect damage in real time as it grows. This is done by monitoring the Lamb waves that occur due to the release of energy and the specific boundary conditions. Environmental and Operational Conditions (EOC) have a significant effect on the wave propagation phenomena, potentially influencing their ability to detect and localize damage. This study sought to extend past research done on metallic structures and was focused on understanding the effects of temperature on the propagation of ultrasonic Lamb waves in composite materials using analytical, numerical and experimental tools. Two test specimens were used, one hybrid laminate with glass and carbon fibre epoxy layers and a sandwich panel with a 2 mm foam. Three temperatures steps of -40, 25 and 70°C were used. An analytical MATLAB code was used to generate dispersion curves for the hybrid material at the previously mentioned temperature steps. Next, the experimental setups were modeled in an FEM ABAQUS CAE environment. Three 5 cycle Hanning windows, with frequencies of 150, 300 and 400 kHz, were used to excite a piezoelectric actuator. The response was then picked up using 3 piezoelectric sensors located at angles of 0, 45 and 90° with respect to the actuator. Finally, the experimental tests were performed and the results were compared with those of the FEM model and the dispersion curves. The comparison was performed using the signals received by the 3 sensors. Preliminary experimental results showed that the maximum change in speed due to temperature variation was 7% for the laminate and 12% for the sandwich panel. The results have also been verified using the FE models.","Acoustic Emission; Composite materials; Lamb waves; Structural Health Monitorin; Temperature effects; Finite Element Modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","Structural Integrity","",""

(mentor)","2015","Due to renewable energy regulations, wind energy becomes more attractive and the offshore wind sector is growing significantly the recent years. Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of offshore wind farms facing more challenges and is more expensive, compared to the O&M of onshore wind farms. O&M costs of offshore wind farms are on average double as high compared to onshore wind farms. This is mainly caused by the cost intensive maritime resources required for O&M and uncertainty of offshore weather conditions, while latest research indicates that the O&M of offshore wind farms can be more effective. Weather conditions have a substantial impact on the production, cost, and planning of offshore wind farms which require O&M strategies that minimize production losses and O&M costs, while making sure scheduled maintenance tasks are completed in time. Previous research show a lack of an approach that is 1) integrated: including all the stakeholders’ requirements that are necessary to assess the effectiveness of the O&M in terms of production, cost, and planning and 2) generic: applicable for all wind farms. This master thesis identified first all the requirements for an integrated and generic O&M decision support tool. By means of literature research and interviews with stakeholders in the offshore wind sector, all the requirements for modelling an integrated and generic O&M tool are gathered and verified, supporting the offshore wind O&M plan and process. 35 model requirements are identified covering wind farm parameters, O&M strategies, external factors, O&M effectiveness indicators and tool capabilities. Of these requirements, 9 are not or partly fulfilled by the examined studies or tools. The main gaps in the current research are related to the option to perform only maintenance during low wind speeds, the planning aspect covering the feasibility and robustness of maintenance plans, the insight in the O&M process (e.g. visualization or process animation) and to the optimization capability. The second part of this thesis focused on the conceptualization and implementation of all the identified requirements into one O&M tool. The developed tool, based on discrete event simulation covered all the identified gaps in the current research besides all the other stakeholders’ requirements, apart from some spare parts logistics requirements which are simplified included with assumptions. The developed tool enable users to compare optimize different O&M strategies (covering the resource configuration and deployment options) on all the KPIs of the O&M plan and process, to optimize the O&M strategies and to gain insight in the maintenance process in order to find the optimum in the production, cost, and planning trade-off triangle, taking into account all the requirements. After the implementation in the discrete event simulation software the tool is verified and validated by means of a model comparison with the validated ECN O&M tool and an expert validation with an actor from the offshore wind sector. The results is a verified and validated tool that is demonstrated with a fictitious cases study in the last part of this thesis. The tool can be improved on several aspects, most notably by performing a real validation project for a maintenance campaign of an existing wind farm. Other recommended improvements implying further research are extending the scope regarding the inventory aspect, including the option to incorporate historical data for condition based maintenance, including more transporters, extending the model with a user-friendly interface around the actual tool and integrating forecast weather data to enable day-to-day planning.","offshore wind farms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Systems Engineering","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

This thesis shows that the measurements from the output signal can help to update and improve the probability distribution in a closed loop situation without the requirement of additional input. The probability distribution is updated by repeatedly taking samples from the uncertainty region and computing the probability of these samples using moving horizon estimation. Moving horizon estimation is used as the basis because it allows for constraints to be active on the system, at the cost of solving many convex programming problems every time step. If there are no constraints, moving horizon estimation reduces to a Kalman filter. The updated probability distribution leads to the creation of a new robust controller with an improved performance over the original controller.","randomized algorithms; moving horizon estimation; robust control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); Rutten, M.M. (mentor)","2015","Coastal squeeze is defined as the reduction in the space of coastal habitats to operate [1] and it is an important cause for (amongst others) coastline retreat, an increase in flood risk and salinity intrusion. Land use changes, such as deforestation and urbanization, reduce the space of natural habitats such as mangrove forests. This causes a deterioration of these habitats, which leads to a reduction of their natural protective and provisioning functions. Costs related to these function losses can be avoided by early recognition of coastal squeeze and early action against it. The coastal zone inMyanmar is subject to urbanization, extreme weather conditions (cyclones), increase in agri- and aquaculture and (illegal) felling of mangroves. TU Delft and partners are developing a research proposal in order to investigate the occurrence of coastal squeeze in Myanmar and to use this knowledge to develop a decision making tool that can operate within an integrated coastal zone management strategy. Our research is a scoping study to investigate how remote sensing analysis (using freely available Landsat imagery) can contribute to early recognition of coastal squeeze. This is applied on a case study of the lower Ayeyarwady delta in Myanmar, a crucial agricultural zone nicknamed the ‘Rice Bowl of Myanmar’. Analysis of Landsat imagery has been done to create a series of land use maps and determine coastline changes. This analysis has led to varying results. The use of recent Landsat imagery combined with data gathered by fieldwork has promising results to accurately calculate land use for large areas. Unfortunately this technique loses accuracy rapidly when applied to imagery from the past. Causes are the quality of the imagery (Landsat in general and the used techniques to obtain surface reflection images), the quality of the algorithm used for the classification and the quality and quantity of our ground truth data set. Extraction of the coastline for the past 30 years has been done with a reasonable accuracy of § 60 meters. Trends of coastline retrogradation and/or progradation along the coast of the delta have been identified and are presented in a map. Another output of this scoping study is an indicative map that identifies coastline types along the Ayeyarwady delta coastline.","coastal squeeze; Ayeyarwady Delta; Myanmar; remote sensing; Landsat; land use classification; QGIS; ground truthing; coastline change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

However, recent advances in silicon processes have enabled the use of BiCMOS and CMOS technologies as enablers for circuits and systems operating at mm-wave and sub-mm wave frequencies, i.e. frequencies above 100GHz. Hence, high frequency and baseband electronics can be integrated in a single chip, thus reducing cost dramatically. The ultimate goal is to have silicon circuits operation at Terahertz frequencies. The need for power generation at high frequencies is fundamental for the successful implementation of any application. There is a variety of circuits providing power at frequencies below 100GHz, namely oscillators and power amplifiers. Furthermore, lasers and other optoelectronic devices are capable of providing power above 10THz. Hence, there is a gap in power generation between 100GHz and THz that has to be filled in order for the applications to be accommodated. This thesis constitutes an effort towards the direction of understanding the challenges and limitation of power generation at frequencies above 100 GHz. Specifically active and passive device limitations are addressed and guidelines are given in order for the best performance possible to be achieved. The acquired knowledge is applied in the design of a medium output power PA at 135 GHz. Specifically, the PA achieves an -1dB compression point output power of 5dBm and a saturated output power of 8 dBm along with a power gain of 17 dB.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Stoop, J.A.A.M. (mentor)","2015","The objectives of the Netherlands Ministry of Defence are not changed since the start of the Cold War, but the execution has dramatically changed. From a single enemy in the east to many smaller threats all over the world. Due to this change also the public opinion over the Netherlands Ministry of Defence is changed, which has drawn more attention to the value the Netherlands Ministry of Defence created and the amount of money the Netherlands Ministry of Defence costs. Since then the Netherlands Ministry of Defence had to be more cost effective and had to explain their expenses far more comprehensively. But due to the change of usage of weapon systems from very regular usage in Cold War to more irregular usage the prediction based on expenses lost their value for tracking and improving the cost effectiveness. The main reason and added value for Netherlands Ministry of Defence of this research is improving management decision-making. This decision-making can only be supported when the appropriate tools are handed. This translates into the design of a model that can take into account the highly variable environment in which the Netherlands Ministry of Defence has to operate. To accommodate this need, the developed model must deliver an indication of the cost-effectiveness of a weapon system. As a start the costs that are induced must be included, but this will not give an adequate indication. To do this the performance and the effective usage must be factored into the model. This is done by measuring the performance delivered by the system relative to the targeted performance. The effective usage is set by taking the flight hours which are corrected by taking into account the environment in the form of a profile severity and the flight dynamics in the form of fatigue severity. Because fatigue severity is difficult to determine, a more easily measurable indicator is needed for an easily accessible cost-effectiveness measure. This indicator is found in the fuel consumption, because it was found that the fuel consumption highly correlates to the fatigue severity. Together with historical data of the flown profile this can give the Netherlands Ministry of Defence the information it needs for future deployment. The cost, usage and performance data can be brought together in a scale, which is called Rating Points. The Rating Points give a clear indication for the management, when the Rating Points increase for a specific weapon system the costs are increased, relative to the delivered performance and use.

(mentor); Snellen, M. (mentor); Brouwer, M.A. (mentor)","2015","Airports in The Netherlands are subjected to tangent environmental laws to restrain pollution and noise nuisance. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AAS) is one airport dealing with this regulatory framework but nevertheless they are resolute to continue growth with respect to aircraft movements. To cope with the law related to aircraft noise, the department Stakeholder Strategy and Development (SSD) of AAS is responsible for the implementation of Noise Abatement Measures (NAMs). NAMs are used to minimize aircraft noise as to be able to maximize the number of aircraft movements within the environmental law as set by the Dutch government. SSD demands to be able to visualize the effect of a NAM by measuring aircraft noise with its Noise Monitoring System (NOMOS). However, in practice it appears that the effect of a NAM to the exposed noise level cannot easily be determined since the total set of measurements show a high degree of scattering. This is caused by the fact that many other parameters are contributing to the exposed noise level as, for example, engine setting and aircraft configuration. Therefore, AAS encounters difficulties evaluating the effectiveness of implemented noise reducing measures using the noise levels as measured by NOMOS. Hence, the research question becomes: How can the distinctiveness between noise measurements effectively be improved as to evaluate the direct effect of a Noise Abatement Measure to the measured noise level? As a first step towards answering this question, aircraft mass m and aircraft engine setting N1 were identified which were expected to mask the effect of a NAM to the measured noise level. Then, the Peak Find Method (PFM) is developed to determine N1 from the associated acoustic time series as retrieved from NOMOS. Thirdly, aircraft mass m was found to be very difficult to determine from aircraft performance theories. Therefore, the lift-off speed at take-off Vlof2 is taken as an aircraft mass representative. With the two predictors N1 and Vlof2 available and the measured maximum loudness levels Lmax retrieved from NOMOS, a Multivariate Linear Regression Analysis (MLRA) is carried out to assess the effect of the two predictors to variations in Lmax. Last, the identified MLRA model is used to subtract the contribution of N1 and Vlof2 from the received noise levels, hence leaving the direct effect of a NAM to the measured noise level. Initial correlation analysis showed no correlation between N1 and Lmax and neither between Vlof2 and Lmax. While the MLRA model is based upon the identified values of the predictors, it was therefore not expected that the high variations in Lmax would decrease when using these predictors, bearing in mind the results of both correlation analysis. And ultimately, by using the MLRA model only 7% of the total variation in Lmax could be explained, which turned out to be too less to evaluate the direct effect of a NAM to the measured noise level.","aircraft noise; measurements; classification; engine setting; aircraft weight; flight track; N1; Multivariate Linear Regression Analysis; acoustics; NOMOS; Schiphol; RADAR; correlation; analysis; BPF; Blade Passing Frequency; lift-off speed; noise; meteo; KNMI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Air Traffic Performance and the Environment","","52.307503, 4.762406"

And this demand is expected to rise a staggering 31% between 2012 and 2017 and will continue positive growth rates up to 2030 . In tandem with the growth in the aviation section, the commercial aircraft cabin interior market is expected to grow as well. There will be an shift in airline landscape towards the emerging economies. Especially in the Asia-Pacific region, where the majority of the global middle class is accounted for, will fuel the need for increased mobility. This results in an increase demand for aircraft seats, and particularly economy class seats. This creates opportunities for numerous players in the aircraft seating industry. As so for Zodiac Aerospace. This master thesis report will present a design proposal for a new generation aircraft seats in where the focus is set on user-centric design to improve passenger comfort and simultaneously create a lightweight seat. The first chapters will describe how this project took flight in conjunction with Zodiac Seats US, LLC and a thorough internal and external analysis will be given to position the company with the commercial aircraft interiors market. Furthermore the aspects of discomfort and comfort will be elaborated to get a good understanding of what causes comfort and discomfort and how that can affect aircraft seat design and its passengers. From there the a current Y class seat will be deconstructed and analyzed to find out what the current situation is that needs to be taken into consideration for the new Y class seat design proposal Based on the literature research, and the gained knowledge from the current seat deconstruction, a design vision is set up for the future direction with respect to stakeholders. The design vision will describe the most important factors that causes discomfort and with the aid scientific research, it can be prevented or reduced. There is an abundance of data available regarding discomfort, yet few aircraft seat designers have yet to implement that to improve the comfort level of the passengers. This design vision I strive to change that. The new seat design will be designed from the ground up based on scientific data to reduce discomfort and increases the comfort experience of the passenger. A crucial aspect of this new design is that it is an user focused seat design. Ideation, conceptualization and embodiment will lead to a prototype in which user testing can be done to validate the new design, which has not been introduced before in the aviation industry. Finally the design and results will be evaluated and validated. To end this report, final conclusions have been made and recommendations for the future design and development will be given.","aircraft seat; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2016-05-26","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Lukosch, H.K. (mentor); Li, S. (mentor); Saanen, Y.A. (mentor); Zutt-de Fockert, F. (mentor)","2015","Container terminals are important nodes in the worldwide supply chain. The planning of the daily operations of a container terminal is a complex task and sub optimal decisions can be made due to interconnected sub processes, interrelated decisions, time and uncertainty. If suboptimal planning decisions are made in the planning, consequences will occur during the operation, which cause a decrease in performance. The perfor-mance of a terminal is measured in average Quay Crane (QC) performance. The QC performance determines the turnaround time of vessels. A delay in the turnaround time can cause huge financial loses and a decrease in the reliability of the service a terminal offers. To overcome sub optimal planning decisions, a simulated execution of a planning can be used. If suboptimal planning decisions are made, the consequences will occur during the simulated execution. By analysing the results of the simulation these consequences can be recognised, and thereby the suboptimal decisions can be identified. These decisions should be revised to prevent recurrence of the consequences in the real operation. This can only be done after the planning is finished and before the operation commences, 2-3 hours before the operation. If used not more than 2 Hours are left in the planning process to simulate the planning, analyse the results and revise planning decisions. A simulation takes 15 minutes, including overhead time and performing 3 iterations leaves only around 10 minutes to analyse and 10 minutes to revise decisions. The problem is the lack of a method to use the results of the simulation in such a short time frame. The aim of this thesis is to develop a method that makes it for a planner possible to identify the consequences, define a suitable revision and implement it in the short amount of available time before the operation commences. The research question is stated as follows: How can simulation be used to improve the operational planning of a container terminal before the real execution? The method chosen to solve this problem is a decision tree, which can reveal patterns, identify an assignable cause and define a suitable solution. The developed decision trees are able to reveal the consequences in the results of a simulated execution by checking statistics of the simulated execution with thresholds. A sequence of checks can lead to 3 types of decisions: i. A revision of a planning decision is proposed if the QC performance is lower than desired, the cause could be identified and a solution is available. ii. The tree proposes to lower the planned performance, if the planned performance could not be reached, but no cause was identified or no solution is available. iii. Do nothing is proposed if the desired QC performance is reached, in this case there is no need to make adjustments. To develop this decision tree seven steps are performed; 1. Analysis of the operation and planning, 2. Define the solution space, 3. Perform a root cause analysis, 4. Connect the causes with solutions, 5. Develop the decision trees, 6. Set the thresholds, 7. Evaluate the decision trees. The developed decision tree is evaluated by a case study and expert opinion interviews. In the case study two planning datasets are improved by the use of the decision trees, one reached an increase in QC performance of 1.1 containers/hour and the second of 2 containers/hour. The experts indicated that if the method would be developed further it has the potential to solve the problem. The main conclusions are: - By the analysing the results of a simulated execution of planning decisions with a decision tree, revi-sions of suboptimal planning decisions can be defined - After automation of the decision tree the analysis can be done within 1 minute - The seven steps led to a decision tree that proposed effective solutions during the case study - When the recommendations are processed the decision tree has together with Plan Validation the potential to support a planner to improve their planning and on the longer term planners might be-come more skilled in planning and strategically improvements can be identified From both the case study as from the expert opinion recommendations followed for further research. The main recommendations can be formulated as follows: - The decision trees developed in this research require improvements before implementation is possible - The decision tree should be automated - How the solutions are presented to the planner should be developed (the interface and visualisation) - Plan Validation in combination with the decision tree should be tested in further case studies, by checking it with real planners and by using it on a real terminal","container terminal; planning; simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","Engineering","",""

(mentor); Martins, J.R.R.A. (mentor); van Zuijlen, A.H. (mentor)","2015","Recent improvements in accuracy and effciency of numerical simulation techniques in the field of engineering have led to an increasing interest in applying high-fidelity models for wind turbine design. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations in a co-rotating reference frame has shown promising results for performing design analysis. However, using high-fidelity techniques for wind turbine blade design optimization is not yet fully understood. Especially, high-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimization for wind turbine blades has not yet been employed in the industry due to its computational ineffciency when large number of design variables are used with traditional techniques such as finite difference derivatives and gradient-free optimization methods. This dissertation presents an effcient and robust high-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimization methodology for rotating ow problems. The high-fidelity optimization method consists of a multiblock, structured RANS-based CFD simulation tool, a discrete adjoint method, a shape parametrization method, a mesh perturbation technique and a gradient-based optimizer. Steady-state solutions are obtained by the RANS-based CFD analysis method based on a co-rotating reference frame. The turbulence model is a segregated one-equation SA model. Total derivatives of the ow solution and constraint(s) are computed by a discrete adjoint method. For reducing the computational cost of computing partial derivatives that are required in the discrete adjoint method, forward automatic differentiation is used. Once the total derivatives and ow solution are computed, the gradientbased optimizer based on sequential quadratic programming computes a better design by using an augmented Lagrangian formulation with quasi-Newton approximations for the Hessian. The change in design variables obtained by the optimizer is parametrized with a Free Form Deformation (FFD) volume approach. After performing surface perturbations, the mesh is deformed using a hybrid mesh deformation scheme, that combines an algebraic and linear elasticity method. The linear elasticity method based on finite elements is used for large perturbations, while the algebraic method attenuates small perturbations. When the optimality condition is satisfied, the iterative procedure ends with the optimal design. Verification and validation of the developed codes are performed using the NREL VI wind turbine. The RANS-based CFD solver is validated by comparing numerical results with NREL VI sequence S experimental data. The solver resolves attached ow conditions accurately, while separated ow conditions lead to inaccurate ow solutions due to insufficient transition and turbulence modeling. DES can resolve the inaccuracy associated with separated ow conditions. Total derivatives of the adjoint method are verified by comparing derivatives of the complex and finite difference method. The quality of (perturbed) meshes are verified by using mesh quality metrics. Correct shape parametrization is assured after careful examining the direction and magnitude of the deformations. Since the NREL VI wind turbine blade rotates at a constant angular velocity, the power generation is considered to be only dependent on torque. Therefore, the objective of the optimization is maximizing the torque coefficient with shape, twist, and pitch design variables. Thickness constraints between 15% and 50% are added for representing a wing box. The thickness constraints impose thicknesses of the blade to increase only up to 300% of the original thickness. No reduction in thickness with respect to the baseline design at that region of the blade is possible in order to fit the original wing box. For future research, the objective and constraint function(s) can be easily adapted to more realistic and modern rotating ow problems. From the aerodynamic shape optimization of the NREL VI blade, an increase of at least 22.4% in torque is achieved. The airfoil shapes tends to become more cambered and less thick. The nose of the airfoil is more aligned to the in ow. At root section of the wind turbine blade, the trailing edge of the airfoil acts as a ap in order to obtain higher loads at low relative velocity. Three different mesh refinements are employed for optimization. The first mesh is a coarse mesh that is used for verification purposes of the optimization procedure. The second mesh is employed for obtaining accurate aerodynamic shape optimization results. The final design variable values of the medium refined mesh are projected on the most refined mesh, because computational costs would be too high for performing optimization. An increase of 29.1% in torque is achieved, indicating that the increase in optimized torque for more refined meshes will be higher when using coarser meshes. Since wind turbines are operating in a range of wind speeds, multipoint optimization from cut-in to rated wind speed is performed. Similar results as in single-point optimization are achieved. An increase of 22.2% in Annual Energy Production AEP is obtained. The adjoint method and high-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimization methodology allow designers to examine accurately the trade-off between various design variables at the early stage of the design process. For future research purposes, aerostructural and aeroelasticity optimization can be employed with the same framework","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Aerodynamics","",""

They would benefit from an effective fertility preservation method that allows natural conception. A new method, called autotransplantation of ovarian tissue, has much potential but improvements can be made. The method entails that ovarian tissue is harvested before treatment and frozen until future use. When the patient is in remission the tissue is transplanted back into the patient, which will allow the patient to become pregnant in a natural way. In order to improve the success rate and facilitate further research, a new technique for harvesting ovarian fragments was researched. The goal of this study was to develop a technique to harvest ovarian tissue fragments with controlled dimensions in a minimally invasive way. The technique had to satisfy two functions, namely holding the ovary and removing a tissue fragment. A concept technique was developed where suction was used to hold the ovary and a knife was used to cut a tissue fragment with an impulse. An experimental set-up was developed to test this concept technique. The use of the set-up with chicken filet showed a proof of principle. The efficacy of the concept technique was proven, as well as the accuracy and precision of the length of the obtained fragments. However, the set-up was not effective in producing fragments origination from ovarian tissue. Suggestions for future research include the use of active suction to hold the ovary and a reciprocating knife to cut a tissue fragment.","ovary; fertility preservation; surgical technique","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-05-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

An FPSO vessel can be favored as it is flexible, quickly commissioned and cost-effective, be used at all water depths and does not require additional pipelines to shore. To predict the roll motion of an FPSO traditional techniques such as the Ikeda-Tanaka-Himeno (ITH) method are no longer sufficient due to aberrant dimensions and shapes of bilge keels and riser balconies. The goal of this thesis was to provide a practical method to evaluate the roll damping and motions of an FPSO with aberrant bilge keels and/or riser balconies in (ir)regular waves. For this the ITH method was modified in three manners: 1. by extending current formulations with out-of-phase terms, 2. by obtaining relevant coefficients from 2D CFD simulations in forced roll oscillations, and 3. by using linear potential theory to obtain local velocities consisting not only of rigid body velocities, but also radiated wave velocities, incoming wave velocities and diffracted wave velocities. This new methodology was compared to forced oscillation and regular wave experiments performed by MARIN of the model scale Glas Dowr FPSO. Forced oscillations were reproduced satisfactory after a correction for additional heave and sway motions was applied. Regular wave results were compared to measurements, simulations using experimentally derived damping coefficients, ITH method damping coefficients, local velocity-based ITH method coefficients and using the proposed methodology. Results were good when compared to simulations based on measured damping coefficients but inconclusive when compared directly to measured roll amplitudes. Reasonable agreement at low to medium wave amplitudes and an underestimation at high wave amplitudes were obtained. The underestimation at high amplitudes is faulted to the linear increasing hull pressure coefficient while it is more likely to become saturated at higher local velocities. It is concluded that the combination of CFD and local velocities yield promising results and is more flexible than the traditional ITH method. A more thorough validation should be performed against data at various frequencies, hulls, keels and wave amplitudes before application becomes feasible.","bilge keels; roll damping; CFD; FPSO; riser balcony","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime Transport Technology","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Mostert, E. (mentor); Enserink, B. (mentor); Basco Carrera, L. (mentor)","2015","Water Resources Management (WRM) problems are now recognised for their complexity. Approaches for dealing with these problems must integrate a variety of interests, perspectives, values and knowledge into their potential solutions. They must also confront and manage problem uncertainties. The involvement of stakeholders in these approaches is critical. Collaborative Modelling (CM) offers a particularly promising set of approaches to involve stakeholders in computer-based modelling activities in WRM. This thesis analyses two of these approaches from the Netherlands: the development of the AZURE iMOD groundwater model using a Consortium Modelling approach, and the Model-Supported Collaborative Planning approach adopted during the Dutch Delta Programme Rivers (DPR). It identifies which characteristics, structures, and processes of collaboration were important in achieving approach objectives, in addition to establishing those the stakeholders involved most valued and appreciated. Consortium Modelling is found to apply most in problem contexts where the scientific knowledge base is uncertain. The approach is premised upon cooperative stakeholder involvement at a high co-decision making level of participation. It is an intensive process of model co-construction, where specialists with sufficient technical knowledge collaborate in the development of a sophisticated groundwater model. In contrast, Model-Supported Collaborative Planning is more suited to problem contexts where different values and opinions proliferate and the scientific knowledge base is largely certain or uncontested. This approach directly supports policy-making, and relies upon highly structured involvement for large numbers of stakeholders at different levels of participation. It involves the development and use of a Blokkendoos model (or ‘Planning Kit’) to formulate an integrated flood protection strategy. The thesis demonstrates which stakeholders to involve and when to involve them in these approaches depends upon the problem context and the specific purposes of the CM exercise. Higher levels of participation are generally preferred over lower levels for both approaches, and it is broadly beneficial if stakeholders are involved during the earliest agenda setting phases. Neutral expert advice and process management can also be of benefit, provided these experts enjoy the trust of the stakeholders involved. It is also essential to confront any uncertainties with stakeholders, and provide sufficient time for both collaborative and model-construction processes to occur. This, notwithstanding, care must be taken in translating either of these approaches to cultural contexts significantly different to that existing in the Netherlands. The thesis confirms and reiterates many CM recommendations presented in previous research, however, several of these are found to also be dependent upon problem contexts and the specific purposes of the exercise.","Collaborative Modelling; AZURE; Delta Programme Rivers; Stakeholder Participation; Groundwater Management; Flood Risk Management; iMOD; Blokkendoos; Consortium Modelling; Model-Supported Collaborative Planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources Management","",""

The aim for the project was to research the experience of visitors in theatres and communicate this knowledge towards theatre directors. The project consisted out of 2 phases; the research phase and the design phase. In the research phase a customer journey of a visit in theatre is created, based on interviews with experts (theatre-directors). By doing literature research existing knowledge on user experience and theatre experience could be placed in this customer journey. One of the main findings was that the experience of the theatre visitor consisted out of two levels; (1) the performance –experience (experience related to the performance) and (2) the theatre-experience (experience related to the theatre it self). The overview of existing knowledge showed that there was a knowledge gab on the theatre-experience. What actually happens during a visit and how does this contribute to the experience of the performance, the experience of the theatre and the experience as a whole (the total theatre experience)? By doing observations in different theatres different elements influencing the total theatre experience were found. By doing user studies (emotion capture study) there was found how visitors experience a theatre visit. These studies resulted in ‘total theatre experience insights’, insights from the perspective of the user which summarize the most important findings. The design phase resulted in an evaluation method for theatre directors to evaluate their theatre on the provided experience. For this evaluation session an evaluation tool is developed. With this tool the theatre-directors are able to evaluate their theatre for every step of the theatre customer journey on both experience levels (performance- and theatre-experience).","theatre; experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

This study is focused on the 11.6 Moz Lagunas Norte high sulphidation epithermal gold deposit in the La Libertad Region, Peru and is part of a research collaboration between Barrick Gold and Delft University of Technology. In the deposit 80% of the gold is hosted in weakly metamorphosed quartzite of the Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous Chimu Fm. A correlation between alteration mineralogy and mineralization is present according to previous authors. In this study a sample set originated from 6 drill holes throughout the deposit was investigated to determine the nature of the correlation between alteration mineralogy, Au and sulphide content by using near-infrared reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy. This method was chosen since alteration minerals typical for the deposit have diagnostic features in this range. Alteration mineralogy was determined with near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy for a whole rock sample suite. This resulted in the identification of mineralogy, typically observed in the advanced argillic zone of a high sulphidation epithermal deposit. The mineralogy was verified by XRD analyses. Furthermore iron bearing mineralogy, typically found in the oxidised breccia zone, was identified. Principal component analyses on the spectra resulted in the observation that the mineral compositions are mixtures between mineral end members, which can be coupled to progressively neutralising of acidic fluids in the hydrothermal system. Subsamples were extracted and were tested both spectrally, petrographic, and geochemical. This resulted in the conclusion that Au was focussed in fault zones. Partial least squares discriminant analyses was used to classify samples based on Au mineralization revealing that pyrophyllite is an indication for Au$<$0.25 ppm. Total sulphur based classification models were able to distinguish samples which contained total sulphur>0.25%. The Au model had an accuracy of 76% adjusting the threshold would result in a small class which has a high certainty to not contain gold. Hence PLS-DA models showed it is possible to classify ore, based on the near-infrared reflectance spectrum. In which alteration mineralogy can be used as a calibrated proxy for gold and sulphide content at Lagunas Norte. Implementing a pre-sorting step based on NIR would result in a reduction of processed waste, which would result in a reduction of operational expenditure.","Chimu Formation; Spectroscopy; NIR; Gold; Lagunas Norte","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Applied Earth Sciences / Resource Engineering","","-7.94, -78.25"

(mentor)","2015","Unperturbed observation of deep space radio waves is impossible to achieve from Earth but could be managed if the instruments were positioned in a place shielded from Earth, such as the far side of the Moon or the Shackleton crater, situated at its South Pole. In order to keep the costs of such a mission as low as possible, the VEGA launcher needs to be used. This MSc Thesis studies the possible mission designs and trajectories to land a minimum of 150 kg of payload in such a place. For the eight mission scenarios considered, the spacecraft can either use a Chemical Propulsion System (CPS) or an Electric Propulsion System (EPS) for the transfer to Low Lunar Orbit (LLO), the spacecraft can either circularize around the Moon in a polar orbit or in an orbit situated in the lunar orbital plane, and the relay can either be sent to the Lagrangian point L2 or be landed on the Moon. After preselecting the four feasible mission scenarios, a Matlab program was coded to simulate the trajectories flown from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to LLO using either a CPS or an EPS, the trajectory from LLO to L2 using a CPS which is applicable to certain mission scenarios only, and the trajectory for the descent and landing also using a CPS. The inclination of the lunar orbital plane with respect to the launching site varying during the year, it was chosen to take the worst-case scenario for this study. The subsystem masses were then assessed to determine the payload mass that can be placed on the Moon. It was found that with the most successful CPS mission 34 kg of payload could be placed on the rim of the Shackleton crater, while 107 kg could be placed at that same place when using an EPS. For both cases, no relay module was sent to L2 and the spacecraft circularized around the Moon in a polar orbit. Even though the payload mass does not meet the 150 kg requirement, it should not be forgotten that this study belongs to the preliminary design phase of the mission: looking into the recommendations for further work and altering several parameters could change the final outcome.","LOFAR; Trajectory; Transfer; Design; Mission; Orbit; Moon; Configuration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Flight","","Space Exploration","",""

Current error metrics, like the classical (Root) Mean Squared Error (RMSE), assume that predictions can be properly validated against observations by regarding the point-wise difference in bed level. This analysis inherently has the problem that phase differences of bottom features are not recognized, such that a misplaced feature is penalised twice, the so called double penalty effect. To reduce the double penalty effect, Bosboom and Reniers (2014) formulated errors metrics based on an optimal smooth displacement field between predictions and observations. Since the employed image warping technique moves pixels rather than sand, sediment continuity is not guaranteed. To overcome this limitation, this study presents an error metric based on the effective (net) sediment transport difference between prediction and observation including a recipe to compute it: the Root Mean Squared Transport Error (RMSTE). This transport difference is minimised by its 2-norm (not 1-norm) for computational efficiency. Intuitively, the RMSTE can be interpreted as a measure for the amount of work to be performed to correct the sediment displacements between prediction and observation. For predictions with equal RMSE, the highest RMSTE is awarded to the one with bed level differences with the largest wave lengths in the sense of Fourier components. This study presents case studies showing a gradual response of the RMSTE to increasing displacement of features. The double penalty effect does not occur if the distance to the boundaries is large in comparison to the feature displacement. Further research should point out if the double penalty effect occurs with real model studies and leads to counter-intuitive behaviour of the RMSTE. The transport difference field and displacement field provide opportunity for a more insightful visual comparison of prediction and observation. Filtering on displacement magnitudes may be useful in subsequent research to asses model skill at smaller scales.","model validation; mean squared error; double penalty effect; morphodynamics; root mean squared transport error; effective transport difference","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering & Water Resources Management (double degree TUD/NUS)","",""

An Incremental Backstepping scheme that relies on estimates of the angular accelerations and measurements of the current control deflections is used to reduce the dependency on the on-board aircraft model. The contribution of this thesis is the design and evaluation of three parameter estimators to handle the remaining uncertainties. The estimators that are evaluated in this research are based on Tuning Functions, Least-Squares and Immersion & Invariance. It is shown that the Incremental Backstepping controller is not only more robust to uncertainties in the system dynamics compared to Backstepping, but is also more robust to uncertainties in the control effectiveness matrix. Furthermore, by augmenting the Incremental control law with on-line parameter update laws, the tracking performance of the uncertain F-16 model is significantly increased. The results of this study show the great potential of Adaptive Incremental Backstepping control in increasing the survivability of damaged aircraft.","flight control; incremental control; robust control; adaptive control; fault-tolerant; backstepping; adaptive backstepping; incremental backstepping; parameter estimation; system identification; immersion and invariance; tuning functions; recursive least-squares","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-05-22","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Operations","","Control and Simulation","",""

Due to the advancements in semiconductor technologies, researchers have witnessed a continuous increase in the power density of inverters over the decades. Meanwhile, on the basis of such advancement, designers are also pushing the power density to its limit by minimizing the weight and volume of every sub-system in the inverter such as EMI filter, cooling system, DC-link, etc. More often than not, these studies only look into one individual sub-system and do not consider the correlation between different sub-systems. This study explores the optimization of the weight and volume of a three-phase inverter system with a different approach. In this thesis, essential designing variables and sub-systems are considered simultaneously. To accomplish this goal, a thorough investigation of the case study inverter system is introduced; crucial sub-systems and designing variable will be picked out. Then an effective and efficient system model is constructed to evaluate different system designs. In the final step, NSGA-II optimization algorithm is applied to obtain Pareto optimal inverter designs. The optimization results are presented and analyzed to shed light upon guidance which designers could follow. It is believed that the proposed optimization procedure could effectively assist designers in the early stage of the designing task.","inverter; optimization; NSGA-II; weight; volume","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","ESE","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Schools are digitizing, which poses both advantages as well as threads to the education of students who are blind.

In this design project haptic technologies are explored to evaluate their ability to communicate graphical aids used in mathematics. Unfortunately, performance of haptic identification with such technologies was poor. It would simply take too long to haptically identify a line drawing, while accuracy would also decrease drastically with increased complexity of the line drawing. Therefore, a new method for creating tactile drawings on the fly has been sought in 3D printing methods. From currently existing additive manufacturing processes, material extrusion seemed best suited to be utilised for create tactile drawings in this context. Printing a tactile graph with the Ultimaker2 has proven to be both faster and possibly at a lower cost than utilising swell-paper to create raised line drawings, a process that is currently used. While there are still several aspects that need to be investigated, utilising 3D printing in the form of material extrusion, seems to hold a lot of potential to create tactile drawings to be used as well as produced by students who are blind; increasing their independence and thereby expanding the availability of learning materials.","haptics; 3D printing; blind; mathematics; tactile graphics; multimodal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2015","Offshore wind energy faces three important trends: (1) wind farms grow in size, (2) monopiles are installed in deeper water, and (3) cost reduction remains the most important challenge. With wind farm size, the importance of variations in environmental site conditions across the wind farm increases. These site variations, e.g. water depth and soil conditions, can lead to significant differences of loads on support structures. For monopiles in deeper water, design is dominated by wave-induced fatigue loads. Since full fatigue load calculations are computationally demanding, they can typically not be performed for each turbine within large wind farms. Therefore, turbines must be grouped into clusters in early project phases, making time-efficient approaches essential. Optimization of design clustering is necessary to reduce design conservatism and the cost of offshore wind energy. Hence, the goal of this thesis is to investigate load site variations and clustering. Therefore, a probabilistic fatigue load estimation method is developed and verified with aero-elastic simulations in the time domain. Subsequently, the developed method is applied for an exemplary wind farm of 150 turbines in 30-40m water depth to perform – sensitivity studies of loads to changes in MSL, soil stiffness, and wave parameters, – probabilistic assessments of data, statistical and model uncertainties, and – deterministic and probabilistic design clustering. The estimation method is based on frequency domain analysis to calculate wave-induced fatigue loads, a scaling approach for wind loads, combination of wind-wave loads with quadratic superposition, and Monte-Carlo simulations to assess uncertainties. Verification confirms an accuracy of 95% for lifetime equivalent fatigue loads compared to time domain simulations. The computational speed is in the order of 100 times faster than typical time domain tools. Sensitivity studies show a significant influence of water depth and wave period on equivalent fatigue loads. The influence of soil on equivalent fatigue loads is minor for high soil stiffness but can increase significant for soils with low stiffness. Normal distributed input parameters in a probabilistic assessment yield a positively skewed probability distribution of equivalent fatigue loads. Design clustering is optimized based on site-specific fatigue loads using brute-force and discrete optimization algorithms. Results for the exemplary wind farm show a design load reduction of up to 13% compared to standardized design. Probabilistic clustering proved to be only relevant at cluster borders leading to a difference in allocation for 12 out of 150 turbines. Project results show that it is essential to account for load differences in large wind farms due to varying site conditions. This study improves clustering and provides a basis for design optimization and uncertainty analysis in large wind farms. Further work is needed to extend tool verification and formulate design clustering for cost optimization.","offshore wind energy; support structure; fatigue loads; design optimization; uncertainty; clustering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Master Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

It is done by employing the best features of existing systems and including several new features.<br/>Throughout the thesis, ventilation, night cooling, solar shading, heat balance, heat recovery unit and renewable energy sources are studied. In this study, the demanded yearly ventilation air flow rates are found, the optimal heat exchanger model is selected and optimized, yearly energy consumption is calculated, while at the end, a wind cowl is selected and saved yearly energy using the cowl is calculated. The Excel Macro tool is developed and used to establish the needed yearly air flow rates, applying night cooling and solar shading. The Matlab tool<br/>is used for the selection and optimization of the heat exchanger as well as yearly energy consumption, with and without the wind cowl. The main specifications of the new system are found. Since a resize of the heat exchanger passage is recommended, an experiment is carried out in order to verify the heat transfer coefficient of the air traveling in the heat exchanger.<br/>The developed ventilation system provides the dwelling with a ‘good’ indoor air quality at any time of the year, using minimum required air flow rates per room. Thus, combined with the heat recovery device the heating demand for ventilation air is minimized. The system also provides thermal comfort at most times of the year using natural cooling and optimal shading. Thus, the cooling need of the dwelling is minimized. However, due to the heat recovery unit and high night cooling flows, the newly developed ventilation system has an enhanced electricity use. Therefore it is recommended to also redesign the air distribution ductwork system within the dwelling for low pressure use The wind cowl contributes to electricity savings even more if the ventilation system has a well-designed, low pressure air distribution system.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

A method to achieve this goal is to reduce the amount of parts in a wind turbine and more specifically avoid the use of expensive and failure-prone pitch systems. Using blades which passively deform under high aerodynamic loading and effectively reduce the peak, design-driving loads on the turbine structure might offer an interesting alternative to the pitch system. However, the conventional material for construction of blades, glass-fibre reinforced plastics,<br/>does not allow for such large deformations during normal operating conditions. Prior to this project, a study to incorporate more flexible materials has been carried out in the design of the current XANT-21 wind turbine in order to increase the flexibility of the blades. However, introducing a high degree of flexibility in the wind turbine blades might increase the risk of aeroelastic instabilities. These aeroelastic instabilities often result, in combination with a non-linearity in the aerodynamics or structure, in limit cycle oscillations (LCOs). The need to identify the key structural parameters which play a role in the initiation of the aeroelastic instabilities has led to the objective of this thesis: Investigate the influence of the critical structural parameters on the onset velocity and the behaviour of high-amplitude limit cycle oscillations of a wind turbine airfoil by means of numerical simulations.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

Current body powered hand prostheses are inefficient and require large input forces for the control. Improvements are needed to provide amputees with adequate body powered hand prostheses. The Delft Cylinder Hand, a promising design for an underactuated voluntary closing body powered prosthesis with hydraulic actuation, could be improved further by adding an actively movable thumb. The goal of this research is to increase the grip size of the Delft Cylinder Hand by adding an active thumb. A 1 degree of freedom mechanism is chosen to create a natural looking conical movement of the thumb. A complete design is made for an underactuated hydraulic cylinder hand with moving fingers and a moving thumb. A prototype for this design was made, tested and evaluated on the posed design requirements. The mechanism for the thumb movement adds 24 gram to the weight of the prosthesis. The total weight of the prosthetic hand (176 gram without glove and 241 gram with glove) is still 49 % lower than the lightest available voluntary closing body powered prosthesis. The prototype could grasp objects up to 99 (mm), which is a 32% increase with respect to the current grip size of 75 (mm). For objects with a size above 35 (mm) the mechanical performance is comparable to the current design of the Delft Cylinder Hand. Activation forces of 80 (N) to 90 (N) are needed to apply a pinch force of 15 (N) between the thumb and two fingers. The performance of the prototype without cosmetic glove for grasping small objects is lower than that of the Delft Cylinder Hand. Obtaining a stable pinch grip on small cylindrical objects is difficult because of the uneven movements of the finger phalanges of the prototype without cosmetic glove. Also the pinch forces are lower when grasping small objects compared to the current Delft Cylinder Hand. A pinch force of 5.5 (N) is achieved for an activation force of 100 (N) while grasping an object of 10 (mm) thick compared to a pinch force of 19 (N) with the Delft Cylinder Hand. Adding an actively movable thumb to the Delft Cylinder Hand is a promising improvement. It is possible to obtain an equilibrium between the thumb and the finger phalanges while grasping objects of various sizes with different grip types. The active thumb increases the grip size of the prosthesis. Further research is needed to develop a Delft Cylinder Hand with a movable thumb which meets the performance criteria for a larger range of object sizes.","Body Powered Hand Prosthesis; Prosthesis; Delft Cylinder Hand; Prosthetic hand","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Bio Compatible Design","",""

The assignment consists of three parts. Firstly, research investigates the user needs in urban individual transportation and people’s perception of the role of the electric bicycle in this urban individual transportation. Secondly, a concept for a product service system is designed, based on the research to enhance the user experience of the electric bicycle for the target group of Spaac. Finally, a strategy for further development and implementation of this concept is created for Spaac. In the analysis the current behaviour and desires of people in urban transportation are indentified and the barriers in the adoptioin of the electric bicycle are investigated. This analysis phase consists of desk research (Chapter 2), an internal analysis of the client (Chapter 3), an external analysis of the E-bike market (Chapter 4), and a user research (Chapter 5). This analysis indicates an important distinction within the target group of Spaac. While some people prefer to always take the same means of transportation, other people have an array of options to choose from and do so on a daily basis. This means both types of users have different demands to a transportation solution and a single solution might not satisfy both user groups. Important values and desires in urban individual transportation, identified in the research, are the reduction of social interaction during traveling, the reduction of distractions and unnecessary stimuli in order to have a quiet and peacefull moment in the busy city life. Finally, the increase of intuitive behaviour by reducing cognitive effort is found as an important value. The main identified barriers for the adoption of innovation, like the electric bicycle or a new PSS, are affordability and availability. During the analysis phase, trends and developments are found in the electric bike market but also in society in general. Important opportunities are the increasing amount of smart technologies in the bicycle industry and the growing sharing economy. The final concept (Chapter 9), Spaac Sharing Pro, is designed to solve the adoption barriers of the electric bicycle as well as to improve the user experience in urban individual transportation. This system is based on the trend of peer to peer product sharing and serves both users who prefer to have one means of transportation for the majority of their journeys, as well as those who prefer to use different modes whenever they please. Via smart products and an online platform the owner of an electric bicycle and a renter are connected to each other, connected to the bicycle and connected to the brand of Spaac. The owner of the bicycle is granted a discount during purchase, which has to be paid back by renting out the bicycle on Spaac’s online sharing platform. The revenue of renting will go directly to Spaac. This means the owner has a high amount of access to the bicycle but affordability is increased. For the renter this means an electric bicycle is available and affordable, even for a short amount of time. No high investments or risks need to be taken in order to drive a convenient and representable means of transportation. In designing the user experience, special attention is paid to the reduction of required social interaction during traveling, and the relaxing and intuitive interaction with all products and touchpoints. During the further development of the product service system and its touchpoints, the interaction vision provides a guideline for design decisions. Finally, a plan is presented to develop a working system in four years time and then take two more years to optimise the value for both customer segments as well as for Spaac (Chapter 10). The main challenges here are establishing appropriate partnerships, and setting up the required (user) research and product developments with the limited resources available to a startup company.","electric bicycle; E-bike; service design; customer journey; Spaac; product-service system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

In this research, society’s response to climate change has been interpreted as the emergence of climate change mitigation action by society. Studying society’s response to climate change is hampered by two main factors. First, the dynamics of society’s response to climate change are emergent and complex, as mitigation action arises out of the actions and interactions of the many actors in society. Second, society’s response to climate change is subject to many uncertainties. Agent-based modelling (ABM) has been identified as an appropriate method to get insight into the complexity and emergence of society’s response to climate change. Exploratory Modelling and Analysis (EMA) has been identified of a suitable approach to gain insight into the consequences of the uncertainties influencing society’s response to climate change. Combining ABM and EMA resulted in the design of a scenario discovery approach that supported the identification of narratives on the possible pathways of society's response to climate change.","agent-based modelling; climate change; deep uncertainty; exploratory modelling and analysis; scenario discovery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor); Wolfert, A.R.M. (mentor); Morales Napoles, O. (mentor)","2015","During the past years a lot of attention has been drawn towards the development of renewables, due to the expected depletion of fossil fuels and political decisions. Offshore wind energy is considered as one of the most promising renewable energy sources, however the cost of offshore wind farms have not yet reached competitive levels. Hence public-private partnership initiatives, such as FLOW, were developed, aiming the reduction of the high cost of offshore wind farms. The current thesis is part of the FLOW project and its main goal concerns the development of a probabilistic decision support tool which will help professional concept engineers in comparing different cable installation scenarios by taking into account uncertainties. The tool estimates the time needed to complete the cable installation and by this estimation, an insight to the total cost of the cable installation can be provided. Thus the user can exploit the results provided by the designed tool in order to decide the optimal installation scenario. Within the scope of the project the dependence of wind speed and wave height, was investigated using Copulas functions and random weather time series were constructed based on the estimated dependence. Also an algorithm which takes into account the uncertainties regarding the performance of the installation operations as well as the risk of potential failures was developed. The algorithm provides as output the CDF curve of the duration of a cable installation scenario. Based on the produced curve the user is able to estimate the duration of a cable installation scenario within a confidence level. Finally the designed tool was used to simulate a realistic cable installation test case, provided by Van Oord. The results from the simulations indicate that the designed tool provides a better estimation of the duration of a cable installation scenario, since it takes into account more realizations of weather conditions, compared to the common practice which simulates this scenario for a number of observed weather time series. Also it can be used to compare different cable installation scenarios by estimating the time needed for their completion and provide an insight on the expected cost, incorporating weather uncertainties and failure risks.","probabilistic; cable installation; offshore wind farms; copulas; random weather time series; decision support; failure risks; uncertainties","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering / Section of Offshore Engineering","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Sakes, A. (mentor)","2015","Background: Chronic Total Occlusions (CTOs) are the most challenging lesions of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). The most common failure mode is the inability to cross the lesion with a guidewire. Crossing is complicated by the lack of guidewire stiffness and the high penetration force of the fibrous proximal cap of the CTO, often causing guidewire buckling during penetration attempts. Therefore, the goal of this study was to explore a novel method to puncture the proximal cap of the CTO. Methods: Theoretical analysis and modelling of the clinical case and crossing action resulted in the selection of the ""impact method"", comprising the application of impact force onto the CTO that potentially causes fracture of the proximal cap without (large) environmental disturbance through an inelastic collision. This method was transformed into a functional prototype design, which was subsequently evaluated on its mechanical performance and puncture effectiveness, by means of High Speed Video (HSV) analysis, peak force measurements, and tests with different developed CTO models, representing variable CTO material characteristics. Results: The developed prototype (Ø 2 mm) uses a distal spring-loaded indenter (of different shapes) with a novel reload mechanism to exert impact force onto the CTO. The maximum indenter momentum and mean peak force, at 1 mm object distance and with maximized spring force, were experimentally determined at 1.3 mNs (mass 0.39 grams, mean velocity 3.4 m/s (n = 5)) and 19 N (n = 10), respectively. The puncture effectiveness of the indenter strike was found to be dependent on material characteristics of the targeted CTO model and the indenter tip shape. Proximal cap models with hard and brittle characteristics were fractured most effectively; on average in less than three indenter strikes with non-pointed indenter tip shapes. Conclusions: The impact method and prototype have shown potential to fracture fibrocalcific cap models. However, to draw final conclusions on potential (safe) endovascular crossing of CTOs, and the most optimal design (parameters) of the instrument, more knowledge on biomechanical properties of CTOs, or an in-vivo experiment, is needed. Nevertheless, it is believed that continued research and development of the method may, in time, improve the endovascular treatment possibilities of coronary CTOs.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-05-19","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Brand-de Groot, S.C.M. (mentor); Boots, J. (mentor)","2015","Karakter – a child- and adolescent psychiatric hospital - is implementing a new way of working: high & intensive care (HIC). The HIC offers the most intensive treatment, whenever ambulatory care does not work any more. Patients are admitted when they become a danger to themselves and to others. In the HIC it is important to have respect for the patient, so he or she is approached in a hospital way. When unusual stress temporarily renders a patient unable to direct life effectively, a psychological crisis occurs. Different phases can be described in a crisis, in which the patient shows different behaviours and has different emotions. The new HIC department of Karakter in Nijmegen will have a new room: the comfort room. The comfort room is place in the HIC where patients can use calming techniques on their own initiative in order to cope with a psychological crisis. The goal of this graduation project is to design a product for the comfort room of the new high & intensive care department in Nijmegen that supports patients coping with a psychological crisis. In order to design this product, it is necessary to question if design can support coping in this situation. By using different research methods, including observing patients at the HIC and contextmapping with patients and sociotherapists, the patient’s experience of being admitted to the HIC and different coping strategies were investigated. Positive feelings of being admitted to the HIC are the secure and safe environment, and the fact that patients always have someone to go to. Negative feelings include the insecurity towards their situation at home, having no control over their actions, and a lack of stimulation. Additionally, the researcher identified 6 categories of coping strategies patients can use to cope with a crisis situation: balance social interaction, focus, find joy, escape and release energy. It can be concluded that design can support coping with a psychological crisis. This design intervention should make the coping experience positive. It does so by fulfilling the patient’s concerns towards the situation of being admitted to the HIC. A conflict between two of these concerns has been found: the patients feel good in the stable and safe environment (security), but they feel locked up and restrained in their possibilities as well (autonomy). This was the starting point for the design goal: ‘I want to increase the subjective wellbeing of patients at the HIC, by letting them experience both security and autonomy during a psychological crisis, which allows them to grow in their coping abilities with a crisis’ To accomplish this design goal, the interaction between the product and user should be explorative, controlling, reliable, focused and joyous. The designer discovered that the patients would use a product differently in different phases of the crisis: when they are frustrated or angry, they want to release their negative physical energy into an object; but when they are feeling more anxious or psychotic, they need something that structures their thoughts. With Glowb the patient is able to do both. Glowb is an elastic sphere hanging down from the ceiling in the comfort room that facilitates both an aggressive and an intimate interaction. The patient is able to punch the ball against the wall, which is a way to release negative energy. The ball reacts on this action by making a noise, bouncing back and lighting up brightly. The patient’s attention shifts from the negative thoughts to the returning sphere. They are not dealing with these thoughts anymore, because they focus on catching the ball, avoiding it, or smashing it again. The light enhances this interaction, because it changes the whole environment: it lets the patient know that he or she has been heard. The patient is also able to interact with the sphere in an intimate way, by touching the sphere or letting it swing or turn. The sphere reacts as expected: it starts to move gently and starts to light up and eventually changes in colour. In this scenario the user focuses more on the light patterns that are projected on the walls of the comfort room, moving around and changing into different colours. When the patient found a focus in the pattern, the pattern brings structure in his or her thoughts: a moment to sit down and think about the situation. The light eventually fades out when the patient does not interact with it. This will give patients a moment to evaluate their mental state, so they might are stable again. The goal of Glowb is to support psychiatric patients at the HIC coping with a psychological crisis. To verify this goal, an evaluation study has been executed. The users experienced the light effects as a reflection of their emotional status and behaviour, which makes them aware of how they feel. The focus on the light effects helps the patient with emptying their thoughts, which results in movement for new thoughts. It can be concluded that Glowb does support patients coping with a crisis situation, because the product can be used in different phases of this crisis. Patients have the control to use the product in multiple ways, according to what emotional state they are in.","psychiatry; coping; psychological crisis; positive design; lighting design; comfort room; high & intensive care","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2015","Europa, the second of Jupiter’s Galilean moons, has attracted strong interest from the scientific community. This is because it could harbour a sub-surface ocean of liquid water beneath its icy surface, which could be habitable. Recent observations indicate the existence of water vapour plumes at Europa’s south pole. The in-situ measurements of the plume particles (both neutral and ionized) may allow the direct sampling of Europa’s (potentially habitable) sub-surface ocean environment, without the need of an expensive landing or surface-ice penetrating mission. The instrument that could be able to perform in-situ sampling of the plumes is PEP (Particle Environment Package). PEP has been selected to fly on-board the European Space Agency's JUICE mission (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer) to be launched in 2022. PEP is under development now at the Swedish Institute of Space Physics (Institutet för rymdfysik or IRF) in Kiruna, Sweden. PEP is an instrument suite with six sensors to characterize the plasma and neutral environment in the Jovian system in-situ and remotely (via fast neutral imaging). The JUICE mission will perform two flybys of Europa. Related to the development of PEP and future observations of Europa’s plumes a Master’s thesis project with the following goal has been proposed: “Determine if PEP can observe Europa's water vapour plume by modelling: (a) the trajectories of neutral and ionized particles from Europa’s water vapour plumes with test-particle simulations and (b) the respective instrument observation.” In the test-particle simulations method the trajectories of particles through background electric and magnetic fields are determined by treating each particle as an isolated test particle. The project focusses on the JDC (Jovian plasma Dynamics and Composition analyser) and NIM (Neutral and Ion Mass Spectrometer) sensors that are part of PEP. We developed a model of the neutral and ionized plume particle environment. We simulated observations of these particles with respectively the NIM and JDC sensor, and demonstrated observations of plume particles is possible even for plumes that have lower mass flux (? 1 kg/s) than what has been observed (7000 kg/s). The developed neutral plume particle model is applicable when the particles in the plume are non-collisional. The ionized plume particle model is applicable to the case where the plume ion density is lower than the typical ion density at Europa. This limits the applicability to plumes with a mass flux ? 1 kg/s. We argue that future Europa plume models should consider the collisions between plume particles. Furthermore the expected high ion density will strongly influence the electric fields at Europa, this effect should be taken into account.","Europa; JUICE; water plumes; PEP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space flight","","Astrodynamics and space missions","",""

It makes the operation of home apparatus much easier, more flexible and comfortable by enabling control at a certain range of distance, time and magnitude. After decades of gradual development, this domain is recently experiencing a rapid growth, owing to the booming technologies. Not only our home and household activities are becoming more automatic, but many other aspects of our daily living, such as communication, entertainment, health care and fitness, etc., are also becoming more convenient. In response to this trend, a new vision for our future living with more emphasis on wireless and intelligence has been brought up, depicting a home-based but not home-bounded daily living automation which provides the needed services at the right time and right ‘amount’ regardless of the users’ location, and most importantly, with easy operation. To differentiate this vision from simple home-automation, the term ‘Smart Living’ is coined as a replacement for ‘Smart Home’ (Nikayin, Skournetou et al. 2011). As the global ageing problem exacerbates, Smart Living is promising to solve the problem of lacking resources for elderly care. Nevertheless, its realization in the field of elderly care can be challenging due to the cooperation problem among the various stakeholders. In this research we will tackle several aspects of the cooperation problem that can potentially be encountered by the Smart Living projects in elderly care via a thorough review on relevant literature and a case study on an in-home assisted living project in Finland.","platform theory; collective action; IAD framework; structural closure; structural hole","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Information and Communication Technology Department","","Management of Technology","",""

In light of reducing the Levelised Energy Cost (LEC) generated from wind energy, power company Vattenfall is continuously looking for new ways of monitoring and improving wind turbine yield. Recent publications have shown nacelle-based lidar to be a valuable tool for research, capturing the interest of Vattenfall's Wind Resource team. To gain more insight in the applications of nacelle-based lidar and their benefits to Vattenfall as operator, a measurement campaign was conducted at wind park Slufterdam West. More specifically, a Wind Iris was installed on the nacelle of the most southern wind turbine (type GE 1.5s) and a sodar of type AQ500 was installed 235m to the southeast of this turbine. The Wind Iris proved to be a useful instrument for measurement of the power curve and mean yaw misalignment. The former was found to be in accordance with the contracted power curve and the latter turned out to be 1.5 degrees. In the wind regime where it is most relevant to the power curve (4-13 m/s), yaw misalignment was found to have no clear relationship with rotor speed and wind speed. Two methods were used to investigate the impact of yaw misalignment on the power curve, but no definitive conclusions could be drawn. Moreover, the Wind Iris was found to be a useful tool for investigating the blockage effect and results were in accordance with theory. Finally, a financial case study was carried out to evaluate implementation of the Wind Iris at Slufterdam. However, since there is no evidence that the turbines have yaw misalignment nor that small yaw misalignment is harming the power curve, implementation is currently not recommended. However, if the impact of yaw misalignment on the power curve can be quantified accurately, implementation can be financially viable.","yaw misalignment; power curve; blockage; nacelle-based lidar; Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy, Flight Performance and Propulsion","","Wind Energy","",""

(mentor); Reniers, A.J.H.M. (mentor); Van Rooijen, A.A. (mentor); Boers, M. (mentor); De Vet, P.L.M. (mentor)","2015","A very large storm hit the coasts of The Netherlands-and most of north-west Europe-during the evening of the 5th of December 2013. The Sinterklaas storm, as it was later known, induced extremely high water levels and substantial dune erosion all along the Dutch coastline. In this thesis the morphological impact of the Sinterklaas storm at one particular location-Het Zwin-will be analysed from measurements and simulated with the process-based model XBeach. Het Zwin is a relatively small natural reserve shared between The Netherlands and Belgium. It is a brackish reservoir dominated by the tide, composed mainly by tidal flats protected from the sea by beach dunes and separated from the hinterland by clay dikes. Actually it is hard to classify the Zwin; it is not really an estuary, given its small dimensions, nor a tidal inlet since no lagoon is present behind the dunes. Probably it is best defined by the Dutch word ""slufter"". Two different storm regimes were observed at Het Zwin during the Sinterklaas storm: dune erosion (collision), and storm overwash, the latter confined at a precise location where the Dutch dunes were lower and narrower. The storm impact was deduced from lidar measurements of the terrain elevation prior and after the event, and the hydrodynamic conditions of the storm were obtained from wave buoys and tide gauges deployed and maintained by both countries. These data were used as inputs for a numerical hind-cast of the storm impact. Calibration of the model considered sensitive parameters that were either meaningful physical inputs, such as the bottom friction, or numerical proxies for physical processes, such as the critical slope for avalanching. As suggested in previous studies, the collision regime was found to be dependent on the onshore transport induced by short-waves, whereas the overwash regime and the washover fan were determined by the bottom friction at the higher parts of the dunes. The best fit was obtained with parameters facua = 0.10, and C = 25, respectively. Additionally, the critical slope for avalanching which produced the best fit, both in sand loss and profile shape, was found to be wetslp = 0.20, slightly lower than the recommended default value of 0.30. However, it is argued that the actual value to be used in other studies might be a function of the grid size, since it determines the ability of the model to assess the terrain slope. Morphodynamic numerical modelling is normally a costly task. For this particular site of study three factors induced very large simulation times, which rendered the modelling with XBeach unworkable: 1. A rather large domain is needed to incorporate the refraction of the wave data. 2. A very fine grid is required in order to reproduce the flooding and drying processes of the overwash and (in a lesser way) the avalanching of the dunes' face. 3. The duration of the storm, of a few days, is rather large compared with the physical events being modelled, which have a time scale of a fraction of seconds. A central issue in this thesis is the optimization of the runtime of XBeach (and by extension, any other process-based numerical model). Two techniques are discussed and tested, which allowed the hind-cast to be computed in just over a day: 1. The use of curvilinear over rectangular grids, in order to focus computational effort. The same precision can be obtained using fewer grid cells. 2. The computation of the hydrodynamic forcing by waves and water levels only once, and later feed those results to a smaller dedicated grid to perform the morphodynamic computations. This is a straightforward offline coupling scheme. The use of these techniques significantly reduce the computation effort without compromising the accuracy nor the reliability of the results.","storm impact; dune erosion; overwash; curvilinear grid; offline coupling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","51.370, 3.369"

They could however be of great value to various organizations, companies and the general public. They currently seem to be on the verge of a breakthrough. An interesting technology that could help increase the flight performance of civil UAVs is the micro gas turbine technology. This is a promising propulsion system that is being developed at the moment. It could become a solid competitor for other propulsion systems used to power UAVs due to the higher power-to-weight ratio, lower complexity, higher energy density potential and power density advantage. This could fuel the continuous expansion of civil UAVs even more. The objective of this Master thesis is to investigate the difference in flight performance between a UAV powered by a reciprocating engine and a micro gas turbine; to explore the potential of a UAV powered by a micro gas turbine based propulsion system. The exploration study first identifies the most promising application. Followed by nominating an existing UAV design as a baseline, based on the closest requirement match with the selected application. The Harfang EADS, powered by a Rotax 914 turbocharged reciprocating engine, acts as the baseline UAV. The flight performance of this UAV is determined by a software package in which point performance is integrated to obtain path performance of a typical mission profile. The aerodynamic model of the baseline UAV is determined using a combination of a vortex lattice method and the thin plate approximation. Weight estimation relationships are used to determine the components weight and the center of gravity location. Fuel flow and thrust data of the reciprocating engine are derived from the operating manual of the Rotax 914 engine, while thrust management tables from another Master thesis are used to model different micro gas turbine sizes (86, 70 and 60 kW), each having a number of technology levels. The influence of some of the assumed parameters is investigated by a sensitivity analysis. Minor modifications to the UAV dimensions resulted in a none notable effect on the mission performance of the baseline UAV. Increasing the critical Reynolds number on the other hand had a significant effect on the drag coefficient, while the influence of the Oswald factor on the drag coefficient gradually increased as function of the angle of attack. Changes to the drag coefficient and user-specified propeller propulsion efficiency of the baseline UAV both had limited effect on the mission performance. Modifications to the specific fuel consumption of the reciprocating engine resulted in a more pronounced effect. The research indicates an increase in mission endurance of 4% for the 60 kW micro gas turbine with the highest technology level compared to the reciprocating engine using the same UAV platform. A take-off weight reduction of 18% can be obtained if the UAV platform is optimized for this micro gas turbine by a redesign process; modifying the wing, fuselage and empennage design. The fuel weight is reduced by 12.5% compared to the reciprocating engine as a result of the increased mission endurance and redesign process. The micro gas turbine can therefore perform the same mission as the reciprocating engine with less fuel. This Master thesis therefore concluded that there is a performance gain possible if a reciprocating engine is replaced by a micro gas turbine. This performance gain could also be transformed into a fuel weight reduction, proving the potential of civil UAVs powered by a micro gas turbine based propulsion system.","aeronautics; UAV; flight performance; micro gas turbine; conceptual design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

The LTM consortium that is developing this smart material is composed of seventeen partners from eight EU countries. It is a diverse group of professionals, including material researchers, designers and design students. The aim of their collaboration is to ensure that the LTM smart material acquires the right functional and aesthetical qualities. They are confident to say that this novel light-touch material has great potential for a broad range of applications. My quest as a student in Design for Interaction involved: - Exploring the potentialities of this LTM smart material. Unfortunately the material was, and still is, not available in any tangible/visible form to experiment with - Organizing the potential of this smart material in a method that designers can easily adopt - Designing a concept that both illustrates the potential in interaction and physicality of the material. This yields the research question: ‘’ How can the LTM smart material be explored to map out all the characteristics and find the experiential potentialities for developing a design approach to embody these main potentialities in the design of an application? ‘’ The final aim is to show the LTM consortium how they will be able to find more potentialities of the LTM smart material by developing the material experience. This results in a final showcase-concept and a plan on how to improve the collaboration between researchers and designers. The thesis mainly concentrates on the phase in which the potential of the LTM material was explored. This phase has yielded various explorative tests and deliverables. The design phase and the exploration phase are intertwined, seeing that most of the explorations culminate in design decisions. The exploration of the potential has resulted in a mapping of the LTM material that includes the technical and experiential characteristics in an overview document, a video compilation and a mind map. Furthermore, by simulating the LTM smart material with a plastic sheet that had the same bending radius as the LTM smart material and the thickness of the Piezo-plastic layer and flexible Oled-layer combined I was able to explore the deformation possibilities, the form factor potential and the application of different surface layer textures and finishes. With this exploration I could define potential interactions. Organizing the potential has resulted in the development of a design approach. With the information thus far on potentialities in interaction and experiences and by combining these with the other characteristics of the LTM smart material I was able to create a guiding step-by-step method, the Design under Uncertainty (DuU) method, to be able to design with the LTM material. For phrasing a focus to design for I have decided to showcase two interactions, stroking-dimming and squeezing-pulsating and concentrated on the combination of these two. This focus has resulted in a design goal and interaction vision. I was able to create a context around my design goal and interaction and define a model-user. This helped me to organize my thoughts, develop a scenario and eventually define the application that would lead to a final concept. The design of the concept revolved around an exploration of the potential in tactile surface layers forms and shapes. I decided to design a garment for sporty women in stormy weather, or in darkness that acts as an extra power source for survival. By creating samples to test the best surface layer texture for stroking and the best forms in shapes for squeezing I was able to decide on placement of the LTM material in the garment and to make the final design decisions. By deciding on a texture for stroking that invites someone to actually stroke the material, I created a texture for the final design and a shape for the final form for squeezing. Squeezing the shoulder of the garment results in a pulsating light effect and stroking the sleeve results in an increasing dimming light. When this woman is biking or running she can communicate through her jacket by changing the material experience from an expressive form to a way of communicating through light. To conclude my design explorative research thesis, I can say that the LTM material has indeed great potential, but it should be thoroughly researched, viz. by building several prototypes with differences in shapes, forms and textures. For every interaction with the material and to create lots of different material experiences each different prototype could show other potentialities and qualities that invite one to interact differently with it. Provided that designers and researchers decide to join forces in working together to achieve this, I am confident that the LTM smart material has great potential in future application design.","Light Touch Matters; Material Driven Design; Explorative Design Research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2015","A Master Thesis Research has been undertaken with the goal of investigating the potential of micro gas turbines as propulsion system of choice for small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) used in civil applications. The UAV market is likely to develop great economic and technological importance on a near future because of the wide variety of applications and the added value related to the unmanned vehicles. In this regard, research focused on improving UAV capabilities is strictly related to UAV propulsion systems; as a matter of fact, aircraft performance is dependent on the mass of the power-plant and its specific fuel consumption since these can have a very significant effect on the reduction in size or increase in range of the UAV. An Exploration Study is performed both in the fields of UAV technology and of Micro Gas Turbine technology. These two areas are covered in order to understand the possible advantages and limitations of micro gas turbine engines compared to alternative propulsion concepts (e.g. electric and reciprocating engines) when used for a specific application. After the identification of a significant Case Study, a conceptual design of a high-potential UAV micro gas turbine based propulsion system is performed. Prediction of scale effects is important within the framework of turbine conceptual design where the power output is varied in order to optimize the mission performance in which the turbine is integrated. To this end, engine cycle optimization using Gas turbine Simulation Program (GSP) is carried out. Furthermore, an ""Aircraft Study"" is performed in a correlated Master Thesis Project in which the aerodynamic and flight performance model of a baseline UAV is developed. After the model validation, results from the micro gas turbine model are integrated and the performance of the new UAV configuration is investigated. The final engine configuration is a 77 kW dual shaft turboprop which is further implemented into the UAV platform redesigned accordingly to the reduced weight and improved performance. The mission model estimates for this configuration an endurance of 28.7 hours, with a range of 4419 km and a payload weight of 250 kg, with a significant fuel reduction of 12.5% compared to the original UAV configuration. The effect of power setting at cruise and the engine weight reduction allows the turboprop to arguably showcase overall better mission performance. As a result of the work carried out in this Master Thesis Project, a valuable tool for understanding the contribution of micro gas turbine integration into civil UAV has been developed.","microturbine; UAV; civil Applications","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); Wang, X. (mentor)","2015","Recent improvements in mobile technology have allowed computationally intensive augmented reality systems to become increasingly ubiquitous. As will be shown in this thesis an increasing number of companies have started developing markerless AR systems that can be used professionally. Robust pose estimation is essential for such systems to convey users into a believable AR experience by excluding outlying and erroneous tracked features. Robust statistics can detect and reject large percentages of outliers but in highly dynamic scenes more dedicated motion segmentation is required. In this thesis a motion segmentation algorithm is presented that is designed to increase robustness in a vision based marker-less stereo AR framework, to improve pose estimation and mapping. This is based on a motion segmentation method that has successfully been tested on PTAM [1]. We believe that by expanding this to stereo vision, improvements can be made by utilizing the extra visual information obtained by the second camera. By modeling the stereo triangulation error we could use the Mahalanobis distance for clustering features and correct for their error distribution, which increases with distance from the camera. Initial visual inspection showed that this improved the dynamic feature rejection with respect to the Euclidean distance and with that also the accuracy of pose estimation. This is shown in the test results. By using the 3D distribution in the scoring of each set, the correct labeling of a set of clustered features as being static was improved. This is because static features are more likely to be arbitrarily spread over the 3D scene while dynamic features belonging to the same moving object are more likely to be grouped in a relatively planar configuration. Stereo vision provides 2.5 D information (in contrast with X-ray images) and moving objects are generally smaller than the 3D scene in which the user resides itself.","augmented reality computer vision","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor)","2015","In the high-tech industry the call for higher precision and higher accuracy will never vanish. One of the aspects that influences precision and accuracy is transportation. To transport an object contact is needed. Stigmatically thinking, contact means having a mechanical connection between the transporter and the object to transport. However, if mechanical contact with the object is to be avoided, other means of transportation can be used. By avoiding mechanical contact certain benefits arise. For example contamination or surface damage (due to friction at the contact points) can be reduced by avoiding mechanical contact. The use of a device that can transport objects without contact is the basis for the thesis. The considered device uses an air bearing to carry and to position the object. This device is called the Contactless Wafer Handler (CWH). This contactless wafer handler is connected to an air supply system that generates the forces needed for carrying and actuation. To be able to support the object the air should be spread evenly across the object's surface. Also, the actuation function of the bearing requires the air flow to be controllable. This distribution of air is done by the supply manifold. A part of the CWH that consists of a labyrinth of channels, with inlets at the perimeter of the manifold and multiple outlets across the surface of the manifold. In this thesis the influence of the geometry of this supply manifold on the performance of the CWH is examined. The term performance is defined as the CWH's ability to accurately position the carried object. This performance is limited by numerous factors, one of which is the dynamics of the air in the manifold. The dynamic behavior is investigated in order to design manifolds that show optimal dynamic properties. The term optimal will be defined in this thesis. In order to obtain the optimal supply manifold the air dynamics are investigated. Using a setup consisting of a pneumatic valve and multiple air pressure sensors, models that can predict air dynamics are verified. Furthermore potentially interesting pseudo manifold geometries are analyzed. The pneumatic valve's actuation principle is piezo-electric and the valve is of the nozzle-flapper type. The pressure sensors measure strain in a membrane that deflects due to a pressure difference. The pneumatic valve and the pressure sensors used are of the same make as the ones used in the CWH. In this thesis it is shown that interesting geometries do exist and that their dynamics can be predicted with modeling. It is found that certain geometries can influence dynamics and that these influenced dynamics can benefit the performance of the CWH.","pneumatic; manifold; distributed; element; modeling; design; CWH","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","PME","","MSD","",""

(mentor); Diehl, J.C. (mentor)","2015","This report describes the design process that led to the concept of the portable power network with the name ‘Volt city’. The project is executed for the Danish startup company Volt, that currently operates mostly in the festival market. They have developed a product service system in which people can get a mobile device charger at the start of the festival and return it to Volt at the end of the festival, who in turn takes the setup to the next festival in the Volt tour. Discover In the first phase the topic of mobile charging is explored with regards to human desirability, viability in the market, technical feasibility and environmental sustainability. People’s charging routines are mapped and their tacit needs are researched in through literature studies and a contextmapping session. The outcome is mapped in customer profile. Market viability for a future solution is assessed by mapping stakeholders and competitive solutions. The place of the future design within this competitive field is determined by finding the space in the strategy canvas. The technology chapter draws the state of the art of battery technology and related technologies, which serves as an inspiration and feasibility study for the next phases. Finally an initials sustainability analysis is made that introduces charging from a wall plug and getting a powerbank in a retail situations as benchmarks. Define With all the knowledge and inspiration gained in the discover phase, a clear direction for the project is defined. A group of seven design principles is assessed from which two with the highest potential are chosen for further development. The elements in these concepts that are still uncertain are further verified through a series of tests and validations. The concept of creating a ‘power sharing network’ is found to have the highest potential based on the five core requirements. An interaction vision for the concept is formulated. “Finding power on the go should be as easy as finding your way in the city”. Develop In the develop phase the system’s architecture is set up and the basic interactions in the system are developed. In a series of four iterations all aspects from optimizing the different stakeholders’ value proposition to making a prototype of the online platform are dealt with. Deliver: Introducing Volt City Volt city is an eco-system that provides its users the opportunity to get power whenever and wherever they are. No need to be tied to a cord, no need to charge and bring your own powerbank; as long as you have a phone and you’re part of the community, you have access to a massive amount of chargers around the city. Volt spots Venues that facilitate the offer and recharging of the Volts are referred to as Volt spots. This can be any place from your local supermarket to the airport. Volt heroes Excess power carried by users is also put up for grabs in the system. If you’re out of power you can send a request to the nearest hero and meet up to exchange a Volt. In case you find yourself with a spare Volt you can pass it on to any person, friend or stranger, without having to worry about who’s responsible or who’s paying for what. The deliver phase concludes with a development roadmap, suggesting how to proceed with the concept of Volt city. Looking back The report concludes with looking back on this seven-month’s project; the design is evaluated, recommendations for future development are given and a reflection in terms of methodology is provided.","PSS design; EVR; power network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Sodja, R. (mentor); Werter, N. (mentor)","2015","Variable-stiffness panels have previously shown enhanced buckling performance compared to constant-stiffness panels, due to the beneficial load and stiffness redistribution. Two semianalytical models based on the Galerkin method and the Ritz method have been developed in order to solve the buckling problem of variable-stiffness composite panels (plates and shallow cylindrical shells). The laminates considered are assumed to be symmetric, which results in zero extensionbending couplings. However, the bending-twisting couplings, D16 and D26, are retained in the model due to their dramatic influence on the convergence of the predicted buckling loads. In the first model the governing equations for composite plates and shallow cylindrical shells with variable stiffness are derived and then solved using the Galerkin method. The variable stiffness in this model is approximated using two-dimensional Fourier series, which, however, appears to be less accurate and less efficient as compared to the Ritz method. The Ritz method avoids using Fourier series to approximate the stiffness. Instead, the stiffness is exactly expressed in the integral of the energy functional. The detailed derivations of the energy functional which were rarely shown in literature have been presented. The buckling analysis of this model comprises two main steps. First, the in-plane loads are calculated by applying the principle of minimum complementary energy in pre-buckling state. Second, the critical buckling loads are determined from the stability equations which are obtained from the total energy functional through applying either adjacent equilibrium criterion or the principle of minimum potential energy. The total energy functional for stability analysis in this model is expressed in terms of out-of-plane displacement and the Airy stress function, which appears to be a combination of negative membrane complementary energy, bending strain energy and external work. In order to ensure fast convergence, several shape functions used in Ritz method were investigated. The in-plane loads were approximated either using the beam characteristic function or polynomial function that were orthogonalized by the Gram-Schmidt process. In addition, the predictions of in-plane loads using sine and cosine function that do not satisfy the boundary conditions of in-plane loads were significantly improved by using Lagrange multiplier method. The out-of-plane displacement was approximated using either sine function or orthogonalized polynomials. The influence of the shape functions on the convergence of the predicted buckling load was analysed and discussed for different examples. These examples included plates and shells with either constant-stiffness or variable stiffness, within which D16 and D26 were either zero or non-zero. The boundary conditions considered for these examples were four-edge simply-supported in current thesis. However, the developed model can be easily extended to consider other boundary conditions. The model can solve the buckling problem of variable-stiffness panels under prescribed inplane loads (¯Nx, ¯Ny, ¯Nxy) or prescribed in-plane displacements (¯u, ¯v). In the current thesis, only the prescribed loads ¯Nx, ¯Nxy and the prescribed end-shortenings ¯u have been investigated and compared to Abaqus model; all the results satisfactorily match the results of Abaqus models. In addition, the model have been proved to be able to predict the buckling loads of shallow cylindrical shells with variable curvatures.","buckling; shell; composite; variable stiffness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace material and structure","","Aerospace structures and computational mechanics","",""

(mentor); Weg, G.S. (mentor); Hoogendoorn, S.P. (mentor); De Schutter, B.H.K. (mentor); Taale, H. (mentor); Luo, R. (mentor)","2015","The number of cars on the road and the need for transportation has increased rapidly during the past decades, leading to an increase of congestion. Traffic congestion and delays lead to high societal costs. Congestion leads to a capacity drop, i.e. the capacity of the road is reduced when congestion sets in. Due to limited financial and physical resources, it is desired to develop control measures that are able to reduce congestion and delays, and thus improve freeway throughput using existing infrastructure. Because congestion often sets in at fixed infrastructural bottlenecks, i.e. a part of the road at a fixed location at which the capacity is lower than the capacity at the other parts of the road, this research is focused on this type of bottleneck. Several traffic flow control measures have been the focus of recent research, of which some successful. One of these flow control measures is the use of speed limits, but a practically applicable control approach with improvement of throughput using speed limits as a flow control measure to prevent congestion and thus increase traffic flow at fixed infrastructural bottlenecks does not yet exist. The objective of this research is the development and evaluation of a controller that uses speed limits as a control measure, with the goal to improve freeway throughput by preventing congestion at a fixed infrastructural bottleneck. In order to reach this objective, first a literature study has been performed. This study was focused on existing approaches that use speed limits as a control measure, on different controller types and on approaches that use other control measures to control traffic flow. It was found that controlling traffic by using a dynamic speed-limited area is most promising. A density-based feedback controller has been chosen as most suitable controller for this research. After the literature study, a theory has been developed that explains the control approaches in traffic engineering terms, followed by an explanation in control engineering terms and algorithms for the developed controllers. In the theory chapter, it is explained that a speed-limited area is created with a certain desired density, which creates an outflow of the speed-limited area that is lower than the bottleneck capacity. Two different feedback controllers have been proposed to create this speed-limited area. For both of these controllers, algorithms have been developed. The first controller, feedback I, uses measurement data of the speed-limited area to calculate the average density, and compares this with a desired density value. The adjustment of the area is based on the difference between the measured average density and the desired density. The second controller, feedback II, compares the actual density with the desired density as well, but uses measurements upstream of the SL-area as well to determine the control action. The developed controllers have been evaluated both in a quantitative way and in a qualitative way by means of simulation. The second-order macroscopic simulation environment METANET is used for this purpose. The results of the evaluation show that both controllers show the expected qualitative behaviour, i.e. the flow into a fixed infrastructural bottleneck is reduced when the bottleneck is close to becoming active. This is done by generating a dynamic SL-area to control the flow. It is also shown that both controllers show a reduced total time spent compared to a situation without control, and thus an improved throughput. The improvement is between 10.8% and 23.9%. The results of the second feedback II controller are slightly better than the results of the feedback I controller. The conclusion of this research is that throughput can be improved by a variable speed-limited area. Because congestion often sets in at fixed infrastructural bottlenecks, the approach that is developed in this research could be used for field implementation. It is recommended to improve the control approach before it is implemented in the field. Several recommendations for this have been given in Section 6.2.","traffic flow; speed limits; control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logitics","","51.998869, 4.375643"

(mentor)","2015","Goal Create a highly usable design concept of an Electronic Health Record system (EHR) for inpatient care Research Almost fifty hours of observing and interviewing physicians at work gave insights about their use of patient data and their needs of a system to control it. The hospital environment is highly interruptible and people are greatly dependant on others and external resources. Physicians’ time is very limited and they have to deal with a lot of data while they often only need oversight, or some specific insight. What is necessary is an application that can provide clear overview, and is fudgeable, meaning that the user is allowed do things out of order, or without fulfilling all prerequisites. Design The scope of the final concept was brought back to that of “doing rounds”: Each morning in the hospital a physician, resident and nurse visit each patient to find out what they are going to do this day to treat that patient. This application allows physicians or residents to deal with all the information and the things they have to do originating from that visit. The resulting design is very different from existing EHR. Where they are built around data models that originate in database design or financial systems, this design is built around the goals the user has: get an overview of all relevant patients, get familiar with a specific patient, process all new data and steps to take, and manage everything that still needs to be done It was built as a small web application and tested on desktop and tablet. Although very different than what the test users were used to, the interface and the underlying concepts were quickly understood and worked well for the users to accomplish their goals. It shows that thorough user research together with structural system and information architectural design are the necessary groundwork for creating sensible software for a complex environment as a hospital ward.","user-centred; contextual design; electronic health record; application","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Zijlstra, J.J.M. (mentor)","2015","This graduation thesis presents the results of the design of a sustainability inspired materials selection app for designers. Sustainable design, and in specific ecodesign plays an increasingly important role in society. However, industrial designers, being uniquely suited to take such considerations into account, have difficulty in finding the right tools for the job. To make the selection of materials with a low environmental impact easier and more accessible, Excel based look- up tables have been developed (available at www.ecocostsvalue.com) by Delft University of Technology. However, designers still struggle with choosing the right materials, think the process is too time consuming and lack the necessary support and inspiration to perform the task ahead. Context In order to provide a solution, an extensive referencing framework was created by using literature studies, interviews, and by doing a study of existing ecodesign tools. This framework was used to identify the points of attention, areas that were considered lacking in the existing Excel based look-up tool, but also in other existing tools. By deciding on the format of a (smartphone) app, and making it LCA based, a tool was envisioned that could be used parallel to the design process; thereby providing maximum value. The tool was created in several phases, the first included a theoretical framework as has just been discussed. The second phase included the creation of a mockup design, which allowed for fast optimisations to be made to the interface following user testing involving industrial design students. Many iterations later, after the conceptual design had taken shape, the actual programming began for an iOS prototype version of the app; and even in that state the testing continued. By making use of TestFlight, a beta app distribution platform provided by Apple, several in-between versions of the app were distributed to testers for feedback. The entire process resulted in a continuously evolving prototype. Idemat app The resulting app, named: Idemat - after its backing dataset (the dataset of the app is based on an app optimised version of the Idemat 2015 Excel database) - offers significant value over existing tools. It contains a large and accurate dataset offering two single indicators, and has a clear navigational structure that is easy to understand and navigate. It offers explanatory background information, providing an educational aspect to the user; the latter by including descriptive texts, images and by visualising the impacts of choices made regarding their end-of-life impact. The app is fast, lightweight and user-friendly, and is programmed with future functionality in mind. Besides this, it is highly visual and aims to inspire designers, challenging them to think further, to reach farther. Future The future looks bright for the tool, and the exploration of what it could (eventually) evolve into, has only just begun. Feedback based on initial hands-on experiences was promising, especially as not all envisioned functionality had been implemented yet. Recognising this, the app needs further testing in a practical business environment to really optimise it for its intended function: to cater the needs of all designers, and allow them to select materials with low environmental impacts. Thereby making ecodesign accessible for the average designer, whether it be in a business or an academic setting.","ecodesign; Idemat; eco-costs; app; materials selection; environmental impact; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

An increased caloric intake, partly induced by the food industry, is the main cause of this epidemic. Though activity trackers are widely available, no solutions are yet available for automatic food intake tracking. Current solutions for improving and reducing food-intake rely on manual tracking. This has been proven inaccurate, both for reporting on eating frequency and on dietary intake. A study on human behavior resulted in the insight that, to make long-term changes, the focus should lie on on changing habits. Simplification is key to changing behavior. The slower the changes are introduced, they higher the chances of successful long-term changes. Slow changes are easy to introduce and build confidence in one’s ability to change; a crucial element in achieving behavior change. In order to change habits, it is essential to first analyze current habits. A design was created that facilitates behavior change by helping people analyze and improve their food intake patterns. The design, the BitsLab, consists of an add-on for smartphones and an accompanying app. The add-on is a chewing sensor, located on the zygomatic process.

To execute this task successfully, communication between the robots in the network is imperative. In this thesis, we link communication between robots to network integrity, where network integrity is defined as the ability of the network to communicate its acquired data to all robots in the network and to the human operator. We first introduce a greedy exploration algorithm which will be used as the basis of this connectivity-aware exploration algorithm. Then, we propose two different algorithms that each aim to maintain network integrity by using relaying robots: - The Laplacian algorithm aims to keep the graph of robots connected, which means that the graph Laplacian has a positive Fiedler value. The relaying robots actively maintain network integrity while the exploration robots execute the greedy exploration task. - The Data Transmission Rate (DTR) algorithm aims to preserve enough bandwidth for the exploration robots. All robots simultaneously attempt to preserve this bandwidth, and through artificial potential functions a control law is devised to allow for exploration. We present simulation results based on a series of scenarios, which involve exploration of a rectangular obstacle-free area. From the results, we conclude that the DTR algorithm performs significantly better in terms of exploration time and size of the explored area. Still, many improvements can be made to the DTR algorithm, such as incorporating obstacle avoidance and finding realistic parameters for the signal strength function used in the algorithm.","SDP; Distribution; robotic exploration; optimization; connectivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); Aardal, K.I. (mentor)","2015","Yard crane scheduling is one of the operational optimization problems that arise in a port container terminal. Multiple cranes have to store containers in the yard or retrieve containers from the yard. The scheduling of these cranes is complex and it is difficult to find an optimal schedule within limited computation time. In this thesis multiple mixed integer programming formulations are introduced that can be used to model the yard crane scheduling problem. The first formulation fixes zones for a certain planning window. Yard cranes are assigned an individual zone and these zones are non-overlapping. The second model uses a time discretization. We assume that yard cranes can handle 1 job in each time interval of 3 minutes. Working zones for the yard cranes can overlap, but not in the same or subsequent time intervals. Decomposition methods are used to reduce the problem complexity and reduce computation times. A logic-based Benders decomposition is used for the first model were the assignment of cranes to jobs is done separately from finding an optimal path for the yard cranes individually. Iterating between those problems can reduce computation times when the number of iterations is small. After decomposition, the size of these partial problems is much smaller than the size of the problem before decomposition. Some additional lower bound procedures are introduced to further speed up computation. A lower bound procedure can identify and exclude an assignment that will lead to a bad schedule in an early stage. When the problem instances are large enough, logic-based Benders decomposition showed a reduction in computation times. The problem is modeled in a rolling horizon fashion and time decomposition is introduced to again reduce computation times. Instead of trying to solve the problem for one long time period, this time period is split into two or more small time intervals. These intervals are solved separately where connection between them is solved by iterating between those individual time intervals. The rolling horizon reflects the practice in container terminals better since business goes on the entire day and operational decisions are made continuously, over a limited time horizon. By scheduling for a certain time period ahead, schedules can be made online without using all data available in the future. This keeps the computation times limited since scheduling a whole day at once would be too computationally expensive. The arrival times of jobs at the yard are not deterministic. Exact arrival times of trucks at the yard are hard to predict. Therefore some stochastic models are desirable. In this thesis we introduce uncertain arrival times of trucks at the gate of the terminal. Exact arrival times are only known a few minutes ahead while other arrival times follow an exponential distribution. We solve this model using expected values of the arrival times as well as by simulating possible scenarios.","Yard Crane; Mixed Integer Linear Programming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","Optimization","",""

(mentor); Pasman, G.J. (mentor)","2015","CONTEXT The period of the ‘running-shoe-wearing-American tourist’ is no more. The old fashioned running shoes have entered a new era of high-tech fashionable performance items. The lighter materials, better fitting shapes and other new technologies allow reaching higher performances and a more comfortable fit. Today this is reflected by the higher amount of people wearing Nike performance shoes for multiple purposes. Therefore, Nike needs to keep up with the high demand from the rapidly changing user interests and needs. Nike does this by innovating in materials and technology for each new model they develop. SITUATION Although customers have a good idea about Nike’s innovative approach, customers are often not aware of specific technological implementations in the shoes and their contribution to users’ performance in sport. Willing to help this issue, Nike is communicating shoe characteristics in many ways at the shoe departments in stores. The information is provided by displays with text, images and footage on screens, posters or billboards. Unfortunately that information often does not reach customers despite the efforts Nike is putting into it. Text and images Nike use are good at drawing attention, however they do not fully transfer the intended information to potential customers. One reason could be that the proposed information is too linear. The information is not offered on the right moment in the purchasing consumer journey, which leads to clients’ indifference. PROJECT AIM This project aims to enrich consumers’ shopping experience in Nike stores when it comes to purchasing new running shoes. Making consumers conscious of the implemented technology in running shoes and benefits they procure will motivate them to use the shoes to their right purpose. Therefor, an interactive communication system has to be designed fitting the consumer journey in Nike stores. The system does not analyse users’ pronation. This is a subject that exceeds the purpose of providing information about shoes. The contexts of this system are Nike only stores (in Europe), which means that the designed experience should fit to Nike’s high-end and dynamic brand identity. RESULT / DESIGN Nike Solescape is the solution to this communication design assignment. The system is an interactive floor, which enriches the test-walk experience of the consumer. This interactive system provides information about the tested running shoe to the consumer by reacting to the consumer’s standing position. The concept reads the position the user is standing in and shows information about the characteristics of that part of the shoe. The user can explore and control the system intuitively by taking different static positions e.g. standing flat, on forefeet or heels. Also making dynamic movements e.g. jumping, walking and running. These different actions all activate different information and feedback. The system also gives instructions in case users inactivity. Nike Solescape is designed to keep the user trying and exploring autonomously new running shoes. The system is implemented in the floor, which keeps the threshold to use it low. EVALUATION This design is tested and evaluated by consumers. These consumers were amazed by the surprising and unusual way of interacting with a floor while testing running shoes. This astonishment was so important that users forgot to focus on the given information. However, the information offered by the system did enrich consumer knowledge of running shoes and their benefits. Also users were excited to go more often to Nike running stores in order to purchase running shoes if this system would be implemented. For the critical feedback users especially had remarks on the visualization of use cues and shoe ability scales. These visual use cues were minor points to improve. The very critical shortage to users’ needs is the absence of the analysing function of the product. The system provides information and does not take users’ way of walking in to consideration. This feature is according to consumers important to develop in the future.","Design; Retail; Communication; Running footwear","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Aesthetics","","","",""

The tool was tested on several test cases whereby the results were compared to analytical and FEM solutions and showed good correspondence. The results of the developed tool are sufficiently accurate for a conceptual design stage and give fast quantitative and qualitative insight into the behavior of shell structures.

(mentor); Mejia Sarmiento, J.R. (mentor)","2015","This graduation project was set out to explore how service design could be applied to the circular economy. The report outlines a framework for applying the process to projects on circular system transitions. A case study was conducted on designing a service for Fairphone, in which the framework was applied. Fairphone has been a leading example in the mobile phone industry, addressing the ethical side of consumption by producing a ‘fair’ smartphone. Several guidelines for circular product design are applied to the second generation of its phone, which is expected to enter the market in the fall of 2015. Its business model, however, is still geared to a linear economic system. An analysis of Fairphone’s current system demonstrated a typical problem in the linear economy: a large amount of phones ends up in a drawer, being unused. In the context of the circular economy, service design is often directly linked to the design of circular business models. In circular business models we witness a shift from traditional models, to traditional models with a take back scheme, to service models, in which the access to products is provided, rather than the ownership. Designing services to contribute to a circular economy, requires an understanding of what influences the structure of the system. This means that besides the company and the economic system, an understanding of the users and their mutual differences is crucial. In order to understand Fairphone’s users, several in-depth interviews were conducted with Fairphone community members. The extracted differences in users’ needs were applied to divide the community into five segments. This segmentation has formed the foundation for a system vision, in which devices are both sold and leased, and used devices are returned to the (second hand) market. In a co-creation workshop - which involved several stakeholders, experts, and users - value propositions were developed to strategically target different user segments in this future system. The development of a roadmap structured the approach to move towards the vision. The upcoming launch of Fairphone 2.0, and the limited amount of spare parts for Fairphone 1, prioritised the development of a return to use programme for Fairphone 1. The return to use programme comprises a buyback solution, which enables the company to refurbish and resell used devices. The programme expands Fairphone’s market to a more price-sensitive, low-tech segment. It addresses the longevity and reuse of its phones, and offers a more transparent approach to the end of life phase. The service is presented in a service blueprint. This tool aids in orchestrating all stakeholder actions. The major conclusion of this report is that to apply service design to the circular economy, an understanding of all actors across the different levels of the system is required. Identifying user segments opens up the system to generate a holistic vision for a circular economic system and create services that add value to both users and business today, while contributing to the circular economy.","circular economy; service design; Fairphone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

Accordingly, origami plate dockings onto conventional solid-state silicon nitride pores with membranes of ?20nm thick were previously studied. Here, we examine whether graphene, with its single layer of carbon atoms, poses advantages over silicon-nitride pores. The conductance blockades due to origami plate dockings were characterized as a function of salt concentration and applied bias voltage and compared to the silicon-nitride data. As expected, it was found that conductance blockades increase with salt concentration and voltage. The relative conductance drop in graphene was however found to be similar to that for silicon nitride pores, whereas theory predicts that the blockade signal is larger in graphene pores. We have further compared the root-mean-squared noise levels of the ionic current through hybrid graphene-origami pores and bare pores, and found that the noise in the hybrid pores was slightly higher than in the bare pore current. Finally, it was tested whether the plates stick to the graphene pore in presence of EDTA. This was done by docking the plates and subjecting them to a negative ramping voltage. Without EDTA, no evidence of sticking was found, whereas with EDTA, 88.2\% of docked plates appeared to be sticking.","graphene; DNA origami; nanopore; plate; bottom-up; honeycomb; conductance","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Bionanoscience","","Technische Natuurkunde","",""

To validate the CFD data, experiments are performed in the Open Jet Facility of Delft University of Technology, where the laminar-turbulent transition is measured using an infrared camera. The results show that at high advance ratios, the difference between the CFD simulations using the laminar-turbulent transition model and the one-equation turbulence model is large. This can be explained due to the trailing edge separation which is present in the case where laminar-turbulent transition is modeled. At lower advance ratios, the difference between the two CFD models becomes smaller. This is due to the fact that a larger portion of the flow over the blade becomes turbulent. Comparing the CFD results to the experimental results it can be seen that the location of transition predicted by the CFD simulations shows some agreement with the experimental results.","propeller; transition; performance; CFD; computational; fluid; dynamics; infrared; numerical; experimental; RANS; BEMT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","","","",""

(mentor); Park, G. (mentor)","2015","With a growing demand for cheap access to space and high-speed flight, hypersonic research is experiencing an unceasing interest from worldwide parties. The vehicles designed for this purpose experience flight conditions where real gas effects caused by dissociation and ionization of the air molecules greatly influence the flow conditions and surface heat transfer. This makes the application of conventional perfect gas models ineffective and inaccurate. The study of this high-temperature flight regime and the effects on the flow is called aerothermodynamics. This presentation will introduce the research conducted at the Hypersonics lab of KAIST (South Korea) regarding the catalytic recombination of nitrogen on copper oxide (and copper). Catalytic recombination is a phenomenon where the dissociated air molecules recombine at the surface of the body. The extent to which this recombination occurs does not only depend on the flow condition but is also greatly influenced by the surface material. Copper coated heat flux probes are commonly used as a well-defined reference for experimental catalycity research. However, it has been found that impurities of the probes caused by oxidation (and thus the formation of copper oxide) may have a profound effect on the measured reference heat flux. In order to quantify this effect, heat transfer rates at the stagnation point of a blunt body are measured in a shock tube using thin-film gauges. This thesis presents experimental and theoretical results on the surface catalytic recombination phenomenon occurring in a test gas consisting of a mixture of nitrogen and krypton. The results found in this project will function as a building block towards a better understanding of catalycity which ideally leads to a more accurate design of hypersonic vehicles.","catalytic; nitrogen; dissociation; copper; oxide; tertiary; shock; tube; recombination; dissociation; krypton; heat; flux; thin-film; gauge; gas; mixture; catalycity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics & Wind Energy","","Aerodynamics","",""

(mentor); Tolou, N. (mentor)","2015","Modelling of the behaviour of compliant mechanisms leads to a better understanding and synthesis of designed mechanisms. Static and dynamic responses for compliant mechanisms have been researched extensively. While impact modelling is a well known field in rigid body dynamics, impact modelling in compliant mechanisms research is lacking. By combining the fields of dynamic modelling of compliant mechanisms using the pseudo-rigid-body model and rigid body impact modelling a technique is proposed. The efficiency of the impact is considered as the amount of energy fed back into the first mode shape, for which the compliant mechanism was designed. Energy is expected to be lost higher frequency vibrations of the system. Modelling and experiments were done for a case study to show the effects of impacting in line with and outside of the centre of mass with varying impact angles. Results for an increasing impact angle show less energy returned to the fundamental mode shape. Impacting outside of the centre of mass shows asymmetric results and impacting closer to the base from the centre of mass results in less energy loss than further from the base. Using rigid body impact modelling on the pseudo-rigid-body dynamic model (PRBDM) provides quick simulations including impact. The single degree of freedom of the PRBDM does not capture the effects of higher mode shapes outside of extra energy losses from the first mode. Therefore a two rotation pseudo-rigid-body model (2R-PRBM) is converted into a dynamic model and is applied to the case study including impact equations. This model has multiple degrees of freedom and can therefore contain the higher frequencies in which energy is lost. The dynamic 2R-PRBM provides the same response for an impact in line with the centre of mass and straight path and shows energy moves to higher frequencies at a shifted impact position or angle. The amount of energy loss currently does not match the experiments. Expected cause are assumptions made by the impact modelling.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

KLM is currently losing a strong position as network connector, as the operability of transfer flights is under pressure: departure punctuality is substandard. Offering attractive connections to passengers is KLM’s right of existence as 70% of its customers are transferring at their only hub: Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Therefore, the departure punctuality should be brought back to an acceptable level. KLM scores well on the international standard indicator for arrival punctuality, their on-time departure punctuality is however substandard: declining from 50% in 2009 to as low as 20% over 2014. One contributor to the low departure performance is the inefficient ground operation. Regarding the passenger-handling process there were some other figures raising questions. In 53% of the cases the gate process took longer than planned. The gate process is therefore the object of study.","KLM; Passenger-handling; gate; case study; queuing theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-05-06","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor)","2015","The main reason for accidents involving trucks or truck combinations is the lack of situation awareness. Drivers of particularly articulated truck combinations need a high level of awareness about the state of the vehicle combination and its surroundings. The current steering interface sets limits on the signals that the driver can perceive and the way the driver can act. I see an opportunity to break these limits on the interaction by introducing a new steering interface. The new interface is intuitive and designed specially for articulated truck combinations. The interface consists of two physical walls on the left and right side of the driver, an active touch panel in front of the driver, and air vibration generators on the left and right side. The driver controls the lateral position of the truck by controlling the position of the walls. The idea is that the driver can easily associate the lateral position of the truck between the lane boundaries with the position of his or her own body between the walls. Further, the driver perceives a map of the surroundings by feeling and following surfaces on the active touch panel. Moving surfaces on the active touch panel represent the truck, trailers, road boundaries, and other traffic users. Important information about upcoming traffic is given through air vibrations that are sent by the air vibration generators towards the driver’s hand. The new interface is designed for highly automated driving, where automation allows the truck to follow a lane at a certain speed. The driver still actively participates in the control of the vehicle, and is always in direct control of the walls. Physical prototypes of the walls and the touch panel have also helped to imagine what the new driving experience would be like. In particular, simple tests have been performed with the prototype of the walls in a real truck on a test track.","Human-Machine Interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Visser, H.G. (mentor)","2015","The ever-increasing use of aircraft, together with the on-going urbanization causes increasing noise nuisance due to aviation. This is attenuated by the positioning of airports close to densely populated areas. For this reason the majority of the large airports in the world indicate that noise is one of the limiting factors in the expansion of the airport. One solution of adjusting operational procedures is the adjustment of near-airport operations of aircraft. Previous research shows the application of multi-event optimizations which optimize the lateral aircraft tracks for multiple aircraft simultaneously. Although the results of these optimizations proved significant improvements in terms of community noise, still two problems remain open-ended, which prohibit (or limit) the practical implementation of the results. - The multiple aircraft departures, which currently often show dispersed flight tracks, are being concentrated onto one track. This concentration of flights onto one track allows a reduction in community noise but causes peak loads in noise at the same time. The increased technical capabilities allow aircraft to accurately follow predetermined tracks which causes problems equal to the described problem in the near future. - By repositioning aircraft tracks (and the resulting noise) the total amount of noise nuisance decreases. At the same time an increase in noise received at some locations due to the creation of new noise (noise that is new for a location). The new noise has proven to cause significant resistance to the implementation of new aircraft tracks. This thesis questions the desirability of solely focussing on the reduction of one specific community noise metric, of which the amount of people highly annoyed and awakenings have been used in the past. Instead this research aims to find to which extent peak noise loads and new noise can be taken into account in the optimization of aircraft tracks. For this purpose, two noise impact criteria have been integrated. To be able to investigate the desirability of either concentrating or dispersing aircraft tracks a multi-event optimization is implemented that allows to optimize two aircraft (Boeing 737-300 and Boeing 747-400) tracks simultaneously, for the lateral tracks as well as. Constraints with respect to noise nuisance are implemented within the optimization tool. This novelty converts the optimization problem from finding the optimum combination of fuel and community noise to finding a minimum cost function value while assuring a pre-defined level of community noise. This in turn allows to include new types of noise metrics in the cost function of the optimization.","optimal control; noise abatement; community noise impact; aircraft; departure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Air Transport and Operations","","Traffic Management and Airports","","52.30907, 4.76338499"

These losses are composed out of conductor losses, dielectric losses and radiation losses due to space and surface wave excitation. For printed transmission lines these latter losses are of particular importance when the transverse dimensions of the transmission lines become significant in terms of wavelength. The quasi-analytical model proposed in this thesis is implemented in a software tool, which is now rendered freely accessible, and capable of accurately analyzing the most widely used transmission lines.

(mentor); De Ridder, H. (mentor)","2015","Involving users in the design process of products and services in order to increase the added value for these users is becoming more common. The company Contextmapp was aware of this trend. It wanted to extend its mobile application ‘Contextmapp’, which was used for gathering insights on users’ needs. A suitable graduation assignment was formulated: ‘To design functionalities for an extension of the Contextmapp, with which the user involvement in the design process is enhanced.’ The two challenges that were discovered early in the process, are: (1) ‘By increasing the user involvement in the design process, users are asked to spend more time and effort on the project.’ and (2) ‘Organizing a project in a digital environment quickly makes the experience impersonal and insecure.’ Acknowledging these as challenges, it was important to find a suitable user involvement approach and integrate a motivation mechanism in the design of the extended version of the Contextmapp. A competitor analysis, a literature study, expert sessions, and a motivation experiment resulted in insights on how to involve users in the design process and motivate them for active participation. This resulted in the formulation of a design goal: ‘To provide users with a tool to participate in the analysis- and ideation phase of the design process, on a consultation- or collaboration level, while giving (personal) feedback and addressing ‘self development’, ‘feeling of belonging’, ‘responsibility’ and ‘fun’ to increase their intrinsic motivation to actively co-create.’ Brainstorm sessions, idea clustering, selecting, and combining ideas led to a concept. This concept contained a Contextmapp co-creation process with a description of roles and activities, a suitable Contextmapp application and dashboard, and a motivation mechanism. This motivation mechanism consisted of a team, expert talks, a selection procedure, and (personal) feedback. All were tested in a short co-creation project with the current Contextmapp. Learnings were processed and a final design for the Contextmapp co-creation process and Contextmapp mobile application were made. The co-creation process of the final design contains three phases: data gathering, data analysis and ideation. The data gathering phase was already present in the current Contextmapp. When detailing the design the emphasis was on the ideation phase. The activities for a participant in the ideation phase are: being selected, watching expert talks, ideating with a team and giving and receiving personal feedback. Features of the final mobile application design are a menu to move through all the three co-creation phases, a you-zone with assignments and tools to capture information, a team-zone to share captured elements and give eachother feedback and expert talks. To verify if this design would meet the design goal a final design test was done. Test participants were guided through a fictive co-creation scenario by using an interactive pdf in which the design was prototyped. The following conclusion could be extracted: ‘The design aspects with the biggest influence on participants’ motivation are the toolbox, team(-zone) and expert talks. These increase motivation by contributing to self development and a feeling of belonging.’ Main recommendations were to integrate the design in the general smartphone use, enrich the toolbox, support participants and clients with clarifying instruction movies, create expert talk templates, and make a user segmentation for the Contextmapp.","co-creation; contextmapp; motivation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Steenhuizen, D. (mentor)","2015","The development of unconventional aircraft designs complicates the conceptual design process of aircraft. To manage this increased complexity, it can be helpful to automatize part of this process. The further development of a tool for this automation, called the Initiator, is central to this thesis. The Initiator is a modular tool for preliminary sizing and design analysis, but the currently implemented design of the vertical tail in the Initiator is very basic. The goal of this thesis is to extend the design methodology for vertical tails in the Initiator and thus to develop a rapid aerodynamic analysis method for initial vertical tail design. To achieve this goal, vertical tail design methodology for both conventional and unconventional aircraft configurations was explored. Existing methods for the initial design of vertical tails for conventional aircraft were investigated and a rapid aerodynamic analysis method for vertical tail design for lateral-directional stability and control of conventional aircraft was developed and successfully implemented. This method was validated with existing windtunnel data, and four case studies were performed to analyze the design optimization. The validation of the implemented analysis method shows generally accurate results for most parameters. The main exception to this is the estimation of the tail-off rolling moment due to sideslip. The method is shown in the case studies to match up with the data for comparable reference aircraft. The method does have a trend towards an over-prediction for larger aircraft and an under-prediction for smaller aircraft. Windtunnel tests were performed to acquire validation data for blended wing bodies. No suitable rapid analysis method was however found for blended wing body aircraft configurations. The empirical method for vertical tail design in conventional aircraft does not work well on a blended wing body; the prediction of tail-off performance was especially inaccurate. A vortex lattice method comes up short when the angles of attack and sideslip become larger than 5-10 deg. These are present in some critical cases for vertical tail design, such as crosswind during landing and one engine out at take-off. The estimation of the tail-off yawing moment due to sideslip is inaccurate for the vortex-lattice method as well.","vertical tail; vertical stabilizer; directional stability; Initiator; initial design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Design, Integration & Operations of Aircraft and Rotorcraft","","","",""
