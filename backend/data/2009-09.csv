(mentor); Agbo, S. (mentor)","2009","In recent times, thin-film solar cells have gained a lot of attention. This can be attributed to the low material cost as well as its low energy consumption. The micromorph solar cell configuration consisting of a top amorphous silicon cell and a bottom microcrystalline silicon cell has proved to be one of the promising approaches in thin-film silicon solar cells. The importance of the microcrystalline silicon cell lies in its higher performance in absorption of photons in the long wavelength region of the spectrum. In this thesis we made use of the ASA simulator to study microcrystalline silicon solar cells. We started by carrying out the calibration process of a model microcrystalline solar cell to be used for the simulations. A sensitivity study was carried out for both optical and electrical parameters of the solar cell. The study showed that the RMS roughness of the interfaces of the solar cell especially the TCO-p interface significantly affect the solar cell performance. It is shown in this work that parasitic absorption in the front TCO and the p-layer can be enormous and reduce the overall absorption in the absorber layer. The electrical properties of the solar cell were also studied, showing the sensitivity of the solar cells external parameters (short circuit current density, open circuit voltage, fill factor) as well as the solar cell efficiency to properties such as the mobility gap, layer thickness, activation energy, etc. The effect of a buffer layer between the p-i interface and graded absorber layer on the open circuit voltage was investigated. The result shows that the external parameters of the solar cell are improve upon by implementing the i-layer grading. The Voc also increases with aSi:C buffer layer inserted between p- and i-layer. The Jsc and the fill factor and not affected much. The use of modeling and simulation is a very useful tool in the study of solar cells. This work shows that the feature is bright with regards to what can be achieved in the optimization of microcrystalline silicon solar cells.","solar cell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Micro electronics","","Msc Microelectronics","",""

The algorithm is inspired by the way soap particles move to the interface of grease and water. The artificial soap particles will move to the boundary of the hull of the measurement data cloud, thereby creating a description of the shape of the data cloud.

(mentor); Buijs, J.A. (mentor)","2009","Public art is the artwork in any media that has been planned and executed with the specific intention of being sited or staged in the public domain, which is accessible to all. Public art can be preformed in different manners: permanent or temporary, art installation or art promotion events or programs. For large public building projects almost all over the world it is required to allocate a certain percentage of the total construction budget (usually 1%) for the installation of public art if the total construction budget exceeds a certain amount of money. It is meant for encouraging the integration of art in the environment and to enable the art to be a part of citizen’s daily life. In the early days, the most common approach was to place a piece of still sculpture on a square, entrance or the lobby; however, nowadays more and more clients and architects are interested in how to merge art into a building in a more innovative and meaningful way. Architects are often requested by the clients to provide a proposal or a feasibility study for the public art issue. Accordingly, the goal of this study is to develop a design tool for the architects to facilitate the design process of integrating public art and the building project. To merge art and the environment, one of the approaches, which is also the main concept of this study, is to promote the artwork ,which is more contextual-based, able to provide certain function and interact with the users. Based on this concept, the key elements of the public art and the built environment were analyzed, the approaches for integration of art and the built environment were categorized, and the criteria of functional public art were specified as well. In the end, the design tool, a booklet, was developed and tested by a Taiwanese project, Wei-Wu-Ying Center for the Performing Arts in Kaohsiung.","design tool; public art; built environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

The hydraulic stability of the Xbloc armour unit is expressed by the stability number which is based on the assumption of dominance of lift, drag and gravity forces. If other forces have significant influence on the stability the power of one for the relative density in the stability number might change. The objective of this research was to determine the influence of the concrete density on the hydraulic stability of Xbloc armour unit and to determine if the stability can be described as a function of the stability number. 2-D Physical model tests have been done to determine the influence of the specific weight using concrete densities of 2102, 2465 and 2915 kg/m3 and slope angles of 3:4, 2:3 and 1:2. The size of the model block was held constant for all concrete densities. It is concluded from the model tests that the influence of the specific weight on the hydraulic stability of Xbloc armour layers is not correctly described by the stability number. The stability number underestimates the effect of the specific weight on Xbloc armour units for a slope of 2:3 and steeper. The underestimation increases for steeper slope angles. For a slope of 1:2 the stability number tends to overestimate the effect of the heavy concrete element, where as the normal and light concrete elements are in close resembles with each other and the expected start of damage and failure. A new stability formula for Xbloc armour units is suggested in which the power of the relative density in the stability number is a function of the slope angle and the influence of the slope angle on the hydraulic stability is taken into account.","breakwater; Xbloc; interlocking; armour unit; density","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Department of Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

To provide failure-safe connections in optical networks, lightpaths can be protected. Protected lightpaths consist of a primary path and a backup path which are disjoint and ensure connection continuity in case of a single link failure. Optical networks consist of at least two layers, the optical layer and the physical layer. And although the primary and backup paths are disjoint in the optical layer, in the physical layer they may share the same fiber span or duct. These links are in the same Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG). If one link of a SRLG fails then all fail. Because of this, a single failure at the physical layer can causes multiple failures at the optical layer and protected paths could get disconnected if both paths have fibers in the broken fiber span.

The fact that renewable energy sources are also distributed sources offers an opportunity to save on the capital investment for the transportation and distribution of electricity. Ikem in Nigeria has been chosen to be studied in this research. The proposed hybrid renewable energy system for Ikem consists of PV array, biomass combustion stirling engines and batteries.

(mentor); Stive, M.J.F. (mentor)","2009","In an attempt to reduce the cost of breakwaters, several elements have been developed. Examples are Accropodes, Tetrapods and concrete cubes. Previous tests were performed with armour layers consisting of a double layer of cubes. This study is based on a single layer of cubes. The great benefit of a single layer of cubes is that it reduces the total cost of concrete. Another benefit is that because of the shape, cubes are easy to prefabricate. Three important aspects considering the stability of a single armour layer of a breakwater consisting of concrete cubes are addressed: The influence of the wave steepness on the stqbility, the influence of the slope on the stability of the single armour layer, and the influence of the packing density on the stability of the single armour layer. This study is based on a literature study and the results from a test program including a small-scale physical model tests. All conclusions in this thesis have been based on model tests, in which the cubes were placed by hand and placed in a stretching bond (half-steensverband). In total eighteen tests were performed in the wave flume of the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences. Two different slopes were tested together with three different packing densities and three different wave steepness. It was found that the gentler slope did not contribute to the stability in this setting using a stretching bond. In fact the model failed earlier than the model with a steeper slope in most cases. The best results were found using a slope of cot? = 1.5. Secondly, the influence of the packing density showed varying failure mechanism. When applying a large packing density (np = 0.20) the damage occurred below SWL. Contrary to small packing densities (np = 0.35) where damage occurred higher than SWL. It was found that, from the tested packing densities, a packing density of 0.28 gives the best results for both slopes. This conclusion is conform the findings of previous tests [Van Gent et al, 1999]. During these tests an optimum packing density of np = 0.25 – 0.30 was found. Although the cubes were placed randomly in the tests of Van Gent. In this study the cubes were placed in a stretching bond. Finally it was found that a wave steepness of s0p = 0.04-0.05 causes minimum stability for the armour layer. The tests with a single armour layer of cubes placed in a stretching bond indicated that high sta-bility numbers (Hs/?Dn) can be reached before failure occurs (Nod > 0.2). the tests show that sta-bility numbers as high as 4.5 can be realized before Nod > 0.2 is reached. This study shows that the use of a single top layer of cubes is feasible. The top layer becomes very stable when placed in a stretching bond. In this configuration it is recommended to use a single top layer of cubes instead of a double top layer of cubes. The results during the tests seem to have a strong correlation with pitched stones. Therefore the black box model as well as the analytical method for pitched stones (6-xi-rule) is treated in an attempt to optimize the design rules for different configurations. Finally, in combination with an adjusted 6-xi-rule and the formulae from Van der Meer for loose rock, formulae were developed based on curve fitting.","breakwater; cubes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-10-09","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Zijlema, M. (mentor); Reedijk, B. (mentor); ten Oever, E. (mentor); Vrijling, J.K. (mentor)","2009","The purpose of this thesis was to develop a preliminary concept design of a wave energy converter. The type of device designed was limited by several starting points which stipulated, among other criteria, a robust structure which can be constructed within a breakwater and can generate electricity from a fairly mild (in the order of Hs=0.5-1.5m) and regularly occurring wave climate. Integration with a caisson breakwater was selected to ensure survivability. Three concepts using the theories of wave overtopping, wave run-up, and wave pressure were evaluated. A multi-criteria analysis was performed on the three concepts. Concepts were scored based on power output, functionality in wide range of conditions, ease of construction, and theory reliability. Theory reliability was scored based on the three aforementioned criteria. The concept analysis concluded the most promising device to further investigate was the concept based on the theory of wave pressure. This device excelled in (theoretical) output having the highest peak power and wider power curves. In the concept, wave pressure is exerted on an underwater opening. This opening leads water into a pipe with a gradual constriction. This constriction increases the pressure allowing the water to be brought to an optimal level above MWL. Through a turbine the water is returned to MWL. A model was built with three different opening ratios and three separate basins open to the wave flume at the bottom. A series of tests were performed of varying wave climates and crest freeboards. During the tests the head difference was measured between the internal basins and the water elevation at the rear of the model. The holes in the bottom of the basins allowed for constant flow of water out of the basins and a calculation of flow rate based on the hydraulic head was required. This allowed for the calculation of the theoretical power generated during the tests. Additionally, the input wave power was known so the device efficiency could be calculated for each test allowing for the identification of the optimal geometry and the generation of a full-scale efficiency curve. The device was evaluated at two design locations in Panama and Japan. The wave climate, tidal influence, system headloss, and sea level rise were calculated in order to discover the power generation at each location. Revenue associated with the generation of electricity was calculated to give an indication of the device’s cost effectiveness. It was found that sea level rise has a negligible impact on efficiency if sea level rise is appropriately accounted for. The impact is in the order of 1.5% over 50 years if the rise is assumed to be 80cm over 100 years. Including sea level rise, the device has been calculated to generate an average of 16,413 and 5,766 kWh/m/yr at Panama and Japan, respectively. The report concludes that the proposed design can be constructed using existing techniques for caisson construction. However, the design must be further optimised and tested in order to become a fully feasible wave energy converter.","wave; energy; converter; caisson; breakwater; pressure; wave energy converter; wave pressure; renewable energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-09-27","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Preliminary research showed that commercial processors are not suited for many research projects due to the fact that they are closed source and they can not be modified. Open source processors on the other hand appeared to be of too low quality. Within this thesis a light-weight instruction and cycle compatible implementation of the MicroBlaze architecture called mb-lite is presented to fill the need for a fast, reliable processor suitable for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and semi-custom implementation. This was accomplished by using a proven design methodology and using high-level VHDL abstractions. Experimental results showed that mb-lite is able to obtain much higher performance than existing open source processors, while using very few hardware resources. mb-lite can be easily extended with existing Intellectual Property (IP) components due to a wishbone bus adapter and a modular, easily configurable multiplexed memory bus. All components are thoroughly tested for compliance, and their functionality was proven to be correct using timing back-annotated simulations. Continued work on mb-lite will focus on including the design in a reconfigurable fabric as well as fabrication in a 90 nm semi-custom Integrated Circuit (IC) technology.","microprocessor; system on chip; Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA); microblaze; MB-lite; VHDL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-11-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

M. Sanders. Many lobbies and fields of study are involved in the re-building (re-construction) of an existing motorway. It is obvious that not all wishes and ideas of the parties involved can be carried out. The aim of this thesis is to develop a programme that, on the basis of different possibilities of simulation, can indicate in an early stage of the project to those parties involved which consequences a particular decision may have with regard to the cross (transverse) section of the existing motorway and the services concerning the infrastructure along the motorway. On the road to optimizing motorways deals with all the aspects of civil engineering that are important in order to be able to extend and rebuild an existing motorway optimally. Because of the large amount of knowledge available, not all knowledge relevant to the reconstruction and extension of a highway will be dealt with. Nevertheless the programme provides a good idea of what a motorway will look like after and during the operations (works), the most important demands of civil engineering taken into account. The deliberate gathering of as much traffic as possible on the main roads causes a serious traffic problem on those places where road maintenance is to be carried out on these main roads, because the support road system will probably not be able to absorb the dense traffic diversion. As to the redevelopment and/or extension of existing motorways, this may lead to a method of rebuilding that is different from the present traditional approach and that may help to reduce the length of time required for the building and subsequent exploitation of the road and to restrict the cost of traffic jams. In case of an extension of a motorway different possibilities and the costs involved must be taken into account. An alternative may be to opt for a permanent narrowing of the traffic lanes so that a lane could be added without broadening the road. Such measure will have its effects on the dimension of the pavement structure. In order to diminish the emissions of the vehicles, speed-limiting measures are recommended. The narrowing of the traffic lanes may help to bring about this lower speed. Such measure will also have its effect on the dimension of the pavement structure. Because of the increase of the traffic it can be decided at a given moment to install sound barriers and to adapt a silent pavement surface in order to reduce the noise pollution. The factors that are important in this respect will also be discussed in this report. And finally, by way of conclusion, a number of measures of attainableness will be discussed as well as the circumstances in which these measures can be recommended.","","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Smaller feature size, greater chip density, and minimal power consumption all lead to an increased number of faults in computing systems. Among these faults are soft errors. They are mainly caused by incident radiation. When a particle strikes a semiconductor and deposits enough energy along its path, charge builds up and the transistor temporarily has a different state. If this state is captured by a memory element such as a latch, the system can produce a faulty result. Due to the current technology trends ever decreasing the feature size and minimizing power consumption, reliability is becoming a serious concern in the current and future designs. More and more research is dedicated to fault tolerance of computing systems. One of the problems this research faces is a lack of adequate fault injection tools necessary to perform experimental evaluation of novel fault tolerance techniques. The best experimental setup would consist of a physical hardware placed into an appropriate environment. This is, however, in most cases not feasible due to extremely high cost, and also long time the experiments would require. Moreover, even if the manufacturing of the design is actually planned, the evaluation should be performed before the manufacturing. Hense, a simulation-based fault injection evaluation is necessary. Nowadays researchers usually implement their own fault injectors on simulation platforms they use for the design evaluation. This sometimes requires very much time and effort. A universal solution is very desirable, which could be easily adapted for different designs. Although it is impossible to create a fault injector compatible with all the existing simulators, there exist structural frameworks such as Unisim \cite{unisim}, that can be used for fast prototyping and are even able to interoperate with already existing simulators. This project focuses on creating a universal fault injector for the Unisim environment, which can be used in Unisim-based designs of different granularity with a minimal effort. It models transient and permanent types of faults, transient meaning single and multiple cycles. It can model single bit and multiple bit faults. It can be used for simulating memory and logic faults. The case studies show how the injector can be used when designing a superscalar processor with fault tolerance features. The fault injector can be implemented in an existing module of a simulator, or a new module can be placed in between existing modules. Different fault tolerance techniques are evaluated and compared using the fault injector.","Unisim; Fault injector; SER","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-06-23","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer engineering","","Computer engineering","",""

(mentor); Vuik, C. (mentor); Talstra, H. (mentor); Stelling, G.S. (mentor)","2009","In numerical modelling of water movement wetting and drying is a well known problem. The governing equations are not valid in the dry part of the computational domain which may result in problems with mass conservation, negative water depths and artificially enlarged gradients. A method is proposed that allows for the surface elevation to become negative while strict positivity is demanded from the water depth. In this way mass conservation is guaranteed. It is investigated whether this procedure is mass conservative, efficient and robust. To this end a simple finite element discretization of the inviscid shallow water equations (SWE) is derived. The resulting procedure is validated with several one- and two-dimensional analytical solutions for: 1) a one dimensional dam break, 2) flow over a long crested weir, 3) a one-dimensional oscillating water surface in a parabolic basin, 4) the runup of long waves on a beach, 4) a two-dimensional standing wave in a parabolic basin and 5) the spreading of a parabolic flood wave in two dimensions. In addition two laboratory experiments are used for validation. One experiment with solitary wave runup on a conical island and one experiment with a two dimensional dam break. In general the methods performance is good. However in two-dimensions it can be beneficial, in case of small gradients at the wet/dry interface, to use a lumped mass matrix at partially dry elements too. The wetting and drying iteration converges on average in 2 to 3 iteration steps. In some cases bifurcations and mass errors can occur. However mass errors are caused by rounding errors and can be resolved by using double precision. The occurrence of bifurcations is much less frequent in case of calculations in double precision and can be minimized by adjusting the BiCGSTAB settings.","wetting; drying; finite elements; dam break; numerical model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Romeijn, A. (mentor); Vrijling, J.K. (mentor)","2009","The second Delta-committee (September 2008) foresees difficulty in resolving flood safety issues for Rotterdam and Dordrecht if high river runoffs are still running through the New Waterway. A new safety issue, induced by climate changes, lies in the combination of closed sea defensives and relatively high river runoffs at the same time. A research proposal is made towards an Usually Open Occasionally Closed (UOOC) water-system around Rotterdam and Dordrecht. (In Dutch; Afsluitbaar Open Rijnmond, AOR.) This concept diverts high river runoffs during storm situations towards the Southern rural parts of the delta. Four large movable water barriers, located in the main waterways and navigation channels, are required within the UOOC concept. This plan calls for an innovative barrier designs. First of all, the purpose of the movable barriers in combination with their required width is exceptional. Second, barrier designs are outdated and relatively new, light-weighted and maintenance low, materials are not applied. Third, the life-time of a structure is determined by social aspects. The UOOC barriers are located at the edge of urbanized areas and a multi functional structure could enhance benefits and social acceptance. Up till now, hydraulic structures are mainly mono functional structures. Within this thesis the objective is to make an innovative design for one of the UOOC barriers. The design should be ready for the water problems of the 21st century, ready for a 21st century society and constructed by the latest materials. An objective of this thesis is to investigate an innovative barrier design; an ‘open fabric’ movable water barrier (similar to a parachute). This is in contradiction to a ‘closed fabric’ barrier like an inflatable dam. The thesis is a technology assessment of an ‘open fabric’ barrier and designing with synthetic materials to lower the barrier costs. First of all the locations, water-management strategies, corresponding boundary conditions, required dimensions and the costs of the UOOC barriers are discussed. A fabric barrier is suitable for the UOOC concept because of the possible fast construction and low maintenance, which is favourable because the barriers are located in the busiest waterways of the Netherlands. Design issues concerning fabric water barriers and specific ‘open fabric’ barriers are discussed. Different ‘open fabric’ design concepts are generated and discussed. A subdivision can be made in single, mattress, modular and stepped water barriers. A proposed preliminary design is made where a cable-stayed bridge is combined with a single screen attached to the deck over the entire waterway of 210m wide. The screen diverts the hydraulic loads with ropes towards the deck and the abutments. It is stored under the deck and unfolds with the help of cables. It is concluded that the structure is technical and economical feasible, however, a small scale model test is recommended for the closing-system of the barrier and to test its dynamic behaviour. Also an optimization should be made considering the size of the screen and the required strength of the bridge structure. The costs reduction of a movable water barrier for using fabric instead of a steel is for this design estimated well over 34%. It is found that the life-cycle costs of the screen are approximately 40% of the total life-cycle barrier costs. This indicates that optimization towards a small screen is most effective. More detailed research is required to investigate the minimum screen size and the limitations of a ‘bridge+screen’ barrier.","fabric; doek; balgstuw; sinthetic; movable water barrier; water barrier; parachute dam; weir; beweegbare kering; stuw; Dyneema; screen; rope","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Structures","","","",""

(mentor); Zito, R. (mentor); Van Lint, J.W.C. (mentor); Wiggenraad, P.B.L. (mentor)","2009","The goal of this MSc-thesis is to investigate the possibility of calibrating the microscopic traffic simulation model PARAMICS with a phase-based algorithm. The underlying principle is that once the PARAMICS-model is calibrated and validated, its trajectories can be used for the calculation of microscopic traffic emission predictions. This is studied because the ability to correctly predict traffic emissions on a microscopic scale is a valuable instrument with the ever stricter rules regarding traffic emissions. Trajectories obtained from microsimulation traffic models, which are calibrated with standard and commonly used methods, are not suitable for the calculation of microscopic traffic emission predictions. These trajectories are correct, from a transport engineering view, since the durations and average speeds correspond with the reality. However these trajectories are not suitable, from a emission engineering point of view, as on a (sub)microscopic scale the distribution of characteristics like speed, acceleration and deceleration do not correspond with the reality. The main problems with current simulated trajectories for traffic emission predictions on a microscopic scale are invalid durations and magnitudes for the different phases in comparison with recorded trajectories. Invalid trajectories can be explained through the use of fundamentally unsuitable car-following models, incorrect numerical implementations of the car-following models, or an inaccurate estimation of the driver behaviour parameters. The assumption in this research is that the driver behaviour parameters can be estimated properly through a phase-based calibration. The aim is that this will result in valid simulated trajectories. For the determination of these phases in a trajectory a tool is developed by the Institute for Sustainable Systems and Technologies-Transport Systems (ISST-TS) called 'Drive Cycle Splitter'. The splitter is used to split the trajectories into the six different phases. The phase-based calibration is executed on a PARAMICS-model of the 'Adelaide Central Business District' to obtain suitable simulated trajectories, from this model. The traffic conditions that are simulated, are as observed during the morning peak hours. To calibrate the driver behaviour of the PARAMICS model, parameters are adjusted. The initial adjustments of the parameters are based on an analysis of the car-following model of PARAMICS. in this analysis it is determined which and how parameters need to be adjusted to get an improved match between the recorded and simulated trajectories by a literature and mathematical study. The result of this analysis is that the driver behaviour parameters headway, reaction factor and 'acceleration-speed and deceleration-speed profiles' are adjusted. Unfortunately it is not possible to adjust the aggression and the awareness of the vehicles in version 6.0 of PARAMICS. This is unfortunate since the analysis of the car-following model shows that these parameters have substantial influence on the car-following behaviour. During this MSc thesis a methodology is developed to analyse if the adjustments to the driving behaviour parameters had the predicted and desired results. For this methodology it is required to make an initial set of runs with adjusted driver behaviour parameters. These adjustments are based on the analysis of the used car-following model. The results can be compared with FCTTDAS-data (microscopic data from a dataset which is collected with ISST-TS's instrumented vehicle). The comparisons between the series of runs is based on error scores .An error score is calculated on two levels and in two ways. The first order error score is determined by the mean durations and mean magnitudes, while the second order error score is determined by the standard deviations of the of durations and magnitudes. The mean and standard deviation of the duration or magnitude are for each phase indexed with the values from the FCTTDAS-data as basis. With the first scoring method the difference between the indexed values of the FCTTDAS-data and the simulation are summed. To get an idea off the error distribution over the durations and magnitudes there is also a summation made of the squared difference. For all adjusted parameters a sensitivity analysis is made to find their local optimal value. After analysing all individual parameters, simulations with logical combinations of parameter adjustments are performed. Out of all these different series of runs the series with the lowest error score is selected, provided that the adjustments made can still be justified. The best performing series of runs scores significantly better than the default runs, but is still far from the desired outcome. It can be concluded that it was not possible to calibrate the PARAMICS-model to satisfaction within the given boundary conditions of this research. As the conclusion of this thesis is that it is not possible to calibrate the PARAMICS-model to satisfaction, it seems not logical to start a validation. However, the validation is performed to investigate if the errors that occur after the calibration are consistent. If these errors are consistent the approach can be used for relative emission comparisons, even if the absolute emission calculations are not correct due to the fact that trajectories cannot be simulated optimally yet. Secondly, by analysing multiple trajectories of different drivers under further identical conditions, it has been concluded that the influence of the driver of the probe vehicle on the collected data is significant. Finally this results in a set of recommendations for further research and practice. The recommendations are bipartite. The recommendations are divided in recommendations for similar research under improved conditions, and recommendations for additional research on this topic. A key component in both parts is the presence of a adequate dataset for calibration and validation, as this is necessary for the applied method as well as for an improved and more reliable result. For further similar research under improved conditions to investigate the capability of traffic microsimulation models to generate trajectories which are suitable for traffic emission predictions, it is recommendable to use models where all driving behaviour parameters can be adjusted. Secondly a qualitative and quantitative good dataset for calibration and validation purposes is recommended for a reliable outcome. For additional research on this topic, it would be desirable to research which car-following model gives the best results for a phase-based calibration of a traffic microsimulation model, under further similar circumstances. Next to this it is recommendable to derive the true optimal parameter settings of PARAMICS for which the phase-based calibration approach gives the most reliable predictions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Huibregtse, O. (mentor); Stoop, J. (mentor); Schreuder, M. (mentor); De Vries, Y. (mentor)","2009","EVAQ is a traffic model for ex-ante evaluations of evacuations plans. The model is still in development and it is uncertain whether EVAQ will accurately model network performance degeneration. At the same time it can be said that accurate network performance degeneration is very important for evacuations. The research of this thesis identifies that there are phenomena that contribute to network performance degeneration that are not modelled. Two important phenomena that are not included are the flow degeneration as soon as links become congested and the constraints that nodes (intersections) themselves have. Several general ideas were thought up to implement these phenomena. A selection was made on the basis of accuracy. Flow degeneration as soon as a link becomes congested has to do with the link model. The link model determines what number of vehicles can potentially enter and leave the link within a time step. In order to accurately determine these, the framework of Cell Based Queuing is developed. It represents the queue on a link as a set of cells that are related to successive time steps in the past. The theory of kinematic waves is applied which explains that in congestion the traffic states move upstream. Traffic states in the cells can thus be determined using the link outflow from the past. Link inflow is determined by the remaining storage capacity on the link. As an addition to the theory of kinetic waves, the cell at the end of the link is governed by saturation flow rather than kinematic waves. This implicitly applies a capacity drop. A newly developed node model evaluates constraints on the nodes. The new node model is a combination of these constraints and the constraints by link inflow that are already evaluated. The node model exists out of several sub models that are used for different node types. The controlled intersection model deals with combined use of conflict areas and the effect of green phases. The uncontrolled intersection model is based on a capacity formula that determines the capacity for a minor flow based on a major flow. The formula is used in a framework that relates all flows on the intersection. For roundabouts an existing model by Cetur (1986) is used. A similar framework is put in place to relate all flows over the roundabout. The model is adapted to work on lane level rather than link level for turbo roundabouts. For weaving sections, on-ramps and off-ramps a new model is developed that looks at lane specific demand. The new model needs more calculation time but produces more precise capacity estimations. Significant changes are found for the MFD and for queue lengths (spillback). The latter now resembles results from the microscopic model VISSIM quite closely and needs both the new link and node model. The new node and link model are part of the Dynamic Network Loading model of EVAQ. This model has been the centre of most changes performed for EVAQ and can be used in any other Dynamic Traffic Assignment model. Furthermore, the model is theory based and can thus be used for reversed engineering and more extensive analysis of bottlenecks, also for evacuation schemes.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Daamen, W. (mentor); Brookhuis, K.A. (mentor)","2009","According to the Dutch building regulations, called Building Decree, 135 persons per minute should be able to safely escape via a doorway with a width of 1 meter, which is the same as 2.25 persons per second per meter. Since this value has been based on experiments conducted with healthy students, doubts have been raised on the validity of this value. Besides that, the fire department has also raised questions about this value. For these reasons the department of Transport & Planning has conducted a number of experiments for the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning, and the Environment to find out if the requirements in the Building Decree are realistic or should be adjusted. Insight into the individual behaviour in relation to the capacity is useful to gain a better understanding of the differences in capacities. These insights can then be used for predicting the capacities for other conditions [Hoogendoorn and Daamen, 2009] and they may provide an explanation for these differences in capacity. They therefore form a basis for recommendations for the Building Decree. This is used as a starting point for this project. For this project, a selection is made from these experiments. The experiments considered are the experiments with varying doorway widths (50 cm, 85 cm, 100 cm, 110 cm, 165 cm, 220 cm, and 275 cm) and the experiment where a door was connected to the wall fixed at an angle of 90°. For all experiments three stress levels (no stress, slow-whoop alarm, and slow-whoop alarm together with a stroboscope light) have been considered. The doorway width, an open door, and the stress levels are called the experimental variables. The experiments have been conducted with a population that was considered to represent the average population in the Netherlands, which consists for about 50% of adults, 25% of children, and 25% of elderly people. The research objective is to gain insight into pedestrian behaviour in relation to the differences in capacities for different evacuation doorway configurations and for different external conditions that occur during an emergency. These insights will form the basis for recommendations to improve the safety of existing and new buildings during evacuation conditions. Therefore, the following research questions have been formulated: 1. Which aspects concerning pedestrian walking behaviour are expected to influence doorway capacities? 2. What are the effects of these aspects on the capacity? 3. How can the results from the research questions above be used to improve the safety of existing and new buildings during evacuation conditions? In order to answer the first research question, a literature review has been performed. From this, three groups of aspects resulted: microscopic and macroscopic characteristics and self-organisation phenomena. The microscopic characteristics considered are the distance headways and the occupied area. The macroscopic characteristics are the density, flow, and speed. In order to analyse self-organisation, the composition, so which positions do pedestrians occupy with respect to each other, of the population is analysed. To answer the second research question, the actual analysis has been performed. It became clear that especially the time of day at which the experiments have been conducted influences the results. In the morning the participants were much more motivated and still physically fit. The capacity was on average 20% higher for the first three experiments than for the other experiments. During the analysis it became clear that the capacity is also higher when the percentage of children is higher. This is probably because children are much more enthusiastic, resulting in higher speeds. Comparing the different doorway widths, the capacity estimations were between 2.20 and 2.40 P/s/m for all doorway widths, taking 20% lower values for the first three experiments into account. The only experiment with a significantly lower capacity was the experiment with an open door (2.10 P/s/m). The stress level ‘slow-whoop alarm together with a stroboscope light’ is the only stress level which seems to have an effect on the capacity. Only a ‘slow-whoop alarm’ does not have a significant impact on the capacity. Since stress only had an effect during the first three runs of each stress level, which were all runs of the first experiment and the first run of each stress level of the second experiment, pedestrians seem to get used to stress and are not affected by it anymore when they have become used to it. After analysing the microscopic characteristics it became clear that for higher capacities, the distance headways are smaller and the occupied angles between the congested region and the wall where the doorway is located in are also smaller. For considering macroscopic variables, density, flow, and speed just upstream of the doorway have been analysed. The capacity increases when the density, flow, and speed just upstream of the doorway all increase. During the analysis of self-organisation it became clear that the higher the mean number of side-by-sides ‘inside’ the doorway, the higher the capacity. Besides that, the lower the mean time headways. To answer the third research question, the differences in capacity have been analysed in relation to the experimental variables. The conclusion was that most of the experiments resulted in higher capacities than the value in the Building Decree (2.25 P/s/m). However, the experiments have been conducted under ideal circumstances, which means lower values are to be expected in reality. The advice is to find out what the effect of ideal circumstances is on the capacity. Since the effect is unknown the advice for now is to adjust the value for the capacity in the Building Decree to the lowest average value that occurred during the experiments, which is 2.10 P/s/m. Concluding, the research questions have been answered and more insight is gained into pedestrian behaviour during evacuation in relation to doorway capacity. More is known about the relation between capacity and experimental variables and between capacity and microscopic and macroscopic aspects but also self-organisation. With these insights it is possible to predict the capacity of not observed situations, such as other doorway widths that have not been analysed.","pedestrian behaviour; evacuation; doorway capacity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Tranport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

This method was used to grow µc-Si:H p- and i-layers. The effect of p– layer deposition parameters on the short– wavelength response of µc-Si:H solar cells is investigated. We also investigated the influence of deposition parameters on the properties of the µc-Si:H absorber layer deposited at the a-Si:H/ µc-Si:H transition. Parameters such as RF power, silane concentration, and deposition pressure were studied. The effect of these parameters on the material properties of intrinsic µc-Si:H layers and the device performance of single junction µc-Si:H solar cells is presented. The results show that p-layer deposited at 300 seconds with 0.2 sccm diborane flow has the optimum value with respect to transparent and conductive nature. It gave a high FF and Voc when applied in a single junction p-i-n type µc-Si:H solar cells with efficiency of 5.4%. Significant gain in quantum efficiency of the solar cell was observed especially in the short-wavelength region. With the optimized p-layer and at 80 W deposition power, the quantum efficiency increased to about 65% at 400 nm when compared to the obtained value of about 35% with the same optimized p-layer deposited at 60 W. The overall results show that the spectral response is highly sensitive to diborane flow at short wavelength. The result of i-layer sensitivity study reveals µc-Si:H i-layer deposited at a low power but higher pressure has high photoresponse. The structural properties of these layers shows defects which may be related to the grain boundries and material contamination due to stress. This was evident as the film oxidizes immediately it is brought out of the deposition system for FTIR analysis, leaving the substrate with little or no films.","Microcrystaline silicon solar cell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-10-25","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Introductie: Dit rapport is een verslag van het New Information System project bij Viva Telecom te Cochabamba, Bolivia. Nick Klomp, Paul Spiele en Bart-Jan Vink hebben hier in het kader van hun bachelorproject de situatie geanalyseerd, een ontwerp voor een systeem gemaakt en een prototype hiervan geïmplementeerd. In de maanden juli en augustus 2006 hebben zij hiervoor intern bij Viva Telecom gewerkt. Probleemstelling: Aanleiding voor dit project is de waarneming van de planning manager dat de communicatie inefficiënt, asynchroon, onoverzichtelijk en slecht gearchiveerd is. Dit betreft zowel de interne als de externe communicatie. Als mogelijke oplossing hiervoor is een web based systeem geopperd. Opdracht: De opdracht bestond uit het grondig analyseren van de huidige situatie en het opstellen van een ontwerp voor een web based informatie systeem dat de problemen rond de communicatie grotendeels moet kunnen oplossen. Hiervan moest een implementatie gemaakt worden met behulp van ColdFusion. Van tevoren gestelde eisen waren dat het systeem een centrale database moest gebruiken. Tevens moest het systeem makkelijk toegankelijk zijn maar goed beveiligd gezien de bedrijfsinformatie die in dit systeem staat. Analyse: Allereerst is er een analyse gemaakt van de huidige situatie. Naar aanleiding hiervan is een database model gemaakt en structuur van de applicatie opgesteld. Deze zijn voornamelijk gebaseerd op de aanbevelingen die van uit de gebruikers gedaan werden. Implementatie en testen: We hebben het prototype op een incrementele wijze geïmplementeerd. Hierbij hebben het systeem opgedeeld in verschillende componenten en deze apart geprogrammeerd en getest. Vervolgens hebben we de belangrijkste eindgebruiker deze componenten laten testen voor gebruiksgemak. Conclusies: De opdracht is al snel te groot en complex gebleken om in de beperkte tijd die we hadden volledig uit te werken. Hierdoor hebben wij ons in overleg met onze begeleider gericht op het framework en het GSM gedeelte. Het gebruik van ColdFusion componenten heeft een goede scheiding tussen lay-out en functionaliteit opgeleverd, maar ook erg veel tijd gekost. Ook de soms gebrekkige begeleiding heeft onze voortgang belemmerd. Desondanks zijn we tot een werkend prototype van het systeem gekomen. Het door ons ontwikkelde systeem is uiteindelijk in staat om alle gegevens centraal te beheren en door de beveiliging zijn de gegevens ook niet eenvoudig door buitenstaanders te benaderen. Aanbevelingen: Door het tijdsgebrek is het systeem nog niet af. De delen die nog ontwikkeld moeten worden kunnen door de modulaire opbouw van ons systeem echter eenvoudig toegevoegd worden. Het is belangrijk bij dit soort projecten veel overleg met de begeleiders te hebben. Een vaste regelmaat hierin zorgt voor duidelijkheid aan beide kanten.","Web based information system","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

A newer formulation for triad-interactions, called the DCTA, was therefore published in 2006 and this formulation was further developed in this M.Sc. thesis.

(mentor)","2009","One of the main methods of oil and gas transport at sea is performed by pipelines from the well or a platform offhore to another offshore structure or to land. Allseas is a company capable of installing these pipelines under various challenging operating conditions. In today's market, competition and oil and gas availability make it necessary for Allseas to operate at the top of capability. For each project, calculations are performed beforehand to ensure a vessel will be able to deal with the pipeline installation under the specified conditions. When laying pipe in deep water, the longitudinal force required to hold the pipe can go up to 1000 mT. It is found that the calculations performed to predict this force do not always correspond with reality. The process of laying pipe involves transporting pipe over rubber coated rollers to the seabed under high tensions. The contact between the pipe and the rubber coated rollers cause a rolling resistance, which is not yet included in calculations, possibly explaining (part of) the discrepancy between calculations and reality. The goal of this thesis was to determine the amount of rolling resistance caused by the contact between the rollers and the pipe when transporting the pipe to the seabed. A literature study was performed leading to an analytical model based on material properties. Furthermore, a test setup was built where rolling resistance was measured. The results of the analysis and tests have been analyzed and related to actual operating conditions. It showed that the rolling resistance is much less than currently used in practice. From these results recommendations were provided on how to further develop the acquired analytical and material models which are used for calculating rolling resistance. The research was based on Allseas' vessel 'Solitaire', the world's largest pipe lay vessel but the results can be applied to all vessels having rubber coated rollers.","rolling resistance; rubber coated rollers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-02-25","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

The bonding system exists of a mix of crushed stones and 2-component polyurethane. This bonding system creates bonding forces between the stones and an open (porous) structure can be obtained. Elastocoast is developed by Elastogran GmbH, a BASF subsidiary. The response of an elastocoast layer which is placed directly (without a filter layer) on a geotextile and sand foundation is analyzed in this study from several tests executed in the Large Wave Channel in Hannover. The stiffness of an elastocoast beam is determined in a three point bending test with a dynamic load. The indirect tensile splitting strength and compression strength is determined from several cubes. A model in which the dynamic load of a wave impact event is created (a finite element method program, Plaxis v8, is used) and adapted with the results of all analyzed experiments. The resulting behaviour of the elastocoast layer around the wave impact was predicted according to this model for two cases. First, the elastocoast layer is supported on the foundation over the total length of the layer. Secondly, in case of a gap was formed around the wave impact point in the foundation under the elastocoast layer. The amount and type of the used polyurethaan determines the stiffness of an elastocoast layer. The amount of used polyurethaan increases when an elastocoast beam or cube is formed in a closed framework compared to an layer which of formed on a revetment. The resulting maximum pressure during a wave impact event on top of the elastocoast reduces due to the open structure of elastocoast. The maximum stress inside the elastocoast layer increases significantly when a gap in the foundation is formed. Maximum allowed gap width values in combination with different (regular) wave conditions are shown in several figures in order to avoid breaking of the elastocoast layer due to a wave impact event. The eigen frequency of the elastocoast layer is determined from the vibrations of the layer after each wave impact event. High stresses inside the layer can be expected if it is loaded around the eigen frequency. A static schematization (without dynamic effects) as used in the program GOLFKLAP should not be used in order to determine the maximum stress (or minimum required layer thickness in order to avoid breaking of the layer) inside the elastocoast layer (without a filter layer between the geotextile and elastocoast layer). It is recommended to execute more experiments in order to determine the stiffness and tensile flexural strength from an elastocoast beam with different type and amount of used polyurethaan and with different type and grading crushed stones.","elastocoast; wave impact; golfklap; revetment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-09-16","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Baken, N.H.G. (mentor)","2009","Digital Information Networks (DINs) refer to information networks supported by telecommunication infrastructures and terminated by microprocessors. DINs provide a substrate for digital data flows. DINs enable the networking of individuals in the digital economy: an economy that uses digital products and services in any of the production, distribution and consumption stages. The key feature of DINs is that they enable interactive and flexible communication while reducing information transmission costs. This leads economic agents to be more productive within the economic environment that surrounds them. A general recognition that DINs play an important economic role led to an increasing scientific interest in evaluating the economic importance of DINs. However, the announced impacts were not yet backed up with a factual evidence. Providing scientific grounding to this perception is an essential input to the development of telecommunication infrastructures related public and private policies. Recent work has clarified how DINs impacts productivity of economic agents. Most remarkably, it hypothesized that an economic system influenced by DINs (a Digital Economic System (DES)) has the properties associated to a Complex Adaptive System (CAS): 1) it is composed of interacting agents; 2) some of the agents have individual and evolving goals; and 3) it exhibits unexpected emerging properties. Therefore, a DES requires a different type of analysis than the traditional approach used by economists based on evaluating the direct correlation of aggregated data on adoption or availability of DINs with macroeconomic productivity. This MSc thesis donates to the study of DINs’ economic impact by developing and testing a simulation model which can be used in further studies for the following purposes: a) to demonstrate evidences that a DES has the properties of a CAS; b) to demonstrate evidences of low correlation between DINs’ adoption and macroeconomic productivity; c) to investigate new methods to increase the correlation between DINs’ adoption and macroeconomic productivity. This model is designed with the help of Agents Based Modeling (ABM) which suits perfectly for simulating CASs. From a scientific perspective, the novelty of this work lies in the investigation of the economic impact of DINs following a completely novel approach based on CAS, ABM and network theory. From an applied perspective, this work contributes to clarify utopian and dystopian views on DINs’ effects on the economy, particularly aiming for policy makers and organizational managers.","digital; information; network; productivity; agent; complex; systems; emergent; trans-sector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-09-17","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Network Architectures and Services group","","","",""

Aircraft contribute a lot to this. By reducing aircraft drag, fuel consumption and pollution can be decreased dramatically. Aircraft encounter different types of drag, but viscous drag has the highest potential for drag reduction. Viscous drag can be decreased by delaying the transition from laminar to turbulent ow in a boundary layer. Transition delay can be obtained either passive or active, but because most passive techniques cannot handle cross ow instabilities and can deal with specific ow conditions only, active transition delay is much more promising. Active transition delay is most often based on damping natural instability waves, which promote transition, by superimposing them with artificial counter waves.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor); Vrijling, J.K. (mentor); Dreschler, M. (mentor); De Jong, G. (mentor)","2009","De traditionele manier van aanbesteding waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van het gunningscriterium ‘laagste prijs’ zorgt voor een aantal nadelen. Zo leveren aanbieders op deze manier van aanbesteden vaak een oplossing die weliswaar scherp geprijsd is maar hierdoor ook een oplossing die het met de kwaliteit niet zo nauw neemt. Aanbieders die echter wel bereid zijn om betere kwaliteit te leveren krijgen vaak de opdracht niet gegund omdat zij hierdoor niet meer de laagste inschrijvingsprijs hebben. Er wordt met dit gunningscriterium dus gekozen voor de goedkoopste oplossing in plaats van de beste. Het enige alternatief voor gunnen op laagste prijs is het gunningscriterium ‘economisch meest voordelige inschrijving’, afgekort EMVI, zoals staat beschreven in de Europese Richtlijnen (2004/18/EG art. 53 sub. 1). Bij het gunningscriterium ‘laagste prijs’ wordt er gestuurd op prijs. Bij het gunningscriterium EMVI wordt er naast de prijs ook gestuurd op meerwaarde. De meerwaarde wordt vertaald in EMVI-criteria waarop de inschrijvers worden beoordeeld. Voor de beoordeling van de verschillende inschrijvingen bestaat een aantal methodes. Vier bekende voorbeelden daarvan zijn het ratiosysteem, waarbij de totale waarde wordt gedeeld door de prijs; het puntensysteem, waarbij zowel de meerwaarde als de prijs in punten worden uitgedrukt; ontwerpwedstrijd, waarbij met een vast budget wordt gekeken naar de aanbieding met de beste prestatie en het prijscorrectiesysteem, waarbij de monetaire eerwaarde van de inschrijvingsprijs wordt afgetrokken. Deze laatste wordt voornamelijk toegepast bij Rijkswaterstaat. Vanaf de tweede helft van 2005 zijn gegevens beschikbaar gesteld over de opdrachten die gegund zijn op EMVI door RWS. Binnen RWS zijn op beleidsniveau vier beleidsaspecten opgesteld waar, gebruikmakend van het gunningscriterium EMVI, op gestuurd dient te worden. Deze vier beleidsaspecten zijn: publieksgerichtheid, duurzaamheid, veiligheid en projectbeheersing. Kennis over de hoeveelheid aanbestedingen is bekend bij RWS maar wat echter het effect is van het gunningscriterium EMVI is niet bekend. Tijdens dit onderzoek is er bij de afdeling InkoopManagement GWW (IMG) bij Rijkswaterstaat een kwalitatieve evaluatie gedaan naar de mate waarin de gunningsmethode EMVI meerwaarde levert voor wat betreft het realiseren van de vier beleidsaspecten van RWS. Hiermee vormt dit onderzoek tevens een nulmeting naar het gebruik van het gunningscriterium EMVI binnen RWS. Vanuit een literatuuronderzoek en gebruikmakend van een drietal aanbestedingen is een evaluatiemodel opgesteld. Met dit model zijn alle EMVI-aanbestedingen, die betrekking hebben op werken en door RWS in 2008 zijn gedaan, geëvalueerd. Om de verschillende EMVI-criteria te beoordelen dienen ze eerst ondergebracht te worden in een van de vier beleidsaspecten. Dit is door een expertteam gedaan. De criteria die nergens bij pasten zijn ondergebracht bij een vijfde aspect genaamd project specifiek. Tijdens de analyse is als eerste gekeken naar de uitvraag. Uit de analyse kwam naar voren dat gemiddeld gezien het prijsvolume voor 68% mee telt in de uitvragen en de monetaire meerwaarde voor 32%. De 32% meerwaarde is als volgt verdeeld over de vier beleidsaspecten: publieksgerichtheid (31%), duurzaamheid (10%), veiligheid (7%) en projectbeheersing (45%). De resterende deel (7%) is bij het aspect project specifiek ondergebracht. Vervolgens is gekeken naar de aanbiedingen van de aanbieders. De aanbieders zijn eerst verdeeld over drie groepen. (1) bestaat uit de winnende inschrijvers. (2) alle inschrijvers en (3) bestaande uit de inschrijvers met de laagste inschrijving. Hierbij kwam naar voren dat voor de winnaars geldt dat er voor 63% invulling wordt gegeven op de wensen van RWS. Voor de andere twee groepen is dit 47% en 50%. De 63% die overeenkomt met een bedrag van 93 M is als volgt verdeeld over de vier beleidsaspecten: publieksgerichtheid (93%), duurzaamheid (37%), veiligheid (57%) en projectbeheersing (51%). Vervolgens zijn de resultaten van groep 1 (winnaars) naast de resultaten van groep 3 gelegd (laagste inschrijvers). Uit het resultaat hiervan kan worden afgeleid dat indien altijd voor de laagste inschrijving zou worden gekozen dit zou betekenen dat RWS in 2008 3.5 M goedkoper uit zou zijn ten koste van 19.6 M minder meerwaarde (minderwaarde). Tot slot is onderzocht welke aspecten tijdens het aanbestedingsproces nog meer een rol spelen. Daar kwam uit dat bij toename van het aantal inschrijvingen de mate van invulling geven door de markt ook toeneemt en dat bij toename van het aantal EMVI-criteria de mate van invulling geven op de wensen van RWS afneemt.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction Processes","","Bouwprocessen","",""

The high resolution finite volume scheme is applied as the numerical solution method to solve the population balance equation. The dynamic model is validated with experimental results from an adipic acid crystallizer. Gathering the experimental results is a large part of this study. The process inputs of the crystallizer are changed to see the effect on the crystal size distribution (CSD). A change in the temperature seems to have the largest influence on the CSD. But the recirculation rate is the most effective process input to vary. The experimental results were used to validate the model structure. The model results shows that the model can simulate the measured mean crystal size accurately.

(mentor); Derakhshandeh, J. (mentor); Beenakker, C.I.M. (mentor)","2009","In integrated circuits the delay caused by interconnects, their power consumption, production and reliability are challenges to be solved. Using the third dimension for additional layers of transistor has been proposed as a solution to this problem by reducing the length of the interconnects. A problem in 3D integration is the creation of reliable, low resistance and high aspect ratio vertical interconnects. We propose the use of carbon nanotubes (CNT) for this purpose. There exist single-walled (SWNT) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNT), the latter consisting of multiple tubes inside each other. Carbon nanofibres (CNF) are tube-like structures without graphite walls parallel to the tube axis. Diameters are between 0.5-100 nm, while lengths can be up to several mm. CNTs can behave semiconducting or metallic depending on the diameter and chirality. A metallic SWNT with two conductive bands has a quantum resistance of 6.45 k?, and can have ballistic conduction up to several microns. Each wall in a MWNT can contribute in conduction, the amount of conductive bands depends on the amount of walls and diameter. Beside a quantum resistance CNTs have a large quantum capacitance and kinetic inductance, and an electrostatic capacitance. Lastly, CNTs can carry current densities up to 109 J/cm2. Beside being good electrical conductors CNTs have a high thermal conductivity, with values between 1000-6600 W/m·K being reported. They oxidise at temperatures between 600-800 ?C and deform in a vacuum above 2000 ?C. CNTs can be grown on top of substrates using (plasma enhanced) chemical vapour deposition ((PE)CVD) using a catalyst and carbon feedstock. Vertical alignment can either be achieved by Van der Waals interaction between tubes or by a strong electric field during growth. The geometry of CNTs can be controlled by the activation of the catalyst layer and the growth parameters (table 3.1). We derived electrical models for SWNT and MWNT bundles. The quantum capacitance and kinetic inductance can be neglected when a bundle is formed. The resistance against the MFP, diameter and density was calculated. It was found that only SWNT can perform better than bulk Cu or Al when very high density bundles are formed, otherwise it rapidly increases. MWNT have a resistance that is one order of magnitude higher than Cu or Al, which hardly increases for low densities. We designed electrical measurement structures using two and four-point measurement which can be created using four masks. Two cleanroom compatible processes, one with interlayer oxide deposited before and the other after CNT growth, were made. As photo resist patterning was found to have a negative influence on the CNT growth quality an additional lift-off process was created. The four-point structure can also be used for electrical reliability and thermal conductivity measurements. Vertical aligned growth was possible when using a BlackMagic (HF-)PECVD at 500 ?C, in combination with Ni and Pd as catalyst. The same system in APCVD mode resulted in aligned CNFs with Pd at 450-640 ?C, and random CNTs using Co and Fe at 640 ?C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy were used to investigate the grown CNTs. Using the custom equipment at NanoLab vertical CNTs were observed using DC-PECVD at ~ 800 ?C, with both Ni and Fe as catalyst. A recipe was developed for a tube furnace which gave vertical growth at 600 ?C in combination with 1 nm of Fe, and random growth with thicker layers of Fe and Ni. High quality random CNTs were grown using the same recipe at 500 and 600 ?C on Fe patterned with the lift-off process. In all experiments there was 10 nm Ti underneath the catalyst, except for the lift-off which used 1 ?m Ti. The different Raman spectroscopy quality indicators were investigated vs. temperature and the results obtained with SEM and TEM. If was found that the product between ID/IG and FWHM(D) or the ID/IG ratio are good indicators of quality, while only the ID/IG is not sufficient. Thermal CVD samples were of higher quality than the PECVD samples. No growth, due to a too low substrate temperature, was obtained when using the Novellus Concept One PECVD or novel RF assisted CVD at NanoLab. The combination of a 1 ?m Ti layer and Ni also resulted in no growth, due to Ni diffusion into the Ti.","carbon nanotubes; carbon nanofibres; chemical vapour deposition; 3D integration; Raman spectroscopy; circuit model; palladium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-09-08","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

The goal of this thesis is to create an application that determines the location of a mobile sensor node in an indoor environment. A secondary goal is to get practical experience with indoor localization. Previously, in a literature review, we selected two localization algorithms for this purpose. RIPS was selected since it was tested in practice, uses no additional hardware and has a very good accuracy. CAB was selected because it is a range-free localization algorithm and has low computational complexity. RIPS turned out to be too hardware specific and was not portable to the target hardware. CAB failed because of multipath effects. However, by transmitting beacons on multiple frequencies and averaging over the received signal strength, these multipath effects can be mitigated. In this thesis, we tested the effect of multiple frequencies on a simple proximity algorithm. Although the accuracy did not improve as we expected, it did improve the robustness against temporal disturbances. We also tested the effect of multiple frequencies on two different fingerprinting systems, with the fingerprint database constructed in two ways: a small database, where samples are averaged over all channels and a large database, where samples are averaged per channel. We show that the small database provides the best accuracy with a mean localization error of 2.19 meters.","localization; indoor; wireless; sensor; networks; fingerprinting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-09-03","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Van Heteren, S. (mentor); Van Gelder, P.H.A.J.M. (mentor); Storms, J.E.A. (mentor); Stive, M.J.F. (mentor)","2009","After a storm surge in November 2007, older storm surge deposits were discovered in the eroded dunes near Heemskerk, the Netherlands. These deposits undulate in height with a maximum elevation of over 6 m above mean sea level. Luminescence dating suggests that the layers were deposited by either the 1775 or the 1776 storm surge. The aim of this thesis is to model the 1775 storm surge and its capability to reach the height of NAP + 6.5 m at which the deposits have been discovered. Secondary objectives are (a) to give an estimation of the probability of exceedance of the 1775 storm surge and (b) to compare the effects of this storm surge on a open dune front (historical situation) and a closed dune front (present situation). A modelling framework has been set up to transform the available historical data into boundary conditions for the process-based model XBeach. A 1D probabilistic approach resulted in distributions for the 2% exceedance height for the storm surge level including set-up and wave run-up for six characteristic profiles. The distributions do not give reason to reject the hypothesis that, during the 1775 storm surge, the water level has reached the level of NAP + 6.5 m. Based on the existing exceedance line for IJmuiden, the probability of exceedance of the 1775 storm surge is estimated to be 3/10000. This is close to the existing Dutch design criteria for primary sea defences. A comparison of several 2DH simulations with a historical dune topography containing an open dune front and the same boundary conditions with a present dune topography containing a closed dune front, give the following results. With the open dune front, storm surges can easily enter the dune valleys behind the first dune row, but the water is almost always stopped by the second dune row. Wave energy dissipates quickly in the dune area. The present situation with a closed dune front gives high erosion rates along the entire dune front, while the historical situation with an open dune front gives more variation in erosion and deposition rates. Erosion rates are generally higher in the present situation with the closed dune front.","storm surge; deposits; historical storm; 1775; dunes; dune overwash; dune breaching; dune erosion; process-based modelling; xbeach; statistics; probabilistic modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Jäger, K. (mentor)","2009","Recently photovoltaic techniques have drawn extensive attention both in research and industry. Thin film silicon solar cells are becoming more promising due to their low material and energy consumption, when compared to wafer-based crystalline silicon solar cells. However, the efficiency of thin film solar cells is still relative low. Light trapping is one of the approaches through which the efficiency can be considerably improved. To achieve light trapping in the thin film silicon solar cells, rough surfaces presented on transparent conductive oxide (TCO) are included, either on top of or at the bottom of solar cells. The rough surface enables strong light scattering which enhances the absorption in the thin absorptive layers. In this way the short circuit current can be improved as well as the efficiency. In this thesis, we investigated three types of TCOs, including fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO), aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) and boron doped zinc oxide (BZO). Light scattering properties of these TCOs and their surface morphologies were studied. Morphological and optical measurements were carried out to determine surface root-mean-square (rms) roughness, haze and angular distribution functions (ADFs). The results showed that with an increased surface rms roughness, an enhancement in light scattering was observed. This effect becomes more pronounced especially when the rms roughness is comparable to the shorter wavelength, i.e. in ultraviolet/visible region. However, it is found that rms roughness could not completely describe the scattering behaviors, the lateral features are also required. In particular, pyramidal structures are more likely to scatter light into angles close to the surface normal, while crater-like surface structures are more favorable into angles out of the incident light direction. With a better theoretical understanding of the scattering behaviors, one can propose optimized surface structures for future manufacturing process.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Van Halem, D. (mentor); Petrusevski, B. (mentor); Olsthoorn, T.N. (mentor)","2009","High concentrations of arsenic in drinking water form a major threat for public health in more than 70 countries worldwide. The situation is Bangladesh is seen as the worst incidence of arsenic poisoning: it is believed that 30 million people in Bangladesh are exposed to an arsenic concentration exceeding 50 ?g/L. Recently subsurface treatment as a possibility for arsenic removal for drinking water supply on community scale in rural Bangladesh has been recognized. The application of this subsurface treatment technique for arsenic removal is seen as very promising, since it has many advantages: it is a residue free, low-cost technology and no hazardous chemicals or expensive filter media are required. The technique, already applied for decades in Europe for subsurface iron removal, involves the injection of aerated water into an anoxic aquifer, where consequently ferrous iron is oxidized by the injected oxygen. Subsequently, the flow is reversed and a multiple of the injected volume can be extracted with lowered iron concentrations, which makes the technology successful. Efficiency ratios (V/Vi) of extracted water (V) over injected water (Vi) are typically increasing over the successive cycles and may range from 3 to 30. The freshly formed ferric oxides are potentially effective adsorbents for trace elements like arsenic. Yet, there is a lack of insight in both (i) the fundamental knowledge of the responsible mechanisms causing the (increasing) sorption of iron and arsenic, and (ii) the operational factors through which the removal efficiency can be optimized. The primary goal of this study is to gain a better understanding of these dominant mechanisms and the observed increasing efficiency, in order to optimize the operation of this technology in the field.","arsenic; drinking water; Bangladesh","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

It is believed that drought played an important role in decreasing the stability of the dike, finally leading to failure. In the reported MSc project the situation during drought is simulated with the help of finite element method programs Plaxis and PlaxFlow in order to get more insight into the conditions that caused the dike to fail. First a forensic analysis based on pictures taken directly after the breach is presented, followed by information about relevant failure cases. The interpretation of the soil investigation performed by GeoDelft after the failure is reviewed subsequently. The field data (Borings and Cone Penetration Tests) are used to define the stratification of the soil. The laboratory data (Triaxial, Simple Shear and Ko-CRS tests) are utilised to determine the soil parameters. With this information a finite element model is constructed in Plaxis. The material model used to simulate the different soil types is the Hardening Soil model. In Plaxis and PlaxFlow 3 different calculation phases are defined. The first 2 have as a purpose to simulate the soil history until the start of drought since this is an important aspect in the further behaviour of soil during drought itself. The third one is the simulated drought period. All the groundwater flow related aspects (groundwater head, excess pore pressures etc.) are calculated by PlaxFlow while the related deformation and stability analyses are done by Plaxis. A parametric study of the groundwater flow by PlaxFlow is performed leading to the conclusion that the upper layer of the soil consisting of Holland peat has to be separated into 2 parts along the middle of the slope of the dike in order to take the different degrees of saturation of the unsaturated soil above the groundwater table, that affect the unsaturated soil weight, into account. Finally 9 different models are composed with varying strengths and permeabilities in order to take into consideration the effect of these parameters. The groundwater flow results are realistic. However the deformation results show irregular unexplainable patterns which are inconsistent with some of the observed data of the actual failure. Furthermore the safety factors are calculated for the end of phase 2 (before drought) and phase 3 (after drought). These results are also very inconsistent and should be discarded.","peat dikes; drought; failure; simple shear; Plaxis; hardening soil model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2009","This thesis presents the results of the undertaken investigation on industrial capacitance sensor interface for measuring small displacements, with focus on immunity to external interference, especially when using long cables. Several principles have been investigated and comparison has been made, followed by the proposed measurement principle, which can be implemented without electrical contact with the target. The range of measurement is up to 10 pF. Such sensor interface is designed to tolerate up to a 10-meter cable, and more importantly, due to the special measurement principle, such system is designed to have an improved immunity to external interferences. There are several advantages of such a system, compared with existing capacitive sensor interfaces: (i) the special sensor configuration minimizes external interference (mostly electromagnetic interference); (ii) the measurement principle makes the front-end amplifier less sensitive to non-idealities like offset; (iii) a switch-capacitor type active shielding technique reduces the effect of cable capacitance. The results so far show that the dynamic range of such interface can reach more than 12 bits, with a measurement time less than 100 us.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-09-08","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""
