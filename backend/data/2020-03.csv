On one hand, the mechanical loads include, for example, the self-weight of the construction work, the action from normal use by person, furniture and movable objects, vehicles, snow, wind, execution, etc. On the other hand, when the deformation of a structure is restrained, imposed deformation occurs. The sources of deformation can be various, not only environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity changes, but also chemical or physical actions, such as sulphate ingress or creep. If the shortening of a structure is restrained, the structure will be subjected to imposed deformation which results in tensile stress. Since the tensile strength of concrete is relatively low, concrete structures, such as tunnels, bridges and pavement roads, always suffer a high risk of cracking. Even if the concrete structure is prestressed, the tensile stress resulting from imposed deformation would consume the compressive stress in concrete and raise the risk of cracking. If the crack width exceeds the limit, leakage, corrosion and even structural failure may happen. According to the schematized 푁 - 휀 diagram of reinforced concrete, the development of cracking caused by imposed deformation and mechanical load are different. Suppose the cracking is caused by imposed deformation, there is a developing stage for cracking. It means the cracks caused by imposed deformation could be either fully or not fully developed. However, suppose the cracking is caused by mechanical loads, the cracks could only be fully developed. The stiffness of fully or not fully cracked members are different. The stress resulting from imposed deformation in a structure is related to the stiffness of the structure. Therefore, cracking has significant impact on the magnitude of stress resulting from imposed deformation. Therefore, when a structure is subjected to imposed deformation and mechanical load together, it is necessary to take the impact of cracking into account during structure design. The combination of imposed deformation and mechanic loads is referred to as combined actions. It is common to use FEM software to analyze the stress resulting from the combined actions during structure design when cracking has to be taken into account. However, FEM analysis only is not enough. It is also necessary to check the results calculated by FEM software to avoid mistakes, for example a wrong input.<br/> There is a project called 'Approach Ring South, Groningen'. In the project, widened deck KW03.01 is subjected to a combination of imposed deformation and prestressing force. FEM software called SCIA is used to calculate the prestress consumption in the widened deck KW03.01. According to the data file of the project, 41% in maximum of the compressive stress resulting from prestressing is consumed when the structure is subjected to combined actions, which is much more than the engineering experience. As a result, a simple approach is required to check whether the prestress consumption in widened deck KW03.01 suits the expectation or not, where the prestress consumption is calculated by FEM software.","Comnined Actions; Concrete Deck; Imposed Deformation; Cracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","'Ring South Approach, Groningen'",""

Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) based power systems have been touted as one of the promising technologies of extracting thermal energy from waste-heat and renewable sources such as geothermal, solar radiation and biomass, to name a few. Use of an organic fluid makes it theoretically possible to design a compact, high volumetric flow turbine that can extract energy from sources with low temperature head. However, realization of this turbine becomes challenging because of their unsteady nature which stems from high expansion ratio across the cascade and low speed of sound in organic fluids. The expansion of fluid in these turbines occur in the dense gas supersonic regime where ideal gas assumptions do not hold and the flow is characterized by shock waves and expansion fans. The success of ORC systems thus depends on how well these effects are modeled into the design stage. Stator vanes have a major contribution to the stage losses in these high-expansion low reaction turbines. In current literature, there exists no co-relation that takes into account dense gas effects for the preliminary design of these stator vanes. Thus the objective of this thesis is to study the trend of stator losses with the variation of geometric de- sign variables and inlet conditions, subsequently to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the performance of the blade and finally to propose new design correlations for the organic fluid Toluene. To achieve this objec- tive, the stator design variables affecting 2D loss mechanisms are identified and a design space is constrained. It was hypothesized that the total losses are minimum for an optimum vane design corresponding to a unique value of post-expansion ratio. A semi-automated analysis framework was made, that assessed the fluid dy- namic performance of vanes with varying post-expansion ratio, which upon analysis backed the hypothesis successfully. Further, the trend behavior of this optimum post-expansion ratio with design variables such as stator blade angle, total-static expansion ratio, nozzle solidity and fluid non-ideality is investigated and val- ues of post-expansion ratio corresponding to optimum design vanes are obtained. These discrete optimum points are interpolated to obtain a continuous second order function which is the proposed co-relation that can be used for the preliminary design of a stator vane in an ORC turbine.","Machine-learning; non-ideal compressible fluid dynamics; Axial stator; Turbomachinery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

These picking workstations facilitate efficient picking; however, current release strategies do not take similarity between orders into account, while this could potentially lead to better capacity utilisation. A meta-heuristic approach has been developed in literature to exploit this similarity, thereby using less stock retrievals to fulfill customer orders. However, its capabilities are limited. In this thesis, the meta-heuristic is extended to deal with multiple pick stations and a stock-multiplicity constraint. The algorithm consists of multiple steps. First, a random-start greedy algorithm generates an initial solution for a large set of orders. However, this initial solution will be of poor quality in general. As the computation cost scales exponentially with the order set size, heuristically optimising the entire order set is infeasible in practice. Secondly, the initial order sequence is split into subsets of equal length, each of which will be picked by a separate picking workstation. The picking workstations are then sequentially optimised using the meta-heuristic approach assuming an infinite stock. Afterwards, a check on the stock-multiplicity constraint is conducted, i.e. it is checked if the warehouse is capable of supplying all picking stations simultaneously. If an order line violates this constraint, the order is selected and put in a random position of the order completion sequence of that picking station. It was found that this method is capable of avoiding violations of the stock-multiplicity constraints, although it was also found that this constraint will hardly be violated in a realistic goods-to-person warehouse setting, i.e. with a large number of orders, picking stations, and order lines per order. Furthermore, our simulations show that the algorithm is capable of significantly reducing the number of stock retrievals per picking workstation.","Meta-heuristic; goods-to-person; multiple picking stations; threshold acceptance; stock multiplicity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-03-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Stricter regulations and ambitious targets have been framed to effectively curtail the rise in emissions due to this surge in aviation. A multi-fuel blended wing body aircraft is being developed in TUDelft, with the goal of drastically reducing aircraft emissions. To this end, a dual-combustor configuration, which operates with a main combustion chamber and an inter-turbine burner has been proposed. The exhaust gas from the main combustion chamber passes through the high pressure turbine and then proceeds to the inter-turbine burner. It is important to accurately model the evolution of exhaust gas species, from the main combustion chamber through the high-pressure turbine, since this constitutes the species concentration at the inlet of the inter-turbine burner. This, in turn, can have impacts on its performance too. Therefore, this thesis aims to do a detailed parametric analysis to study the individual impact of the operating conditions on the chemical kinetics after the main combustor. The operating temperature has been identified as the most significant parameter that would have drastic impacts on the way emissions evolve after the combustor. The predictions of Turbine Inlet Temperatures for future aircraft have shown only a steady increase. Although the assumption of frozen chemistry after the combustor may have been valid for older engines, the same does not hold as good for futuristic configurations. Newer and different engine architectures like the hybrid engine, which are designed to operate on high cycle temperatures and pressures, cannot ignore the consequence of change in emissions after the combustor in order to retain accuracy in estimations.","Chemical Reactor Network; High Pressure Turbine; NOx; CO Emissions; Emissions; Chemical Reaction Mechanism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Suriname therefore wants to engage in developments in the shallow areas (0 - 30 m) offshore through their local oil company Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname N.V. The expected discoveries are marginal and the soil consists of extremely low strength clays. This and the local lack of experience regarding the offshore industry represent the main challenges for offshore developments in Suriname. The objective of this thesis is to assess whether offshore developments in this basin are technically and economically feasible, assuming that the discoveries are marginal. Because a reservoir is yet to be discovered, the reservoir characteristics (location, size, etc.) are unclear. Hence, the important figures are currently only best estimates. The reservoir is estimated to possess 30 million barrels (30 mmbbl) recoverable reserves.In order to investigate possible development approaches, marginal field developments across the world were looked into. Based on this, it appears that mostly low cost, minimum facilities platforms are used for development of marginal fields across the world. By using similar approaches and taking into account the local (social and economic) aspects which are significant to this project, possible development scenarios for a field offshore Suriname are formed. The proposed scenarios are the all-land (treatment on land, 9 mbbl/day), the sea-land (treatment at sea, 9 mbbl/day) and the minimal production and logistics scenario (treatment on land, minimal CAPEX, 3 mbbl/day). These scenarios consist of on- and offshore facilities of which the offshore platform is further assessed to investigate its technical feasibility. In order to determine the most suitable platform for each scenario a multicriteria analysis is performed. The technical feasibility of the selected platforms is analysed by performing a structural analysis. For the all-land scenario the proposed platform is a wellhead platform (WHP), consisting of 4 conductors which also function as the support structure (4-conductors support structure (4-CSS)). For the sea-land scenario a jacket with an adjacent WHP is proposed. For the minimal scenario the proposed platform is a freestanding conductor. Because of the shallow water depth the wave loads are calculated using the 5th order Stokes waves. The environmental loads and the permanent &amp; variable loads on the platforms are calculated and the structural integrity is assessed by performing ultimate limit state (ULS) strength checks, which are specified in ISO 19902. The foundation of the platforms is assessed by looking into the axial and lateral soil resistance. The checks are only performed for a static load case. By using WHPs the overall weight of the platform is limited (50 tons for 4-CSS and 15 tons for freestanding conductor). The weight of the jacket is kept relatively low by situating the well bay on an adjacent WHP. When only considering a static load, the jacket, 4-CSS and freestanding conductor are all technically feasible in all water depths (0 – 30 m). The economic feasibility is assessed by evaluating the total costs of each of the proposed scenarios. The main cost components are the drilling &amp; exploration, the offshore and onshore facilities, storage, transport and OPEX. Based on analysis it appears that the minimal development scenario is ultimately the most attractive scenario for development of a 30 mmbbl reservoir. This scenario includes a freestanding conductor as offshore platform with 1 well in production. The raw crude is transported to the TLF refinery via tanker, where facilities are built for primary treatment. The initial investments for this scenario are about 120 MM€ lower than for the all-land and sea-land scenario while the net profit (NPV) over the field life span is about 65 MM€ less. The OPEX and price per barrel can vary significantly. The net profit is estimated with a market sales price of 35 €/bbl and an OPEX of 7.20 €/bbl. The low production rate indicates a longer field life span for the minimal development scenario, 30 years compared to 12 for the other scenarios. By combining the current onshore production with the offshore production, the feed to the refinery can be kept steady and no expansion of the refinery will be required. Because of the low initial costs and the guaranteed longer steady feed to the refinery, the minimal development scenario is proposed as the best development scenario for a marginal field offshore Suriname.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); de Vos, P. (mentor); Mestemaker, BTW (mentor); Infante Ferreira, C.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The maritime sector is important for the facilitation and growth of global trade. Currently, about 90% of the goods are transported by ships and as a result, the number of ships has risen, increasing the emissions related to shipping. Pollution caused by exhaust gas, especially the sulphur oxide emission, from marine diesel engines has become a global concern in recent years. Therefore, the International Maritime Organisation limited marine fuel sulphur content in both Emission Control Areas to 0.1%w/w since 2015 and globally to 0.5%w/w since January 1st , 2020. It is anticipated, that the newly implemented IMO regulations will help to mitigate negative impact of ship emissions on public health and the environment in the coastal areas. The wet scrubber system is a reliable technology for flue gas desulphurisation in marine applications and can achieve a sulphur dioxide removal efficiency of 98%. The operating costs are low, however the capital cost for installation are high and a scrubber system requires space for installation while maintaining ship’s stability. Wet scrubber systems operating in a closed loop and using caustic soda may operate without discharge to the sea and thus are allowed to operate in ports. The use of caustic soda also makes it possible to use the scrubber in areas with low seawater alkalinity. However, scrubber systems generally operate at 100%, even when the engine operates at lowload. This results in an increase of the fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. Themain objectives of this research are to examine the influence of water evaporation on the sulphur dioxide removal efficiency and the (response of the scrubber) effect of dynamic loads on the scrubber efficiency. A dynamic model of a closed loop wet scrubber operating with fresh water and caustic soda also known as sodium hydroxide was created and verified. The scrubber model consists of three resistance elements, namely the venturi scrubber, the tower scrubber with a packed bed and the demister and two volume elements (lower and upper) to connect the resistance elements. The absorption of SO2 is mainly taking place in the packed bed and the two phase flow of exhaust gas and scrubbing liquid was modelled in this section. The Nerst film theory was used and extended to a two film theory in which the exhaust gas and scrubbing liquid phases come into contact through an interface and exchange both heat and mass. The gas flow in the packed bed could be modelled with a combination of resistance and volume elements as this phase is compressible. The liquid flow and liquid film thickness in the packed bed were modelled based on the conservation of mass and the liquid holdup theory developed by Billet and Schultes. A feedback control system controls the scrubbing liquid flow based on the sulphur dioxide to carbon dioxide ratio. The system includes a time constant to account for the inertia of the scrubber’s pump and pipe system. The verified model was integrated with engine data and used to run several static and dynamic simulations. The inclusion of evaporation in the packed bed leads to an increase of the scrubber efficiency in all engine loads. The extra vapour added dilutes the gas phase and reduces the mass fraction of sulphur dioxide. When evaporation is included in the analysis, the sulphur dioxide to carbon dioxide ratio leaving the scrubber is 1.88, equal to a fuel sulphur content of 0.043% on a mass base (from 3.5% in the fuel) for 100% engine load. When evaporation is not included in the analysis the previous values are 2.3 and 0.053% respectively. To increase the precision concerning the amount of water that evaporates, a higher discretisation of the packed bed is required. High engine load fluctuations and/or high input frequencies lead to overshoots and higher liquid supply, in order to keep the scrubber system efficient. In the transition from 25% MCR to 100% MCR the liquid supply exceeds the nominal value of 94 kilogram per second by by 5.3 kilogram per second (or by 5.6%). In the transition between 75%MCR to 100%MCR, for the frequency of 50 seconds the liquid supply is equal to 92.9 kilogramper second. Increasing the input frequency 5 times results in an increase of the liquid supply to 96.1 kilogram per second. The sulphur dioxide to carbon dioxide ratio leaving the scrubber was always below the ECA sulphur limit and was fluctuating around the set point, but most of the time below it. A combination of feed forward and feedback and/or a more advanced control may result in a more stable control of the scrubber, but this has to be investigated. The model functions, but more research is required for the venturi and the demister models, but also for the packed bed model. In the venturi a three phase flow is required and in the demister an analytical and dimensional analysis is required. Also, the packed bed model needs to be further developed to include the condensation effect and a more precise approach for the liquid phase. Further research can be done on the integration of the model with a diesel engine and SCR model. Also, seawater can be examined as a scrubbing liquid as this may reduce the operational costs of the scrubber. Finally, because space requirements of the scrubber are high, a structured packed bed could be an alternative to the dumped and reduce the space occupied by the wet scrubber.","wet scrubber; SOx reduction; Dynamic modelling; System integration; Evaporation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

The goal of this study is to investigate the use of EMD in structured tuning of a motion cueing algorithm (the classical washout algorithm (CWA)) for CH-47 simulation, and to identify whether the resulting filter is rated better, according to the motion fidelity rating (MFR), than manually tuned filters.

The CH-47 EMD filter is also compared to an EMD motion filter, tuned for the AH-64 Apache in a previous experiment, in order to test whether a single EMD filter can or cannot be used for different vehicles. In this experiment, three pilots participated, with experience in flying the CH-47 helicopter. The results of this experiment show a preference for the vehicle-specific, EMD-based approach, based on which it can be said that EMD is preferred, by the participating pilots, over current, manual tuning methods.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

A set containing both static and dynamic Airport Demand Management Strategies was defined, incorporating different demand management measures, such as ground delay and cancellations. A case study was performed to demonstrate that the Evaluation Framework is capable of assessing these Airport Demand Management Strategies. The case study addresses the arrival scheduling of predetermined flight plans at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, combined with bad weather – and very bad weather scenarios. The case study has confirmed that different Airport Demand Management Strategies can contribute to airports keeping delays at acceptable levels and minimising cancellations during weather-based capacity shortfalls.","Airport Demand Management Strategies; Air Traffic Management; Airport; Aircraft Delay; Aircraft Cancellations; Evaluation Framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The second group is mainly focus on investigating the stability of protective layer. What is more, low volume of electrolyte was used during experiment considering the real environment of coating’s application. The research results showed that: (1) Under low volume electrolyte of 5ml aqueous 0.1M NaCl solution, the protective layer is successfully formed; (2) Li2CO3-loaded coating shows better corrosion inhibition performance compared to the non-inhibiting coating; (3) AA2198-T8 aluminum alloy containing lithium in its element composition further contributes to the formation of protective layer; (4) In general, proprietary industrial Li2CO3-loaded coating XP420 are more stable when exposed to the corrosion condition.","Coating technology; Corrosion; Electro-chemical Characterization; Lithium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Geodetic measurements of the surface can help us improve our knowledge of the subsurface; this process is called geomechanical inversion. Improved knowledge on the subsurface is needed for example to improve deformation predictions and to safeguard subsurface and surface infrastructure. Related works in this domain use derivatives of geodetic measurements as input for their inversion methodologies, but not the measurements themselves. Performing geomechanical inversion with derivatives of geodetic measurements introduces correlations in the covariance matrix of the data, making error propagation into the geomechanical estimates more complex. Defining a direct relationship between measurements and geomechanical estimates and subsequently inverting this relationship, makes the error propagation less complex. This thesis presents a new methodology that can be used to estimate reservoir geomechanical parameters through direct inversion using measurements from optical leveling campaigns. In the context of this thesis, a direct inversion is an inversion of a linear relationship between data and measurements. In this thesis, we propose and test a workflow for the estimation of a simplified set of geomechanical parameters. Part of the workflow is an extensive testing procedure of the geodetic data. A Geertsma nucleus-of-strain model is used to express a source parameter term in function of optical leveling measurements. This source parameter term is a lumped term and consists of a volume term, a pressure term, and several elastic rock parameter terms. This system is inverted using a Tikhonov regularization with a spatial penalty term. The methodology is applied to optical leveling data from a case study (the Norg and Roden gas fields in the northern Netherlands) and shows promising results. The RMS between modeled and measured subsidence for the most promising parameterization is 3.0 mm. The proposed methodology leads to geomechanical estimates with formal quality description, that could improve geomechanical models and subsequently leads to a better understanding of the subsurface and better subsidence predictions. The geomechanical parameter that is estimated is lumped and without additional information, it is impossible to differentiate between individual compaction parameter terms. Feeding the problem more information might also relax the need for regularization but can lead to the introduction of bias. We believe that the framework proposed in this work can be a good starting point for further research that uses geodetic measurements directly as input for a geomechanical inversion.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-03-30","","","","","",""

All existing designs of re-entry vehicles are either ballistic or low L/D vehicles. In the future, the aim is to develop a high L/D vehicle, because such vehicles experience lower g-loads, making the flight comfortable for manned flights. The development of these vehicles can be useful for both, space (for example, space tourism) and military applications (for example, long-range missiles). Thermal protection system (TPS) is deemed critical to the RLV development, as high L/D vehicles are expected to experience higher thermal loads. Existing TPS solutions are not suitable for this purpose. Therefore, arises the need to find reusable TPS solutions that can sustain the desired thermal loads. Flight testing is a crucial step for developing any hypersonic system, this applies to the TPS design as well. This study aims to investigate the influence of TPS on designing the mission and vehicle for a test flight. <br/>From the various developed and proposed TPS designs in literature, a TPS solution is selected, to meet the requirements identified for future RLVs. The solution is an active cooling concept (cooled metallic TPS), named Enhanced radiation cooling, that uses water as a coolant. Based on a preliminary design investigation, suitable materials are selected and the thickness of the layer is determined. The performance of the proposed TPS design, i.e., the thermal load-bearing ability, is assessed using a transient thermal analysis tool developed for this purpose. The outcome of this analysis proves that the proposed design does not meet the thermal load requirements identified in this study. Nonetheless, the concept shows substantial improvement in performance, it can sustain almost double the heat flux as compared to an uncooled system.<br/>To meet the heat flux requirements, a few modifications in the design are proposed and analysed. These modifications increase the complexity of the system and have other adverse consequences that must be addressed. However, thermal analysis proves that the heat flux requirements, identified at the start of this study, are satisfied. A sensitivity analysis of this modified cooling system shows that the performance of the design is not influenced by material uncertainties. Additionally, the design is found to be robust under varying mission and design parameters, within reasonable bounds.

To achieve optimal crop yield, irrigation is applied to replace water losses due to evapotranspiration (ET). Information on ET should be applied to optimize water allocations and water use. In this study, the correlation between ET and yield will be investigated on field-scale level to assess the potential of high resolution ET products as a tool to detect yield variation. The variability of crop yield and transpiration are caused by the variability in the topography, groundwater and soil properties. <br/>Agricultural practices and field-scale water management demand high resolution (in meters) and high temporal resolution (daily to sub-daily) remote sensing products. With the arrival of new satellite platforms, such as Sentinel-2, the aforementioned remote sensing data can be improved significantly in spatial and temporal resolution. In order to compare the functionality of different remote sensing products, an assessment is executed for two satellite derived vegetation indices: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI), and two satellite derived evaporation products: WaPOR (Water Productivity through Open access of Remotely sensed derived data) and a newly developed evaporation algorithm from VanderSat. Within this research, the focus lies on assessing which dataset is able to observe the spatial difference and temporal patterns on field-scale level. Using a large sugarcane plantation in Xinavane, Mozambique, as a case study, we demonstrate how the spatial variability of the remote sensing results are correlated to the sugarcane yield. To assist irrigated agriculture we demonstrate that a high resolution evaporation product is needed to incorporate spatial variability in evaporation estimates. The analysis shows that the high resolution satellite derived vegetation indices are related to the spatial variability of yield. Our results indicate that NDWI has a strong positive correlation of 0.73 with yield, but NDVI has only 0.64. The actual evapotranspiration estimates have a moderately positive correlation with yield of 0.5 for WaPOR and 0.57 for VanderSat. Evaporation estimates should be related to yield to control irrigation properly. WaPOR and VanderSat use NDVI as a input for crop stress, these existing evaporation algorithms should incorporate high resolution spatial imagery as NDWI instead of NDVI to assist irrigation adequately. In order to use the satellite derived evaporation algorithms for agricultural practices and field-scale water management, future research should be focus on improving the relation between satellite derived evaporation algorithms and yield.","evapotranspiration; NDVI; NDWI; irrigation; WaPOR; satellite remote sensing; sugarcane; spatial variability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","-25.0429, 32.781"

(mentor); Esposito, R. (mentor); Houben, L.J.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Gas-induced earthquakes are a major problem in the north of the Netherlands due to many unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings being located in this area. To improve the seismic performance of the URM buildings, existing structures must be retrofitted and if the aesthetic of the building is important, the implemented retrofitting technique must not alter the appearance of the property. An experimental campaign was conducted at Delft University of Technology to investigate whether bed joint reinforcement (BJR) can be used for seismic retrofitting of URM walls. In this thesis, the influence of BJR, diagonal anchors and reinforcement layout on the in-plane seismic behavior of the retrofitted wall is studied. To achieve this goal several nonlinear static analyses using DIANA software were performed. First, the case experimentally tested is adopted as a benchmark and a validation of the numerical model is performed. Afterwards, the validated numerical model is adopted to perform a parametric study considering different reinforcement layouts. The numerical study showed that BJR was able to improve the seismic performance of the retrofitted wall. The Peak-load was increased slightly (13%) in the retrofitted wall compared with the URM wall. BJR acts in tension to restrains the crack opening so, the maximum crack width is another affected factor: a difference of -110% in maximum crack width was observed after retrofitting. Finally, the crack pattern and failure mechanism of the structure was changed due to BJR. The sensitivity analysis showed that the results were sensitive to variation in tensile fracture energy and modulus of elasticity, while tensile strength, compressive strength, and compressive fracture energy were the other variations that did not affect the results considerably. According to an extensive parametric study, it was concluded that double BJR was slightly more effective than single BJR. By applying only 4 layers of double BJR almost the same peak-load and maximum crack width were obtained comparing the results of the retrofitted wall with the original layout (with 12 BJR layers). The location of the BJR, however, was the governing concern. In the URM wall cracks mostly developed diagonally from the window corners and by applying horizontal bars below and above the window opening, the diagonal cracks were restricted and failure modes of the wall changed. The absence of single BJR next to the opening (in piers) might lead to the shear mechanism of the piers. The number of BJR is a function of the opening’s dimension. According to a proposed reinforcement layout it is believed that the mentioned 4 layers of double BJR (above and below the opening) and 3 layers of single BJR (next to the opening) were a wise choice for retrofitting of the wall. Furthermore, diagonal anchors could be ignored as they did not affect the performance of the wall. Conservatively, a layer of double BJR far above and below the window level could be applied. In this way reinforcement was decreased by 30%, however, the results were comparable with the retrofitted wall with original reinforcement layout.","Unreinforced masonry wall; Seismic retrofitting with bed joint reinforcement; Seismic resilience of masonry wall; Nonlinear FEM; Macro-modeling; Smeared cracking model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The work of aircraft designers, certifying agencies, aircraft operators, and air traffic controllers relies on aircraft performance models. Current aircraft performance models are based on performance data of brand-new aircraft, independent of airline configuration and customizations. Nonetheless, over time aircraft suffer structure, engine and aerodynamic deterioration, as well as maintenance actions. These factors, which vary with tail number, make aircraft performance deviate from the theoretical and create the need for aircraft performance monitoring, and ultimately for aircraft performance tailoring. This thesis proposes two novel approaches to develop up-to-date, tail-specific performance models. These approaches are based on the use of historical flight data, namely Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data, and machine-learning techniques. First, a methodology is designed to calibrate Base of Aircraft DAta (BADA), a widely consolidated physics-based performance model. As a result, more accurate performance models are generated, maintaining the same applicability over the entire flight envelope and during all phases of flight as BADA nominal models. The second approach is purely data-driven, and in contrast to the first approach, describes aircraft performance without modeling the underlying physics. The resulting models proved to be more accurate tan BADA nominal models. Additionally, they provided insights on the parameters that have a significant impact on aircraft performance. This research project is the first to provide a comparison between physics-based and non-physics-based performance tailoring approaches. Despite the differences in accuracy achieved with both methods, each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. What approach to follow is determined first by the application, and secondly by the demanded level of accuracy.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In this project a frequency-domain approach is proposed for robust controller design for controllers of pre-specified structure. Specifically, an existing technique is extended so that it guarantees not only nominal, but also robust performance. This is achieved by ensuring performance for multiple frequency-domain models acquired from data. The related computational efficiency in the overall approach is also a fundamental criterion and thus we propose a series of techniques by which it can be improved. Additionally, a major contribution of this work is an iterative algorithm that minimizes a linear approximation of the H infinity norm of the closed-loop system.

The results have shown that the receiver antennas need to adapt a nadir orientation to maximize the number of visibility contacts from mentioned GNSS constellations. Second, an assessment on the impact of different error sources in the absolute orbit accuracy has been conducted for the pair of satellites. The sensitivity analysis comprises errors that derive from realistic uncertainties in the geopotential model, GNSS orbits and clocks, satellites’ solar radiation pressure model, centre of mass and antenna reference point. The results have shown that the error sources that most affect the accuracy of the absolute orbit solution are disturbance aligned with the velocity component in both centre of mass of the satellites and reference point of the receiver antennas.<br/><br/>Furthermore, to achieve the high standards of relative navigation, optical ISL observations with micro-meter precision level were employed. This precision level was determined by the limits of the employed software tool, as the state-of-the-art precision of these measurements is at the nano-metre level. Due to the 1D nature of the ISL observation, it has been found that they cannot be processed alone and require the GNSS code and phase observations to be processed along with them. In these processes, the system architecture of the inter-satellite ranging system has been assumed to be two-way to rule out the errors that derive from the non-synchronization of the satellites’ clocks. The relative POD results have shown that the shorter the distance between the satellites, the higher the precision of the relative orbit solution in radial and along-track components, ultimately being limited by the precision of the ISL observations. The fact that the satellites are placed in co-planar orbits makes the cross-track component not be visible and probably yield conditioning problems to the LSQ matrix. Therefore, the impact of angular separations ranging from 1 to 10 degrees on the relative POD accuracy is also investigated. The most promising results come from the case in which the relative distance between the MEO-placed satellites is low (1,000km) and an angular separation in the orbital planes of 10 degrees has been induced. In that case, the relative orbit solution is improved in all components (radial, along-track and cross-track) and placed in the few millimetre level.<br","POD; GNSS; Inter-Satellite Links; Relative Navigation; Absolute Navigation; Orbit Determination","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In January 2019, the SCP (Netherlands Institute for Social Research) reported that 77% of the Dutch citizens think disagreements on social issues increase. As we mostly hear and see the more extreme and opposing sides in the media, it seems like society is divided about many issues. Polarization can be defined as ‘sharpening of opposites between groups in society that can result in tensions between these groups and increased segregation’. In a polarized society, one is either positive or negative, with little space for more nuanced emotional awareness. Yet, all of our thoughts, motivations and behaviours are influenced by our emotions. Emotion Studio, a research and innovation agency, developed an instrument to measure nuanced emotion profiles on products: PrEmo. This thesis aims for a new application of PrEmo on social issues, in which the method leads to a better emotional understanding in the public debate and acts as the key to unlock people’s concerns that are hidden behind viewpoints. PrEmo is a non-verbal self-report tool that measures seven positive and negative emotions, expressed as 14 cartoons. The project focuses on news media organisations, that can serve as the first communicators of society’s perspectives. The influence of media on polarization was analysed through desk research, a literature study and interviews with media, experts and news consumers. Four key problems were defined, addressing potential fields for change: 1) an unnoticed majority of perspectives, 2) little emotional awareness 3) nuance is lost as news must be clear and attractive to be read and sold, 4) diverging interpretations of reality. Subsequently, a design vision was created: ""Design to reduce the perception of polarization by enabling Dutch citizens to explore and contribute to the variety of society’s perspectives on social themes, using emotional awareness."" The final design proposal, Perspective News, is an online platform on which Dutch citizens can explore society’s perspectives. Perspective News consists of an emotion measurement survey based on PrEmo, that captures people’s emotions and concerns after reading a news article, and a platform, integrated into existing news media website, that displays the captured perspectives. The design realizes 1) an accessible possibility for participation and 2) an inclusive image of society’s perspectives. Perspective News provides a stage to everyone, not just the extremes. The platform of Perspective News helps to get a sense of what a significant amount of society thinks and feels. Perspective News also enables users to compare their perspective to others and supports personal reflection. A communication strategy and implementation roadmap complement the design proposal. The concept was positively evaluated by end-users, media editors and experts. For further development of the concept, recommendations are suggested. Perspective News can be a first step towards reducing the perception of polarization, by amplifying the variety of perspectives that exist in society, which opens the way to the ultimate goal: supporting mutual understanding and empathy as foundation for a solidary society.","Polarization; News media; Social identity; Emotion; News consumption; Fundamental needs; Design for Emotion; Selective exposure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The current generation of Al-Li alloys were developed to replace the currently used AA2024 alloy in commercial airframes, military and space applications. Traditional joining methods cannot be used to join dissimilar aluminium alloys. Thus, friction stir welding (FSW) was used to join the 2 dissimilar Al-Li alloys - AA2099 T83 and AA2060 T8E30 alloys. FSW causes several changes in the microstructure due to the rotational movement of the tool which results in localised plastic deformation and a thermal cycle in the alloys. This leads to 4 distinct zones in the alloys - the stir zone, thermo-mechanically affected zone, heat affected zone, and the base metal. The differences in microstructure is suggested to cause a change in the mechanical properties and localised corrosion behaviour of the alloys. In this work, the localised corrosion behaviour of the friction stir welded Al-Li alloys were investigated. The effect of FSW on the microstructure and corrosion behaviour was also studied. Microstructural characterisation was done for both the alloys and their respective weld zones. Coarse constituent particles were found in all weld zones with a decreasing trend in average size towards the weld centre. Strengthening precipitates such as the T_1 phase particles were observed on the grain boundaries of the alloys. This had a decreasing trend of distribution density towards the weld centre with virtually no precipitates in the SZ. In order to assess the corrosion performance potentiodynamic polarisation, open circuit potential, linear polarisation resistance, and immersion tests were deployed. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was used to evaluate the morphology and chemical composition of the of the corroded surface. It was found that for the BM and HAZ regions of both alloys, the attack occurred mainly on the grain boundaries which were sites for the T_1 particles. These particles were suggested to be the controlling factor of localised corrosion behaviour in these regions due to their high electrochemical behaviour, which also resulted in almost no passivity in these regions. A large attack site was also observed on the surface of the matrix which was the site of hydrogen evolution during initial immersion time periods. Pits were also formed on the sites of coarse intermetallic particles. For the SZ regions the dominating attack was due to the coarse particles in the matrix. The effect of anodising the surface and sol-gel coating of the surface on the corrosion behaviour was determined in this project. It was found that the anodised layer did enhance the corrosion performance of the alloys. The SZ of the anodised sample was found to be most prone to corrosion compared to the anodised base metals. The sol-gel coating on the surface was also found to increase the corrosion resistance of the surface due to its self healing properties thus protecting the surface of the alloys.","Aluminium-Lithium alloys;; Corrosion;; AA2060 T8E30;; AA2099 T83;; Anodising;; Sol-gel coating; Hydrogen evolution;; energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy;; Passivity;; Linear polarisation resistance;; Intergranular attack;; Scanning electron microscopy;; Friction stir welding;; Immersion tests;; Potentiodynamic polarisation;","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

This popularity starts to have its drawbacks since the number of complaints increase. As an effect, regulations become stricter and municipalities hand out fewer permits, resulting in last-minute cancellations of festivals. The festival landscape already encounters other extreme risks and some festivals can go bankrupt within one bad edition. Simultaneously, the Netherlands is changing and festivals also have to adapt to future trends. These trends are positioned around one main phenomenon: the purpose economy. Combining these occurrences, the festival landscape has become a much-discussed topic and every year questions pop up with regards to its relevance and effects. It is discussed that citizens and visitors currently have the most impact on the success of a festival. Nevertheless, the impact on their own lives is minimal and short term. An increase in official complaints or disturbed citizens would endanger the festivals’ position. Therefore, festivals will have to become indispensable towards these two stakeholders to create a permanent position. They should do this by creating reciprocity and fulfill the needs of the stakeholders. For citizens, this means that festivals will help tackle societal challenges.

In order to do so, festivals will have to change their role to a stakeholder-oriented service and position themselves as a platform where citizens and visitors come together and take the opportunity to fulfill their needs. This results in a shift of focus and festivals can use this position to strengthen its base. In order to fully embrace this new role, festivals will have to create a strong relationship between visitors and citizens. Research shows that co-creation can change the attitudes of people towards a service. A continuous innovation plan is developed where the four pillars of a strong relationship are implemented. These four pillars are ‘Openness’, ‘Trust’, ‘Involvement’, and ‘Commitment’. It is stated that this relationship should be created in the before-, during- and after phase of a festival, finishing each cycle with peak-end, ensuring an overall positive attitude and increasing loyalty towards the festival. Since festivals can have different aims for creating a strong relationship, three scenarios are developed. The first one is a formal relationship where the festival does not merge its identity with the environment. Secondly, a relationship can be created where the festival creates an impact on the environment. Thirdly, the festival can aim for a relationship where they are an equal part of the community. The festival can use the online platform to reach more people and tackle the complexities of the offline platform. Finally, a roadmap is created on how festivals can implement this future vision and create a stakeholder-oriented organization. A plan is developed on how to create awareness among festivals. During the entire project, the organization of Into the Great Wide Open served as a basecamp where insights could be validated.","Festivals; Roadmap; Future Vision; Into the great wide open; Strategic; 2030; festival; Future Relevance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

As a response, in 2002, the local government took a step forward at the policy level by mandating the provision of rainwater water harvesting structure for every building. This system contributes to take advantage of the excess water during monsoon and palliating the situation during the dry season, while preventing it from being discharged into the polluted waterways. However, the widespread uptake of rooftop rainwater harvesting systems has been slow partly due to the lack of accurate and reliable information on the benefits of rooftop rainwater harvesting to make more informed decision. This research seeks to bring forward the potential of leveraging decentralized rooftop rainwater harvesting (RRWH) systems to mitigate Chennai’s water challenges by quantifying the hydrological effect of RRWH using a multi-purpose approach. To do so, a RRWH model was developed using daily continuous simulation method with ‘Yield Before Spill’’ as the operational rule to determine the optimum design capacity required to meet the domestic water demand and to provide its associated hydrological benefits on water supply, groundwater recharge and urban flooding. In this research, a closed system of RRWH designed to maximize water supply is applied for the analysis. Two areas of Chennai were investigated : urban area and peri-urban area. The Mambalam area, located in the historical center of Chennai, was selected as the urban area case study. Assuming 380,000 inhabitants are living in an estimated area of 11,690,000m2, approx. four million cubic meters of water can be harvested annually from the existing building’s roofs. From this, 50% of the buildings in the Mambalam is assumed to be residential which can provide 51d/yr/p of the domestic water demand. Thus, other sources of water supply are required to supplement the water demand. Maximizing water supply reduces groundwater recharge to nearly 0m3/yr in the Mambalam area. There is clearly a trade-off between water supply and groundwater recharge. However, when considering the adoption of RRWH for groundwater recharge (also refer as open system of RRWH) for the remaining 50% of the non-residential buildings in the Mambalam, approx. two million m3/aof rainwater can be recharged into the aquifer, balancing out the urban water system. This volume of recharged groundwater can also be considered as available groundwater for water supply because in urban area, groundwater is also used for domestic water supply. Together, the potential of decentralized water supply is increased up to 30% of the annual water demand (equivalent to 105d/yr/p) . Finally, the combined systems of RRWH for water supply and RRWH for groundwater recharge can contribute to reduce a volume of approx. four million m3/yr going into the stormwater drainage network and the polluted waterways in Chennai. According to the results, RRWH can reduce up to 60% of the stormwater runoff during a heavy rain event in the Mambalam. The results show that scaling up RRWH at the macro-scale level can have a significant impact in terms of drought and flood resilience for the Mambalam area. These numbers can serve as inputs for stakeholders’ dialogues to make informed decisions and raise awareness on the benefits of multi-purpose RRWH to transition Chennai toward a water resilient city. In practice, retrofitting existing building with RRWH for water supply in urban areas may become challenging mainly due to political, legal, physical and socio-economic factors. The adoption of a close system for RRWH is found to be more relevant for the periurban areas of Chennai. Indeed, buildings are developed on top of marshland with a high-water table level and saline water. This is the case of many residential apartment complexes located along the IT Corridor in the southern part of Chennai. Groundwater recharge and groundwater abstraction for water supply are not possible. As a<br/>consequence, people need to rely solely on water tankers which is around 20 times more expensive than the cost of water per kiloliters in urban areas. The case of Sabari Terrace residential apartment complex showed that the adoption of RRWH for water supply contributes to 15% of the annual water demand and it saves up to $6/yr/p.","Rainwater harvesting; Multi-purpose; Indian cities; urban hydrology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","","13.067439, 80.237617"

To do so, extensive desk-research was conducted, summarising existing data, and 21 interviews with CM experts were held. The result is an analysis comprised of both quantitative and qualitative data. In this thesis, the CM industry was understood as technological innovation system (TIS), a framework often used to analyse emerging industries. To compare the state of the CM industry in the USA and Europe, three research questions were answered. The first was: What is the structure of the cultivated meat innovation system, specifically its technology, actors and networks, and institutions? To answer this research question, a review of CM’s technology, an overview of actors and their associated networks and of the institutions governing CM is provided. The answer to this research question is in summary that CM is a nascent technology with many uncertainties from a technological standpoint, that its actor networks are still emerging, and that the regulatory framework is relatively clear in both the USA and Europe. The second research question was: How does the functional performance of the cultivated meat innovation system compare in the assessed regions? To answer this research questions, seven functions provided by the TIS framework were analysed. These seven functions are argued to influence the development of an innovation in a given region, and comprise for instance Knowledge Development and Diffusion, Entrepreneurial Activity, or the Venture Capital Availability. The answer to this research question is in summary that the USA is leading across all assessed indicators. The CM industry is clearly leading in the USA over Europe. The only indicator on which Europe is leading is public research output on CM. The third and last research question was: What themes with importance to the near-time development of the cultivated meat industry can be identified? To answer this research question, a thematic analysis was applied to the interview content that could not already be understood through the lens of the TIS framework. The answer to this research question is in summary that there are two important challenges for CM: the development of its technological system, and the development of its supply chain. For the technological system, specifically, the main challenge is to reduce costs. For the supply chain, interviewees identified the development of a work division in the industry of high importance, although this appears to be already partially under way. After presenting the results, an extensive discussion is provided. Two points of the findings are particularly worthwhile to point out. Firstly, the dominant role of the USA compared to Europe. Although this thesis indicates that the USA is clearly leading compared to Europe, the results should not be overinterpreted. The number of CM start-ups in both regions is identical, although the US’ start-ups appear more advanced; and, as already mentioned, the public research output is stronger in Europe. Whether the CM industry will actually be focused in the USA remains to be seen, and the dices have not yet fallen. Secondly, there appears to be an “technology battle” between plant-based meat (PBM) and CM upcoming. In this context, it may come that PBM will evolve as “dominant design” for unstructured 2D products, such as burger patties, while CM may evolve as “dominant design” for structured 3D products, such as steak. Yet, this poses the challenge to create CM for 3D products in a cost-efficient way in a not too far future. However, the development will not be deterministic, and maybe one will observe entirely different pathways, for instance with hybrid products of PBM and CM. The main limitation to this work is the usage of the TIS framework, which is not yet quantitatively validated. A key avenue for future research lays in creating a computational model for the development of the CM industry, for example an agent-based model. This work makes contributions from both an empirical and a theoretical angle. From an empirical angle, it sheds light on the CM industry in the USA and Europe; from a theoretical angle, it provides an example of an international, comparative TIS analysis. Lastly, recommendations to policymakers and CM companies are given. Which world region will come to dominate the CM industry remains to be seen. But the assessment at hand indicates that it may yet be again the USA, which came to dominate many emerging technology-driven industries in recent years.","cultivated meat; clean meat; in-vitro meat; Innovation systems; industry assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Out of the urban building stock residential buildings require continuous supply of energy for space heating and appliances. To answer to this demand in a sustainable way policy maker need to design energy efficiency strategies that must rely on accurate and traceable models. These models estimate energy demand based on a series of building features, out of which building age is of prime importance because it predicts the insulation properties of the building. To support the energy modelling process, we propose a method of automatically identifying building age from spatial data at a large scale. We identify features of buildings that are significant for age prediction and determine which set of features has best prediction power at national scale, in Germany. It is expected that the accuracy of classification will be strongly related to sampling design and data availability. The final results will be used to identify the impact of misclassification errors on estimating energy use in urban energy models, providing in this manner a measure of the reliability of such models.","spatial data; building energy model; supervised learning; energy efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

It is expected that by 2040 the number of people with dementia will grow to 520.000 and expand to over 620.000 people by 2050 (Alzheimer Nederland, 2018). This puts pressure on the Dutch healthcare system.Despite their impaired memory, people with dementia still have the ability to (re)learn tasks when addressing the memory systems that are associated with automatic processes and performing activities, which are relatively spared in dementia (Eichenbaum, Cohen, Otto &amp; Wilbe, 1992). These tasks include everyday activities such as knowing how to tie your shoes, how to make coffee and how to walk a certain route.A learning method which makes use of the implicit memory is errorless learning. This is a highly structured learning method used in rehabilitation for people with dementia to (re)learn skills (De Werd, Boelen &amp; Kessels, 2013). By regaining the ability to perform meaningful and important activities, people with dementia could maintain or improve their independence and quality of life (Cohen, Ylvisaker, Hamilton, Kemp, &amp; Claiman, 2010).Within this thesis, the aim was to research the possibilities of involving informal caregivers in the errorless learning process for people with dementia in the home environment. The insights gained from this research are used to develop a solution that supports informal caregivers to (re)learn meaningful tasks or activities to people with dementia to maintain or increase their independence.In the analysis phase of the project, literature research was done on the errorless learning method to give an overview of how this method is applied in the current situation and which elements it consists of. Explorative research methods have been done to define what is needed to bring this method in the home environment and involve the informal caregiver in the process. This research consisted of interviews with experts on errorless learning and dementia care, hosting focus groups with people with dementia and informal caregivers, and performing two case studies.Based on the literature and explorative research, the most important aspects concerning the errorless learning process in the home situation were described by discussing the needs and requirements per stakeholder. These included the person with dementia, the informal caregiver and the professional caregiver who should guide the learning process. This was translated into a vision on how errorless learning could be performed in the home environment by visualizing it in a desired journey.A new design goal, opportunities for design, and design requirements were defined, which formed the base of the design phase. Individual and group ideation sessions were done which resulted in the proposal of a platform that was developed iteratively through low-fidelity tests, interviews and a focus group. Simultaneously the desired journey was refined.The concept proposal Leren met dementie is a platform that informs, educates and guides the informal caregiver throughout the process of errorless learning to (re)learn meaningful activities to people with dementia. It provides information on why this learning method should be applied, how to apply it and how to approach the person with dementia. This is done through a website, booklet, and application. Part of this website and application is an online tool, the Stappenplan maker. With this tool, a (printed) step-by-step plan can be made with pictures and instructions tailored to the person with dementia to use during the learning sessions.The concept proposal was validated in a focus group with the participation of people with dementia and informal caregivers. Secondly, the platform was evaluated with a professor of neuropsychology who is involved in research on errorless learning for people with dementia. This was done by describing the scenario as visualized in the desired journey and discussing the platform Leren met dementie to determine the desirability, feasibility, and viability of the proposal.Based on the validation, it could be concluded that Leren met dementie could serve as a base to further develop, discuss, research and test the possibilities of errorless learning for people with dementia in the home environment by involving the informal caregiver. However, more research is needed to evaluate the usability and understandability of the platform for the target group. Secondly, the effects of involving the informal caregivers and the step-by-step plan on the learning effects for people with dementia should be researched.","Dementia; errorless learning; learning; Informal Caregiver","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

This study assessed the feasibility of methanogenic aniline biodegradation under saline (8 gNa+/L) conditions (1) by performing biodegradability batch assays using biomass from three different origins, and (2) by treating aniline-containing synthetic wastewater in a continuous anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR), seeded with granular sludge coming from an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor treating petrochemical wastewater. In addition, the inhibitory effect of aniline and phenol on the aceticlastic methanogenesis, as well as the toxic effect on the integrity of cell membranes of the anaerobic biomass were assessed. Methanogenic biodegradation of aniline was not observed in the AnMBR, nor in the biodegradability assays. However, the results from the AnMBR operation fed with synthetic wastewater (20-200 mg aniline/L) demonstrated a 10-20% aniline removal, which was mainly attributed to volatilisation of aniline. Results from specific methanogenic activity (SMA)-inhibition tests demonstrated a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of aniline for the aceticlastic methanogenesis of 2.5 g aniline/L. The IC50 of phenol for the aceticlastic methanogenesis was 1.0 g phenol/L. The cell membrane integrity (CMI) of the anaerobic biomass was not significantly affected after 72 hours of exposure to 4 g aniline/L or 2 g phenol/L. This research constituted the first report demonstrating the application of an AnMBR with the aim to biodegrade aniline-containing synthetic wastewater under methanogenic saline conditions. The results of this research demonstrated that, after 200 days of AnMBR operation, the methanogenic enrichment culture was not able to biodegrade aniline.","Anaerobic membrane bioreactor; Anaerobic digestion; Wastewater treatment; Aniline; Phenol; Methanogenic; Saline; Specific methanogenic activity; Inhibition; IC50; Cell membrane integrity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-27","","","","","Bioxtreme",""

The project is conducted mainly in Nairobi, Kenya and focuses on building a marketing pilot for Mhogo Foods to increase access to nutrition in low-income markets. The project taps into the challenge of marketing nutrition and the difficulty of measuring effectiveness of marketing campaigns. After a short literature study and 15 interviews with the target audience that provided several insights, a design-led approach was used to create a tag line that resonates with the target audience. The combined insights resulted in a tag line that formed the key message of the campaign: ‘Mlo Wetu Halisi’ (in English: ‘Eating, in our traditional way’). The design-led approach turned out to be helpful in targeting the message to the preferences of the target audience and ensuring the tag line is inclusive. During implementation of the campaign, all materials and interventions were based on the predefined key message. The implementation of the campaign consisted of a mix of proven offline activities to gain the first market traction with digital experiments to explore new marketing opportunities. The digital experiments consisted of streaming recipe videos through Wi-Fi platforms on local buses and distributing digital coupons through several digital channels that could be redeemed at local shops. During the campaign, different digital channels were tested through the digital coupon program. An initial setup, where coupons would be distributed through Facebook, Whatsapp and the Wi-Fi platforms on buses highlighted the challenge of reaching customers through the digital channels while also educating them on the program. A second iteration, consisting of a hybrid between offline and online channels, resulted in more tangible data, with customers showing understanding and interest in the coupon program. An additional key insight was that the Wi-Fi platforms turned out to be the only digital channel that could both reach the target audience and keep the attention span of consumers for a prolonged period of time. Finally, a tool is presented that can be used in future marketing pilots to assist in building the campaign and in designing strategies for measuring effectiveness of digital channels.","marketing; Digital; BoP; Nutrition; Lean; design thinking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","2SCALE",""

Exploration and coverage is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics, the goal of which is to explore an unknown environment in order to gain vital information. Some of the diverse scenarios and applications in which exploratory robots can have a significant impact include search and rescue missions, environmental monitoring, and space exploration. Specifically, we focus on the aspect of finding areas of interest, also referred to as targets, in the environment. In this thesis, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based approach relying solely on visual observations. In particular, our method builds upon the off-policy, actor-critic, Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architectures (IMPALA) framework by including a set of novel auxiliary tasks, i.e. Pose Estimation and Local Map Prediction. These auxiliary tasks are inspired by Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approaches to exploratory robotics problems. The intuition is to assist internal representation learning and build locale specific knowledge by teaching the agent to predict its position and orientation, as well as transfer the visual information to information about the its local proximity. Experiments conducted in the DeepMind Lab simulation environment show improved performance over the base IMPALA agent and demonstrate the effectiveness of these auxiliary tasks. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of the agent, trained through various stages of curriculum, compared to a human controlled agent. The trained agent is shown to outperform the human in the majority of tested scenarios.","Deep Reinforcement Learning; Artificial intelligence; Mobile Robots; Auxiliary Learning; Autonomous Exploration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Labl wanted to know how to improve this course of events so that, by design, the process of ordering fashion can be improved. The aim of this graduation project was to design an intervention that would facilitate communication between brand and supplier in the fashion industry, in a way that leads to mutual understanding and will result in production of better-quality fashion over time. Therefore, interviews and context research were performed with Dutch brand owners, Kenyan artisans and factory owners to become aware of the issues that led to dissatisfaction in this collaboration. A cultural analysis was performed to find out how to bridge the Kenyan and Dutch culture, and come up with practices that are suitable for all stakeholders. Two creative sessions were performed to come up with solutions that could tackle this problem. The design intervention that was created was a digital platform design which is unique in the industry. It offers a solution that is aimed at: 1) enabling clear communication of instructions and feedback, 2) Creating transparency in the supply chain, and 3) Building trustworthy relationships between factory and brand. A prototype of the interface was developed and tested with Kenyan artisans. Afterwards, iterations were made, and a final concept of the digital platform is presented.

There is currently little data available on mass evacuation in the Netherlands to calibrate existing models or to develop new insights. This thesis aims to improve the methods used in the Netherlands to estimate the effectiveness of evacuation with methods developed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). This USACE method includes a questionnaire that can be completed with authorities which in turn estimates the time it takes for authorities to give a warning to evacuate, how fast the warning spread through the population and how fast people will react to this warning. The results of this thesis showed that this “USACE assessment method” could be a valuable source of information to the Netherlands. However, due to the different threat scenarios and command structure(s) found in the USA several adaptations are needed to this USACE assessment method to make it usable in the Netherlands. However, this thesis also showed that the effect of (most) measures takes by authorities in the Netherlands will be limited by the heavy road congestion during evacuation. Traffic jams will quickly develop and any improvements with respect to evacuation will be cancelled out. So a recommendation that follows from this report is that authorities in the Netherlands shift their focus from an area specific evacuation strategy to a national evacuation strategy so new traffic management option can be developed that can limit these traffic jams. Another conclusion of this thesis is that agent based and micro level evacuation and loss of life models (models where people are modelled separately and area specific parameters are taken into account and thus include much more detail) add little to nothing to the evacuation strategies of the Netherlands compared to the current used macro models (models where an overarching view of the evacuation is used). Again, this is due to the large traffic congestion where traffic jams will almost immediately develop. When better traffic management options are available these micro level and agent based models may provide new insights on the evacuation effectiveness of specific areas.","Evacuation modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Over time, however, valid concerns have been raised about whether decisions made about individuals using these data-driven technologies can lead to bias against women. In an attempt to assess the fairness of an algorithm, 21 prominent definitions of fairness have been proposed by the computer science community over the years. However, what remains absent is consensus on which definitions are suitable for assessing gender equality in consumer lending. There is also a lack of knowledge on how to appropriately implement these metrics in practice. To tackle the problems mentioned above, this research has investigated how automated loan approval processes can be assessed for gender equality. Two essential elements for assessing predictive tools were identified and investigated through a separate research question: What fairness metrics are suitable for assessing gender equality in consumer lending? How can the metrics be applied to observe gender bias in lending history data? Based on the questions above, the research was conducted in two stages: Stage 1 focused on analyzing the prominent definitions of group fairness, but before doing so, it conceptualizes gender equality in consumer lending by conducting an extensive literature review encompassing domains of philosophy, economics, gender studies, and history. In investigating the first research question, it is found that group fairness metrics are a measure of distributive justice. These metrics are based on three different statistical criteria commonly known as independence, sufficiency, and separation and each underlie different moral assumptions which should be verified based on the application scenario at hand. In Stage 2 of this work, the second research question was investigated by conducting an exploratory case study in which a logistic regression model is built to classify a sample of loan applicants in an open source dataset. Both the dataset and the model are then tested for bias using IBM’s open source Python AIF36 toolkit. After applying the group fairness metrics, it was found that the choice of separation and sufficiency can have different repercussions for each demographic group in the dataset. When false distribution of utility is under inspection, sufficiency advantaged male applicants more than the female applicants while separation advantages males more than females. Such inconsistency highlights the importance of realizing how relevant distribution of harm/benefit depends on the choice of fairness criteria made by decision makers. Lastly, the research provides an extensive discussion on possible root causes of bias and some recommendations to managers and data stewards on how to tackle bias issues that stakeholders may face in the context of consumer lending.","fairness; Fairness Perception; Ethics; Gender Equality; machine learning; Bias Detection; Bias Mitigation; Consumer lending; Binary Classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Plettenburg, D.H. (graduation committee); Sakes, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Background: The majority of the amputated population is living in low-resource countries, but only a small minority has access to rehabilitating services. The accessibility of upper limb prostheses in these countries is poor due to limited technical and medical resources. 3D printing is regarded as a promising manufacturing alternative in contrast to the expensive and labour-intense conventional processes. However, the majority of the developed 3D-printed prostheses show weak functionality characteristics and do not meet basic user requirements. The goal of this research is, therefore, to design and evaluate a new body-powered prosthetic device which is fabricated with a 3D printer and easy to assemble, capable of performing high force-transmissions with an appropriate pinch force output, and meets the basic user demands. Methods: An analysis of the widely used conventional prostheses and available 3D printed prostheses has been performed, and as a result, design requirements have been set up. Based on these requirements a prototype has been designed using SOLIDWORKS, and is printed with a FDM printer. Mechanical characteristics have been measured using a test bench, and the functional performance has been evaluated by ten able-bodied subjects using the SHAP and the BBT. These results were finally compared to results of conventional prostheses, as found in the literature. Results: The final prototype of the 3D-Sanhand is presented; the 3D printed Simple to Assemble Natural-looking hand prosthesis. This prosthetic device has a one-degree-of-freedom rotating thumb and is, except for a pressure spring and an elastic rubber band, completely printed with a FDM 3D<br/>printer. The device is capable of performing a 15 N pinch with an actuation force of 24 N, which is lower than the required actuation for conventional prostheses and within the boundaries of fatigue-free use. It has a low mass of 142 gram which is a reduction of over 50% in comparison to the commercially available designs. The opening width of 75 mm is in line with conventional prostheses. The sliding mechanism in the rotation point enables the users to change the initial position of the thumb and to reduce the opening width, to allow all users to pick up objects from different sizes. User tests showed that the prosthesis was capable of picking up a variety of different object shapes and did not encounter difficulties with heavy weights. The main problems were subjected to the smoothness of the finger tips and the impossibility to pick up thin objects from the surface. Conclusion: This thesis describes the design of the first 3D printed hand that can be assembled without any technical and medical knowledge or complex tools and machinery. The hand performs a pinch force high enough to perform activities of daily living under comfortable operational forces, and that is comparable to conventional prostheses on the market. Future research should further investigate what the wear effects of 3D printed materials are on the long-term use, and should propose directions to increase the durability and efficiency of the design.","body powered; Upper limb prosthetics; low-resource prosthesis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Due to this systemic view on safety airlines pursue to understand this complex, underlying system and aim to proactively act upon the occurrence of these events. The most prevalent implementation of flight safety event detection is however still threshold analysis, which has no such implications. On the other hand, Machine Learning methods have readily proven to be an efficient and valuable solutions in predicting the occurrence of anomalies in data, such as flight safety events. However, existing methods search for anomalies in datasets encompassing the anomaly, i.e. direct datasets. On the contrary, this study approached airline operations as a complex system which the outcome could be the occurrence of a flight safety event. Hence, the question was raised whether a set of indirect precursors could be significant in predicting flight safety events. That is why common airline processes were selected, in consultation with industry experts, and their indirect data considered. The aim of this study was to evaluate this concept by evaluating a set of precursors for a particular flight safety event (a case study). The Knowledge Discovery in Databases framework was the general guideline throughout this research, with a Relief and Neural Network algorithm as transformation and data mining step respectively. This study showed that the considered processes were significant in predicting the occurrence of a safety event, although the found precursors could not fully encompass the event under investigation. The classification performance of the methodology was characterised by a large number of false positives, which originated from the problem's class skewness. The Matthews Correlation Coefficient proved to be a well-balanced optimisation objective for such problems and overcame this drift. Locally, the weight optimisation showed a set of confidently classified false positives and negatives confined further improvement. These misclassifications were found to be the result of a lack of adequate information. Nevertheless, the considered information did display to be significant as the obtained Matthews Correlation Coefficient and recall underpinned, particularly in the light of the class imbalance and the anomalous nature of flight safety events.","Safety Data Analysis; Unstable Approaches; Precursor Mining; Anomaly Prediction; Aviation Safety; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The present research attempted to find the cause for this lining behaviour. The determination of critical loading conditions, the application of the longitudinal beam model and the analytical and numerical modelling (in Plaxis) of a monolith tunnel lining in abrupt ground property transition were analyzed. Thereby, the global lining stiffness reduction due to joints was also considered. The literature review led to the following expected factors that caused difficulties in the Middle-East case: the squeezing and submerged ground conditions, the rock mass disturbance and the improper backfilling of the rings. Additionally, the ring stiffness reduction due to joints was an essential factor for lining behaviour. The geotechnical conditions, the lining design and the observed difficulties in the case were defined in the next section. Critical missing information, such as geotechnical properties of the fault zone material and limited monitoring data, led to essential assumptions. The settlements were expected to be caused by rock mass disturbance and improper backfilling. These altered the water flow during and after the boring operations and led to lowering of the groundwater level and increase of effective stresses. The water leakages were caused by ring ovalization in the soft fault zone, leading to opening of joints. The analysis for this research was divided in 2D transversal, 2D longitudinal and 3D modelling of the lining in and around the fault zone. The 3D model was seen as the integral model, which took into account the transversal and longitudinal behaviour of the lining. However, most of the behaviour of the lining was analyzed by carrying out parametric analysis for both directions in 2D. Moreover, the 2D models were used to validate the results of the 3D model to identify the influence of the third dimension. The assessment of the results from these analyses led to the following conclusions. The behaviour of the tunnel lining in small width fault zones was governed by the transversal action. The ovalization was mainly influenced by the ground stiffness, the vertical to horizontal stress ratio, the backfilling stiffness and the ring stiffness. Using Erdmann's analytical solution, the approximate lining forces can be determined. However, this overestimated the ground pressures acting on the lining, especially in cases where vertical to horizontal stress ratios were not equal to 0.5. This was because the 2D transversal behaviour did not take into account the longitudinal arching effect, which depended mostly on the stiffness ratio between ground types. The final conclusion was that the global reduction of lining stiffness due to the joints led to a discrepancy with regard to the distribution of the longitudinal displacements. A complementary analysis using a numerical model taking into account the joint structure and discontinuous behaviour between rings would probably allow a better prediction of longitudinal displacements.","Bored tunnel; TBM; Lining; Discontinuous rock; Hoek Brown; Fault zone; Plaxis; FEM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geotechnical Engineering","",""

In 2015, the maritime sector was responsible for 2.6 % of the global CO2 emissions. The combination of the solid oxide fuel cell fueled by sustainable synthesized ammonia is seen as a potential solution to<br/>reduce emissions. Ammonia is considered as a balanced solution in terms of ease of storage, volumetric energy density and cost of production. The solid oxide fuel cell is generally regarded to be a promising technology owing to its high eciency and combined heat and power usage. This MSc thesis investigates the technical viability of a sustainable SOFC propulsion system fueled by ammonia. Technical viability is expressed in equipment weight and volume, whereas sustainability is determined by efficiency and emissions. The solid oxide propulsion system is subjected to a case study: A diesel engine powered vessel from the Watertaxi Rotterdam company with an assumed shaft power of 25 kW. A model was compiled to determine the efficiency, weight and volume of the solid oxide fuel cell system. The model covers activation losses, ohmic losses and diffusion losses within the solid oxide fuel cell stack. With the model, a sensitivity study with a selected set of system parameters was performed to gain insight in the solid oxide fuel cell system. The selected system parameters are: Number of cells in the stack, single-pass fuel utilization, cathode off-gas recirculation rate and anode off-gas recirculation rate. The final solid oxide fuel cell system has a signicantly higher efficiency based on the higher heating value than the diesel engine system: 46.0 % versus 35.0 % respectively. Also, no carbon dioxide is emitted, leading to a reduction of 56.9 ton per year. Furthermore, nitrogen oxide emissions are considered to be negligible compared to the diesel engine system. However, the weight and volume of the solid oxide fuel cell system are signicantly larger: 1199 kg versus 278 kg and 1175 L versus 432 L respectively. Mainly caused by the battery module, required for compensating for temporarily imbalances between power demand and power supply. As a result, it is concluded that the solid oxide fuel cell system is unpractical for the small inland vessel selected for the case study. Larger sized vessels have more potential for the application, because large sized vessel sail more continuously, reducing the battery capacity requirement, may allow for more tolerance regarding heavy and bulky equipment and have more benefit of the higher efficiency due to a lower refuel frequency.","SOFC; Ammonia; Propulsion; Solid oxide fuel cell; Watertaxi; Vessel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-03-26","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Process and Energy Technology","",""

It’s two artificial inlets, Boughaz 1 in the West and Boughaz 2 in the East, provide a connection to the Mediterranean Sea. They enable the water bodies to interact and support fish migration. Currently, regular maintenance dredging works are necessary to keep the two inlets open.<br/>The objective of this thesis is to analyse the effect of interventions applied to the two inlets on the lagoon-sea interaction, with the goal of transforming the present, unstable inlet system towards a stable tidal inlet lagoon by adapting one or both of the present inlets. This study is conducted on three system phases, being Phase 0, Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 0 consists of the initial situation without any interventions; Phase 1 contains the effect of adaptations to the Boughaz 1 inlet, and Phase 2 includes adaptations to Boughaz 2 in addition to the changes made in Phase 1. The new design in Phase 1 and Phase 2 consists of a deeper inlet cross-sectional area, the dredging of an approach channel, the addition of a nourishment, and the removal of the present breakwaters. Design elements are processed using a 2D-H Delft3D Flexible Mesh model and analysed under tide-only conditions with and without a prevailing wind climate added. Evaporation effects are included after the model calculations are made. The results are mainly assessed are the interaction with the Mediterranean Sea, the sediment transport character, and the inlet stability according to the Escoffier curve. Moreover, an analysis is made on the flushing of the lagoon and the effect of a prevailing wind pattern on the system. It is clear from both literature and the initial model results of Phase 0 that Bardawil Lagoon currently does not function as a morphologically stable tidal inlet system, as sedimentation occurs in both inlets. The water exchange between the Mediterranean Sea and Bardawil Lagoon is restricted by the inlets, which is indicated by the difference in tidal elevation on both sides of the inlet. Both inlets are positioned near the unstable equilibrium point on the Escoffier curve, indicating possible closure of the inlets in the future. Hence, interventions are required to establish a morphologically stable lagoon inlet system. By applying the proposed designs in Phase 1 and Phase 2, the limitations on the incoming tide shift from the inlets to the inner basin induces friction, thus removing the inlets as limiting factor. Moreover, taking into account both the prevailing winds and high evaporation effects, the total system is classified as having a sediment exporting character after Phase 2. High evaporation rates have a significant importing effect on the sediment transport character of the inlets. However, after Phase 2, these effects are reduced by a factor 3-5 compared to Phase 0, depending on the wind. The new cross-sectional area design also results in both inlets being positioned near the stable equilibrium point on the Escoffier curve after Phase 2, which is supported by the sensitivity analysis. Hence, it is concluded that the proposed adaptations achieve the goal of developing Bardawil Lagoon into a morphologically stable inlet system. The study provides good insight into the effect of system interventions on the morphodynamic stability of the inlets as well as the flow dominance regarding those inlets. It is recommended to construct a validated morphological 3D model which can provide insight in the long term response of the system to those adaptations.","Bardawil; Lagoon; Inlet stability; escoffier","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-25","","","","","","31.151774,33.142986"

(graduation committee); Correljé, A. (mentor); Stikkelman, R.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","A trend in current society is reducing the environmental impact of products. One of the industries in which this trend is noticeable is the yachting industry. Yachts with a lower environmental impact are being demanded. Furthermore, regulations are being put in place that are likely to limit the effect yachts can have on the environment. One problem arising with this demand is that there is no clear indication of what the environmental impact of a yacht is. Therefore, the concept of the Yacht Environmental Transparency Index (YETI) has been developed. To ensure the YETI will be used in the industry, it is proposed that the development of this index be done by yacht builders and designers. However, there is no structured process how this group of stakeholders can develop a credible environmental impact index. Therefore, the goal of this research is to develop a process design towards a credible environmental impact index for yachts. The research is divided into five steps that contribute to the development of this process design and find an answer to the following main research question: How can a process design towards a credible environmental impact index for the operational lifetime of superyachts be developed? The research begins by defining an environmental impact index via a literature study. The literature study was undertaken to identify what must be developed by the yacht builders and designers and what must be the result of the process design. It was found that, to develop a credible index, a test procedure must form the basis of an environmental impact index. The second part of the literature study was executed to obtain insights into how a test procedure can be made credible. From the literature, seven principles have been identified that must be considered during the development of an environmental impact index. These seven principles can be divided into two groups. Where one groups contains principles that are regarding characteristics of the index that is developed, the other presents principles regarding the development process. The principles are not, however, specifically focused on the development of an index by stakeholders from an industry. Therefore, the IAD framework is used that structures the principles of credible index development and identifies the effects they have on the behaviour of and interactions between stakeholders during the development. Certain rules are provided by the framework that are coupled with principles. This process results in an overview of how a credible environmental impact index can be developed by stakeholders of an industry. The rules prescribe how the development process has to be governed and what has to be the outcome of the development process. The two groups of principles are assigned to the rules accordingly. From the IAD framework, it is apparent that the development of the index partly depends on the environment in which the stakeholders act and who is involved. Therefore, an analysis of the industry was executed to identify its influence on the development of an index. It was found that the technical characteristics of a yacht and the behaviour among yacht builders and designers complicate the development of an index. In addition to the influences of the industry, the development of the process design is based on the results obtained from a workshop with yacht builders and designers. This workshop had the goal to specify the rules assigned to the principles of environmental impact index development. These rules concerned how to develop a credible index that is capable of indicating the effect on the environment by a yacht during its operational lifetime. Based on these rules, a process design is developed. The process design consists of two aspects, the governance of the development process and steps that have to be executed in order to provide a credible index. The most important aspects of this process design are highly correlated with transparency. The credibility of the index is ensured when stakeholders develop it and reach a consensus on how the YETI should be developed. Any index that is developed must be made public, including the development method. A third party must verify whether what is included in the test procedure can be predicted and measured correctly and transparently. Also, standardisations must be developed for all procedures to calculate and verify the value of indicators included in the ‘test procedure’. Standardisations enable verification by stakeholders and therefore make the index credible. In general, credibility is objective and dependent on the perception stakeholders have of the index. The process design leads toward the YETI in such a way that that stakeholders are likely to perceive the index as credible.","Yacht Environmental Transparency Index; YETI; Environmetal Impact Assessment Index; Process Design; Yacht Building; IAD framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The rising anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> levels pose a significant threat to the environment as evidenced by the increase in the mean global temperature levels, and the rising ocean levels. To mitigate the challenges associated with rising CO<sub>2</sub> levels, there is an urgent need to move towards carbon neutral sources of energy and to curb carbon emission from large scale point emitters such as industries. Additionally, emitted CO<sub>2</sub> could be converted into energy dense organic fuels using carbon-neutral forms of energy. This not only helps in reducing the carbon emissions but also balances the intermittent nature of renewable energy supply. CO<sub>2</sub> could also be converted into platform chemicals such as ethylene/CO, which can be further up-converted or directly used in industry. Ethylene is particularly interesting due to its high<br/>energy density and wide industrial usage as a precursor in the polymer industry. Electroreduction of CO<sub>2</sub> provides one such approach to electrochemically convert CO<sub>2</sub> produced at large scale emitters to useful organic compounds. Different metallic catalysts are known to catalyse the electrochemical reduction towards different products, which follows from Sabatier’s principle. In this study copper is used as the model catalyst due to its unique ability to electrochemically convert CO<sub>2</sub> to multi-carbon products, such as ethylene. From a cell design perspective conventional electrochemical reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> in aq. media suffers from low production rates due to the low solubility of CO<sub>2</sub> in aq. electrolytes which makes it not feasible from an industrial standpoint. To overcome the low production rates, this study was carried out on novel gas diffusion electrodes. Another factor limiting the implementation of CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysers on an industrial scale, is the scalability of the catalyst synthesis. To improve this, electrodeposition of copper catalysts was employed. Electrodeposition is a well-established industrial technique and integrable within the existing infrastructure. Electrodeposition facilitates in-situ growth of the catalyst on gas diffusion layers, thereby providing a facile alternative to the conventional multi-step process for catalyst synthesis. Different morphologies of copper were synthesized by varying the electrodeposition process parameters. Copper nanowires were also synthesized by using templated electro-deposition techniques. The catalysts were characterised before and after the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction experiments by Scanning ElectronMicroscopy, and X- Ray Diffraction. CO<sub>2</sub> reduction experiments using the synthesised copper catalysts were carried out over a range of potentials. A peak Faradaic Efficiency (FE%) of 15% was measured at -1.5 V vs RHE (uncompensated) for ethylene, 19% FE at -1.1 V vs RHE for formic acid, and 13% FE at -1.5 V vs RHE for methane. It was also seen that the catalyst suffered from stability issues which were overcome by using pulsed electrolysis. Using pulsed electrolysis the lifetime of the catalyst was increased from 30 minutes to 15 hours.","CO2; Electrochemical Reduction; CO2 Conversion; Electrocatalysis; Gas Diffusion Electrode; Copper; Electrodeposition; Copper Nanowires","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-25","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

This creates several problems, such as heat stress in cities, reduced biodiversity and the disappearance of greenery in cities. The World Health Organization has made a list of indicators based on which the sustainability of cities can be assessed. One of these indicators is a minimum amount of 9 m2 green space per capita. Currently, few cities meet this requirement, which threatens the quality of life for city dwellers. A possible solution to obtain more green area in urban regions can be to have more green surfaces on buildings and structures. To realize this in an efficient, low maintenance, and cheap way, concrete could be designed to stimulate the growth of mosses. Spontaneous abundant moss growth on young concrete structures can actually already be observed in the build environment, however this is often unintentional and unwanted, and is seen as degradation of the concrete. A better understanding of why spontaneous moss growth occurs on some constructions while it does not on others can help to intentionally design green concrete structures, and eliminate unwanted spontaneous moss growth on concrete. It has been found in this research that the curing conditions and the cement type being used are two major influencing factors that can contribute to the presence or absence of abundant moss growth on current relative young concrete constructions. A hospitable concrete surface is needed to support the growth of a biofilm, that can subsequently develop in moss. This hospitable concrete surface is provided by the concrete microstructure, a lowered pH, and a sufficient surface roughness. To obtain concrete that is bioreceptive and will enable mosses to grow on its surface, a low-clinker content concrete must be used that is insufficiently cured. This will cause a porous and permeable outer layer of the concrete, that has been related to moss growth on concrete. Due to the low buffering capacity towards alkalinity, the pH at the cover zone of the concrete will be lower, thereby making the surface more attractive for micro-organisms to settle on. Another effect of insufficient curing is an increase in carbonation, which also leads to a more porous and permeable cover zone for low-clinker concrete. To prevent moss growth on concrete, a dense microstructure and a high pH at the outer layer of the concrete must be created. This can be obtained by using a high-clinker content concrete. From this research it can be concluded that a high-clinker mix is relatively not very vulnerable for the curing conditions. A high-clinker content concrete will provide a dense microstructure and high buffer capacity towards alkalinity, even though it has been cured insufficiently.","Concrete; Bioreceptivity; Moss","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-03-24","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

To improve the accuracy with which these tasks can be performed, CNNs are typically designed to be deep, encompassing a large number of neural network layers. As a result, the computational intensity and storage requirements increase dramatically, necessitating hardware acceleration to reduce the execution latency. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) in particular are well-suited for hardware acceleration of CNN inference, since the underlying hardware can be tailored to rapidly and efficiently perform the required operations. To this end, Xilinx introduced the FINN (Fast, Scalable Quantized Neural Network Inference on FPGAs) framework to leverage FPGAs for Neural Network (NN) inference. The FINN end-to-end deep learning framework converts high-level descriptions of CNN models into fast and scalable FPGA inference accelerator designs that are based on a custom dataflow architecture. In this dataflow architecture the input data are streamed in a feed forward fashion through a pipeline of per-layer dedicated compute units, that each have on-chip access to the associated NN parameters. In order to keep the compute units occupied, specific throughput requirements have to be satisfied by the memory subsystem. These throughput requirements directly dictate the shapes of the on-chip buffers that contain the NN parameter values. Especially for accelerators that exploit a high degree of parallelism, these memory shapes map poorly to the available on-chip memory resources of FPGA devices. As a result, these resources are typically underutilized, which leads an On-Chip Memory (OCM) deficiency, and limits the amount of parallelism that can be exploited. In this thesis, a methodology is proposed that improves the mapping efficiency of NN parameter buffers to the embedded Block RAM (BRAM) resources on FPGAs, without negatively impacting the accelerator throughput. To accomplish this, an architecture is proposed where the memory subsystem and compute units are decoupled, and operate as a producer-consumer system. Within this architecture, the memory subsystem functions at a higher clock frequency relative to the compute units, which enables the memory subsystem to match the consumption rate of the compute units when multiple NN parameter buffers are clustered within the same BRAM instance. Furthermore, a genetic algorithm is used to find optimal group arrangements for these clusters such that the mapping efficiency is improved, and the throughput requirements are still met. The proposed methodology has been applied to a number of CNN accelerators, and demonstrates BRAM reductions of up to 30%. The observed BRAM reductions enable existing FINN accelerator designs to be ported to smaller FPGA devices while maintaining the computational throughput.","Computer Architecture; Heterogeneous acceleration; Dataflow computing; Memory; FPGA; Convolutional Neural Networks; Combinatorial Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

The aim of this thesis is provide an extension to this model by parameterizing bottom stress using a partial slip parameter and viscosity. Also level variations of the bed are taken into account in this thesis. A width-averaged model of an idealized stratified tidal basin is developed. With increased bottom stress, the velocity near the bed is significantly slowed down, whereas increasing the viscosity slows down the velocity further away from the bed. The interface fluctuates more when the viscosity is low, the wavelength of these fluctuations is decreased with increasing viscosity. Resonance characteristics in the hydrodynamics are dampened severely by increased viscosity, and less by bottom stress. Increasing the slope of the bed results in a lag of tidal dynamics at the end of the embayment compared to at the embayment entrance. A sloped bed also dampens the resonance characteristics.","Tidal embayment; Hydrodynamic model; Idealised model","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is difficult to measure evaporation, due to the influence of the plant water storage on the water availability during the dry season. The seasonal variation in the plant water storage makes it even harder, as the time lag between the plant water storage and the terrestrial groundwater storage varies between the 0 to 90 days depending on the vegetation density. (Tian et al., 2018). It is unclear why the trees prefer this early flushing strategy and what is triggering the shedding of old leaves and flushing of new leaves. It is difficult to remotely sense the variation during this period. In this report, the outputs of several evaporation products and the vegetation indices are studied and compared to see how models follow the transition period. Three models, that are chosen for the comparison use different methods to indirectly calculate the evaporation flux. The first model is the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS), which is based on the Surface Energy Balance as the name suggests and calculates the evaporation through land-atmosphere relationships. The second model is the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM); this model uses the water balance model to calculate the water stress factor and in return the actual evaporation. And lastly, the MODIS Terrestrial Evapotranspiration (MOD16A2) which uses the Penman-Monteith equation as a basis to separately calculate the evaporative fluxes such as transpiration, soil evaporation, and interception. The outputs of the evaporation models differ quite a lot, especially during the transition period. This is among other things due to the input variable such as vegetation indices. There are several vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) and the Leaf Area Index (LAI). The difference in the indexes is minimal and only small timing differences can be found. This means that the output differences are not influenced by the vegetation indices. MODIS follows the trends found by the vegetation indices best as it does not have the shortcomings that GLEAM and SEBS display. GLEAM overestimates the water stress because the model doesn’t account for plant water storage. While SEBS responds well until the start of July in which the model starts to oscillate. The oscillations could be due to the slash and burn culture which happens around this time which could impact SEBS substantially due to its dependency on temperature and radiation. Even if the MODIS output is the most similar to the vegetation output, it is limited by the fact that it is average values and daily variations might be lost. As this research is based on mostly satellite images supplemented by field observations, no statements can be made about it how accurate the models are. But based on this research, the MODIS model seems to be the preferred evaporation output.","Evaporation; Model; Miombo Woodlands; Transition period; Remotely sensed data; Zambia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-03-23","","","","Civil Engineering","ZAMSECUR",""

Together with a growing memory pressure caused by higher CPU core counts combined with multi-tenant systems, this causes the need for new memory technologies. Recently, various technologies are becoming available for commercial use. Examples of these technologies are memory types like non-volatile RAM. These technologies generally have different characteristics than traditional DRAM. To be able to fully utilise the potential of these new memory types, a better understanding of memory usage in modern systems is required. A way to gain a better understanding is through memory traces.<br/><br/>Solutions that are currently available either do not support multi-core architectures or cause a severe slowdown. Therefore, this thesis presents a novel approach to gather full-system after-cache memory access traces. The proposed system is a hybrid framework which consists of the QEMU emulator combined with a custom distributed cache and page table simulator. A modified version of QEMU, called QMEMU, is devised to improve tracing performance and allow tracing instruction fetches.<br/>By leveraging the existing tracing functionality of QEMU only a small amount of modifications have to be made to QEMU. The traces produced by QMEMU contain virtual addresses. However, for accurate cache simulation, the physical addresses have to be used. Tracing the physical address instead of the virtual address for each memory access is shown to cause a 70% slowdown when using QMEMU.<br/><br/>To find these physical addresses for the traced accesses, a novel approach is employed. This approach simulates the guest page tables outside the critical path for memory tracing and therefore does not decrease performance. Using QMEMU traces can be gathered with a speedup of up to 42.6 times over the gem5 simulator for benchmarks of the PARSEC suite.<br/><br/>In the second part of the framework, which performs memory, cache, and page table simulation, cache simulation is found the most computationally intensive task. Therefore in the proposed framework cache simulation is performed in a parallel and distributed manner. Most modern systems use set-associative caches, simulation can be parallelised without reducing accuracy by dividing the memory access traces based on these cache sets. Using this approach 10 Million accesses can be processed per second by the simulator when simulating a single modern cache hierarchy. When simulating 7 different cache hierarchies concurrently a throughput of 6 Million accesses per second is reached. The simulated guest page tables provide additional information like the number of accesses or virtual memory size for each process of the guest workload. This information can be used to decrease the size of the semantic gap between memory traces and their meaning. The proposed framework is evaluated by comparing it to CMP$im and gem5 using the PARSEC benchmark suite.<br","Cache simulation; QEMU; NVRAM; Distributed; Full-system; Tracing; Memory; gem5","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Despite this, there is little research which carries out a detailed comparison of these systems. This is also true for research which analyses the effect policies regarding climate change are having on DAC development. Furthermore, there is no available analysis on potential stakeholders for DAC companies. These factors have contributed to a lack of widespread implementation of DAC. By answering the following research question the negative effect these elements are having on DAC development can be minimised. “How do the most promising available DAC systems described in literature compare, where does DAC fit in current policy and how can DAC companies best position themselves to maximise the potential of their technology?” To answer this question a set of criteria are used and categorised as contributing to different objectives which can help DAC development. This can be used to identify technology and policy combinations which are likely to be successful. Following this a stakeholder analysis is carried out from the point of view of DAC companies. This is used to identify where there is dependency between DAC companies and other stakeholders to achieve their objective. Through this analysis it was additionally found that combining an amine carbon capture system which captures CO2 from flue gas with a humidity swing DAC system which captures CO2 from the atmosphere that an extra 8% of CO2 can be captured than with the amine carbon captures system alone. In this system the humidity swing DAC system uses the waste heat from the amine carbon capture system as a heat source. This means that there are no extra thermal energy requirements to capture this extra CO2. This type of system can be used in the energy production sector where energy is produced from natural gas or coal and therefore reduce emissions from this sector. By using a policy which passes the cost of this system onto the consumer by promising a minimum price for electricity it, generally called a contract for differences, it reduces burden on public finances and therefore be an attractive option for governments. The implications for this study are that DAC companies and energy suppliers from natural gas or coal with an amine carbon capture system should explore potential collaboration. This is because it has been shown in this research that technically these systems can be combined to reduce CO2 emissions with minimal increase in operating cost.","DAC; Direct air capture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

The transition effectuated the adaptation of large volumes of wind and solar based generation capacity. The intermittent power-output of these Variable Renewable Energy Sources challenges the balancing operation of the electricity network in particular. Despite the availability of different solutions like storage, smart applications and infrastructure substitution, large investments in transmission capacity are inevitable. While the need for additional transmission capacity is evident, the realization of transmission capacity has become increasingly complex due to the uncertainty surrounding the future landscape in which this expansion would take place. The many possible pathways towards a sustainable future make it increasingly difficult to predict the development of generation and load profiles and thereby complicate the identification of capacity requirements within the electricity network. This raises the need for new approaches that address the high degree of uncertainty present within the electricity domain. Literature describes the framework of Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty as an alternative approach to addressing the role of uncertainty in Transmission Expansion Planning. In contrast to traditional scenario planning approaches, this approach focuses on the computational evaluation of large numbers of scenarios that are sampled from a constrained uncertainty space. The idea is to inform decision making by exploring the uncertainty space and identifying conditions under which certain outcomes occur. Consequently, decision makers are aware of the conditions under which interventions might succeed or fail and are therefor able to design strategies that perform in different futures. The potential of the framework of Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty in the context of Transmission Expansion Planning is explored through a proof-of-concept approach that focuses on Transmission Expansion Planning in the context of The Netherlands. In this approach a simplified integrated market simulation and network model are used to explore the effects of different quantities of wind and solar based generation capacity on the required transmission capacity within the electricity network. Instead of using merely three traditional scenarios, this thesis has evaluated and analyzed 20,000 different scenarios. The results of these analyses have been reviewed by domain experts during two workshop sessions. These sessions established that approaches to Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty could provide useful insights in relation to model sensitivity, the reduction of dimensional complexity of the uncertainty space and the development of scenarios that describe areas within the uncertainty space. The sessions furthermore established that the application of Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty in relation to Transmission Expansion Planning requires further development in order to become a viable alternative to traditional scenario planning in a corporate environment. The application of Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty approaches within the context of Transmission Expansion Planning provides a unique opportunity to make the uncertainty space more visible for Transmission System Operators. The approach provides the building blocks to design adaptive investment strategies which in turn are geared towards facilitating the energy transition in a robust manner.","Transmission Expansion Planning; Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty; Exploratory Modelling; Deep Uncertainty; Electricity Network; Scenario Discovery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Gavin, Kenneth (mentor); de Jong, Koen (mentor); Lengkeek, H.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In situ tests, such as the cone penetration test (CPT), are a popular tool for geotechnical engineers because they are an efficient and economical method for routine site characterisation, soil profiling and estimation of constitutive properties of soil. The main problem with interpreting in situ test results is the large amount of empiricism that engineers have to rely on. Furthermore, the rise in complexity of constitutive soil models have made soil interpretation from experimental data ever more challenging. Constitutive models in numerical analyses are used to simulate the stress-strain response of soils and each model is governed by a set of parameters that quantifies the mechanical behaviour of soil. A consequence for the increased complexity of a constitutive model is the increased number of parameters to be defined from a larger number of experimental tests. This is why parameter determination is still one of the most challenging tasks faced by geotechnical engineers. The challenges in soil interpretation from experimental data have led to an increasing demand for a more efficient parameter determination system for performing more reliable numerical simulations in geotechnical engineering. This study explores the applicability of graphs to develop a generic system for the determination of constitutive model parameters from in situ test results. Graphs are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects in a network and benefit from their ability to visualise complex problems. In the same manner, the use of graphs in a parameter determination system could generate valid relations, or paths, between parameters in a network. This should give the user of the system, i.e., the geotechnical engineer, both insight in and control over the system. The proposed strategy aims to increase the confidence of derived parameters from in situ test results. It should eventually provide guidance for the user in selecting the right constitutive model and corresponding parameters for the considered application, in order to use the full potential of numerical analysis. This study presents a proof of concept for an automated system to determine constitutive model parameters from in situ test results. Key aspects of the system are: <i>transparency </i>and <i>adaptability</i>. The system is kept transparent, since users are able to verify how available information (i.e., expertise by the engineer) is used by the system to arrive at a solution. The system is kept adaptable, since users can add their expertise into the system without having to make modifications to the system and since developers can easily expand the system in the future. This study illustrates how a system can automatically generate paths between parameters in a network (i.e., a graph),using the external database (e.g., a spreadsheet) as input by the geotechnical engineer. The focus of this system is on determining engineering parameters based on CPT data for coarse-grained soils. However, the universality of the system allows the system to be extended to a wider range of soils and in situ tests. Separate ongoing research efforts are devoted to further validating and tweaking of the system.<br","parameter determination; constitutive modelling; in situ testing; soil characterisation; cone penetration test; graph; network analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-19","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

The letters bare the first-hand witness of his unique life stories and precious insights about his art. Dedicated to the works and stories of Van Gogh, the Van Gogh Museum (VGM) wants to redesign the current letter gallery in the museum, aiming at creating personal connections between visitors and Van Gogh. To achieve this, multiple user research activities were conducted, based on which three design strategies of the letter gallery were defined. Then a design concept of the gallery was generated. There are three scopes of the research: ""personal connection"", ""personal connection with Van Gogh"", and ""connecting with Van Gogh in the VGM letter gallery"". To address these scopes, a group session, two rounds of visitor interviews, a Van Gogh fans interview and a letter booklet research were done. With the research insights coming together, the author generated the model of ""layers of connections with Van Gogh"" which illustrates that in order to achieve personal connections with Van Gogh in the letter gallery, the design strategies can be: 1. Trigger visitors' interests in letters through art; 2. Hit visitors' focus points by layering the information; 3. Encourage further exploration of the letters after visitors leave the gallery. Then, how to realize such design strategies? The author proposed a concept of the gallery, consisting of six parts: 1. Introduction; 2. Trailer; 3. Interactive programme; 4. Narrative structure; 5. Online content and 6. Link to VGM multimedia guide. The design explorations mainly focused on ""part 3 Interactive programme"" and ""part 4 Narrative structure"", with three concepts generated for each of the two parts and followed by visitor evaluations. After the design explorations, the final concept was presented, consisting of part 1~4. Part 1 Introduction shows the letter themes in the form of stamps, to make the information easier to understand. Part 2 Trailer consists of projections of a painting and a letter quote of the same theme which switch every 10 seconds, to trigger visitors' interests in more letter contents that they will see next. Part 3 Interactive programme give visitors a quick opportunity to engage with the letters without diving into the whole story.

(mentor); Steur, Erik (mentor); van den Boom, Ton (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The integration of variable renewable energy sources (RESs) in the electrical power grid leads to larger and faster variations in the power demanded from controllable power sources. This is a problem, because flexibility of (base load) power plants is limited. Solid oxide reversible cells(SORCs) can be used as load-shifting devices to reduce these power variations by converting electricity to hydrogen (solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) mode) when power demand is low and converting hydrogen to electricity (solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) mode) when power demand is high. However, the introduction of SORCs is challenging. It is a promising long-term energy storage technology, but it is in its development stage. Apart from prohibitive costs, challenges also lie within durability and efficiency under dynamic operation. Development of control strategies is essential for maintaining optimal operating conditions. Therefore, this study researches the ability of SORCs to operate in a mixed power grid by developing an SORC model and power disturbance rejection controller which ensures safe operating conditions.<br/>A dynamic 0D SORC model was developed. It describes a single cell at the center of a large stack of identical cells, which makes it representative for large-scale SORCs. The model is based on SOFC models and uses the current density to indicate the operating mode of the SORC. The benefit of this approach is that one continuous model describes both operating modes. Validation of the model is based on comparison of static cell voltage-current density curves from literature and from a small stack experiment. Open-loop analysis of the model showed that the system is stable and can be decoupled. It also showed that development of gain-scheduling controllers was necessary to handle the exothermic, hydrogen consuming SOFC mode and endothermic, hydrogen producing SOEC mode. This motivated the design of gain-scheduling H-infinity tuned proportional-integral (PI) controller, which were used to control the positive electrode, electrolyte, negative electrode (PEN) structure temperature and fuel channel composition by manipulating the air and fuel flow rate, respectively. Two methods were compared for specifying the performance of the controller. The first method was based on the desired closed-loop bandwidths and the second method was based on the bandwidth of the disturbance. The first method was superior to the second method, because the obtainable closed-loop bandwidths are faster than the bandwidth of the disturbance.<br/>This study shows that gain-scheduling PI controllers allow SORCs to be used for load shifting applications in a mixed power grid. Further research is needed to validate the dynamics of the model and to identify the influence of balance of plant (BOP) dynamics on controller performance.<br","SORC; Solid oxide reversible cell; Control; PI Control; Modelling; Energy storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Picnic is an online supermarket currently operational in the Netherlands and Germany. Groceries are ordered from an app and delivered to the customer using a last-mile delivery vehicle. This last-mile delivery vehicle is currently used for densely populated cities and works well enough to support the current number of deliveries. However, this specific current last-mile delivery vehicle can not access all households in the Netherlands. This is because its speed is limited to 50 km/h and can only carry a limited amount of cargo. In order to expand and reach new households, Picnic is looking for a new last-mile delivery vehicle. Having started a joint venture with VDL and TNO, Picnic is looking to design and build their very own last-mile delivery vehicle that is purpose built for their needs. They are looking to become bigger, faster and stronger on the roads. Increasing the vehicle speed to 80 km/h and carrying more cargo allows them to reach the households that are currently out of the geographic scope. Having a vehicle that can reach those extra households would significantly increase their customerbase and consequently market share in the supermarket space. With the opportunity to build a purpose specific vehicle, they also have the opportunity to control the aesthetic of the vehicle. Picnic relies heavily on their brand image and identity as a means of differentiation from their competitors. Therefore translating their brand assets to the vehicle will give them a stronger brand presence in the consumer environment. Having identified the raison d’etre of the vehicle, reaching new households in less densely populated areas, research was carried out to find different design cues and assets that could be leveraged in the exterior design of the new vehicle. The result of this was that the new vehicle had to look quirky, friendly and electric. Accompanying these terms was a design vision also derived through research and in talking to the relevant stakeholders. “Design a next generation company icon, to remain a local hero”. Using this input, the sketchphase was conducted with a funnel approach. Creating a broad spectrum of different designs and options that were in accordance with the design vision and form language derived from the research. Through method of elimination with the input from the different stakeholders, the sketchphase reached a point of maturity, which consequently yielded a final design. This final design satisfied all the requirements derived from the research and embodied the Picnic aesthetic while remaining functional for the runners. This final design was thereafter iterated once more and presented using renders from a CAD model along with detailed renders of key features and elements of the design. That is the final phase of the project and the culmination of the efforts documented in this report. Further recommendations are also included at the end of this report. They aim to develop the sophistication of the design to the point that it is ready for VDL and TNO to create a proposal for the next steps required to take the design to a first prototype.","Automotive design; Exterior design; Design aesthetics; Last-mile delivery; Picnic Technologies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","Graduation project",""

This thesis presents an assessment of flight dynamics and control of differential thrust aircraft under engine inoperative conditions with minimum control speed. A methodology consisting of an aerodynamic data acquisition module and a non-linear six-degrees-of-freedom flight dynamics model is proposed. The data acquisition module uses FlightStream solver to capture the aerodynamic performance data. The assessment consists of studying the aero-propulsive effects, control of the aircraft, rudder removal, and vertical tailplane size reduction. The directional control is achieved in the flight dynamics model by using a proportional–integral–derivative controller to generate a yaw command, which is distributed to the propulsors by thrust mapping. Additionally, drag mode is investigated, in which the outermost idling propulsors are used to generate maximum drag, allowing the non-idling inner propulsors to produce more thrust. A modified version of the NASA X-57 aircraft is selected as the case study aircraft. Results show that during the engine inoperative conditions at minimum control speed, the aircraft experiences significant loss in thrust and power augmented lift due to the failed propulsors and the directional control effort. Therefore, the stall and minimum control speed are increased, and the aircraft must accelerate to prevent a stall. Consequently, the aircraft experiences a temporary reduction in altitude during the recovery maneuver. Vertical tailplane reduction is seen possible, with differential thrust fully replacing the performance of the rudder. It was seen that the response time of the directional control has a significant impact on the maximum yawing angle and temporary altitude reduction. Finally, the use of drag mode reduced the maximum yaw angle and increased the climb gradient.","differential thrust; flight dynamics; aero-propulsive effects; vertical tail; lateral-directional stability and control; engine inoperative conditions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This study is supposed to be a simplified version of a Smart Rotor, a mechanism which deals with the reduction of unsteady loads acting on a wind turbine and aims to understand the behavior of this type of control under dynamic stall conditions. The controller acts on the velocity of the flaps, and pressure sensors are used to detect the unsteady loads, which are generated by actuating the wing model in a sinusoidal motion. Two different regimes are considered: attached flow (oscillations around zero angle of attack, where little flow separation is expected) and dynamic stall (oscillations close to the static stall angle). The influence of actuation frequency and controller time lag is also studied, as these parameters were found to be crucial for such a concept during the literature review. A reduction of 87.5% in the standard deviation of the lift is obtained for a frequency of 0.2Hz and time lag in the control system of 12ms for attached flow conditions. The reduction of the standard deviation of the lift deteriorates for increased frequency and time lag. The proposed controller is also able to reduce the loads during dynamic stall, although the reduction is smaller, close to 40% in the reduction of the lift coefficient. A maximum reduction of 59% in the peak-to-peak loads experienced during dynamic stall is observed, for 0.2Hz and a time lag of 12ms. Time lag is again crucial for this reduction, and larger and faster actuation systems are needed to fully compensate for the larger drop in loads. However, the active load control of the loads during dynamic stall can negatively affect the aerodynamic damping of the model, since the flap actuation is dependent on the detachment of the leading-edge vortex from the surface of the wing. The flap actuation is also shown to delay the onset of dynamic stall, by increasing the static stall angle with respect to the case without flap deflection.","control; dynamic stall; load alleviation; smart rotor; pressure; aerodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Vanderlande provides a pick-and-place robot (SIR) that helps in improving capacity. However, SIR's capacity is limited by its vacuum gripper and its inability to solve failures. The aim of this thesis is to improve SIR by adding a second gripper and reasoning capabilities. To this end, a grasp synthesis approach is developed that complements the vacuum gripper, based on existing approaches in literature and the devices available to SIR. Furthermore, an ontology is developed according to Methontology that allows the robot to reason about item properties and failures, while providing operators with insight into its thought process. The improved system is referred to as RSIR.<br/> The grasp synthesis approach, applicable to parallel-jaw grippers, synthesizes grasps by detecting parallel edges in depth data. Tests on real depth data showed that the approach synthesized reasonable grasps in reasonable time for a variety of items, some of which are not graspable by SIR's vacuum gripper. It did not need a segmentation of the items to do so. Furthermore, RSIR was tested on a virtual robotic set-up. The results showed that RSIR reasoned how best to complete a task when provided with information about a robot's components and possible item properties. RSIR also drew conclusions based on the execution of the task, and reasoned what actions should be performed to prevent failures from re-occurring. The above results show RSIR's potential for autonomously estimating item properties and selecting the best approach for grasping an item. In practice, this decreases downtime and thus improves capacity. Because RSIR is designed to be expandable to related tasks, its benefits could be useful in more of Vanderlande's applications than just the SIR system.","Ontology; Knowledge Representation; Reasoning; Robotics; Pick-and-Place; Grasp Synthesis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-03-20","","","","","",""

(mentor); Lhermitte, S.L.M. (graduation committee); Coenders-Gerrits, Miriam (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In this study, an unsupervised classification approach is used to investigate and characterize the spatial and temporal variability of MetOp-A ASCAT backscatter (σ◦) and the TUW SMR vegetation parameters across mainland France between 2007 and 2017. Currently, soil moisture data is retrieved from ASCAT backscatter measurements using the TU Wien Soil Moisture Retrieval (TUW SMR) approach. To correct for the influence of vegetation on soil moisture, two so-called ’vegetation parameters’ are also estimated from the backscatter measurements. These vegetation parameters are the slope (σ′) and curvature (σ′′) of a second-order Taylor polynomial which describes the incidence angle dependence of backscatter. Recently, Steele-Dunne et al. (2019) showed that the slope and curvature contain significant information about vegetation phenology and vegetation water dynamics across the North-American grasslands, suggesting that the vegetation parameters are a potentially valuable source of information on vegetation dynamics. This study further investigates the value of the vegetation parameters as a source of information about vegetation dynamics for land cover types present in France. 3492 ASCAT grid points were clustered using agglomerative hierarchical clustering based on σ′ and subsequently analysed. The results show that clusters based on σ′ are contiguous and can resemble distinct land cover features; areas like Paris and the Alps are clearly visible in cluster maps. While the clusters differ in terms of σ′ – which follows from a clustering based on σ′ – the results show that the clusters generally also have distinct σ◦ and σ′′ characteristics. This suggests that the clusters represent ’scattering surfaces’ that differ in terms of their seasonal scattering characteristics. It was found that grid points with a heterogeneous land cover footprint tend to have noisy seasonal backscatter signatures, while homogeneous land cover footprints have more recognizable seasonal behavior. Additionally, certain backscatter signatures tend to correspond to certain land cover footprints; in particular the agricultural area around Paris produced clear σ◦ , σ′, and σ′′ signatures corresponding to specific growth stages of wheat and the rapid land cover change during the agricultural season. In general, the results are consistent with the existing assumptions that σ′ is a measure for vegetation density and σ′′ is a measure for the relative dominance of ground-bounce and direct scattering from vertical vegetation constituents. Finally, clustering was performed on ten years of dynamically estimated σ′ and a measure for robustness was introduced to quantify the clustering certainty for each grid point. Robust grid points are found in areas that have relatively stable land cover like the Alps or Paris, suggesting that these areas exhibit predictable seasonal backscatter behavior with low interannual variability. Poor robustness scores are mainly found in north-west France, where land cover is heterogeneous and seasonal backscatter behavior is highly variable. This study confirms that the TUW SMR vegetation parameters contain valuable information about vegetation phenology across different land cover footprints. Furthermore, it was shown that unsupervised classification methods based on the vegetation parameters are able to identify areas with similar scattering characteristics, and are able to show how these areas change over time.","ASCAT; Backscatter; C-band; Scatterometry; Soil Moisture; Machine Learning; Unsupervised classification; Clustering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-20","","","","Water Management","",""

Within these networks, hierarchical levels can be distinguished where different levels have different functions. These hierarchical levels can be analyzed but there is no way to quantitatively determine the hierarchy in a PTN. Therefore, this paper presents a metric to quantify the hierarchy in PTN to increase the understanding of these complex networks. In order to determine the hierarchy, a metric is developed based on a combined topological and empirical approach. The metric is a multiplication of three different elements which are the topological influence, (non-)redundancy and transfer potential. Together these elements are applied to define the hierarchical degree of nodes in a network. Furthermore, to determine the hierarchy of a network as a whole, a hierarchical coefficient, based on the distribution and inequality of the hierarchical degree in the network is developed. The metric has been applied to case-studies for the Dutch cities of Amsterdam and Rotterdam which allows for different state and cross-network comparison. The results show some expected yet non-trivial results identifying different patterns in network structures for network states and different spatial distribution of hierarchy between networks. Furthermore, by dividing the network into functional levels, a hierarchical structure can be identified.<br/>Throughout this study, a new method to quantify hierarchy in PTN, based on different approaches, is developed which can be seen as the most important contribution of this research. While this study explores the implications of this metric, it can be applied in numerous different contexts. Furthermore, in potential the metric has numerous network related applications such decreasing vulnerability and solving bottlenecks.","Transportation; Hierarchy; Networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

To ensure maximal cleaning coverage, accurate localization to keep track of the robot trajectory on the ship hull is essential, but also challenging. Contrary to the VS case, drift-free localization from motion sensors is not applicable on the FB. Instead, the current system relies heavily on operator input, who in turn relies on features (such as the quay wall, a line feature) appearing on imagery from a Forward Looking Sonar (FLS) to determine the robot pose. Human inattentiveness caused by the high workload of cleaning operations makes this method error-prone and sensitive to drift. In the future, Fleet Cleaner aims to develop an autonomous robot to relieve the operators from the task of localization and improve cleaning performance. As no previous work was performed on this matter, this thesis is a contribution to this vision, by developing a sonar-based framework enabling drift-free localization of a ship hull cleaning robot on FBs. Before the conceptual phase, two objectives are formulated to achieve the thesis goal. The first is to provide a sonar-based algorithm measuring the line parameters of the quay wall, as lateral and heading reference. The second objective seeks to fuse the FLS-based measurements with motion sensors to achieve drift-free localization. From there, the operating conditions relevant to the systems are defined, and both functional and performance requirements are formulated, where the latter define metrics that measure the accuracy of the systems w.r.t. manually defined ground truths. <br/>For the first objective, three candidate solutions for tracking the quay wall line parameters are selected. These are first implemented with recorded data in an iterative tuning procedure, then validated where the Total Least-Squares (TLS)-based line tracker with Gaussian filtering arises as a proof of concept. Although the algorithm is fast enough to function for each incoming sonar image, it does not fulfill the requirements for accuracy and robustness, a problem solvable by tuning with better data and the use of filters. For the second objective, also three sensor fusion algorithms are selected. Analysis of their properties with regards to performance revealed the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) as the most suitable solution, where tuning was performed heuristically. Validation tests again showed partial success, with fast computation times and greatly improved but still insufficient accuracy of the FLS measurements, although localization drift was reduced within the required limits. Mainly, the poor predictions from auxiliary sensors degrade performance, but also the imperfect nature of manually defined ground truths exaggerate the errors. To improve and complete the localization system, it is recommended to implement trajectory optimization for an improved fit of estimated poses with sensory data, and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) based on weld line detection to reduce longitudinal drift.","Localization; Forward looking sonar; Computer vision; Sensor fusion; Mobile robot","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-03-19","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The city of Amsterdam needs a reliable transport and mobility system to foster economic growth, but at the same time transport is causing congestion, pollution and accidents. To scientifically explore the research question, Transport Innovation Adoption Theory and Transition Management Theory are used as theoretical research lenses. The Political Economy Framework Political Economy Framework (PEF) from Feitelson and Salomon (2004), has been complemented with the PESTEL Classification Framework to systematically address the feasibility of Urban Waterway Transport (UWT). <br/><br/>Desk-research and expert interviewing have been used to obtain a rich understanding of the factors determining feasibility and a focus group meeting is organised to envision pathways to overcome existing failure factors. The extent to which waterway transport can be implemented as a sustainable freight transport solution depends on the condition that the alternative, road transport, becomes less attractive. Many of the canal walls and bridges in Amsterdam are in bad condition and as a result of maintenance projects and a ban on heavy freight vehicles in the centre, road accessibility is considered to decrease. This stimulates a modal shift towards waterway transport, but a lack of transshipment locations, vague transport policy and failing cooperation seem reason for failing implementation. <br/><br/>Currently, clear policy and efficient transshipment technology are lacking. Both public and private actors recognised the importance of executing pilots to fill existing knowledge gaps regarding the development of transport policy and technology. Waterway transporters are willing to participate in long-term pilots, but require political support in the form of temporarily transshipment permits and subsidies to succeed. Conflicting public interests and a lack of long-term focus seem to hold against the providence of financial and regulatory support. <br/><br/>For practical purposes, this thesis contributes by recommending the Transition Management Approach to foster sustainable waterway transport development. Three practical policy strategies are suggested to foster the potential for implementing urban waterway transport in Amsterdam.<br/>This study theoretically contributes by providing an innovative analysis framework that constitutes a pragmatic, dynamic and multi-level perspective approach to improve understanding on innovation implementation. To support policy makers and scientists in the evaluation of innovations, it is recommended to explore and improve the applicability of the suggested framework by applying the framework to address other cases.","Urban Waterway Transport; Inland Waterway Transport; City Logistics; Amsterdam; Urban Freight Transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The increased cost is mainly due to the used sensors, such as linear encoders for stacked stages and laser interferometers for planar stages. It is a trade-off between the performance and cost.

By using a cost-effective linear image sensor (2000 pixels) the same precision could be achieved while the sample rate can be significantly higher. This thesis presents a new methodology to measure the 3DOF(<i>xyθ<sub>z</sub></i>) of a planar stage with a single linear charge-coupled device (CCD) from a self-designed pattern. The feasibility of the methodology has been shown with a self-developed line scan simulation tool. A sensor system has been built and implemented in a demonstrator to gain knowledge about the different sensitivities in the sensor system and to demonstrate the possibilities of the sensor system.<br","CCD; CMOS; Linear image sensor; Moiré; 3DOF; Planar precision positioning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

This leads to a crucial role for double-loop learning, which involves modifying the existing norms, policies and objectives. Without double-loop learning, the transition experiments will be constrained in their influence. However, there is currently a lack of knowledge on how to facilitate, guide and support learning processes in transition experiments. This leads to impeded progress for the client, consortium and national government, due to lost opportunities. Therefore, the following research question is formulated: What key governance mechanisms, focused on starting conditions or design and organization, facilitate double-loop learning in mobility transition experiments? Two case studies are conducted, using desk research and semi-structured interviews, with each case study being characterized by its decision-making process. The results of this study indicate that i) involving different perspectives, such as the client, consortium and national government, are of added value to the development of learning processes and ii) paying attention to the identified conditions will provide further support. It is recommended to put more emphasis on the ability of pilots to generate knowledge on what facilitates learning processes and to center the discussion of knowledge building on research protocols. It is expected that enhanced research protocols will provide the groundwork for generating more practical knowledge in this area. This will support the development of recommendations for different stakeholders on ways to facilitate learning processes.","Governance; Experimentation; Transition Experiment; Learning; Methodology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

One of these challenges is maintaining a stable power grid. On the power grid, the amount of energy generated and consumed should be in balance. As wind power has an unpredictable and fluctuating nature, it is presumable that its increasing use makes it problematic to maintain this balance. As most wind energy is generated at sites consisting of multiple wind turbines, called wind farms, this thesis focuses on these sites to overcome this problem. In this thesis, a distributed model predictive control (MPC) strategy is introduced that not only stabilizes the power produced by wind farms, but also creates the possibility to perform power reference tracking with wind farms. With power reference tracking, it is possible for grid operators to adapt the power production to a change in the power demand and to counteract fluctuations introduced by other power generators. For this MPC, in this thesis, a new low-fidelity control-oriented wind farm model is developed. In this control model, the wake dynamics are taken into account. Wakes are areas downwind from turbines with decreased wind speed and increased turbulence. These wakes cause the wind turbines within a wind farm to influence each other. It is envisioned that taking these effects into account, will benefit the tracking quality of the controller. Because with centralized MPC it becomes problematic to provide real-time control for large wind farms due to the large order of the controller model required for such wind farms, the controller proposed in this thesis uses distributed control. With distributed control, the central control problem is divided into smaller local control problems that will be solved in parallel on local controllers. This makes it possible to also solve large complex control problems in real-time.","Windfarm windenergy windturbine energy distributive control model predictive mpc","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The dynamics of the underdamped mechanical system are linked to the time-discounting behaviour of a trader. Moreover, the parameters of the damped harmonic oscillator are interpreted economically, resulting in the following analogues: the natural frequency is analogous to the risk-free discount rate, the damping ratio is analogous to time-preference, and the real part of the eigenvalues are analogous to the exponential discount rate.

Recently thermoplastic based composites also gained an increased attention and there is a push towards adopting these for primary aircraft structures as well. This interest for thermoplastic composites in aeronautical structures is driven by the material's advantages over thermoset parts in joining methods, damage tolerance, sustaining, shelf live, recyclability, or chemical stability. The butt-joint feature is one of the novel joining techniques made possible by using thermoplastic composites, joining technique which can used to assemble stiffened panels by co-consolidating different, typically flat, laminates. With the potential use of thermoplastic structures in primary aircraft structures being relatively recently considered, the available literature on the damage behaviour of thermoplastic stiffened panels under compression is still scarce, to say the least, especially when using this novel butt-joint feature. <br/><br/>In this project, the building-block approach is used to develop a robust modeling technique able to model skin-stringer separation in butt-joined thermoplastic panels under compression. Here the modeling strategy is developed in a step-by-step fashion, going from a material characterisation coupon scale, up to a sub-component scale. The separation was first modeled in a DCB coupon used to describe the Mode I material fracture toughness, then in a single-stringer specimen with skin-stringer de-bond and finally in a multi-stringer panel with skin-stringer de-bond. The base of the damage modeling strategy was defined by studying the load-displacement response of a DCB specimen using multiple models. First, an experimental load-displacement response of a DCB specimen was captured by an analytical approach, with which the accuracy of the numerical models was compared. The numerical approaches tried were based on cohesive zone models (contact and element based) and on the Virtual Crack Closure Technique, with the latter proving to be better suited for this particular task. The VCCT separation damage model was preferred here since it allowed the use of coarser meshes than the cohesive zone models, with a superior overall accuracy as well. As the material of the studied DCB specimen was identical with the one identical of the single-stringer specimen and multi-stringer panel aforementioned, the VCCT model used to model separation was also kept identical when these larger structures were studied. The accuracy of the FE model developed for the single-stringer specimen was also assessed by comparing its load-displacement curve and failure load with the existent experimental data, improving the modeling technique for its use in the multi-stringer panel. As an FE model which correlated well with the experimental data already existed within Fokker, using a cohesive surface based damage model, the shortcomings of this damage model was shown by applying it to the lower scale DCB specimen. Implementing this damage model for the DCB specimen led to a very poor load-displacement correlation, owing to the altered fracture toughnesses values with respect to the measured one. With the shortcomings of the old separation damage model shown, the VCCT one was implemented in this already existent model, which gave a poor correlation with the experimental data. Since the VCCT damage model used needed to be kept unmodified, the butt-joints of the single stringer were refined and the elements used for these areas were updated in a new FE model, these changes leading to a near excellent experiment-simulation correlation in terms of load-displacement curves and failure loads. The modeling technique developed was then used further to study skin-stringer separation in the multi-stringer panel. A sensitivity study on the panel's compressive response with and without the de-bond damage modeled revealed the high sensitivity of its skin buckling pattern. The occurring skin buckling pattern appeared to be highly influenced by the skin's imperfect non-flat shape, asymmetric load introduction, ends boundary conditions, as well as by the de-bond damage itself. This very sensitive skin buckling pattern was attributed to the specific combination of panel's skin bays boundary conditions and skin bays aspect ratio, which likely gave a buckling coefficient governed either by a 3 or 4 longitudinal buckling half-waves. The sensitivity study on the different possibly occurring buckling patterns revealed that the ones promoting de-bond growth from a certain side of the stringer have a strong influence on the panel's failure load, decreasing the strength of the panel by as much as 25% for a 4 half-waves skin buckling pattern, the most likely to occur however having a 3 half-waves one. Similarly, the most significant strength increase was also due to a 4 half-waves skin buckling pattern, the difference between this and the aforementioned one being the stringer side from which the de-bond grew. Furthermore, this sensitivity study was also used to select a best blind prediction based on which the experimental test plan was defined. The test measurement set-up to correlate and validate the developed FE model was also defined based on this selected best blind prediction and it was successfully used during the experimental test to accurately capture the panel's compressive response. The test-model correlation showed that the FE model was able to predict the compressive response of the panel with great accuracy in what concerns its load-compression response, failure load, buckling behaviour, skin out-of-plane deflections and the qualitative aspect of the de-bond growth. These qualitative aspects of the de-bond growth were its skin buckling pattern influenced location, de-bond growth front shape and its growth soon after skin buckling occurred. A initially very good correlation in terms of load-strain response was also achieved, this correlation being highly influenced by two aspects. First source of test-model strain correlation mis-match was considered to be the significant difference in the panel's skin buckling load, while the second one was the model's poor prediction of the panel's stiffness drop associated with de-bond growth. The de-bond growth was overestimated by the FE model prediction, while the panel stiffness loss as a result of the de-bond growth was underestimated. Overall, the presented modeling strategy to model and study skin-stringer separation in thermoplastic butt-joint stiffened panel under compression proved to be robust. The robustness of this method comes mainly from the same modeling strategy used at all the addressed scales and with the same VCCT damage model using the measured material fracture toughnesses. This implies that the presented method could be successfully transferred to similar panels with similar skin-stringer damage, provided that skin-stringer separation is the main failure mode.","butt-joint; thermoplastic; skin-stringer separation; damage tolerance; PEKK; numerical and experimental; stiffened panel; multiple scale; Post-buckling analysis; Frequency Response","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-17","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Optimization usually provides a single 'optimal' outcome which misrepresents the underlying uncertainties and the large set of possible futures. In this research a method is proposed with which model-owners can be provided insight into the impact of uncertainties on (Energy System Design) Optimization Model outcomes by producing insights regarding the model behavior across model runs under uncertainty. The proposed method consists of three steps: 1) Uncertainty Characterization, 2) Exploratory Modelling, and 3) Results Analysis. The proposed method is applicable to Energy System Design Optimization Models specifically, and to Design Optimization Models in general. This general applicability is constrained to (Energy System) Design Optimization Models where the 'optimized' outcome, the design, can be formatted as a (high dimensional) vector which contains the value for all potential design components, including the zero values, in a fixed ordering over all experiment runs. When applied to an existing Design Optimization Model, this method should help to answer two questions: ‘How do the (Energy System) Designs vary resulting from underlying uncertainties?’; ‘What (Energy System) Design trade-offs are driven by which underlying uncertainties?’. Step 1) consists of the identification of uncertain model-parameters and the assignment of a mathematical representation of their uncertainty. In step 2) the characterized uncertainties are integrated into the model under analysis with the Exploratory Modeling and Analysis (EMA) Workbench. Each exploratory modelling case is composed of n model simulations which results in n experiments. Each experiment represents a unique set of uncertain parameter value combinations and of outcomes containing the model behavior resulting from that specific experiment input space. To answer the first question, clusters of experiments resulting in similar energy system design are identified with a novel approach of cosine distance-based agglomerative hierarchical clustering with complete linkage. To characterize the cluster designs, the total outcome is aggregated to case-design specifics and related back to the underlying uncertainty input with subspace partitioning. The second question is answered with sensitivity analysis and subspace partitioning techniques to characterize design elements that are of interest and to identify trade-offs between these design elements resulting from the underlying uncertainties. As a proof of concept of the applicability and functionalities of the proposed method, it is applied to an Energy System Optimization Model that aims to aid decision-making regarding integrated energy system design and operation in urban areas. This revealed that model-owners can use the insights to: identify model specifications (or the lack thereof) that are determining for the model output, and possibly take measures to limit these effects, and to offer their clients (possibly decision-makers) strategy advice.","Exploratory Modelling and Analysis; Method; Energy system design; Energy system optimization; Design optimization; Clustering; Cosine distance; Uncertainties; Uncertainty analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Although a rescue craft’s purpose is to improve safety, multiple incidents recorded in the GISIS database have proven that the launch and recovery operation can be dangerous or even deadly. The problem research shows that the davit system is the main cause for incidents, which are related to design flaws, lack of maintenance and human errors, the three parameters for a successful launch. The opinion of the author is that a different type of launch and recovery system can lead to improvement of these three parameters and to an increased workability of the system. To compare a new design with the conventional design, a computational model of both designs is built in Matlab to simulate the launch of a rescue craft from an FPSO in various sea states. The conventional model shows dangerous accelerations in high sea states and the risk to collide with the hull of the FPSO. The concept design aims to reduce these motions and, in addition, provide a more redundant design with easy maintenance and focused on reducing human errors. After comparison, the concept design proves to reduce dangerous motions during launch and increase the workability in high sea states, while being very simplistic, robust and easy to operate. However, in the splash zone the concept model does not mitigate dangerous motions sufficiently. <br/>To further substantiate this conclusion, it is advised to further investigate the splash zone model and to develop a more detailed model of the concept design.","rescue craft; davit system; Life saving appliances","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","","","","","",""

Gecko Covers is a company that provides protection for devices in the form of covers and sleeves. They are performing at their best in the tablet market. They would like to enter the impact resistant tablet cover market using an impact cover that is both impact resistant and stylish. Their product style is characterized by the usage of contrast in both material texture and color, simple shapes and an attention to detail. Based on a market analysis, the tablet user on the go is selected as target group. These people carry their tablets with them wherever they go. To differentiate from the current competitors in this tablet market segment, Gecko has to focus on reducing the environmental impact of the new cover by e.g. making it recyclable. The most important material properties for the impact cover are high toughness, low density and a minimum ductile-to-brittle temperature of -20 °C. Not only does SRPP meet these requirements, it is also recyclable as it is only made out of a single type of thermoplastic. The manufacturing process of producing laminates out of woven SRPP influences the material properties such as impact resistance. Literature research shows that a combination of hot compaction and film stacking improves the impact resistance of the SRPP laminate the most. The values of the other parameters which influence the material properties of the laminates were determined through trial and error. To evaluate the SRPP laminates, a bending fatigue test and an alternative Izod impact test were conducted. In the end, the laminates with a compaction temperature of 170 °C, a pressure of 1,73 bar, an active heating time of 5 min and 1 PP film layer in between the SRPP fiber layer are the toughest and ductile. The focus of the design was on a minimum viable product. A back structure inspired by those of suitcases, the screen edge and the regular corners and edges of the cover were all taken into account. To validate that the shape is manufacturable from SRPP, a proof of concept was made with a mold. Furthermore, this proof of concept was tested via a drop test to get more information about the actual performance of the SRPP layer and to determine which orientation would have the highest impact resistance. The drop test showed the importance of the screen edge, which was missing from the proof of concept as it cannot be made out of SRPP. The test also showed that the SRPP lacked damping. To add the screen edge and the damping to the product, additional injection molded PP was used in order to add the screen edge and damping elements to the product. The final design was inspired by natural Voronoi structures and also creates a contrast in material texture and color, matching the current style of Gecko Covers.","SRPP; Impact Resistance; Tablet Cover; Self-reinforced polypropylene","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

It consists of two hydrologically distinctive sub-embayments North Bay and South Bay. South Bay is unique as it does not experience the freshwater flushing typical for estuaries. It experiences the largest freshwater input during a regime of reverse estuarine circulation during Winter, when the entire Bay becomes fresher following peak discharges from the northern rivers. Hence both saline and freshwater enter from Central Bay through the same entrance. South Bay is dealing with increased risk of inundation due to the combination of sea level rise and land subsidence and a deteriorating water quality. Understanding sediment pathways within South Bay and sediment exchange at its entrance can support the development of management strategies dealing with turbidity depended algae blooms and the development of salt marshes as a measure against sea level rise. Additionally, by understanding the current factors controlling fine sediment dynamics, future implications of climate change can be better predicted. Though San Francisco Bay is the topic of much research, a process-based model with a model domain covering the entire Bay is a novel approach to analyse fine sediment dynamics in South Bay. Methods<br/>A Delft3D-DELWAQ buffer layer model was calibrated against a newly available combination of local high-frequency suspended sediment concentration (SSC) measurements and two-monthly, depth varying SSC measurements across the entire 145 km length of the Bay. Subsequently the method of Sediment Connectivity was applied to analyse sediment pathways and net sediment fluxes in South Bay. Sediment Connectivity is an approach that uses network analysis to quantify sediment fluxes based on a schematization of San Francisco Bay into 17 segments. Large data sets of spatial and temporal output were reduced to a 17x17 adjacency matrix permitting a more straightforward analysis and the application of different statistical metrics unavailable in more traditional approaches. Results and implications Calibration enabled the model to better capture seasonal and episodic variations in SSCs across the Bay. Connectivity analysis uniquely revealed key dominant pathways, which agree well with literature. Additionally, it unveiled intra-basin transport pathways, regions of erosion and sedimentation and an indication of the varying controlling forcings during the year. Finally, this study acts as a proof of concept for the Sediment Connectivity method that could be applied in other estuaries.","fine sediments; estuary; sediment connectivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","37.773972, -122.431297"

Workflow and efficiency optimization are topics that are gaining momentum over the last years in the field of medicine (3-6). Health care providers see this as a viable solution to treat more patients and reduce the costs, i.e. increasing efficiency. This research group intend to automatically evaluate the workflow efficiency in the cath lab with use of two sensors: the X-ray imaging system and video cameras. In order to facilitate automatic workflow monitoring and optimization, prior research should be conducted, as “the initial step for improving the process is to acquire knowledge of how things are done”(7). To continue in this line of reasoning, in this research the current peri-operative workflow of the CAG procedure is formalized and quantified.METHODWe used the SPM (surgical process model) methodology to formalize the peri-operative workflow of the CAG. The role activity diagram (RAD) was chosen as the model representation. The model approach was top-down. The metrics were determined and designed based on a previous conducted literature study, the formalization of the workflow and the design criteria. The metrics were divided in two groups: 1) the high-level metrics and 2) the procedure and CAG specific metrics. To evaluate metrics two datasets were used: 1) the manually acquired dataset through observations and 2) the dataset retrieved from the X-ray imaging system. To validate the methodology, the outcomes of the metrics were compared with the experience of the cath lab team. The generalizability was tested by utilizing the phases and metrics in different endovascular procedures and in a different hospital.RESULTSIn total 19 metrics were created of which 11 evaluated the high-level workflow, three the procedure specific process and five the CAG specific steps. Prior the first procedure in the morning, the LA waiting time showed an average of 37 minutes and on average seven minutes are used for lab preparation. In the afternoon similar results are found: the LAs waiting time is longer than the actual lab preparation. The average percentage on-time start cases was 43%. A significant mean difference of 3.3 minutes (p=0.041) regarding the turn-over time was found between the two LA and three LA group. Delivery time showed a mean difference of 3.7 minutes (p=0.004), comparing inpatients (M = 8.1± 5.43 minutes) to outpatients (M = 4.4 ± 4.4 minutes). There was significant positive correlation between delivery times and turn-over times, r=0.66 (p&lt;0.001). Longer delivery times resulted in longer turn-over times. The procedure time presented the highest mean and variance, M=38.0 ± 21.1 minutes. The patient preparation time and post-care duration presented low variances, respectively M=11.8 ± 3.8 minutes and M=4.6 ± 3.3 minutes. The variability in the procedural time could be attributed to the operative phase, M=22.4 ± 18.8 minutes. Within the operative phase, the duration of P1 and P2 accounted for 70% of the variability in the operative length. The X-ray imaging system was able to correctly measure consolidation of metrics describing P2, P3 and P4. The non-procedure specific metrics have the potential to be generalized to any type of procedure. Only P1 and P5 showed potential to be utilized in other endovascular procedures. The analysis in Haga hospital suggests that phases and the metrics could be generalized and therefore used in more cath labs throughout the Netherlands.DISCUSSIONThis research has paved the way for in-depth efficiency assessment and workflow optimization in the cath lab. The cost of delay in an OR is $25 /minute(8). In the event that turnover time can be shortened by five minutes, 20 minutes of scarce lab time would be saved each day. Assuming the cost of delay in the cath lab is similar to the cost of delay in the OR, 500 $/day can be saved by optimizing the turn-over times. Moreover, the LAs wait in the morning for 20 minutes and in the afternoon for 15 minutes. In case the waiting time could be reduced with 50%, 18 minutes of wasted time would be utilized and 450 $/day would be saved. Enhancing starting time and the turn-overtime can result in saving 38 minutes that account for 950 $/day, which is approximately the scheduled time of one CAG procedure. As a result of optimization, an extra patient could be treated every day and money could be saved.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-31","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Roosenboom-Kwee, Z. (mentor); Ortt, J.R. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In recent years, there are growing concerns over climate change and future energy supply. Sustainable energy technologies (SETs) can be implemented to decrease the human impact on the environment and to ensure future energy supply. However, firms that develop SETs face barriers to the large-scale diffusion of their product in the market. This research identifies barriers and strategies for the diffusion of SETs in developing countries. Ortt et al. (2013) developed a framework to assess the market situation based on influencing factors (IF) and core factors (CF). The framework focuses on the diffusion of high-tech products in developed countries. This research uses an improved and later version of this framework that was developed by Kamp et al. (2017) and Ortt &amp; Kamp (2018) as a starting point. This framework is used as a basis and it has been adapted in this research to better suit analyses focusing on the diffusion of SETs in developing countries. For this purpose, some CFs and IFs have been adapted and new factor categories have been added. In the context of this research, the combination of an IF and a CF forms a barrier-set and an individual barrier is defined as an issue that is causing an underdeveloped state of a factor. The goal of the framework of Ortt et al. (2013) is to couple barrier-sets to niche strategies. By adopting niche strategies, firms can circumvent or remove barrier-sets and the large-scale diffusion of their high-tech product is made possible. The framework of Ortt et al. (2013) is focused on developed countries and therefore it has been adapted in this research to better suit the typical constraints of developing countries. In addition, the original framework only focuses on the identification of niche strategies that a firm can adopt. The original framework is extended in this research by incorporating the intervening effect of other actors that can influence the process of circumventing or removing barrier-sets that prevent the large-scale diffusion of SETs. These actors can provide support or they can counteract a firm in this process. In this research, issues that prevent the diffusion of SETs in developing countries have been identified and categorized based on factor descriptions that Ortt &amp; Kamp (2018) formulated. In addition, a new methodology is developed to link barrier-sets to strategies. To conclude, the original framework is extended and a preliminary test of this extended framework is performed. A literature review is performed for the identification and categorization of all the issues, but also for the development of the new methodology and the extension of the framework. The extended framework is tested by performing a case study. The case study shows how the extended framework can be applied. New insights from this case study have further improved the extended framework. The results of this research provide several contributions to the scientific literature. First, 101 issues that prevent the large-scale diffusion of SETs in developing countries have been identified. Second, the process of categorizing all the issues revealed that new factor categories were required to fully capture all the issues, which resulted in formulating 2 new IFs and 2 new CFs. New IFs are: ‘’Environmental, ecological and geographical aspects’’ and ‘’Organizational capacity’’. New CFs are: ‘’Infrastructure’’ and ‘’Data availability’’. The new factor categories ‘’Environmental, ecological and geographical aspects’’ and ‘’Data availability’’ can be adopted in the original framework that Ortt et al. (2013) developed. In addition, all of these new factor categories can be adopted in an adapted framework focusing on developing countries. These additions improve the frameworks and make them more comprehensive. Third, this research provides a new methodology to identify linkages between barrier-sets and strategies. This methodology explores a barrier-set more thoroughly than when the original framework of Ortt et al. (2013) is applied. An advantage of this new methodology is that core problems of the barrier-set are identified and in some cases this may lead to the selection of a more accurate and effective strategy. Fourth, the extended framework that incorporates the intervening effect of other actors in the process of circumventing or removing a barrier-set is developed and this improves the comprehensiveness of the framework. Possible supportive and counteracting strategies of other actors have been identified. The strategy identification process revealed that most actors have nothing to gain by adopting a counteracting position towards firms that sell SETs. Thus, this implies that most actors will take a neutral or supportive position towards such firms. The combined results of the literature review and the case study show that entrepreneurs who are able to engage in network activities and maintain good contact with other actors have higher chances on circumventing or removing barrier-sets and have more strategic options. Partnerships can be very important because this may lead to cost reductions and it may provide access to a larger potential market. This research has academic and practical implications. The tool that this research provides is an extended version of the framework that Ortt et al. (2013) developed. Firms can possibly use this tool to anticipate and investigate what strategies other actors may adopt in order to increase the chance of selecting a successful niche strategy. This tool can also serve an academic purpose. The framework can be used to investigate the large-scale diffusion of SETs in developing countries, but it can also be used for analyses focusing on other types of technologies in other countries. There are also several opportunities for future research. An example is that a study could identify drivers for the diffusion of SETs. These drivers can be converted to issues through logical reasoning and this could provide additional issues to improve the comprehensiveness of the extended framework. Another example is that a study could focus on identifying more counteracting strategies for specific actors to identify more strategic options for firms. Note that the extended framework that this research provides should be tested before using it in practice.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

To decrease the emissions of large ships the required amount of fuel has to be minimized. This is done by increasing the efficiency of the engine, decreasing the hull resistance or by lowering the cruise speed. Another interesting way of decreasing the emission is by using Wind Assisted Ship Propulsion (WASP). The Turbosail is a promising type of wind propulsion for this purpose introduced by Jacques Cousteau[4]. The Turbosail is an aspirated wing which is able to generate up to 3 times more lift compared to a non aspirated wing. A lot of research has been done in order to increase the performance of the Turbosail. But this research has mainly been done on the outside of the Turbosail and the suction area is often modelled as an area with a uniform flow. In this research a model has been made in order to give insight in the behaviour and sensitivity of the suction system of the Turbosail. First the model foundation is described. A lumped parameter approach is chosen and the structure of the model is described. The model of the fan is described and after this the total model is made using Matlab Simulink. This model is made such that the number of elements (the amount of parts that the Turbosail is divided in) can be easily varied. This is done in order to perform a convergence study. Followed by a mathematical verification with carefully chosen tests the model is considered as verified. To understand the sensitivity of different parameters of the system a parameter variation is performed. Different parameters are varied and their effects are simulated. This yields insight in the sensitivity of the system and can be used in order to optimize the energy efficiency of the total suction system. Finally two possible improved designs are simulated combined with their decrease in power consumption. These results can be used for future simulations and designs with the main purpose to decrease the energy consumption of the shipping industry.","Turbosail; Boundary layer suction; Wind assisted ship propulsion; lumped parameter model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Marine Engineering","",""

This thesis addresses these gaps by exploring to what extent a growth mindset underpins planning in the city of Amsterdam and what the need and potential for degrowth could be in sustainable urban planning for the city’s future. The qualitative research design includes a document analysis of degrowth proposals for urban planning, a historical analysis of urban planning focusing on degrowth precedents and finally interviews with respondents related to sustainable urban planning and degrowth. This study shows there is an urgent necessity for a degrowth approach in sustainable urban planning in Amsterdam which currently does not sufficiently address issues of global and long-term social and environmental impact. Degrowth can address these issues with a broad pallet of proposals from the planning process itself, to the design of public space and large economic policy changes. This study provides an overview of these degrowth proposals for sustainable urban planning but also shows that a degrowth implementation faces big obstacles. The study concludes that an example project such as the re-localization of the food system of Amsterdam can be a valuable showcase for a degrowth approach in sustainable urban planning.","degrowth; sustainable urban planning; Amsterdam; policy proposals; historical analysis; interviews","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

(graduation committee); Coenders, Jeroen (graduation committee); Peters, Pim (graduation committee); Houben, Lambert (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The Netherlands is currently in the process of transitioning from a linear economy to a circular economy, in accordance with the ”Nederland Circulair 2050” policy. To increase the circularity of buildings, several approaches can be integrated. In this research, the so-called Design for Deconstruction and Donor Structural Framework concepts are elaborated as possible approaches. The first concept focuses on taking the future de- and remountability of a building into consideration during the design process. This concept allows buildings that approach their end-of-life phase to be (partially) reused as structural components, on a new location. The second concept can be applied during the construction phase of a building, where structural components of an old building are dismantled and reused in the to be constructed building. The difference between the two concepts thus being the life cycle in which they are applied. Therefore, the resulting benefit of using a Donor Framework can be seen immediately, whereas the benefit of applying the Design for Deconstruction concept can only be stated in the future. Unfortunately, the current procedure to measure the sustainability score of a building, the Life Cycle Assessment methodology, does not take these concepts into account. This makes determining their impact on the environment hardly possible. Also, due to the fact that detailed information about a design is required, a Life Cycle Assessment is made only once the design is final. In this order, all design variables are set such that designing towards sustainability is not an option. This research focuses on solving the introductory problems and aims to enable sustainable material choices for a structural design possible in the early design phase. Both the Donor Structural Framework and the Design for Deconstruction concepts were taken into consideration. This main goal has been split into two sub–questions:- How to assess the environmental impact of a steel, concrete and timber load bearing structure in the early design phase? -How to implement the Donor Structural Framework and the Design for Deconstruction concept into the existing Life Cycle Assessment methodology? The research questions have been answered by executing the following approach: 1.A parametric model is used in which not only the geometry and structural calculations are included, but the Environmental Impact Calculation as well. In the event of a design change, the Environmental Impact Calculation is automatically reiterated, which means different designs can be compared quickly based on their environmental impact. The model constructed for this study is suitable for designs in steel, concrete and timber. For each material a reference design is created. The Bill of Materials of these designs serves as input for the Environmental Impact Calculation on which the materials were compared in a later research phase.2.First, an existing end-of-life allocation method has been adjusted to include reuse during both the construction phase (Donor Structural Framework) as the end-of-life phase (Design for Deconstruction). Secondly, the Building Circularity Index, which recognizes a ”circularity score”, has been implemented in this method. In this study the Building Circularity Index is assumed as the ”probability of future reuse of the building”. The modified method was implemented in the parametric model to enable a real-time Environmental Impact Calculation. This approach has been fully implemented into a parametric visual script, executed in the Grasshopper, a parametric environment plugin of Rhino which enables visual scripting. Input parameters are imported from Excel, the Grasshopper script calculates the environmental impact and exports the results to Excel where they are visualized in a dashboard. Ultimately, the developed parametric model has been divided into a part containing the geometry and structural calculations of the reference designs and a part where the newly developed Environmental Impact Calculation method is implemented. Combining the results of both parts in the total model, it becomes possible to assess whether a design is best built in a certain material in the early design phase. The final model can provide results with or without the use of a Donor Structural Framework and with or without application of the Design for Deconstruction concept. For the purpose of demonstrating the functioning of the model, a reference design in steel, concrete and timber was implemented as a basic geometry. This geometry was assumed equal across all designs and for comparability purposes, dimensions were fixed. Consequently, it can be concluded from the results of these reference designs that using a Donor Structural Framework results in a lower environmental impact than applying the Design for Deconstruction concept by maximizing the remountability of a structure. Until a lifespan of 75 years, using a timber donor framework is the most sustainable solution for the reference design. From 75 until 100 years this is the case for steel and from 100 years onward, a concrete design, whether or not using a donor framework, results in the lowest environmental impact. In the current design practice of a building, the default lifespan has been determined by the function of the building (Functional Service Life). By using the model developed here, this lifespan can be determined on the basis of sustainability requirements instead of functional requirements. The differences in environmental impact for different lifespans can easily be compared. Therefore, it is made possible to steer towards a certain lifespan, in order to determine the most sustainable construction based on the clients requirements. This is currently not possible in the Dutch construction industry. However, these results do have their limitations, as they should not be interpreted as general but rather specific conclusions. The following points of attention apply: -Results should not be interpreted as general results, but these results only apply on the three reference designs as elaborated further in the research. These reference designs are not optimized for every material used. -Changing input parameters can have a significant impact on the results. In addition, a number of important parameters (reuse percentage, material lifespan etc.) have been assumed due to insufficient existing research. -The developed allocation equations include the incineration of timber too favorably. This results in a significant deviation in timber environmental impact for lifespans much shorter than 75 years. This flaw can be either due to the model, or the impact parameters as stated in the NIBE EPD app. Lastly, it is recommended to further research the assumed parameters in this research, especially the material lifespan and the incineration impact parameters. As these parameters can have a major impact on the environmental impact of a specific design.","Sustainability; Early Design Stage; Parametric design tool; design for disassembly; Donor Structural Framework; Environmental Impact Assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Traditional measurement approaches in wind tunnels have relied on the simultaneous use of several measurement systems (accelerometers, strain gauges, pressure probes, PIV…) in order to capture the relevant structural and aerodynamic variables. However, this results in complex setups which are often intrusive and need to be specifically tailored for each experiment. In addition, the output of these sensors is often limited to pointwise information. This thesis proposes the use of the robotic PIV system as a versatile measurement system capable of providing simultaneous, full-field aerodynamic and structural information in a non-intrusive way. This approach involves the simultaneous tracking of Helium Field Soap Bubbles and reflective markers for the characterization of flowfield and structure respectively. To prove the measurement concept, an experiment is conducted in the Open Jet Facility at TU Delft, where the aeroelastic response of a flexible composite wing is studied. The static and dynamic deflection of the wing is measured, where the dynamic cases correspond to the wing response to discrete and continuous gusts of different reduced frequencies. Following the experiment, a methodology is developed in order to reconstruct the aeroelastic response of the wing based on this information by combining marker-tracking data and a simplified structural beam model of the wing. The results include the reconstruction of structural variables such as strains and wing-tip accelerations, and aerodynamic variables in the form of steady and unsteady, phase-averaged flowfields. Some information about the different loads acting on the wing can be recovered from the structural model and from the flowfields based on the circulation around the wing. A good general agreement is found between the reconstructed variables and the validation measurements provided by independent systems.","Aerodynamics; Experimental Aeroelasticity; Robotic PIV; Flexible Wing; Gust Response","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-03-13","","","","Aerospace Engineering","HOMER",""

Increasing shares of variable renewable energy sources create mismatches between electricity supply and demand. These mismatches create a need for large-scale energy storage. Existing large-scale energy storage technologies are pumped hydro energy storage and compressed air energy storage, but their storage potential in the Netherlands is limited. The alternative is to store energy in chemical bonds, for example by producing hydrogen, and regenerate the electricity later. This type of storage is called a Power-to-X-to-Power (PtXtP) system. Power-to-X technologies have existed for a long time. This<br/>report evaluates their potential in an energy storage application. First, PtXtP systems are compared to compressed air energy storage (CAES) and pumped hydro energy storage (PHES). The geographic potential of CAES and PHES in the Netherlands is limited for both technologies, proving large scale energy storage is a challenge to which PtXtP. Next, all PtXtP technologies are investigated and compared based on available literature. The three technologies with the most potential (hydrogen, ammonia and methane) are further investigated. This report gives a current and comprehensive overview of data on PtXtP system components, including amongst others their OPEX, CAPEX, efficiency and energy use. This data was used as input for several models of hydrogen, methane and ammonia storage systems, to determine system cost and performance in a dynamic system. Simulations are run with these PtXtP systems as energy storage technologies for a 1GW wind park. The simulations are used to identify main system bottlenecks, investigate the impact of intermittent use on system performance, and evaluate the potential of a PtXtP storage system. The first important bottleneck is the size of the hydrogen buffer required for operation of the Haber-Bosch reactor and Sabatier reactor. It is as large as or larger than the storage capacity in a hydrogen storage system. The second bottleneck is the size of ammonia and hydrogen fuel cells. The required fuel cell power is 425 MW, which is larger than any current or expected fuel cells. Next the simulations were used to investigate the performance of a PtXtP system as energy storage medium in a VRES system. The first important finding is the tradeoff between system flexibility and system sizing. An ammonia system with 33%-100% flexibility can be 60% smaller than a 0%-100% system, while still processing the same annual amount of hydrogen. Intermittent system use increases the levelized cost of storage significantly, in these models by factor 2.2-4, due to the unchanged CAPEX which must be paid for a reduced system output. The first important finding related to the PtXtP system is that the cost and energy consumption of hydrogen transport and storage are relatively small compared to energy conversion steps. The electrolyser proved to be the system component with the highest cost and energy loss. Finally, the added value of the storage system is significant wind park size reduction. The 1GW wind park size could be reduced by 35% when connected to a hydrogen storage system, while still meeting the same demand. In addition, zero grid exchange can only be achieved when implementing a storage system. With lower shares of grid exchange, storage becomes increasingly more valuable. The overall conclusion drawn is that hydrogen or methane systems seem to have the most potential for energy storage purposes. The report also shows energy storage is necessary, and no alternatives to PtXtP are available in the Netherlands. PtXtP will therefore have to play a large role in the future Dutch electricity grid. However, use of PtXtP storage will increase the price of electricity and several technological developments, mostly scale-ups, are necessary before a PtXtP <br/>system is feasible.","Power-to-X-to-Power; Energy Storage; energy storage system; simulation; 2030; PtXtP; Hydrogen; ammonia; methane; Haber-Bosch Process; Sabatier; Electrolyser","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

These psychological issues have a negative influence on the patients’ healing process and dramatically reduce the quality of life during and after ICU. Medical alarms are meaningful signals that inform nurses and lead them to properly act to attend patients’ basic needs and medical treatments. However, medical alarms are not meant for patients who lack resources to cope with them. Due to their ambiguity, alarms are perceived as a threat and appraised as dangerous by patients. Nurses are the main resource for patients to cope with such a threat. Nurses have the information needed by patients to reduce their uncertainty and stress provoked by such a stressor; therefore, lack of support contributes to the risks of developing psychological issues. Designing solutions that aim to reduce the risks of developing psychological disorders during the period of hospitalization in the ICU is necessary to facilitate the people healing process and to guarantee them an improved quality of life during and after such an experience. Overcome is a feedback interface designed to enable nurses to communicate by a distance with patients to reduce the risks of developing a state of anxiety when a medical alarm goes off. Through the provision of feedback, Overcome informs patients about the nurses’ decisions over medical alarms while they are approaching the room thus restoring the perceived sense of safety. Information about the decisions made by nurses over an alarm, as well as information regarding the reason for an alarm, promote medical alarms understanding and reduce the uncertainty of dying that patients can experience when exposed to ambiguous alarms and when they have to wait longer than expected before receiving the nurses' support. Feedback reassure the patients and positively influencing their state of anxiety; also, a reduced state of anxiety may also result in reduced stress levels.","Critical Alarms Lab; Anxiety; Intensive Care Unit; Stress; Heart Rate variability; Virtual Reality; Virtual Reality Experiment; Feedback; user interface design; Motion graphic; Social support","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The method followed, starts with an analysis of the problem, giving insight to the relevant stakeholders and functions that should be included. These elements lead to the Program of Requirements, which contains research into the tailor-made pump-turbine system and present-day water levels. The analysis ends in presenting the boundary conditions. This thesis continues with several concepts that fulfil the functions and requirements. For those concepts, the possible construction methods are described, and checks are performed to verify the stability, including 1) piping, 2) rotational stability, 3) sliding, 4) bearing capacity and 5) (static) floating stability. Using the evaluation criteria from the analysis, described after the Program of Requirements, and weighting factors, following from the stakeholder analysis, the value of the different alternatives is calculated via a Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis and compared to each other, by including costs. Lastly, one more iteration is made to check the strength of the walls and floors of the most desirable alternative. It can be concluded that the most straightforward alternative, called `Unity', is more cost-effective than an alternative integrated into the dune surrounding the energy storage lake. Also, the minimum width of that caisson, which is 53 m and follows from the pump-turbine system, can be achieved according to the stability checks. The author recommends checking the interaction between the spillway and the in- and outlet structure and model the foundation of the caisson more thoroughly.","DELTA 21; Design methodology; Caisson","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","DELTA 21",""

(mentor); Kuipers, M.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Javelin throwing in the winter is not fun when the temperature approaches zero degrees. That is way javelin throwers move indoors for training. The problem with training indoors it that there is no room to throw a javelin 80 meters, so a different type of training is used. The javelin fitted with a rubber tip is thrown into a net. This way, the technique can still be practiced without the javelin’s flight. Unfortunately, the flight of the javelin can tell a lot about how well the javelin is thrown. Without that feedback, it is hard to know if an improvement in technique also results in a better throw. This project aims the fill that gap and provides performance feedback to the javelin thrower and the coach. Javelin throwing context First, the javelin throwing context is analyzed. The most critical parameters for measuring the performance of an athlete are the release velocity, release angle, and angle of attack. These parameters need to be measured with an accuracy of 0,25 m/s for the velocity and 1,5 degrees for both angles to give a realistic indication for the performance of the throw. The feel of the javelin is also crucial. It should hold the same as a standard javelin and should behave the same way when moving it around. Sports data collection The most used data collection now in day to day training is video recording, which can be played back in slow motion to dissect the technique of the athlete. As mentioned before, this does not tell everything about the performance of the throw. Several 3D tracking technologies are explored to find the best way the tracking the velocity and angles of the javelin. The best option seems to be a combined system of an inertial measurement unit inside the javelin with video tracking as an external reference system. The video can also be used to playback the recording of the throw. This way, the link between the technique and the performance of the throw becomes more apparent. Development For both the inertial measurement unit and the video tracking a proof of concept prototype is developed. The systems are combined to use the strengths of one system to fill in the weakness of the other. In this case, the video tracking can compensate for the drift of an inertial measurement unit, and the inertial measurement unit can reduce the noise in the video tracking data. Product A product name PRODON in build around the two tracking systems. It has active trackers front and back for the video tracking system to pick up. The inertial measurement unit is built into the back in a protective casing. The PRODON uses an app to communicate the collected performance data to the athlete and coaches. Combined with a video of throw, this can be a meaningful addition to indoor javelin training. Evaluation The accuracy of the prototype is tested in the situation where the javelin is thrown perpendicular to the camera. The velocity error calculated from this test is 0,02 m/s. The angle error tested came out to be 0,5 degree. Although these measurements fall below the set requirements, they are tested in a controlled 2D environment. Further testing in real conditions is needed to say for sure that this technology can provide accurate data. <br","Javelin; Sports; performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Hermans, Felienne (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","As computer science lies at the heart of almost all technological progress, widespread computer science education, and particularly programming education, is of great importance. In order to reach a large group of students, secondary schools can play an important role. However, students have difficulty learning programming concepts. Programming is complicated and the education largely takes place on computers, which allows for little interaction with teachers. Consequently, teachers have difficulty gaining insights about the progress and misunderstandings of students and thus have little opportunity to intervene, which threatens to undermine the effectiveness of the learning process. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to improve on existing programming education by developing a feedback method for computer science teachers, which enables them to better understand and remedy programming misconceptions held by their students. Following a Grounded Theory approach, interviews were conducted with computer science teachers and programming education researchers in the Netherlands. Participants were asked to describe the problems they encountered in teaching programming concepts and to identify what in their views would help to improve their teaching. Furthermore, literature was reviewed on existing tools which offer teacher feedback. The majority of these tools appeared to provide little insight and/or require time-consuming analysis by the teacher in order to gain some insights. Teachers indicated that they have little time for complicated data analyses, but would highly value detailed feedback about their students’ programming misconceptions. Furthermore, it was suggested that alternative testing methods, such as puzzles, might be useful. Based on these findings, Parsons Problems were proposed and tested as a solution for detecting programming misconceptions. The testing took place during two rounds, a small-scale trial experiment and a broader experiment in which 64 secondary school students participated. 'Primitive assignment works in opposite direction' was the number one misconception, held by 56% of the participants, and was the most occurring misconception across students. The 'invalid else-statement' misconception was the second most held misconception (53% of participating students), followed by 'primitive assignment works in both directions (swaps)' (45%), 'difficulties in understanding the sequentiality of statements' (39%), 'the natural-language semantics of variable names affects which value gets assigned to which variable' (20%), 'adjacent code executes within loop' (6%), and 'using else is optional' (5%). As 7 out of 8 misconceptions targeted in the experiment were successfully detected, this experiment demonstrates that employing Parsons Problems appears to be a viable method for misconception detection.","Parsons Problems; Teacher Feedback; Programming Misconception Detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The vibrational energy is converted to electrical energy by piezoceramic cantilevers. Replacing batteries by vibrational energy harvesters, reduces the footprint of the device and no continuous replacement of batteries is required cutting down the maintenance costs. However, the greatest issue preventing these system from being widely used is their poor reliability. The main failure mechanisms identified are ageing, temperature degradation, humidity degradation and most of all mechanical degradation. In the aim to maximise the power output, the piezoceramic cantilevers are resonating at<br/>the eigenfrequency close to the point of the fracture strength. It is found that too large tensional deformations result in fractures in the active piezoceramic material. Experiments show that fractures significantly drops the power output and reduces the eigenfrequency. Literature suggest that tapered piezoceramic cantilevers are a reliable replacement for the conventional rectangular piezoceramic cantilevers. Experiments confirm the severity of fractures in the piezoceramic cantilevers reduction of power output as low as 75% have been measured. Tapered cantilevers show to have a higher electrical power output per unit area compared to rectangular cantilevers. Therefor less deformation is needed to achieve the same electrical output.

(graduation committee); Ragno, E. (mentor); Morales Napoles, O. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The objective of this study is find out whether maximum daily discharge of the Geul and Rur catchments can be forecast using machine learning (ML) methods, and if so, to what extent. In addition, these ML models are compared to a conceptual model to see which performs better. A second objective is to test whether soil moisture content (SMC) and NDVI increase performance of the two ML models. The Geul and Rur catchments are both partly situated in the administrative area of Waterschap Limburg, a water authority in the Netherlands. They use discharge forecasts in order to prepare flood defenses and to monitor high water levels more closely. Currently, discharge is forecast using the conceptual HBV model for the Geul. Forecasting is done based on experience for the Rur and only in case of high water levels. Conceptual and physical models are based on physical laws, i.e. conservation of mass and energy. However, some relations are not yet fully understood, or are hard to translate to equations, and assumptions have to be made. This is why a data-driven approach is used, as no explicit relationship between variables has to be specified. In this study a gradient boosted decision tree framework (XGBoost) and a recurrent deep learning model (LSTM) are used to map input to output. XGBoost is a relatively new framework that has shown promising results in other water resources related studies. Long Short-Term Memory is a type of recurrent neural network and chosen for its ability to handle long-term dependencies and for its ability to model non-linearities. In order to see whether the machine learning methods outperform conceptual models, they are compared to the GR4J model. GR4J is a simple yet effective soil moisture accounting model. Beside SMC and NDVI, meteorological variables are used as input. Results show that the deep learning model performs best for simulating today’s discharge and when forecasting up to three days ahead. The GBDT model has a slightly higher Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) for the daily simulation of the Geul, but also a higher mean absolute error (MAE) compared to the deep learning model. The same holds for the three-day-ahead forecast for the Geul and the Rur. Peak timing is accurate for most models but peak discharge is often underestimated. When comparing the ML models to the conceptual model for the daily simulation, deep learning performs best in terms of MAE, but GBDT is better in terms of NSE. When looking at the one-day-ahead forecast, deep learning outperforms the GBDT and conceptual model in both NSE and MAE. In any case, when looking at the metric they outperform the conceptual model. However, the conceptual model has only a couple of parameters to calibrate, is transparent and has only two input variables. The ML models, on the other hand, have my parameters to train, are difficult to physically interpret and have four to five input variables. Besides comparing the two types of models, it is tested whether adding soil moisture content and NDVI as input improve performance of the machine learning models. The former undoubtedly improves performance, whereas NDVI at best improves performance as much as some other meteorological variables. Overall, this study finds that a conceptual model still outperforms the two ML models from a holistic point of view. However, machine learning is not yet fully exploited in water resources management. It already gives promising results and is likely to perform even better in the future.","data driven; machine learning; gradient boosting; neural networks; XGBoost; LSTM; discharge; forecasting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

(mentor); Kouwenhoven, M.L.A. (mentor); Warnier, Martijn (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","All over the world, governments are facing sustainability challenges, which are among others related to car use and ownership. Car ownership research is traditionally mainly focussed on the effect of socio-demographic characteristics, like age, income and having a driving license. More recent research showed that life events related to work, family and residential location, and built environment factors are other promising explanatory factors of changing car ownership. However, the Dutch car ownership models do not incorporate these factors adequately, due to a lack of data. Next to that, it was found that it is theoretically better to model car ownership in a dynamic way (taking into account car ownership of last year). Since such dynamic models are still a rarity in the literature, this thesis examines to what extent the forecasts of household car ownership in the Netherlands are affected by the inclusion of life events and built environment factors in a dynamic model. To this end, the dynamic model is enriched in two steps: first in terms of structure (static versus dynamic), and secondly regarding substance (without or with the effect of life events and the built environment). The step from a static to a dynamic model (by using a transaction choice model) resulted in a significantly higher model fit (p&lt;0.001), which was true as well for including life events and built environment factors. A variety of life events were found to affect car transaction behaviour, especially those with a spatial component (relocation and job transition). Furthermore, the absence or free nearby parking is found to reduce car ownership.The forecasts of the dynamic model were especially on a short term better in line with the historic car ownership trend than that of the static model. Including the effects of life events and built environment factors in the dynamic model resulted in a lower car ownership trend (up to 1.4% lower), while a similar effect was found of increased paid parking on a national level as well as on the level of Rotterdam. Therefore, reduced free parking at the street – especially near new business and residential areas – and campaigns aimed at people experiencing the habit-breaking effect of life events, are policy measures with the potential to reduce car ownership and to work towards a more sustainable and accessible future.","car ownership; dynamic model; life events; built environment; parking; transaction choice model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

These vibrations are believed to be caused by the eigenfrequencies of the system and/or amplification caused by the motion control algorithm. In this research an investigation in this phenomenon was done. This investigation was done via an analysis of the eigenfrequencies of the active controlled hexapod. A finite element method model was created to determine the eigenfrequencies of the system. This model was made using MATLAB and the toolbox StaBIL 2.0, created by the university of Leuven. All the elements of the system are modeled as beams except the hydraulic actuators. The properties of the elements which represent the hydraulic actuators are calculated separately using a modelling study on stiffness characteristics of hydraulic cylinder under multi-factors. <br/>Possible causes for the unexpected vibrations have been investigated via measurements performed on Ampelmann systems. Data which was readily available is analyzed. Based on this data three possible causes have been determined. These are: the influence of the pedestal, residual motions due to limitations of the Ampelmann system and vibrations in the bottom frame due to compensating for gangway motions. To investigate the influence of the pedestal and the vibrations in the bottom frame two experiments have been performed. The residual motions have been investigated via calculations based on data already available. The amplitude of the response in the results from the first experiment performed to investigate the vibrations in the bottom frame due to gangway motions is negligible over the entire test period. The data from the calculations done to investigate the effect of the residual motions show no amplification. The results of the experiment and the calculations lead to the conclusion that these do not cause unwanted behavior. The second experiment to determine the influence of the pedestal shows four peaks in the frequency domain of both the signals. The first is directly caused by vessel motions. The other three have a cause which is not directly related to vessel motions. The data from the sensor on the Ampelmann system, at the top of the pedestal, does not contain a peak which is not present at the ship deck. From this it can be concluded that the eigenfrequencies of the pedestal do not have a relevant influence. For one of these peaks the amplitude of the graph related to the top of the pedestal is higher than the one corresponding to the ship deck. A possible explanation for this phenomenon could be the eigenfrequencies and corresponding eigenmodes of the ship deck. The pedestal functions as a leaver arm amplifying the rotations related to eigenmodes of the ship deck. This may cause the unexpected vibrations.","Eigenfrequencies; Vibrations; Experimental Research; Motion Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Solutions that are currently made are not implemented effectively on the units. This report will describe a design project leading to a way in which nurses can be involved in improving their own work environment which will lead to a decreased workload an more job satisfaction. The first part of the report shows that improvement opportunities nurses face do not reach the departments that could solve these opportunities. To involve nurses, in order to decrease their workload and increase their job satisfaction, it is not only important for them to be involved in projects that are started at the technical departments. Participatory design theory shows that by giving users a voice in what could be improved in their work, not only will the solutions fit the context better, having a say in what happens will by itself add to the job satisfaction. <br/>The following chapter elaborates on different personas of nurses, what they currently do with improvement opportunities and what limits them in doing so. <br/>Nurses currently improve the processes on their own units. This can be done by the nurses themselves. If an opportunity can not be improved on by nurses themselves, this opportunity will not be documented or improved upon. <br/>Based on the insights of this research a design goal was formulated:<br/>Design a participatory design process to improve the work environment of nurses, in which all relevant stakeholders are included and actively involved. <br/>The ideation phase describes how the active role of nurses was chosen. <br/>For a nurse to be actively involved, they need time and the ability to take responsibility. Though activating nurses without other relevant stakeholders also having time and responsibility, the workload and job satisfaction will not improve. Therefore the design of “De Ontwerkgroep” was made. “De Ontwerkgroep” is a multidisciplinary team that has the goal of improving the work environment of nurses.

There is a need to increase the efficiency of this process, meaning that (1) the speed has to be increased, (2) the accuracy of designs has to be increased and (3) the risk of deviations of the project plan has to be reduced. Analysis of the current concept design phase shows that the designer should get more insight in the design challenge, and that a more systematic and uniform design approach is required amongst different involved departments. Additionally, the lead time of developing concept designs is mostly delayed by two major bottlenecks: development of the hull shape and obtaining a resistance prediction. In this thesis a conceptual design tool is developed to resolve these deficiencies, by providing a platform for fast hull concept exploration. Key of this approach is to pre-compute time-intensive design aspects such that the most critical activities are done before starting the design process. It uses a set of parent hulls for which the resistance is obtained by RANS CFD simulations. Based on the parents, a semi-parametric modelling technique is used to create new hull geometry. A kriging surrogate model is used to provide a RANS CFD resistance prediction to that new hull geometry. A brute-force approach is then adopted to fill a database with feasible hull shapes, which can be used by the conceptual design tool for hull shape concept exploration. To test this concept a proof-of-concept database of 245.005 hulls of double-ended ferries is generated in a few days on a laptop with good memory capabilities. The geometry results and resistance predictions in the database have been assessed with a sensitivity study, cross-validation and comparison with the parent hulls. It is shown that resulting geometry is smooth and well-faired. The resistance results are sufficiently accurate for use in the concept design phase, but applicability is limited for low prismatic coefficients. For application to OPVs further research into application of this approach to hull geometries with varying local details (bulb shape, tunnels etc.) is necessary.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Subsidence is affecting different parts of the Netherlands. The strongest subsidence is observed in the province of Groningen due to ongoing natural gas extraction. Subsidence is also observed at several locations in the province of South Holland, where the processes of peat oxidation, soil compaction and the withdrawal of groundwater are at the root of the problem. In South Limburg, the after-effects of coal mining are seen in the surface deformation, which is characterised by ground heave due to rising mine water, and the potential risks for sinkhole and local subsidence due to near-surface mining. Not only does subsidence cause damage to the natural and built environment, but it also increases the vulnerability towards flooding. Considering the rise in sea level, subsidence forms a pressing issue for low-lying countries, such as the Netherlands. The combined efforts of interferometric synthetic-aperture radar (InSAR) data, global positioning system (GPS) points and gravity measurements have led to the recent Bodemdalingskaart (2018), which represents the nationwide subsidence in three statistically inferred products. These products are the the total surface deformation, the deformation caused by shallow subsurface processes, and the deformation caused by deep subsurface processes. This has triggered the discussion on how the deformation from 'shallow' and 'deep' processes can or should be better understood in a physical sense. The aim of this research is to 'enrich' Sentinel-1 persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) points with contextual information, or 'attribute-enrichment', in order to better understand the origin of the observed deformation. Classifications from the Dutch 'basisregistraties' (base registries) are assigned to the PSI points, which are stored in a spatial database. The classifications include information on the Dutch soil types and geomorphology. The classifications from Bodemkaart are used in an analysis of nationwide extent, focused on the deformation behaviour of different soils and their groundwater levels. The nationwide average deformation of all track results suggest subsiding trends of about -1.24 mm/yr for marine clay soils and -0.48 mm/yr for peat soils, whereas opposite trends of uplift are observed of, on average, +0.77 mm/yr for river clay soils and +0.54 mm/yr for sand. The soil and geomorphology datasets are also used in combination with the geographic classifications of the built environment to study the distinction between deep and shallow-induced deformation in Groningen and South Holland. Here, the 2 x 2 km grid cell representation of deformation makes it possible to characterise areas with overall low PSI point density. In the localised deformation cases, the behaviour of classes from different attributes can be directly compared, e.g. road polygons intersecting with soil type polygons. For South Limburg, risk-assessment-based classifications are used to enrich the PSI points in the study the coal mining after-effects in the identified risk areas. The risk-deformation results suggest an overall slowing trend in the ground heave of the potential impact areas. The results from the case studies highlight the efficiency of attribute-enriched PSI datasets for the interpretation of deformation, based on both direct and indirect physical classifications.","Subsidence; InSAR; Attributes; GIS; Radar; PS-InSAR; Deformation; Geology; Netherlands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

Due to three consecutive dry summers as a result of climate change, a growing population and an increased per capita water demand, the city’s main water supply was nearly depleted. Cape Town depends for 98% on surface water stored in dammed reservoirs, which is replenished by rainfall. There is a temporal mismatch between water availability and peak demand, and thus harvesting rainfall can be potentially become an additional source of water. Cape Town’s urban drainage system has 737 detention ponds, which are used to attenuate flooding in case of heavy rain events. These ponds can be used to harvest the stormwater and store it in the Cape Flats aquifer using managed aquifer recharge for seasonal availability. The complexity of retrofitting stormwater ponds into infiltration ponds calls for a systematic approach. This research offers a retrofitting framework for the context of Cape Town. The framework can be used to determine suitable detention ponds to allow managed aquifer recharge via infiltrating stormwater, and to retrofit these detention ponds into infiltration ponds. The framework consists of three phases; spatial assessment, physical assessment and conceptual design. It is highly flexible in usage due to the fact that every phase can be used separately. Additionally, the framework can be extended to include important socio-economic aspects. Following the framework standardizes the procedure of obtaining data on individual ponds, which allows for objective comparison in assessing their suitability for infiltration.","Stormwater management; urban drainage; day zero; drought; flood attenuation; water sensitive urban design (WSUD); stormwater harvesting","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","Nuffic Orange Knowledge Program",""

(mentor); Timmerman, Pieter (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Sustainability is an important aspect in the construction industry nowadays and therefore timber is interesting to use as it is considered a sustainable building material. With the development of mass timber engineered products such as glued and cross laminated timber, there are more and more possibilities to use timber as a structural element, but this material is not yet widely used in high-rise buildings. Recent research has shown different aspects to take into account when using timber. Due to the lightweight, high flexibility and strength, attention must be paid to the dynamic behaviour and the high horizontal deflections of the top levels of the building due to wind. A parametric model is used to generate the structural model, which enables you to easily change certain parameters to gain a quick insight into the consequences of these changes on the behaviour of the structure. The model is developed in the program Autodesk Dynamo, where a plug-in developed by the company Arcadis is used to connect Dynamo to a FEA application called RFEM to be able to check the generated structure on relevant criteria. The parametric model is able to design a building which has certain dimensions and lateral stability systems which can be changed. It is chosen to implement lateral stability systems consisting of shear core(s), a diagrid and a tube, which can be used either independently or combined. The connections between the elements cannot be modelled with a finite stiffness using the Arcadis plug-in. Therefore, several assumptions had to be made to encounter for the characteristics of the connections. The Young’s modulus of the structural elements are modified to take into account the stiffness of the connections and openings in surfaces if present. To check if the parametric model gives satisfying results, a case study is performed on the BrockCommons Tallwood House. This showed that the parametric model gives satisfactory results. A parametric study is performed to check the possibilities of timber high-rise regarding maximum building height in The Netherlands. An office building with a width of 32.4 metres, a depth of 28.8 metres with a specific floor plan and connection characteristics is used. Optimal configurations regarding compressive and tensile resistance of connections between structural elements are resolved using MATLAB and the reduction of Young’s modulus of the elements is determined using the specific connection characteristics. The connections used in the parametric study are compared to commonly used connections regarding strength and stiffness. Furthermore, an insight is given on the influence of the stiffness of the connections on the structure. The maximum building heights are investigated for stability systems consisting of either a shear core, diagrid, tube or a combination of 2 stability systems. Results show that a 4-storey diagrid system with infinite stiff connections can reach the greatest height of 187.2metres. No additional measures had to be taken to ensure that each structure complied with the maximum acceleration limit for office buildings. Finally, a comparison<br/>is made between the stability systems with regard to total timber volume and steel mass usage.","Parametric Design; Timber; High Rise; Dynamo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Every year approximately 5,000 new persons arrive at The Hague, meaning that in 10 years The Hague will increase their population by 8%. The main problem is that currently, the city has a shortage of social housing, which is the most vulnerable sector in the city. The municipality has a variety of new governmental strategies that provide answers for these upcoming changes. The main challenge is that the municipality of The Hague’s strategies in the construction sector will result in significant volumes of waste. These waste streams need to be quantified to find opportunities for urban mining. Typically, the materials extracted from the construction and demolition (C&amp;D) sector are downcycled into less valuable materials, incinerated or sent to the landfill, backfiring in economic loss and increase in CO₂ emissions. Nowadays, there are companies that recover the material form the C&amp;D site and recycle it into new construction material. However, even if it has been proved that circular demolition is between 10-15% cheaper and decreases emissions up to 44%, it is not a common practice. This develops the questions about ‘why urban mining is not a common practice?’, and ‘how can it be encouraged?’The purpose of this research is to explore the topic of urban mining by assessing the possibilities of implementing urban mining in the social housing sector in the upcoming years.Methodology: For this research, three methods have been selected; A) Interviews, B) Stakeholder analysis and C) Mass Flow Analysis (MFA). A) Interviews: Ten interviews were conducted with the main stakeholders related to urban mining of social housing in The Hague. These include the municipality of The Hague, Social housing associations and C&amp;D companies.B)Stakeholder Analysis: The stakeholder analysis was performed to analyse the relation and communication between the various parties involved. The goal of this analysis was to understand the communications barriers that stand in the way of urban mining becoming a common practice. C)Mass Flow Analysis: Using four different criteria (construction year, land use, energy label and the 20-80 rule) two estimations were created to quantify the projected number of social housing buildings that might be demolished by 2050. The result of the two estimates was the monetising of the material – brick and glass- that can be extracted from the social housing buildings.Results: Two main findings were established from the methodologies. On the one hand, the interviews and stakeholder analysis led to the finding that there is a lack of proper communication between social housing associations, municipalities, and C&amp;D companies. The various parties are interested in collaborating in the area of urban mining. However, the lack of direct communication channels resulted in the slowing down of the process of upscaling to larger urban mining projects. On the other hand, after doing the MFA, the results showed that urban mining practices could be between 15-20% more profitable than standard practices. Construction companies can save up to 20% by buying recycled material from a C&amp;D site. The results also showed that urban mining of materials, such as brick and glass, can reduce the CO₂ emissions by 44%.Conclusion: Urban mining in The Hague is an environmentally friendly and profitable option if the different parties agree to collaborate. After the municipality of The Hague creates a framework on how to apply urban mining techniques for the buildings owned by the municipality itself, the process can be more easily replicated by other companies. Scientific relevance: This research quantifies the competitiveness of urban mining of social housing in The Hague, opening the path for new research about urban mining implementation and development.","urban mining; Industrial ecology; mass flow analysis; stakeholder analysis; resilient cities","en","master thesis","","","","","","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology.","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Electronic implants are becoming a valuable tool to explore and regulate neural activity, potentially overcoming neural disabilities that are still incurable. On the one hand, neural recording can provide tremendous insight into the neural system and the sometimes accompanied neural diseases. On the other hand, neural stimulation is necessary to control or adjust neural activity related to neural diseases. Detail of neural recording and stimulation is achieved with highly dense and often deep implantable electrodes (spatial resolution), while neural patterns are found with larger neural area coverage. In both stimulating and recording, a combination of spatial resolution and area coverage can be key to understanding and curing. Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are often employed for the interaction with the electrodes interfacing with neural tissue but ASICs are limited in size, which consequently limits the amount of individual recording or stimulation channels. The de facto solution to circumvent this limitation is to multiplex high numbers of electrodes to a single ASIC channel. However, due to switching and signal latencies only a limited number of electrodes can be multiplexed per channel. Multiple channels on an ASIC are therefore desirable nonetheless to accommodate implants with a many electrodes. Due to recent miniaturization advances, an ever-increasing number of channels can be made available on a single ASIC and the urgency arises to investigate connecting and integrating these channels to electrodes on a flexible implantable substrate. In this work we will investigate technology for assembling a fully flexible electrode array substrate to an ASIC with a high number of channels. For such assemblies, a routing optimiser was developed especially for flexible implants, optimising for chip size and critical substrate limitations. However, with no established manufacturing methodology for such systems, technology parameters were not fully understood. Therefore, initial efforts were put into fabrication of a custom chip with which 72 chip-to-substrate gold stud contacts can be evaluated by means of 4-point measurements and daisy-chaining. This multifunctional chip allows for experiments at various chip-to-substrate contact diameters and pitches. In addition, different materials, including polycarbonate (PC), polyimide (PI) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) were investigated as candidate substrate materials. A transfer methodology, using copper and FR-4 as carrier materials, proved fruitful for these polymeric materials. TPU samples showed particularly promising results, with the main advantage that it can encapsulate the entire implantable system, including chip and metallization, without the formation of additional material interfaces. This has significant advantages for the longevity of implantable systems. A second chip iteration with similar functionality was manufactured with 1008 gold electroplated contacts. The chip measures at 4x4mm² and contacts were designed to be 36x36µm² in size, pitched at 80µm apart. Contact resistances of this chip on TPU substrates were in the range of 5.5 and 73mΩ but the yield of proper contact dropped from 100% to an estimated 90% compared to experiments with the previous chip. A demonstrator product, fully embedded in TPU, was made using the same chip and connects 324 peripheral electrodes to the chip on a single Au metallization layer.","Bioelectronics; neurostimulator; polyurethane; Polyimide; Electrode array; embedding; flip-chip bonding; Flexible electronics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-03-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

Service for patients have become increasingly important for healthcare providers, for example hospitals. Due to this change, hospitals experience more pressure to find the perfect balance between the components of the Triangle of Health Care: accessible, cost-friendly and high quality care. In order to improve the accessibility of care for patients, care parties have set up an initiative: “the right care in the right place”(JZOJP). This initiative is setup with the aim to shift the perspective of healthcare providers from their interests and what they have to offer, to what people need from them to live independently as long as possible. Furthermore, transmural care and concentration and decentralisation are also developments to improve the accessibility of care for patients. One way hospitals can contribute to these initiatives and developments is by setting up external outpatient clinics (EOCs). These clinics are located on the edge of their care areas or between hospital locations. These EOCs are set up to provide care closer the homes of patient and to attract patients living on the edge of care area. However, nowadays hospital are more focussed on the service for patients and less on competition with other hospitals. Franciscus Gasthuis &amp; Vlietland is a hospital group in the area of Rotterdam. Franciscus has seven locations: Franciscus Gasthuis, Franciscus Vlietland, EOC Berkel, EOC Maassluis, EOC Hoogvliet Haven polikliniek and het Oogziekenhuis, Rotterdam. The performance of the EOC locations have not yet been researched in detail before. However, after a first analysis of the patient flow it was concluded that the patient flow for Maassluis and Hoogvliet were decreasing. Also, Franciscus believes that the locations are not optimally used due to empty rooms during opening hours and lack of work for employees at the locations. With focus on the service for patients, the increasing pressure on the main locations and the vacancy of rooms at EOCs, Franciscus aims to use the EOC locations more efficient.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

The aim is to develop a dynamic fleet policy which adapts over time by intermediate assessments of the states. A Deep Q-network is trained to estimate the optimal fleet decisions based on the airline and network conditions. An end-to-end learning set-up is developed, where an optimisation algorithm evaluates the fleet decisions by comparing the optimal fleet solution profit to the estimated fleet solution profit. The stochastic evolution of air-travel demand is sampled by an adaptation of the mean-reversion Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, adjusting the air-travel demand growth at each route for general network-demand growth to capture network trends. A case study is demonstrated for three demand scenarios for a small airline operating on a domestic US airport network. It is proven that the Deep Q-network can improve the prediction values of the fleet decisions by considering the air-travel demand as input states. Secondly, the trained fleet policy is able to generate near-optimal fleet solutions and shows comparable results to a reference deterministic optimisation algorithm.","Fleet Planning Problem; Dynamic Fleet Policy; Deep Q-Network; Ornstein-Uhlenbeck","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The traditional method to acquire these data is by conducting depth soundings from a vessel, which is a very accurate way for measuring bottom elevations in all kinds of water, but has as a downside that the acquisition of data is slow. The rate data collection is limited by the vessel speed and swath, which for instance results in months of surveying to accurately map the entire Dutch coastal zone. Therefore, it is mostly applied in targeted surveys where bathymetric information is required for instance in construction project or detailed coastal analysis and modeling. It is not also feasible to conduct an entire survey for such projects and therefore remote sensing data has gained popularity in the past decades. <br/>Multiple methods of bathymetry derivation from satellite data has been topic of investigation, One of those is the concept of light attenuation, which was already covered in publications from the 1970s but is still used in many (coastal) researches. A simplification of the complex radiative transfer theory was made by assuming a log-linear relationship between reflected radiance and water depth. This simplification implies that calibration with known elevation data is needed to obtain an accurate bathymetry. These empirical Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) methods were successfully used in multiple researches the past years, but those mostly focused on single locations with typical good SDB conditions (clear water with a high reflective bottom). The main goal of this research was to gain insight in the possible applications and limitations of empirical SDB methods when optical conditions are not as ideal as in previous researches. A multi-case evaluation of these methods was conducted at several different locations on earth with each having particular conditions that affected the reflected radiance ranging from the ""most ideal"" case with clear water to a case where SDB is hardy possible because of high levels of turbidity.<br/>Promising results were obtained in cases where one can be certain that the measured reflectance is coming from the bottom, so in clear waters with hardly any suspended sediment and waves that disturb the path of light to the bottom. The results, with vertical errors below 50 cm, were in accordance to earlier researches. Also in more complex cases, where water clarity was affected by some levels of turbidity, a reliable bottom was still derived, but vertical errors where increasing. The determining factor whether it was possible to use SDB was if measured reflectance was coming from the sea floor. The full potential of a single satellite image was further analyzed by spatial analyses which showed that a small amount of data already gives enough information of calibrate a model to an accurate SDB. However, these results all rely on the initial reflectance values measured by the satellite's sensor These initial values were analyzed more elaborately without the use of calibration data. The concept of the attenuation of light in water was applied to satellite images to assess the bottom derivation without performing any calibration of the algorithm. It was found that, even after correction for atmospheric effect, measured reflectances on images that were captured at different time varied per image, which hindered the temporal analysis. With the addition of ground-truth data, these fluctuations are eliminated by vertically shifting the bottom to the absolute correct level, but when no data is available, differences in measured reflectance does not necessarily be caused by vertical bottom changes. A contribution of these fluctuations was found in the solar zenith angle, which is differs over the year.<br/>With SDB it is possible to derive accurate bathymetric maps under good optical condition. When these conditions get more challenging, the uncertainty in the bottom reflection increases, resulting in an increase of uncertainty in SDB as well.","Satellite Derived Bathymetry; SDB; Sentinel 2; Bathymetry; Google Earth Engine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As aerodynamic drag constitutes the single biggest source of engine power demand for HDVs at highway speeds, aerodynamic improvements are an effective measure to reduce fuel consumption and thus greenhouse gas emissions. Automated close-distance following of two or more HDVs, better known as “platooning”, can lead to lower drag through beneficial aerodynamic interference effects. While the influence of longitudinal separation distance between HDVs on the aerodynamic drag of the vehicles has been investigated in several studies, considerably less research has been done on the influence of relative lateral positioning or “misalignment”. This report covers a wind-tunnel experiment with two simplified models, which are known as squareback Ahmed bodies, in several longitudinal and lateral positions. Pressure measurements were done on the rear face of the leading models, and force measurements were done on both models utilizing integrated load cells. Coaxial Volumetric Velocimetry, a large-scale Particle Image Velocimetry technique, was used for reconstruction of the mean three-dimensional velocity field in the gap between the models. Three separation distances were tested: 20%L, 40%L, 60%L, where L is model length. For each longitudinal separation distance five lateral positions were tested: -25%W, -15%W, 0%W, 15%W, 25%W where W is model width. Based on the force readings it has been found that, for zero lateral offset, the leading model benefits of reduced drag coefficients for all separation distances. Pressure measurements confirm that the pressure across the base area is increased relative to the vehicle in isolation. The trailing model, on the other hand, suffers from increased drag coefficients at the tested separation distances. The positive effects of driving in a low-momentum wake are negated by secondary aerodynamic effects that increase the pressure on the nose section of the trailing model. The introduction of lateral stagger generally increases the drag coefficient, relative to the drag coefficient when aligned, for all models and all separation distances. The magnitude of the drag coefficient increase is dependent on the separation distance. The smaller the separation distance is, the more negative impact lateral offset has. Pressure measurements show that areas of low pressure occur on the base of the leading model at the side to which the trailing model moves. That is: if the trailing model is offset to the left of the leading model, then an area of lower pressure exists across the left part of the base area of the leading model. Time-averaged flow field visualizations show that for a platoon at 0.6L separation, the near wake flow topology remains largely unchanged when a lateral offset is introduced. At 0.2L separation, however, the wake topology changes considerably with lateral offset. When aligned, a toroidal vortex exists in the gap between the models. The toroidal structure changes in a horseshoe vortex when the platoon is laterally misaligned. The topological change is accompanied by strong flow curvature and leads to regions of low pressure across the base of the leading model.","Platooning; platoon; Ahmed body; PIV/PTV; PIV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The survival rate of out of hospital cardiac arrest in Europe is only 9%, even though AED (automated external defibrillators) can be accessed in public places to treat it successfully in most of the cases. First aid training is recognised as the most efficient way to provide skills, knowledge and confidence to use AED devices. Laerdal Medical is the company which provides a wide range of training equipment and is specialised in advanced CPR mannequins. As the next step, they research and work on the new tools for AED training. The extensive research was conducted to understand participants, instructor and company perspective towards the future of the AED training. With the help of St John Ambulance in the United Kingdom, the field trip was organised to investigate their current methods and needs of first aid training institution, but also better understand the users by observing courses and interviewing multiple instructors. The research showed that the aim of the courses is to make students effective and not necessarily perfect. Besides, gaining the confidence to act is as important as gaining skills and knowledge. In that process, the huge part plays the practice with the device and the positive and constructive feedback from the instructor. As a result, the project focused on empowering instructors to train and support students without unnecessary limitations. One of the challenges is assessing the performance of multiple students at the same time and also providing constant feedback without losing track of other students. Laerdal’s QCPR (Quality CPR) technology addresses this problem efficiently, however there is no solution which can be applied while students practise the AED use. The concept of future AED training was created. It consists of two elements: the physical QAED Trainer and QAED Classroom app and can be integrated with the Laerdal’s QCPR products. The AED training device does not only provide the conditions for practice but also collects participants performance. The QAED Classroom app analyses the data and provides an instructor with the reliable information which student should be addressed and suggestion what feedback to provide. When an exercise is finished the detailed information about students performance is created. Besides, if the instructor will decide to share the visual feedback with the class, the special interface can be projected on a TV or projector. The concept aims to provide a simple and accessible overview of the student’s performance so the instructor will be less stressed to control everyone but also provide more time to give feedback.","AED; First aid; CPR; defibrillator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The novel algorithm casts the hinge loss in a Distributionally Robust Optimization setting, where the ambiguity set in the distribution space is defined by the Wasserstein metric, or earth mover’s distance to the empirical distribution.

(mentor); Hoppe, T. (graduation committee); Mouter, N. (graduation committee); Enserink, B. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Wind farms are one of the main means for sustainable energy supply in the Netherlands. In the period of 2013-2020 provincial governments were tasked with siting a certain number of megawatts of wind energy on their territory. This led to the development of wind farms in many Dutch municipalities, of which the decision-making process has in many cases recently finished. In this process, citizen participation played a large role. This thesis research provides an exploratory study on the influence of this practice, using the following research question: How does the current practice of citizen participation influence the decision-making process of wind farms in the Netherlands? To answer this question, three cases have been selected of wind farms where the decision-making process was recently completed: Weijerswold in Coevorden, Spui in Hoeksche Waard and Nij Hiddum-Houw in Súdwest-Fryslân. These cases are chosen as they are very diverse regarding the type of initiator, the citizens involvement and the role of the municipality. Literature and policy documents are studied, and interviews are held with policy-makers, wind farm developers, citizens and experts. For each case, the main groups of actors that most highly influence the decision-making process are described: provincial and municipal government, initiators of wind energy and participating and activist citizens. The division of citizens into these two groups is somewhat artificial, as in reality these groups are not so strictly distinct. It also is noted that citizens participating and representing other citizens can be difficult, as in every case there are also citizens who fiercely object to the entire participation process. <br/>All three cases are analysed and evaluated using the Rounds model of G.R. Teisman (2000). In this model, the activities of the different actors are described in different ‘rounds of decision-making’. It focusses on the interaction between actors, who can make decisions in varying combinations. This thesis includes case-specific graphical representations of the Rounds model. This has not been done before by other authors who applied this model, even though it is very suitable and adds clarity to the description in text: broad outlines are easier to visualise and cross-case analysis is simplified. The cases are also classified on Arnstein’s ladder of citizen participation, the most used academic reference for classification by influence. On this ladder, the current practice of citizen participation can best be described as placation or partnership, depending on the specific case. It is hereby noted that this influence is not the only valid measurement by which to assess a citizen participation process. Furthermore, six factors of influence are determined, which each have their own influence on the decision-making process. The analysis shows that municipalities especially take on very different roles in the process, ranging from full opposition of the proposed wind farm to organising the participation process. They are not forced into either position, but decide for themselves. Furthermore, government shapes the participation process, regardless of whether this is the province or the municipality. They determine the first four factors: the timeliness of citizen involvement, the flexibility of the government process framework, the diversity of the citizen board composition and the degree of decision options in the citizen board. The timeliness is one of the most mentioned issues: in all the cases, the decision for a number of megawatts had already been made before the citizen participation process in the form of a citizen board started. The flexibility of the process is an issue when citizens want to organise the process somewhat differently, or need more time to make decisions and inform the other citizens than initially envisioned. Regarding the citizen board composition, there are cases where only nearby residents are represented and ones where there are also many other societal groups, both having different advantages. When it comes to the degree of options, it is also a question of perception to how open the options really still are. Furthermore, the attitude of the initiators is of great importance in the participation process, as is described regarding the fifth factor: the initiator’s relative willingness to extra-legal concessions. What they have to do is not completely legally determined, so this willingness to make concessions that they are not strictly obliged to also influences the influence of citizens in the participation process. The sixth factor is the experienced legitimacy of the participation process and its outcome. This experienced legitimacy is influenced by the other factors, but action committees can also have a large influence on this, as is illustrated clearly in the Spui case. In general, it is very important that citizens are put in such a position that they can have influence. This includes, for example, that they are assisted by an expert. When the right conditions are created, citizens can have real influence on the outcome of the process, ranging from the exact location of the wind turbines to financial compensation. However, their influence on the process itself is usually very limited: government, and to a lesser extent initiators, should provide the boundaries in which citizen participation can be executed well. Another conclusion is that the current legal framework is insufficient to secure a well-designed citizen participation process. This is illustrated by the wide variety of methods of organising this process in the different cases and mentioned by multiple interviewees. Research from a legal perspective is therefore also of vital importance.","citizen participation; decision-making; wind farm; rounds model; policy-making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AAS) saw a record number of passengers during the summer of 2018, with an average of 220,000 passengers per day[61]. Over recent years, the airport has recorded an increase in passenger numbers every year. Projections of the International Air Transportation Association show a significant increase in demand for air travel worldwide in every of the projection scenarios[38]. It is therefore highly likely that the demand for flying from AAS will continue to increase. This poses a problem because the airport is surrounded by densely populated municipalities. Apart from passenger numbers, the airport also broke records in terms of complaints from the surrounding community[53]. To mitigate nuisance, the airport is assigned a fixed quota in terms of environmental pollution and external safety. This leads to the airport being restricted to a certain amount of flights per year and the operations being highly constrained by noise abatement procedures. A major factor in these noise abatement procedures is the ""Fourth runway rule"". This rule is aimed at minimising operations with four runways in use simultaneously, by mandating that under normal circumstances no more than 40 flights per day may be handled using the ""fourth runway""[3]. As a result, it is required to operate predominantly using configurations with three active runways throughout the day. Facilitating the alternating pattern of inbound and outbound peaks at AAS, using only three active runways, requires switching between using a second runway for inbound traffic and using a second runway for outbound traffic. These type of reconfigurations are referred to as demand-based runway reconfigurations. The ""Fourth runway rule"" combined with varying wind conditions at AAS, results in the airport seeing 18 runway reconfigurations per day on average[54]. According to investigations by the Dutch council for safety(OVV), the high amount of runway reconfigurations poses elevated safety risks[55]. Apart from these elevated safety risks, runway reconfigurations are considered disruptive events that can lead to substantial capacity reductions for the airport system [4]. Considering these facts, it is critically important to establish an adequate understanding of the phenomenon thereby enabling the estimation of the effects and generating the potential for mitigating these effects. The research described in this report is aimed at developing this understanding by exploring the dynamics, decisionmaking processes, quantitative aspects, and qualitative aspects related to the runway reconfiguration phenomenon. For an airport like AAS, with a complex runway structure, performing a safe and efficient runway reconfiguration is no trivial task. This task is in reality performed through an interaction between two highly skilled and experienced air traffic control operators, that bear responsibility for mutually exclusive control areas of the inboundoutbound system. Investigating this complex socio-technical phenomenon is highly challenging due to the many interactions, uncertainties, and qualitative aspects involved. Especially the aspect of human intelligence involved in this phenomenon is hard to capture and fully understand.","Agent-Based Modellig","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

A mobihub (or mobipunt in Dutch) is a brand of mobility hub. In this report, a mobility hub is defined as “A recognizable, physical place where different context-driven functions and services (mostly shared mobility-related such as shared cars) that benefit the neighbourhood meet. A connection to public transport is desirable but type-dependant.”A typology of mobihubs was found and simplified to three types, with a special focus on the type: “neighbourhood hub”. Along with this, a target group was defined: the “suburban citizen”: people that live in a smaller neighbourhood and work in a bigger city. This type of hub and target group determined the focus of the project. This focus was on social cohesion in the neighbourhood. Vision in Product Design (VIP) was used as the main design &amp; research method.In the research phase, a broad literature study was done, along with case studies in the Netherlands and interviews with users from the target group (Figure 1), amongst others. It was found that users on a transport hub always navigate the space between being connected and being autonomous, while they experience positive or negative ‘friction’ (events that slow them down) during their travels. The amount of ‘being connected’ and ‘autonomy’ that a user experiences or seeks, depends on that users personality. Based on this, the design statement was formed:“The mobihub needs to wake up people by introducing a kind of positive friction (that literally and figuratively slows them down) at their local or commute mobihub, with which they can choose to interact, together or alone”The mobihub needs to facilitate for two kinds of pePple at the same time. The fact that the mobihub needs to be in these two states at the same time was compared to the principle of ‘quantum superpositioning’. In quantum superpositioning, a quantum particle can be in two places at the same time (figure 2). After an ideation period a design direction was found. This design direction revolves around modular multi-purpose interactive capsules on the mobihub. With these capsules, inhabitants can combine their mobility patterns. Inhabitants can deliver packages for each other, lend or sell each other items, or pick up groceries. The capsules and the supporting app form an open-ended platform that can be used by the inhabitants as they see fit. This design direction was prototyped (figure 3) and evaluated with users and experts. The functionalities were viewed as very beneficial, but the design direction did not provide a meaningful interaction between place (mobihub) and user (inhabitant).After an extended period of research, it was found that the mobihub should act as a concerned parent through the app and the interactive capsules. The mobihub acting as a concerned parent gives the relationship between user and hub more meaning, because it mirrors wanted mobility patterns. The hub is a concerned parent that needs to ‘educate’ it’s users about responsible mobility usage, and ‘take care’ of them. The user, in turn, has the responsibility to keep visiting his ‘parent’. The final design was dubbed “mobi+punt” (Mobipuntplus or Mobipluspunt) (see figures 4 and 5) and was evaluated with relevant experts in an expert meeting (figure 6). It was evident that social cohesion the most relevant success factor of the design is, as well as efficiency in delivery methods and extra value for the neighbourhood. The main limitations all revolved around the business model and implementation -questions. The final design is still conceptual, and there are much unknowns about its eventual realisation. The experts recognized that it is an idea with a lot of potential.","Mobility; Sustainability; social cohesion; energy transition; Vision in Product Design; Neighbourhood; human-centred design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Carbon free hydrogen as an energy carrier can significantly reduce the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the entire energy system. In this report, a concept for a spatially efficient, initial hydrogen corridor in the European Union is proposed. The corridor links up areas with high hydrogen consumption to regions with great hydrogen production potential. The spatial distribution of hydrogen demand in a bottom-up scenario was determined first. With this information an optimal hydrogen corridor was composed and subsequently the consumption potential for this corridor was estimated. Finally a hydrogen system was designed with plans for production, transmission and storage. The areas that make up the corridor, going from the Sahara to the North of England, have a combined surface area of only 7% of the EU total. The proposed corridor currently consumes 50% of the total hydrogen consumption in the EU. In 2050 the corridor will consume an estimated 33% of the EU total. In an ambitious scenario, the proposed system is designed to produce and transport almost 31 million tons of hydrogen, or about 1200 TWh, to the corridor. About 35% of the hydrogen is produced in the EU, mainly on the North-Sea, and the rest in the Sahara desert. The hydrogen is distributed among the corridor by identifying 7800 kilometers of existing natural gas infrastructure. The estimated levelised cost of hydrogen transmission amount to 0.12 € per kilogram. Next to that more than enough hydrogen storage potential is available in the vicinity of the infrastructure using already existing rock-salt caverns. Although the project presented in this research may be of large scale and bring severe challenges, the positive environmental consequences are potentially even greater. The EU has the bold ambition to make Europe the first climate neutral continent on the planet and this hydrogen corridor can very significantly contribute to this ambition. Furthermore the EU currently has the political and economic power, as well as the required knowledge, to take a leading role in the development of hydrogen technology. A leading role that may turn out to be very profitable because hydrogen, with its versatility and undeniable strength to decarbonise entire energy systems, will undoubtedly be used by the rest of the world.","Hydrogen; Renewable Energy; Europe","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this thesis is to perform a mission analysis of a space-based telescope that provides warning for Earth-impacting NEOs down to 20 m in size, by determining the performance of both a visible and an infrared (IR) space-based telescope used in two different mission candidates.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Salts of trivalent cerium (Ce(III)) are known to successfully hinder localised corrosion phenomena typical of aerospace aluminium alloys by forming a thin passivation layer on top of the corrosion-active intermetallic phases. This is generally observed to happen when the alloy is under immersion conditions in a solution containing Ce3+ ions. However, some very preliminary works suggest that protection provided by this layer is lost once the passivated metal is re-exposed to a corrosive solution in absence of inhibitor (for example, aqueous solution of sodium chloride). This (in)stability process has not been directly addressed in literature and is, therefore, not well understood. A deeper understanding of such process and the strategies that could lead to a higher passive layer stability are needed to bring Ce-based inhibitor technologies closer to application and replacement of the harmful Cr(VI)-based primers. In this work we studied the inhibition mechanism and stability of cerium inhibiting layers created on AA 2024-T3 upon exposure to electrolytic solutions containing Ce(NO3)3 and NaCl. The stability of Ce(III) layers after re-exposure to corrosive electrolytes (i.e. without inhibitors) is investigated. Furthermore, the interaction between Ce(III) layers and different organic compounds, namely 2,5-Dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole (DMTD), phytic acid and sodium alginate, was also explored as a potential strategy for stabilisation of Ce-based inhibitive layers.<br/>Due to the complex interpretation of electrochemical signals typically used in corrosion studies (e.g. electrochemical noise and impedance spectroscopy), it was decided to combine such electrochemical methods with highly spatio-temporally resolved in-situ microscopy in order to assess both corrosion of AA 2024-T3 and its inhibition. For this purpose, a home made optical-electrochemical experimental setup was used, together with a protocol for optical data analysis. This hyphenated in-situ protocol is further supported with SEM-EDS, Raman and SKPFM analysis after exposure. In the work here presented, the unstable nature of Ce-inhibitive deposits was found to be associated to their dissolution after re-exposure to inhibitor-free electrolytes. Studies devoted to the stabilisation of Ce(III)-inhibitive layers with organic molecules indicated different behaviours and outcomes. Alginate oligomers efficiently passivate the Ce-protected intermetallic phase, but, at the same time, destabilise the Al-rich matrix, which became subject to general corrosion. Phytic acid was found to provide synergy with Ce(III) layers, which however lacked in stability. Treatment of Ce-passivated surfaces with DMTD, on the other hand, shows a significantly delayed onset of optical-electrochemical activity upon re-immersion in NaCl solution, which suggested the accomplishment of a more stable system. The results obtained confirm the power of in-situ (i.e. under immersion) optical investigation not only to support the understanding of complex electrochemical signals, but also to deliver quantitative information relevant in corrosion and inhibition studies. The approach proposed in this research is believed to be of future help for an improved design of Cr(VI)-free anticorrosion coating systems.","Cerium; Corrosion; Corrosion inhibitor; Aerospace aluminium alloy; AA 2024-T3; Stability; Opto-electrochemistry; Alginate; Phytic Acid; DMTD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-01","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

However, artificial intelligence systems raise a series of ethical challenges that hamper their sustainable development. These challenges have often been discussed from a philosophical or theoretical perspective, but rarely from the more practical perspective of businesses. The lack of such a perspective for the ICT-sector in the Netherlands has formed a barrier to develop adequate ethical governance mechanisms. Specifically, the scarcity of practical data of ethical challenges and governance of business in the industry has made it difficult to establish the quality of the current code of ethics for the industry and the need for additional ethical governance measures. This research provides a descriptive study of ethical challenges and ethical governance of AI for ICT-businesses in the Netherlands. A form of mixed methodology (i.e., the exploratory sequential method) combines literature, interviews, and a questionnaire to acquire the relevant data. The results of these three methods are triangulated to identify room for improvement in the current code of ethics and identify the need for additional governance measures. Explainability, fairness, safety, and privacy were identified as the most pressing ethical challenges for businesses in the industry. This research also found that the first three of these challenges are currently insufficiently addressed in the code of ethics for the ICT-industry. Moreover, this study found a significantly low level of ethical governance of AI among small and medium-sized enterprises as compared to large companies. Future research should focus on further normative argumentation on principles for explainability, fairness, and safety to improve the code of ethics. Furthermore, this work lays the basis for researching and developing different concrete ethical governance measures of AI for the industry, especially for SMEs.","Artificial Intelligence; Code of Ethics; Ethical Governance; ICT-industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The goal of this thesis is to find out what the geotechnical properties are of the 7 different locations at the eastern flank of the Rockall bank which is located to the west of Ireland and to the south of Iceland in the Atlantic Ocean. The possible effects of these properties on slope stability are then discussed. This will be done by geotechnically testing the sediments in a laboratory. All standards used during testing can be seen in chapter 3.1.1. The gravity cores used for this research were found to contain parts of sediment that were quite intact together with other more disturbed parts of sediment. The sediments that were found could be classified as silty SAND, clayey SILTS and silty CLAYS which are calcareous to very higly calcareous,from medium to very high plasticity, low to medium-organic and have extremely low to very low undrained shear strengths. Grain size distribtions were found to be gap-graded and well graded and the the sediments were found to be inactive to normal soil based on the Atterberg limits.Geotechnical properties such as gravimetric water contents are found to range from 0.20 to 1.18, the volumetric water contents range from 0.50 to 0.80, a liquidity index from 0 to 3, specific gravities from 2.72 to 2.79, void ratios from 1 to 3, bulk volumetric weights from 14 kN/m3 to 18 kN/m3, dry volumetric weights from 7 kN/m3 to 13 kN/m3, clay contents from 10% to 60%, a silt content of 15% to 60%, a sand content from 8% to 70%, calcite contents from 17.3% to 57.4%, organic matter contents from 2.6% to 9.0%, liquid limits from 0.40 to 0.82 and plastic limits from 0.23 to 0.49. The undrained shear strength for the original and remoulded sediments from the UU DS tests is found to range from 2 kPa to 8 kPa and from 0 kPa to 4 kPa. The undrained shear strengths from original and remoulded sediments from the fall cone test range from 4 kPa to 33 kPa and from 0 kPa to 4 kPa. The undrained shear strengths from the original pocket vane tests range from 5 kPa to 22 kPa. The sensitivities of the sediments measured by the fall cone tests are found to range from 2 to 28 and the sensitivities obtained by direct shear testing are found to range from 0.5 to 4.Based on these undrained shear strengths a failure mechanism similar to that of a direct shear test is found to be more likely on the undisturbed sediments and a failure mechanism like that of a fall cone test is found to be more likely for the remoulded sediments. The non-phyllosilicate minerals that are present are Smectite, Illite, Muscovite, Chlorite and Kaolinite. The phyllosilicate minerals that are present are Quartz, Alkali feldspar, Plagioclase, Calcite, Ankerite, Siderite, Anatase, Rutile, Hematite, Pyrite, Halite and Apatite. This mineral composition can be logically explained by their possible weathering paths and indicates that the possible parent material is Monzogranite type 2 also called Muscovite-metagranite. Magnetic particles are found to be present in all sediments in small amounts that are not quantified. Similar sediments are found to be present from the research of ( Georgiopoulou, Krastel et al., 2019). This confirms the presence of turbidty deposits. These turbidity deposits are indicated to be present at all sites based on the fininng-upward sequences found. Also the presence of lighter interglacial and darker glacial sediments is found. It was also found that the likley reasons for slope instability on the eastern side of the Rockall Bank are the much higher water contents and clay contents of the sediments present compared to the sediments found on eastern side of the Rockall through.The risk of liquefaction upon distrubance is found at sites 1736, 1672, 1988, 1959 and 1604. No risk of liquefaction upon disturbance is found at site 688. The organic matter content is considered to not have an effect on strenght parameters of the sediments present whereas an increase in the amount of foraminifera shells could increase stability of the sediments. Only differential compaction is not found to be a probable factor in lanslide initiation. A long term instability could arise from weathering of Smectite minerals. Erosion could cause slope instability due to sediments with widely varying grain size distributions. The high water content sediments that are present are prone to liquefaction due a disturbance possibly from seismic activity. It is recommended that in future studies a quantification of the marine shell fraction is made. Also a microscope spectrometry is recommended to be done on the sand fraction together with an X-ray diffraction on the &lt;63µm fraction. The most important recommendation is to do a slope stability analysis on the RBSC using the geotechnical properties presented in this thesis.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

The children participating in these strikes indicate that they do not feel heard. While striking is relevant to communicate their opinions, change can also be initiated by changing the perspective of for example parents/guardians. This led to the initial design brief to ‘help minors of the age 12 to 14 to take agency in developing strategies to decrease environmental impact in their home environment’. The first phase of the project was the research phase. Agency in sustainability consists of a combination of the readiness to change behaviour and the feeling of self-efficacy one has. One does not only have to believe in their own ability to become more sustainable, but also must believe that those efforts make a difference. The research showed that an additional motivation to be more sustainable (saving money, being healthier) was the reason people stayed motivated in their efforts to be more sustainable. This study provided an overview of factors that influence the self-efficacy and the readiness to change their behaviour, which together determine whether there is the possibility to take agency over a situation. A lack of intrinsic motivation and existing beliefs regarding sustainable habits or the value of current habits limit the readiness to change behaviour. A lack of information or highly complex information, a lack of constructive reflection, and unclear intention setting limit a feeling of self-efficacy. The following design goal was formulated: I want children of the age 12 to 14 to feel an appreciation for food when deciding what to eat together with their parents. My goal is not only to help them eat more sustainably, but also to help the family reflect on the value of current food habits in open. I determined the following desired characteristics: surprising, appreciative, connecting and in control. Food for Thought helps families to pick meals based on what their limitations or values are on certain days of the week instead of what type of meals they want to eat. This responds to the limitation of not making concrete plans to realize intentions. It is a card set with a mobile application. The cards have on one side different categories of values, ('quick', or 'a treat'), On the back of the cards there are recipes that fit with the value they chose. Giving the family a sustainable meal idea ensures they have all the information necessary to prepare a sustainable meal, thus making it easier for them to fulfil their sustainability goal. In this way the design bridges between intention setting and self-reactiveness and helps them discuss sustainability with the family. This method of bridging between intention setting and self-reactiveness was useful to let the families look at their food habits differently and proved to be both educative and easy to implement. Using values to provide users with a fitting approach to behavioural change could be used in other situations where a change of behaviour is fitting.","sustainability; family communication; children; agency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","ENERGE Interreg",""

However, to prevent damage to the surrounding buildings, the settlements induced by the tunnelling should be kept to a minimum. This thesis researches the influence of the TBM tail void and its grouting process on the settlements. To do so, the monitoring and TBM data from the North/South line in Amsterdam is used. The data of the settlements, grout pressures and grout volumes is searched for locations with sudden changes. For these locations, the development of the settlements as a function of the TBM movement is compared to find out if the changes in settlements are caused by the tail void. This turns out to be the case for half of the researched locations. Furthermore, the changes of the grout pressuresmeasured in the tail void, and the volume injected grout volume are compared for these locations. An increase in injected grout volume shows to decrease the settlements induced by the tail void, while the pressure does not show a correlation with the settlements. Because only one sensor was used for the pressuremeasurements, the grout pressures are then compared for all sensors in the tail void. Again, no correlation is found between the grout pressures and the settlements. A side step in the research shows the development of the grout pressures in the tail void. During the boring process the grout pressures fluctuate. During the boring and forward movement of the TBM the tail void is injected with grout and the grout pressures in the tail void increase. During the ring building phase, this grouting stops and the grout pressures start to dissipate. The amount of dissipation is influenced by the permeability of the surrounding soil. With the help of DIANA FEM software, the influence of the tail void on the total settlements is investigated. The calculations show that a different grouting behaviour caused a change of only 4mmin total settlements. Concluding, as long as the pressures in the tail void stay above the soil pressure the tail void can be filled with grout. The injected grout volume will fill the tail void, preventing the soil from moving into the tail void and with that minimising the settlements at the surface.","TBM; Tunneling; tail void; grout; settlements","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

The well-established first and second generation surgical procedures are not capable of giving optimal outcomes. Moreover, my literature study has shown little to no improvements for four of the most prevailing third generation procedures. As a consequence, the med-tech company Amber Implants B.V. developed a new 3D-printed porous titanium implant that has the potential to resolve difficulties and drawbacks that were identified for all former procedures. Nonetheless, the performance of this implant has never been tested before. Thus, the aim of this study was to pre-clinically evaluate the biomechanical properties regarding the spinal deformities for this implant. For the quantification, the prevention of spinal deformities was subdivided into the anterior height restoration and the kyphotic angle correction. The pre-clinical evaluation was conducted on isolated vertebrae originating from three human cadaver specimens. First, the most abundant type of all osteoporotic VCFs, a wedge fracture, was generated on the vertebrae with 40% anterior height decrease. Thereafter, vertebral restoration was performed with the implants. Besides, vertebral restoration with the second generation surgical procedure, the Balloon Kyphoplasty procedure (BKP), was performed likewise to serve as a comparative. After vertebral restoration, half of the implant group and the total BKP group were tested in a cyclic loading test that mimicked the activity during the first week after surgical VCF repair, i.e. 10.000 cycles with loads ranging from 100N to 600N. The other half of the implant group was tested under higher loading conditions, i.e. 10.000 cycles with loads ranging from 100N to 1000N. At each test stage the spinal deformities, which were subdivided into the anterior height and the kyphotic angle, were evaluated from micro-CT (μCT) data. Eventually, the μCT scans were compared in order to quantify the implant's performance. The anterior height restoration after vertebral restoration with the implant was outstanding compared to the BKP procedure. Thereby, a statistical significance difference (p&lt;0.05) was not only observed for the anterior height restoration, but also for the central and posterior height restorations, between the two surgical procedures. Additionally, the kyphotic angle correction of the implant procedure outperformed the outcomes observed for the BKP. Nonetheless, after cyclic loading various drawbacks for the implants were observed, resulting in substantial decreases in outcomes for the height restoration and the kyphotic angle correction. Regarding the height decrease, most was found in the trabecular bone inferior to the implant. Presumably, the plastic deformation was induced by high local stresses as a result of the minimal contact area between the implant and the trabecular bone. Complementary, the rotation of the implant was observed to effect the implant's performance. Ultimately, it was concluded that the implant in its current design could not compete with the BKP procedure, neither with the third generation surgical repair procedures for an osteoporotic VCF such as Vertebral Body Stenting (VBS) and SpineJack. Nevertheless, the outcomes after vertebral restoration were promising. Therefore, it was assumed that the implant has a decent chance of succeeding after implementing some adjustments on the implant's geometry and the corresponding surgical tools.","Vertebral Compression Fractures; Vertebral Implant; Balloon Kyphoplasty; Height Restoration; Kyphotic Angle Correction; Cadaver","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Increasing the passenger satisfaction contributes to the ambition of Schiphol to become Europe’s preferred airport. The departure gates are impactful touchpoints that currently receive relatively low satisfaction scores. Therefore, this project focuses on creating a memorable waiting experience at the gates by reducing the perceived length of waiting time. Research shows that emotions dominate while waiting and that positive emotions at the end of an experience can improve overall satisfaction. This indicates the importance of enhancing the emotional state of the passengers to improve their perception of waiting time and contribute to a 9+ experience. <br/><br/>Research shows that distraction possibilities and exhilarating ambient conditions seem to lack at the G-gates, while these play an important role in improving the passengers’ emotional state. Distractions can make the waiting experience of the passengers more memorable; for example, entertainment and beautiful and eye-catching objects can distract from feelings of discomfort and boredom. Certain design qualities of the am¬biance can also impact the passengers’ emotional state. This project aims to design a distraction that improves the ambiance. The focus will be on evoking positive and desired product-human interactions, because these have shown to be very important in stimulating positive emotions. An airport terminal is designed to reduce stress. However, most passengers experience the current G-gates as being plain functional, impersonal and boring, and, regardless of the intended purpose of the current terminal design, still feel restless. Studies show that adding some complexity and unique colors to a coherent environment increases its liking and stimulates positivity. Passenger analyses show the need for more exciting, warm, relaxed and personal interactions. At the same time, it is also identified that the distraction should only be moderate as passengers should not be withheld from activities they want and need to perform. Research shows that the identified design qualities and types of interactions may lead to the following positive emotions: feeling enchanted, amused, relaxed, dreamy, at ease and connected. During the project, some design interventions were tested, having the potential of creating the desired interactions and emotions. More insights were gathered on how to create the desired interactions, but also on what type of distraction passengers want to engage in. The results of these experiments have led to the creation of a concept proposal that is tested with the passengers at the G-gates by means of an experiential prototype. ‘FLIP’ offers a moderate distraction for passengers waiting at the G-gates of Schiphol. Stimulus seekers can modify the ambiance around them by flipping colored window filters to another color, thereby leaving a personal pattern. The eye-catching and unique appearance improves the ambiance of the G-gates because it adds some complexity to the coherent and boring environment. Passengers will feel enchanted and amused because they are able to create special effects with bright colors. The warm light in a fluent dynamic design enhances relaxation. FLIP allows passengers to connect with the environment. Their perception of waiting time is improved; for a moment, passengers forget that they are waiting at an airport.","passenger experience; positive emotions; interaction; gates; perception of waiting time; distraction; ambience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

To deliver these goods to your home, the mobile robot will be driving in pedestrian rich environments. In these environments the robot will need to socially navigate itself in a way which is both pleasant for the pedestrians and progressive for the robot. During its drive, the robots behavior should be adapted to the situation it finds itself in. The underlying theory for this is the Social, Technology and Service triangle. This triangle dictates the balance between three aspects. The technology aspect focuses on power consumption and efficiency. The service aspect is all about delivery time and location. The social aspect is all about minimizing social disruption and facilitating intuitive behavior. The behavior of pedestrians can be modelled with the Social Force Model. In this model the objects and pedestrians apply social forces onto each other which determine their movements. The robot can use this SFM for its own social navigation. Multi-Policy Decision Making (MPDM) can be added onto the Social Force Model. This allows for switching between three basic policies: go-solo, follow and stop. Through forward simulations the robot can predict and decide which of the three policies brings the most progress and the least social disruption. However, SFM-MPDM on its own does not cope well with passing and crossing; thus methods were designed to handle these situations. In passing the robot looks ahead and makes room, often keeping right. In crossing the robot slows down and deviates to cross behind the pedestrian. The Social Force Model, the Multi-Policy Decision Making and the passing and crossing all combined form the social navigational model. This model consist of the many different parameters which govern the behavior and is part of the overall computational mechanism. This mechanism takes in the environment through sensors such as LiDAR. It preprocesses these inputs and sends them to the model. The output of this model is what determines the locomotion and behavior of the robot. To find the behavior and its underlying parameters an Evolutionary Algorithm was employed.<br/>The learnt behavioral parameter sets were tested with participants (n=42) and a physical ROSbot. They were asked to rate the robots behavioral performance on comfort, predictability and communication of intent. From these results, it became clear that the robots behavior influences the experience of the pedestrians, but it is unclear which parameter exactly influences which part of the behavior. There are certain expectations to what impact a parameter or group of parameters has, but at which times and to what effect this controls parts of the behavior is difficult to identify. Nevertheless a good foundation has been laid down for future projects through a social navigational model and a way to learn parameters for the many different situations an autonomous delivery robot can encounter. A recommendation is to improve the Evolutionary Algorithm in order to facilitate parameter learning which better matches the desired behavior in the STS-triangle.","design; social; behavior; robot; Autonomous vehicles; Evolutionary Algorithm - EA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

However, in the current literature, the safety of these vehicles is generally an assumption rather than a certainty. Moreover, the time period where CAVs and Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs) share the road (i.e. hybrid traffic period) is often not considered by the design of these concepts.<br/>This paper describes technical and non-technical factors that influence the actual and perceived safety of passengers of HDVs and CAVs during the vehicle interactions that occur in the hybrid traffic period. The impact of the indicated factors on the actual or perceived safety of a vehicle is analyzed and described in terms of required safety margins around a vehicle. The size of the safety margins described depend on the positioning inaccuracy of the vehicle, its trajectory tracking inaccuracy, a time synchronisation inaccuracy, and on the preferred time headway, preferred driver space, and accepted time gap of the car occupants. Due to a lack of available data that could be used to compare the expected size of the safety margins around the vehicle with, this research presents a methodology to generate own data that could be used for this comparison. A virtual reality experiment was executed among 82 participants, which resulted in a 93\% acceptance rate at a time gap of 1.5 seconds between one vehicle leaving and another vehicle entering their conflict area. It appeared that neither the crossing direction (left, right) nor the vehicle composition (HDV, CAV) of a vehicle interaction scenario influenced the perceived safety margins in front of the vehicle. The experiment found lower perceived safety margins in front of the vehicle than was expected according to the literature study. This may be the result of the sample not completely being comparable to the total drivers population. 2.0 seconds was accepted by 99\% of the participants. The question arises what acceptance rate is desired to determine the minimum time gap that can be used as a perceived safety margin by future traffic control systems. The accepted time gap is expected to decrease as soon as more drivers get experienced with CAVs.","Actual Safety; Perceived Safety; Safety Margins; individual Space-Time Reservation; Hybrid Traffic Control System; Connected and Automated Vehicles; Virtual Reality Experiment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Therefore, the idea of secondary disinfection at households to control the drinking water quality has come up. Ultrasound disinfection provides an easy-operated way for point-of-use disinfection, which can be influenced by the local hydraulic conditions. Previous studies have monitored the spatial and temporal variations in the microbial community in DWDS but most of cases were based on long-term effect. In this study, a simulated household piping system was sampled intensively over short time scales. Several parameters on the dynamics of microbiological processes such as tATP, cATP, TOC and total cell concentration of drinking water samples were examined at four sampling points under various flow rate at different disinfection time. The results highlighted that ultrasound disinfection can restrain cell activity but the effect was also influenced by flow rate. Both FCM and ATP data described the microbiological dynamics in the drinking water samples. The cell concentrations decreased when the flow rate was lower. Moreover, operation time of the ultrasonic device showed significant influence on the disinfection efficiency. At the same sampling point, when the system was operated at a constant flow rate, the cell activity decreased with the increase of the operation time of ultrasonic device. Considering the time that a cell travel through the system subjected to ultrasonic effects, the so called exposure time, it is observed that the cell activity decreased with the increase of time that the cell experienced ultrasound. As a result, the cell at the furthest sampling point under the most significant flow rate with longest ultrasound disinfection time showed the lowest activity.","drinking water; Ultrasonic measurements; disinfection; Microbial Growth","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","CIE5050-09",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The erosion resistance of clay is an important aspect when assessing the integrity of a levee. This is because the clay layer of a dike must resist the forces that are imposed in the case of overflow or overtopping. Currently, the erosion resistance of clay in the Netherlands is being assessed based on the sand content, the liquid limit and the plasticity index. The quality of compaction is assessed by a density requirement. However, the effect of compaction on the erosion resistance of clay is not well understood and although its importance has been widely acknowledged by multiple literature sources, it has never been quantified. Therefore the goal of this thesis is to investigate what the are of compaction on the erosion resistance of clay and how large. To do this first of all a set-up has been designed and built, resembling the Erosion Function Apparatus as suggested by Briaud with some differences. Then 3 types of clay have been tested with differing initial erosion characteristics: one kind which fully complies with the current Dutch guidelines, 1 which does not quite suffice and 1 which does not suffice in any way. These 3 types of clay have been compacted at various energy levels (Modified Proctor, Proctor and 0.5*Proctor density). Also samples with differing water contents have been produced at each energy level and each clay. These samples were subsequently tested in the Erosion Function Apparatus at several flow-velocities in order to establish an erosion curve from which several erosion parameters were determined. \bigskip Having performed the erosion tests and determined the accompanying erosion parameters the results were interpreted in the Proctor curve. Plotting the results in the Proctor curve show that samples compacted at the optimum water content in the Proctor plane perform best, whereas they perform poorer the farther the water content is off from the optimum. Also it shows an increase in the compaction effort will generally result in a lower amount of erosion occurring. This result has been obtained by determining the critical shear stress, critical erosion velocity, the detachment coefficient and the velocity detachment coefficient and plotting these results in the Proctor curve. The first two parameters are measures of the amount of strength the soil has before it starts eroding at all, whereas the latter two are an increment meant to predict how much a soil might erode if the force imposed on the soil is above the erosion threshold. The results consistently showed the detachment coefficients were lowest with the samples compacted at an optimum water content and/or undergone a higher compaction effort (i.e. the soils erode less). On the other hand the critical shear stress/critical erosion velocity was highest at the optimum water content (i.e the soil erodes less), but did not necessarily increase with an increasing compaction effort. This is attributed to the loss of suction. Further, all tested soils showed their optimum erosion characteristics at or close to a degree of saturation of 85 \%. Several other methods were tried, but to no avail unfortunately. Also the rates of erosion were compared between the different types of clay. The clay which is in compliance with the Dutch codes showed the least amount of erosion, the one that did not quite suffice showed some more erosion and the clay that did not comply with the erosion guidelines at all showed the most erosion. However, it was also proved that the clay which did not quite suffice the requirements was (if compacted at optimum water content and at a sufficient energy level) only slightly more erodible than the clay which fully complied with the current Dutch regulations. Finally, the results of the tests carried out in this study were also compared to similar tests performed in the United States and the show consistent similar results. Overall, this study concludes that the use of (currently perceived) unsuitable clay as dike cover can be possible if compacted at or very close to the optimum water content and at a sufficient energy level. Also it can be concluded that compaction at the optimum water content can dramatically reduce the erodibility of a soil or even stop the erosion process. Increasing the compaction effort also reduces erodibility of a soil, although it must be kept in mind that the optimum water content also changes and thus if it is wise to do so. Finally this thesis leaves some suggestions for further research. These mainly concern the effects of cyclic wetting/drying cycles on the erodibility of the soil as well as trying to better understand the effects of the erosion process happening in the field versus the erosion process that is happening in the laboratory.","Erosion; Compaction; Dike; Overflow; Briaud; Erosion Function Apparatus","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-27","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

In cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), anaggressive malignancy of the liver, the extracellular matrix (ECM) surroundingthe cancer cells plays an essential role in tumor progression andchemo-resistance. To research potential mechanisms involved indrug-resistance it is necessary to grow CCA-derived cells in the vicinity oftheir native tumor micro-environment. Cell-free scaffolds can be created bydecellularizing liver tissue contributing to the availability of new tissueengineering culture platforms. The resulting extracellular matrix can serve asa scaffold resembling the native non-cellular component of the tumorenvironment. However, a protocol to decellularize CCA tumor tissue is not yetestablished. It is not possible to use the traditional perfusion-baseddecellularization protocol for tumors, due to the lack of an intact capsule andvascular system to cannulate. The aim of this study is to develop a tumorscaffold retaining the essential characteristics of the extracellular matrixand to investigate its feasibility to serve as a scaffold for CCA-derivedorganoids. To do this, CCA tumors were decellularized using an adaptedprotocol. Efficiency of removal of cells was determined by histology andanalysis of DNA content and the preservation of collagen and tissue stiffnesswas assessed. Architecture of decellularized tumor was compared to architecture of decellularized normal liver tissue. A-cellular scaffolds wererepopulated with CCA-derived organoids and ingrowth and viability of cells wereevaluated by histology and confocal imaging. Metabolic activity and geneexpression levels were compared to cells grown in standard basement membranematrix (BME) gel and grown in normal liver a-cellular scaffolds. Aftercompleting the protocol, tumor tissues were white in color and histologicalexamination revealed no cells could be detected indicating completedecellularization. DNA content was slightly above the critical thresholdindicating not all nuclear debris was removed. Characterization of the tumortissue and normal liver matrices revealed markedly higher collagen content andhigher stiffness in tumor tissue underlining the importance to differentiatebetween tumor and normal scaffolds. Recellularization of the scaffoldsrevealed that cells did not only attach to the surface, but also grow insidethe scaffold. Comparable metabolic activity was observed between cells grown intumor scaffold and in BME. We observed that cells seeded in tumor scaffoldsshowed different gene expression levels than those seeded in standard BMEculture. The resulting combination of CCA-derived organoids and tumor ECMprovides an innovative basis for a model in which cell-extracellular matrixinteractions can be studied.

By making use of the development of efficient, gradient-based MCMC algorithms, probabilistic inversion provides a tool for this. To test to what extent we can reduce the uncertainty of an initial geological model, we integrate geological modelling into a Bayesian inverse framework. Additional information can then be included in this inverse framework through likelihood functions. <br/>The proposed methodology is tested on a geological model of the structurally complex Kevitsa deposit in Finnish Lapland. By starting with an initial interpretation-based 3D geological model, we define the uncertainties in our geological model by means of probability density functions. Magnetic data and geological interpretations of borehole data are used to define geophysical and geological likelihoods respectively. To use the magnetic data in the inference, the mathematical description of the magnetic forward calculation is implemented for a 3D voxelised space, linking the geophysical data through magnetic rock properties to the uncertain structural parameters. The result of the inverse problem is presented in the form of probability distributions and ensembles of the realised models through visual analysis. The former is a statistical consideration of the results, whereas the latter is a visual representation for direct interpretation in a geological sense. The uncertainties in these visual representations are best presented by means of information entropy, which allows for a quantitative analysis. The results show that well-defined likelihood functions can reduce uncertainties in geological models and build on the complementary strength of different types of data. Where probabilistic inversion inherently provides uncertainty analysis, finding a single representative solution is less trivial.

Aeroelastic phenomena such as forced response and flutter are one of the main concerns when designing these machines, and the incorrect prediction of these effects generates vibrations that can lead to structural failure due to high cycle fatigue. Furthermore, the search for unconventional energy sources is also of great relevance to meet these demands. Power generation using the Rankine cycle with organic fluids is one example of these technologies. The different thermodynamic properties, when comparing to water, of these fluids, make it possible to use low temperature energy sources, having many practical applications such as waste heat recovery and combined power cycles. Organic fluids, due to their high molecular weight, are also characterized by a low speed of sound which results in a supersonic flow, leading to shock waves. This unsteadiness propagates onto rotating blade rows downstream and acts as a harmonic forcing. Investigating the impact of these effects on the structural integrity of small scale radial machines operating with organic fluids has not been done in the past and is the goal of this thesis. The assembly of a forced response analysis chain is made and is based in three main points. First, finding and characterizing resonant conditions. Second, determining aerodynamic harmonic forcing and aerodynamic damping, and finally, place alternating and mean stresses against structural limits. This method was applied to two test cases, the NASA rotor 67 and the ORCHID turbine. The NASA rotor 67 is used as a benchmark case to assemble and validate the analysis chain due to the large amount of openly available experimental data. ORCHID is a small scale ORC turbine designed at TU Delft and is used to explore the influence of the aeroelastic effects on this category of machines. For the ORCHID turbine, high unsteady pressures in the turbine rotor blades were observed by the simulations made. This is due to the shock waves in the upstream supersonic stator, from tip leakage and from potential interactions. In terms of flutter, a stable system was found for the resonant conditions studied. The regions of higher unsteadiness were confined to the upstream most part of the rotor blade being excited, which correspond to areas of small modal displacements. Furthermore, even with high rotational speeds, the small scale of the machine resulted in small centrifugal effects, and so in high allowable margins for alternating stresses. In sum, even with a high unsteady pressure content, the mismatch between these and the mode shapes, and the positive aerodamping values, result in a safe system in terms of high cycle fatigue for the resonant conditions studied. The current work should be continued for the manufacture of the ORC turbine by investigating precise material properties, hub geometry and upstream inlet geometries that can lead to lower frequency resonant crossings. Furthermore, the investigation of the influence of the aeroelastic issues identified on the efficiency and the incorporation of the work developed on multi­disciplinary optimization procedures is also of great relevance and a main recommendation for further studies.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The design makes use of a so-called closed form pressure balancing principle to obtain this high ratio. This principle utilizes incompressible fluid inside a closed body. A 2D parameter sweep is performed to identify the highest performing hinge design. Subsequently, a computational 3D analysis is performed and the resulting design is realized as a demonstrator. The performance is compared to conventional compliant hinges based on the ratio of the normal- and rotation-stiffness. This showed an increase of at least a factor 30 on the stiffness ratio.","compliant mechanism; closed form pressure balancing; rotational hinge; stiffness ratio","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-02","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

The majority of the sediment is derived from coral reefs for which the stability of these islands is directly related to reef health. Understanding the sediment signature and its drivers is essential to assess island resiliency. We performed a study on sediments from the islands Eva and Fly in the Exmouth Gulf, Australia. We analysed the grainsize distribution and the abundance of sediment producers in order to desribe and discriminate the spatial distribution of these sediment characteristics and performed statistical analysis to identify corresponding key environmental drivers. We found that the sediments were typically course sand-sized (500 − 1000 [μm]) and the dominant constituent is reef-derived sediment. The median grainsize of Eva island (549 [μm]) is nearly equal to the median grainsize of Fly island (540 [μm]). The standard deviation of the grain size distribution of the sediments from Eva island was much larger than at Fly island. However, analysis of variance showed there were no significant differences between islands (Eva/Fly), hydrodynamic regimes (high/low), distance to shore (inshore/offshore) and local habitat (reef/no reef). Furthermore, a distance-based redundancy analysis showed no key environmental driver responsible for the distribution in grainsize and composition of the sediment. The environmental factors which were analyses were depth, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen content and the oxidation-reduction potential. The spatiotemporal scales that were studied are potentially smaller than the scales on which climate change effects act, which explains the absence of significant spatial differences or key environmental drivers. Based on these findings it is not possible to assess the resiliency of Eva and Fly islands, however a study from Perry et al. (2011) found that islands with their particular characteristics (sand-sized and coral-dominated) are expected to undergo major morphological change under a range of predicted climate change scenarios. This research provides a baseline for future studies to assess the stability of Eva and Fly islands or sedimentological research other reef-derived islands.","Sediment characteristics; Environmental drivers; Climate change; Morphodynamics","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","Additional thesis","-21.922153, 114.431844"
