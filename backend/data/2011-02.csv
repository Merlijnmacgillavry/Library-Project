(mentor); Tempelman, E. (mentor); Parmar, V.S. (mentor); Mukul, P. (mentor)","2011","People who have suffered from limb loss, as an effect of a traumatic accident, disease or birth defect, are regularly fitted with a prosthesis or artificial limb. Prosthetic devices are a vital part of the amputee’s rehabilitation process, as the technology enables them to regain mobility and independence. Unfortunately, the vast majority of persons who require prosthetic products live below poverty line, particularly in nations where distribution of wealth is least equal. Access to rehabilitation services becomes close to impossible due to the high costs of products and services, as well as the clinics’ remote locations. In India, the Jaipur Foot Organization addresses this issue by providing orthopedic products and services at no cost to patients. Their fast-paced processes, use of local materials and technology, and patient-centric management system are a proven model for clinics elsewhere which aim to help such populations. Despite their success in over thirty years, many aspects of their products and processes can be improved. Close observation and inquiry into their products, processes and people revealed that improvements in the assembly of the lower artificial limbs can speed up the production process. Rapid yet damaging assembly of the artificial foot to the prosthesis can cause premature failures. In addition, the alignment adjustments between the artificial foot and device lack accuracy, and as such cause improper walking patterns when used by patients. Can a new component reduce the amount of adjustments, improve the assembly process, and enhance the performance of the product during use? Interviews and collaborative sessions yielded clues for concept development. Analysis of existing technologies and alignment methods, both commercial and at Jaipur Foot provided insights for integrating modular components with alignment capabilities to current products. The final concept for a dynamic alignment system was tested to evaluate its working principle. Results indicated that redesign of components was needed. A final design is proposed which integrates the alignment system to the current prosthesis, using alignment bolts to temporarily attach and adjust the foot during the delivery stage of the fabrication process. Further testing is needed to indicate if the positive effects of accuracy during alignment compensate for additional fabrication steps.","prosthetics; artificial limbs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master specialisation Medisign","",""

(mentor); Donselaar, M.E. (mentor)","2011","Arsenic contamination of the groundwater and as a consequence, of the drinking water, has developed to a major problem for many regions globally during the last decades (Chile, China, United States, Argentina, and Mexico). The issue of Arsenic contamination has already been studied extensively in West Bengal, India and Bangladesh, which are some of the affected areas. The importance of studying arsenic groundwater contamination lies in the fact that it has impacts on human health, which indicate that proper measures need to be taken towards a safe drinking water solution. Despite the fact that many researchers around the world have tried to determine arsenic release and mobilization mechanisms, it appears that this is a procedure that is controlled by rather regional parameters and therefore, there is no standard mechanism that can be taken for granted. Each region has different geological and stratigraphic characteristics and since arsenic is naturally formed and released in groundwater for most of the contaminated cases, each region needs to be carefully studied separately. The state of Bihar in India and more specifically the region close to the conjunction of the Ganga and Sone Rivers was chosen as a research location, because, contrary to other affected regions, no geologically related research regarding Arsenic has been carried out there until now. The initial target of this research project was to build a 3D sedimentary architecture model of the area using PETREL software. This model could later be used in flow modeling. The study was then focused on determining the various depositional environments of fluvial sediments and in finally correlating them with the presence or absence of Arsenic in the groundwater. In addition, this study aims to provide a suggestion regarding the possible source of Arsenic in the groundwater for the region of Maner in Bihar. There are two basic hypotheses that will be investigated during this research. One is that Arsenic is confined within the Newer Alluvium of the Ganga River (Holocene sediments) and especially within the point bar alluvial depositions. The second is that Arsenic is already present within the sediments and released in the groundwater due to the presence of Iron oxides in Iron rich minerals (biotite and micas in general) or Iron coatings on Quartz and clay grains. The following methodologies were applied in order to achieve the research purpose. First, literature study of existing research in the area and other Arsenic affected regions was carried out. Then the study area was visited and fieldwork was carried out, which included drilling three approximately 50 m deep boreholes by hand sludging and logging the sediment cores that were obtained as accurately as possible. Hand sludging was used as the drilling technique, even if it is suboptimal for the initial research purpose, because of financial and time constraints. Therefore, it was not possible to obtain undisturbed soil samples while drilling. As a result, core logging, which is an important input for a 3D model, was not always successful. Then, Ultra Violet Spectrophotometry testing was carried out in order to measure the Arsenic content in soil and Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-ray Diffraction in order to determine the mineralogy and chemical composition of the soil samples. In addition, existing measurements of Arsenic levels in drinking water were registered and the coordinates of the handpumps were recorded, using a Global Positioning System device (GARMIN). The purpose of this research is to combine existing knowledge regarding the source of arsenic and specific sedimentary settings in order to correlate local geological characteristics with the presence or absence of arsenic in the groundwater and to suggest a possible source of arsenic for the region of Maner. The results support the hypothesis that it is essential to consider the origin of the sediments to localize regions of high arsenic content.","arsenic; fluvial sedimentology; India; groundwater; borelogs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-03-10","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Geo-engineering","",""

(mentor)","2011","This master thesis describes the “The inviting ice cream cabinet” project and process. Current ice cream cabinets do not totally meet the requirements of consumers and shop owners, because they are not usable enough. Some are too deep and some are too high. Beside this, the appearance does not communicate with the consumer and causes confusion through the disordered placement of the ice creams. The research is focussed on consumers, cabinets and their locations. After establishing the context problem, interviews and observations were done to establish what the real problems were with respect to the needs and wishes of the consumers and shop owners. Consumers were chosen as the main user group and shop owners as secondary - an ice cream cabinet is used more often by consumers than the shop owners. Emphasis on consumers should enhance impulse purchases. The results showed that there is an improvement needed in petrol station shops. People visit these shops for a various reasons, e.g. taking a coffee; going to the toilet or paying for fuel. They do not spend much time there, so, most of times they do not see the ice creams or are not attracted by an ice cream cabinet. This may also be due to the fact that it is not always possible to put current ice cream cabinets in the middle of the shop or near to the pay desk, where the impulse purchases are high. The other issue is that consumers, mostly the women, do not like to spend the physical effort in purchasing an ice cream from current ice cream cabinets. The list of demands has been formulated according to the results. The most important ones were: - 360° accessible - One hand use - Positioning middle in the shop/ close to the pay desk - Ergonomic height; no/ less physical effort - Organized compartments - Clear use cues, easy to understand - Easy to use; easy & quick selection making, less handlings Finally ideas were generated and the final concept has been chosen, which is called “Slimlayn”. The 1:1 model is built and user test is carried out at Unilever. Some of the main test results were: - Large ice cream posters decrease selection making process and help users to find their choice easier and faster. - 950mm cabinet height let the users take the ice creams in their natural posture, without bending and any other effort. - The users were able to access the cabinet from 360°. - The users took the ice creams with one hand. It is recommended to perform a validation test in petrol stations with children and shop owners as well.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-02-28","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

These organizations are structured around projects, and in each project new knowledge is created that can be of value to other projects. These organizations therefore strive for cross-project learning: using the valuable knowledge created in previous projects to the benefit of the current project. A common method to do so is lessons learned, with lessons learned defined as: documented project knowledge gained from both successful and unsuccessful projects that once re-used can impact the organization by improving the cross-project learning, and with that positively impact the performance of the current, other and future projects. PBO’s in the engineering domain are recognizing the strategic importance of cross project learning: lessons learned can result in systematic and cumulative improvement in the process and the deliverables of a project. This in turn can result in improved business processes, financial savings, enhanced revenues, increased competitive advantage and so on. With the increasing awareness of the importance of lessons learned, PBO’s in the engineering domain are reconsidering their lessons learned practice and are looking for ways to improve their lessons learned: a practical problem. From a scientific point of view, a clear guideline or viewpoint on what the design of a lessons learned process should entail is not present.

(mentor); Tromp, N. (mentor)","2011","This master thesis shows a design project in which the Design for Social Impact method is applied, and evaluated, in Afrikaanderwijk, a socio-economically weak area of Rotterdam, for housing corporation Vestia. Afrikaanderwijk is a part of Rotterdam that has been subject to numerous urban renewal plans in the last couple of decades. A neighborhood which, to an extent, has lost its’ raison d’être since the harbour it was built next to was closed in the seventies. This former harbour oriented working-class area is now a highly cultural and ethnical diverse area which, in spite of these urban renewal projects, is still plagued by an array of complex economic, social and physical problems; high unemployment rates, insufficient youth support, high crime rates, little or no opportunities for social encounters, feelings of insecurity and very limited social mobility to name but a few. Estrade, a subsidiary company of housing corporation Vestia and owning over 85% of the social housing in the area, is now the instigator of a new wave of projects with the intent to address the aforementioned problems and improve the living standard in the neighborhood. In this design project I have strived to design a product that contributes to the improvement of living conditions through implicitly influencing users’ behaviour. As a focal point for this design I have chosen the social phenomenon of ‘social ties’. First research was done on how social ties within Afrikaanderwijk should be influenced for general social benefit. Through observation, interviews and literature research factors influencing social ties, and consequently how social ties can influence the community were defined. With these factors a new context was created in which Mark Granovetter’s theory “The Strength of Weak Ties” formed the basis. This defined the design direction, or the statement; I want to create bridging weak ties in Afrikaanderwijk. Bridging weak ties are social contacts with members from social groups different from one’s own. These bridging weak ties, or social bridges generate more diversity in information flow, creating more opportunities for the members of the community, more familiarity and more social cohesion. In Afrikaanderwijk there are rigid divisions between social networks, or different communities and ethnic groups. Specifically the Turkish community is very closed off from its’ environment, but this goes for more communities within the area. Social control within the group and lack of familiarity with others outside of the group prevents social bridges from emerging. Next the most concrete behaviour resulting in the previously defined statement was defined; I want inhabitants of Afrikaanderwijk to make contact with others outside of their regular social circles. A specific domain in which these social bridges could develop with the presumed highest possibility and efficienty was chosen; parents around the schoolyard. This was directly related to the next step in which a strategy for realizing this desired behaviour was developed. The contact between parents on the schoolyard is limited, and the barriers for making contact with members of different communities are very high. The strategy applied was twofold: -I wanted in my design to focus on positive (inter-cultural) human characteristics, stressing the similarities, to create moments of familiarity to overcome, or at least lower reserves for instigating contact. -I wanted the design to focus on the children’s’ goals and concerns, and parents acting in their favor. The parents would be more willing to overcome their own inhibitions for making new contact, if they accomplish something for their child in the process. In addition, the randomness of the contacts (cross-cultural/bridging) is less apparent with the children, this opens up possibilities. The design is an addition to the way birthdays in primary school are celebrated. Birthdays are not celebrated at home in every culture, but in school everyone does. And indiscriminately the birthday is a highly anticipated event, for the child and in many cases the parent as well. The design is a slide that on regular days is part of the school playground for the older kids, ages 6 and up, accessible with stairs. However, on the 6th birthday of students the slide provides a bridge between celebrations inside, and the parent outside. This is made possible by the parents helping the parent of the birthday child in moving the slide from its’ normal position towards the classroom window, allowing the children (birthday child first) to slide down from the window to the schoolyard. Moving the slide is only possible with the help of others, this is the first moment of contact. With the joy and discharge of the child at the end of the long day in mind, the parent will be implicitly forced, but not experience this as force, to approach or come in contact with others. The focus will be on the end of the slide. The characteristic birthday treats will be handed out, and in a positive, festive and (for the children) euphoric situation emphasis is put on the similarities and positive human characteristics of the parents interacting with their children. In time, the birthday celebration can become a ritual, and a system of reciprocity (parent offering and asking each others aid) can come to be. The repetition of the ritual, and with that the accumulation of the moments of recognized similarity will build up inter-group familiarity with the ‘forced’ moments of collaboration and asking for help providing moments of contact.","social design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Schuitema, E. (mentor)","2011","The Delft Biorobotics Laboratory develops bipedal humanoid robots. One of these robots, called LEO, is designed to learn to walk using reinforcement learning. During learning, LEO will make mistakes and fall. These mistakes can cause serious dam- age to the system but are an integral part of the learning process. A likely solution is punishing the robot more severely for falling. However, punishing the robot too rigorously can lead to a robot that is too cautious to make a step. In this research, three methods were tested that reduce the amount of falls during learning, without restricting the possible solutions or increasing the learning time. We introduce Threshold Restricted Learning (TRL), a new method for action se- lection that, during exploration, makes the probability an action is chosen dependent on the expected reward for taking that action. Actions with expected rewards below the set threshold have a signifcant reduced probability of being chosen. The concept of TRL developed from the desire to optimize the use of a pre-learned solution. Hence, TRL was tested after pre-learning in simulation. The largest reduction in the amount of falls achieved by TRL in this research was 50% TRL did not increase the learning time. Without pre-learning the largest reduction was 7%. Softmax action selection is a well known but underused selection method. Combined with pre-learning it was able to reduce the amount of falls during learning with approximately 80% and did not increase the learning time either. Without pre-learning, Softmax could still achieve a reduction of approximately 20%. Sarsa2Q, another new method, stores expected rewards at different levels op generalization. The level with little generalization is used to store the expected total positive reward, while the level with more generalization is used to store the expected total negative reward. Sarsa2Q learned to avoid the failure states for the inverted pendulum problem faster than using a single level of generalization. This method does not use pre-learning. The highest achieved reduction in the amount of falls was approximately 20%. Sarsa2Q can have a broader use than just avoiding failure states. Rather than only using the coarse generalization for negative rewards, it can be used for all rewards that need less precision.","reinforcement learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-02-25","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Biorobotics","",""

(mentor)","2011","In this thesis, the concept of water budgeting is discussed. This concept is based on a comparison between water resources and financial resources. It aims to approach water resources management problems more like a treasurer would. Water resources can be distributed in such a way as to optimise the chance of achieving a desired goal. Depending on what the most important goal of the water manager is, different ‘water budgets’ are possible. The concept of water budgeting is: to distribute the available water resources in such a way as to optimally achieve a certain objective. Model Predictive Control is considered a potential tool for water budgeting. This tool can translate the desired objectives into operational water management. The objective for the water system, in the form of penalties and constraints, are used as input for the Model Predictive Controller. The controller then determines the operational water management, which is most successful at achieving the desired goals. The concept of water budgeting is applied to the South-Western Delta in order to test its usefulness. Different goals are set for the area, and these different goals result in different operational water management strategies. During the application of the water budgeting concept several shortcomings became apparent. These shortcomings follow from the fact that: the comparison between water resources and financial resources is complicated by the physical properties of water. Two very important properties of water in this respect are: water is bulky and water is fugitive. These properties result in: water being difficult to store and transport, in comparison to financial resources. Because water is difficult to handle, it is not straightforward to budget water. The water budgets become very variable in time and space. Due to this variability in time and space the sum of the water distribution does not tell the whole story. The moment at which the water resources are used is equally, or might be even more, important. The application of Model Predictive Control, as a tool for water budgeting, has also proven to be limited. The most important limitation of using Model Predictive Control is: the reduced transparency of the decision making process. It is difficult to trace back why the controller ‘chooses’ certain control actions. This reduces the predictability of the operational water management. Reduced predictability of the operational water management, results in a less predictable water system. This will make it harder for stakeholders to be dependant on the water system. The application of Model Predictive Control to a water system of this size and without a very clear (single) objective is relatively new. During the research it became clear that: it is very important to be able to control all the (large) in and outflow structures, and that it is important to included the parameter that needs to be controlled in the internal model. In the case used, it was not possible to control the Maeslantkering. This resulted in limited control over the water bodies connected to the Nieuwe Waterweg. In the internal model water salinity was not included. This made it very hard to control salinity. Penalties for the controller were developed that were assumed to influence salinity. These penalties were however not sufficient to prevent salinities to become too high in certain areas. This shows that the controller needs to be able to directly predict what the salinities will be.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor); Jakimowicz, J.J. (mentor); Nassar, A.H.M. (mentor)","2011","The presence of gall stones in the gallbladder is a well-known phenomenon. Many people know or have experience with the disease. Less known is the presence of bile duct stones in the biliary tract. Gallstones in the biliary tract can cause obstruction, which hinders the flow of bile towards the duodenum. This causes pain, jaundice and a distortion in food digestion. There are several procedures for removing gallstones in the biliary tract. One of these procedures is the laparoscopic bile duct exploration. In such a procedure the biliary tract is explored via laparoscopic surgery (minimally invasive surgery). Gallstones can be detected and extracted via the minimal incisions. When all the stones are removed, the bile duct and incisions are closed. Laparoscopy is a relative young specialism within general surgery. The replacement of one single (large) incision, by several minimal ones, has several benefits for patients. For the surgeon however, laparoscopic surgery requires some advanced skills, when compared to normal open surgery. The laparoscopic bile duct exploration is an advanced laparoscopic surgery procedure. It requires some advanced skills in laparoscopy. A special artificial model has been developed for training the procedure and the required skills. This model can be applied in training of young and/or inexperienced surgeons, in box trainers and augmented reality surgery simulators. Finally training on this model increases the safeness in the operating room. The artificial model is based on anatomical human data. For the representation of the real procedure, the visual and tactile characteristics of the model are ultimately important. The model is built of a landscape which represents the human abdominal area. It consists of a base platform, liver, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, biliary tract, gallbladder, artery, portal vein and some fattish tissue. Some structures will be manipulated and damaged; and are therefore designed as disposables. After every procedure these disposables need to be replaced. The artificial models are developed in elastic materials such as latex and silicone rubber. A study showed that these materials are most applicable for the mimicking of human tissue. Via an iterative process and in cooperation with surgeons, the best composition and thickness of the structures was tested and specified. During the development the visual and tactile characteristics were qualifying. Finally the first prototypes have been tested with 27 experienced surgeons who participated in a training course in advanced gastrointestinal laparoscopy in Cairo (Egypt). Overall the surgeons were extremely positive towards the training model. Questionnaires showed that most of the surgeons assess the model ‘usable’ for the training of (resident) surgeons. We developed a test protocol and let the surgeons perform some procedural tasks of the CBD exploration. All tasks have been independently rated as ‘fairly realistic’. The transparency of the biliary tract showed to be valuable; since surgeons are able to observe (via the laparoscope) the behavior of the choledochoscope, while they control it by hand (eye-hand coordination). Based on the test results, a second series of more advanced model is in development. Additional tests with experienced laparoscopic surgeons will be required in order to validate the concept idea.","laparoscopy; bile duct exploration; training model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-02-22","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

To validate the guideline several field tests have been performed. From the field measurements is concluded that the design method is very conservative. Improving the design guideline will reduce the construction costs. To understand the physical behaviour of the piled embankment and to validate the theory, experimental scale tests have been performed. During these tests the load distribution, deformation and strains were measured. The results of the scale tests are analysed and published. To improve the understanding of the phenomenon arching and where possible, to confirm the observed load distributions and displacements, numerical analysis of the scale tests have been performed and reported in this thesis. The numerical analysis of the scale test is performed with Plaxis 3D Tunnel version 2.4 (Plaxis). The geometry of the Plaxis model is one quarter of the geometry of the scale test. This reduces the amount of elements and therefore the calculation time. In the scale test circular piles are applied. Circular geometry cannot be modelled in Plaxis, therefore the circular pile is mathematically converted to a square pile. The sand and granular material are modelled with Mohr Coulomb (MC) model and Hardening Soil (HS) model. The scale test is driven by applying top load and by drainage of the foam cushion. The top load is modelled as the measured equally distributed load on the embankment. To model the drainage of the foam cushion, the measured water pressure is assigned to the subsoil clusters in Plaxis by a water pressure head. From the Plaxis results can be concluded that arching is immediately found after the first drainage of the foam cushion. Increasing the top load and drainage of the foam cushion in Plaxis results in an increase of loads transferred to the pile by arching and GR, thus results in improvement of arching. The by Plaxis calculated tensile forces in the GR are concentrated in ‘tensile strips’ that lie on top and between adjacent piles. The largest displacement of the GR is found at the middle of four piles. The results of the Plaxis calculations are compared to the scale test results. The total load on the pile and water pressure in the foam cushion found with Plaxis are corresponding with the scale test results. During the first part of the test, the load distribution shows similar results as the measured load distribution. During the second part of the test the load transferred to the pile by arching is overestimated and the load transferred to the pile by the GR is underestimated. The displacement of the geosynthetic reinforcement calculated with Plaxis is underestimated compared to the scale test results. In general the results of the HS model are better than the MC model. By varying a number of parameters in the model, possible causes for the underestimated displacement are investigated. This research concludes that the stiffness of the foam cushion and the water pressure in the foam cushion does not have influence on the GR displacement. The vertical effective stresses are concentrated on and directly next to the pile and are relatively small between the piles. The internal friction angle does have a large influence on the geosynthetic reinforcement displacement, because when the internal friction angle is decreased, the arch decreases and the settlements increase. However, the measured geosynthetic reinforcement displacement from the scale test is still not found in the numerical results calculated in Plaxis.","plaxis 3D tunnel; piled embankment; geosynthetic reinforcement; scale test; arching","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geo-Engineering","","","",""

With an area of approximately 700 km2 and about 5.0 million inhabitants, Singapore is relatively small and densely populated. To be able to expand economic activities, Singapore has on-going land reclamation projects. The reclaimed land is used for the construction of new infrastructure like harbours and roads and construction of new office buildings. The fill used to reclaim the land is laid on top of a thick soft layer of marine clay. The load of the fill will cause consolidation of the compressible soft soil layers. Structures constructed in the reclaimed land or in the vicinity will therefore be prone to negative skin friction. Reason for the research is are discussions between Delta Marine Consultants Singapore Pte. Ltd. and an ‘accredited checker’, an independent engineer, who checks the design and has to approve it. The design will not be build, without approval by this engineer. The discussion exists due to the wide interpretation range of the Singapore Standard. This research is to interpret the Singapore Standard, compare it to available literature and other standards and get to recommendations in regard to the design of piles subjected to negative skin friction.","negative skin friction; Singapore","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Our assignment was to further develop on a previous project that was selected to be showcased at the Science Centres Gamelab. The game in question is the Nuna Racing game, where a team of two players (a driver and a designer) try to achieve the highest score while driving a lap at the Zandvoort racetrack. While driving the designer can change aspects of the car such as the body, wheels and engine. Each choice has its own advantages and disadvantages but the choice also has an impact on the score. The game was already fully functional , but it offered a lot of room for expansion. The biggest priority was not to lose the Serious Gaming aspects while making the game more fun to play. We achieved this by improving the feedback and interaction with the players. It was accomplished by introducing sound to the game and user interfaces. Interaction between players was achieved by splitting and switching information between the driver and designer screens, both players communicated a lot more in order to exchange information. To make the game more attractive and challenging, we introduced challenges throughout the track. When challenges are successfully completed a number of credits will be earned, these credits can be used to enhance parts of the car making a higher score possible. The highest scores are displayed at the end of the lap, introducing a competition aspect to the game. Finally the game has been deployed on one pc, having two separate programs for each player. The two programs form a client-server structure, with the racer as the server and the designer as the client. The driver has a large screen and the designer is equipped with a normal sized touch-screen. The driver has a Xbox steering wheel and pedals for driving the car.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","","",""

A large number of people in the Netherlands commute to work and school using conventional bicycles, as well as for recreational use, and often face opposing strong winds. A smaller number use petroleum fuelled mopeds (Snorfietsen) that travel at a maximum speed of 25km/h. Although these mopeds are more affordable than electric bicycles, and indeed electric mopeds, they boast significantly higher usage costs. On average, a cyclist travels 2.5km per day, while moped users cover a mere 0.15km per day. This limitation of use can be ascribed to higher usage costs for mopeds. The demand for low effort two wheeler transports can easily be met by electric bicycles as they provide the benefit of increased mobility at negligible running costs. However, a number of factors such as price still limit their adoption within the Netherlands. Although this market is growing, it is still overshadowed by the conventional bicycle market. There is a need to identify the bottlenecks that caused the late adoption of electric bicycles in the Netherlands (and indeed in Europe) and continues to stunt the growth of this market.","power-assist conversion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-02-21","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); van Oudheusden, B.W. (mentor); Muijres, F.T. (mentor); Remes, B.D.W. (mentor)","2011","Due to the high cost of flight, there is a high evolutionary selection pressure for energy efficient flight patterns, such as using external natural forces for soaring or flying intermittently. Some bats at time soar, glide or flap glide. Bounding flight is not possible as their membranous wings will go slack, and soaring is not common amongst bats, as most bats are nocturnal and during night thermals are usually of insufficient strength. From an aerodynamic point of view, gliding flight is less complex than flapping flight, however in bats undulating flight patterns are less observed than in birds. So, why should bats glide? Flight performance studies on live bats have revealed a part of the complexity of hovering and steady flapping flight, but gliding flight in these animals is poorly studied. To get insight in how bats glide and in their gliding flight performance, gliding flight of bats is studied from two points of view; gliding flight of real bats and gliding of a flexible, bat inspired wing model, in a low speed, tiltable wind tunnel. The kinematics of both the bats and the model are filmed by two synchronised high speed cameras, and the flow field in a transverse plane behind the wings is visualized by means of a PIV system. Three medium sized bats Leptonycteris yerbabuenae, are trained to glide at a feeder in the test section of the wind tunnel at a know, fixed glide angle. This known glide angle enables to calculate the aerodynamic forces, which are fixed properties in steady gliding flight. A gliding wing model, based on a bat’s wing, with an adjustable leading edge flap, is designed, build, and tested at different angles of attack. The wing model is tested with both a smooth and a structured top surface to see what the effect of ’turbulators’ can be. Additionally the wing model is mounted onto a balance in order to measure the aerodynamic forces. By means of experiments with the wing model, wake structures of gliding flight can be connected to a single changing morphology parameter to explore the parameter space, and the wake structures can be compared to the wake structures of the gliding bats. The bats are observed to glide for some seconds in the test section, but only the parts of the glides at the feeder where the tip vortex strength and position were stable are analysed. From the PIV data, an average wake is constructed per glide sequence of the bats, and for each leading edge setting and speed combination of the model wing. From the average wake the flight forces and the resulting flight performance properties are derived. The wing model approaches the glide behaviour of the bats. Deploying the leading edge flap increases the span efficiency and the lift coefficient at low angles of attack. Also the structure on top of the wing is beneficial for flight performance at low angles of attack.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor); Boess, S.U. (mentor)","2011","Before operation, the patient needs to be sterile draped. In a total hip replacement surgery through the anterior supine intermuscular approach, the surgical incision is made from the front side (anterior) of the hip, by which the patient lies down on the back on the operating table. During the surgery, both legs are maneuvred. Due to this, both legs are draped separately. In the current patient-draping procedure within the total hip replacement surgery through the ASI approach, many drapes are used, there are too many actions and holding up both the legs simultaneously is experienced as unpleasant. Above all, the pubis, perineum and groins area, which is considered as a dirty area, is draped in a way that it is questionable whether the sterility is guaranteed. After an analysis of the draping procedure in the current situation, done by an observational research, concepts were created in the conceptualization phase on the hand of defined design guidelines and the interaction vision, which is stated as: The new drape is easy and understandable to use, where the pubis, perineum and groins area is covered with one drape and the amount of actions is reduced. The design consists of three main parts: a double layered drape with integrated stocking and integrated drape for beneath the legs (available for left and right leg), a separated stocking and a top sheet that creates a barrier between the surgical and anesthesia field. The double layered drape should be put over the non-operative leg of the patient when the orthopedic team is not sterile scrubbed and gowned yet. This way, the pubis, perineum and groins area can be covered in an early stage of the draping procedure. The drape will then be unfolded and with an adhesive strip it is attached around the disinfected groin area of the operative leg. The outer layer is allowed to be in contact with a non-sterile environment, the inner layer is sterile. Then, the orthopedic surgeon and the assistant leave the operating theater for sterile preparation. In the meanwhile, the nurse puts the separate stocking, which also has an outer layer, at the knee of the operative leg. When the orthopedic team is back and sterile gowned, the patient-draping procedure continues with disinfection of the incision area and the operative upper leg, and the removal of the outer layer of the drape and the stocking in order to expose the sterile inner layer. Next, the stockings are unrolled and the drape beneath the legs is unfolded. The ends of the stockings at the feet are closed by means of tape. The top sheet is put on top of the patient. Finally, an incision drape is used to cover the incision area.","surgical drape; total hip replacement surgery; anterior supine intermuscular","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2011","-Introduction Mammography is the main screening method in early breast cancer detection in most civilized countries. Although the breast cancer mortality rate decreased with 25% since the introduction of mammographic population screening, the method still displays relatively high false negative and false positive rates, resulting in missed tumors and unnecessary stress for recalled women. The objective of this research is to explore the possibilities for optimizing mammographic breast cancer screening with the implementation of a local pressure sensing system. In this approach the differences in stiffness between cancerous tissue and healthy breast tissue are used as a biomarker. -Methods to explore the influence of a tumor surrounded by healthy breast tissue, a breast model was made. The stress distribution along the contact area of the breast with the compression plate is examined performing a numerical and experimental study. Three main input parameters which influence the stress around an inclusion were de fined; the size, the position in depth and the relative elasticity of the tumor. The influence of those parameters were evaluated using finite element analysis. The experimental setup contains a tensile tester used to compress silicone tissue phantoms, with or without a stiffer inclusion representing a tumor. An array of 16 pressure sensors is used to explore the abilities to measure fluctuations in stress distribution caused by the tumor. -Results & Conclusions The presence of a tumor produces a peak in the stress-distribution along the contact surface of the tissue phantom. Tumors embedded in a cylindrical tissue phantom having a diameter of 10mm or larger are detectable using simple pressure sensors. The influence of the elasticity of a tumor is only noticeable up to a stiffness which is 20 times higher than the surrounding tissue. The stress peak grows exponentially by increasing the size or decreasing the distance from the tumor to the surface. The ability to use differences in the stress distribution for detecting a stiff inclusion surrounded by an elastic material looks promising. Additional research must be performed in order to find a suitable local pressure sensing system.","Mammograph; Breast Cancer Screening; Sensing System","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-06-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Ergonomic problems of surgical lighting systems have been indicated by surgeons; however, the underlying causes are not clear. The aim of this dissertation is to assess the problems in detail, and subsequently clarify the underlying causes. In the first stage of the research, the observation method was used to quantify the luminaire use during 46 hours of open routine surgical procedures in the field of general surgery. The location of the observation study was the Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis hospital in Delft, which employs the Berchtold Chromophare C series as the surgical lighting system. The results showed that every 7.5 minute a luminaire action takes place, intended to reposition the luminaire. Of these LAs, 74% was performed by surgeons and residents. For 64% of these LAs the surgical tasks of OR-staff were interrupted. Observed difficulties were collision of the luminaire against any object, or that the luminaire was out of reach for the surgeon in a sitting posture. The primary difficulty appeared in the kinetic relation during the SLS and user interaction, as manoeuvrability of the luminaire was cumbersome and in some situations the system was immovable. These problems primarily occur during the repositioning of the luminaire 2 dimensional plane of the pendant arms. In the second research stage a valid simulation model of the surgical lighting system was constructed in MSC Adams software to allow virtual experiments to analyse the system mechanics. The model showed that the required force during luminaire usage depends on the location of the luminaire its work field and are on average higher than ergonomically acceptable. Primary cause of this difficulty with the current systems is the two pendant arms construction as the highest forces were found when the luminaire was directly below the ceiling suspension or in the peripheral region of the work field. In those regions the pendant arms are either in parallel or serial alignment. The force spectrum for luminaire use showed a diffuse image, ranging from 14 Newton till unlimited quantities when the system is unmovable. The average required force is 136 Newton in the region where the observed luminaire use was primarily undertaken. In addition, the software engineering model which was constructed in this study is applicable as a test procedure to analyse surgical lighting systems. As a result, this dissertation stated novel insights into the OR lighting problem during open routine surgical procedures in the field of general surgery. And it presented a valid simulation model of a surgical lighting system Berchtold Chromophare C series. The protocol for the model construction can be user to analyse surgical lighting system of different brands using engineering software simulation. Furthermore, this dissertation presented a direction for future research and an improved user system interaction of the luminaire during surgical procedures.","ergonomics; equipment; operating room technology; surgical lighting; usability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Department Biomechanical Engineering (BMechE)","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

A quay wall is a soil retaining structure where ships can moore and transfer goods. Over the centuries the developments in quay wall structures have been tremendous, due to increasing ship dimensions, loads and crane designs. Next to that climate change is a hot topic nowadays. The building sector is one of the sectors which have a large impact on the environment. Constructing durable and sustainable throughout the entire life cycle is becoming more and more important. CO2-emission is a widely excepted parameter to estimate sustainability. Besides CO2 many other environmental effects, so called impact categories, have an impact on air, water and soil, which can be shown with help of a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). In this thesis the impact on the environment of a quay wall constructed in four different materials is analyzed. These materials are: concrete, steel, wood and composites. To make a good comparison, the designs must be based on the same requirements and boundary conditions. For this purpose the quay wall of the Euromax Terminal is used. Several types of quay wall structures have been studied and their main dimensions have been determined. This resulted in a retaining wall in combination with a concrete L-shaped relieving structure. The stability of the structure is guaranteed by a combination of mv-piles and vibro-piles. In this design the retaining wall is constructed in the four different materials: concrete diaphragm wall, steel combi wall, wooden wall of Azobé elements and a Fiber Reinforced Polymer sandwich panel. Next a cost estimation of the four designs has been made. Finally the CO2-emission of each structure is determined. This Carbon Footprint has been calculated with two different databases. Furthermore the emissions of several other impact categories have been determined. They represent emissions due to pollution to air, water and soil, depletion and land use. Using monetization as a weighing factor, the so called “shadow prices” of each structure can be calculated. These costs represent the costs for the preventive measures that must be taken to reduce the emissions to a sustainable level.","quay wall; concrete; steel; wood; composites; CO2-emission; Life Cycle Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor)","2011","The erosion problem at the Senegambia area (The Gambia) is the subject of this thesis. The Senegambia area is the largest Tourism developed area which contributes significantly to the economy of The Gambia. In November 2003 Royal Haskoning has constructed a beach nourishment of 1,000,000 m3 as an erosion buffer with a lifetime of 10 to 15 years. In 2010 this nourishment has been eroded almost completely. The processes that drive this ongoing high erosion are not known; therefore two research questions have been defined: (i) What happened to the nourished sand, where has it been transported to? and (ii) Which processes cause the high erosion rate at Kololi Beach? To gain insight in the coastal processes in front of the Senegambia area field data have been collected and analysed, the nearshore wave climate has been modelled using SWAN and sediment transport capacities and shoreline movements along the coast have been computed using DHI software. The most important results are: Nourished sediment contains 10-20% of shell fraction with a maximum of 30% for the lowest quality of sediment; these shell fractions wash out very easily and do not contribute to the total volume of the sediment in case of erosion, increasing the erosion rate. Shoreline movement for the 2004-2009 period has qualitatively the same trend as the shoreline movement for the undisturbed period 1964-1983, however a factor 5 to 8 larger. According to the computations two direction reversal points are present along the coast causing a large area of small accretion and a small area of large erosion. This was not indicated during the large-scale study in 2000 on which the design of the nourishment has been based. The computed net sediment transport is southerly directed between south of the Senegambia area, north of this area the sediment transport is northerly directed. The water level and a changing wave climate for the period 2007-2009 have a large influence on the sediment transports. These transports have been computed for the recent bathymetry and wave data, which can differ from the conditions between 1964 and 2000. These results lead to the following conclusions: The largest part of the nourishment has been transported to the stretch south of the Senegambia area. The accreted volume along the coast is approximately 50% of the total nourished volume. The cause of high erosion rate at Kololi Beach is an enumeration of multiple processes. The combination of a large amount of shell fractions in the nourished sediment, spatial placement of the nourishment, sand deficit due to sand mining and the effect of sea level rise as the water level has a high influence on sediment transport. The reason why erosion rates are 5 times higher than before 1990 is not exactly known. The modelling study on which the conclusions have been based is performed using the present bathymetry and the wave climate from 2000 to 2009. It is possible that both the bathymetry and wave climate have changed over time; this could have large influence on the sediment transport along the coast. A Combination of a “hard” structure with initial nourishment in front of the Senegambia area may be considered as a mitigation measure for the present erosion.","erosion; Gambia; longshore transport; shells; nourishment; waves","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

In this light Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques are already used for some time to simulate flow behavior in the human airway system. This was mostly done for idealized and simplified airway models as it is only recently that truly realistic geometry models are made available. It is believed that improving CFD techniques with respect to these realistic lung geometries may improve medical practice and help lung surgeons. In this thesis the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations are used to simulate airflow in a realistic human airway model derived from Computed Tomography (CT) scan data ranging up to 7 generations. This is done for inhalation at three different breathing rates. Due to the transitional nature of the flow, the _-_ SST model is chosen to predict turbulence. For solving the flow equations the Fine/Hexa software (Numeca, Brussels, Belgium) is employed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Snellen, M. (mentor); Wunderlich, J. (mentor)","2011","Sub bottom profilers are commonly used as mapping tool for the seafloor and sub-bottom structure in the upper few meters of the seafloor. Their recent enhanced performance in terms of resolution adds the potential to classify the sediment layers as well. In this research, the seabed surface and sub layers classification are investigated using model based techniques. The remote sediment classification technique of the seabed surface is achieved by matching the back scatter measurements to the predicted backscatter intensity of the model. The model simulates the returned signals of a monostatic sub bottom profiler operating at 100 kHz. The back scattering strength in the angle domain is estimated using the APL-UW backscattering model. The matching procedure was applied on averaged echo envelopes performed by Hilbert transform. The averaging process is essential to reduce the stochastic variability of the acquired data. The sub layers data was obtained by operating frequencies of (5, 10 and 15 kHz). The layer classification was achieved by estimating the geoacoustic parameters such as reflectivity and impedance contrast. Two techniques were investigated based on a reflectivity model. The first technique is an extension work of D.Simons [11] which aims to estimate the reflection coefficients via the received and transmitted energy ratio. The second technique is an implementation of a similar approach but applies the attenuation on the received frequency components in place of the nominal components. Both models accounted for energy propagation and its corresponding geometrical and sediment attenuation losses. The classification techniques were carried out to a dataset that was acquired in the Baltic Sea near Rostock in 2004. The acquired dataset is characterized by various bottom types such as mud, sand and coarse sediments. The general description of the acquired areas was used as a reference for the final results. Due to the lack of core samples, the classification was evaluated by comparing the results of the backscatter to the energy model. The results were consistent with the general description of the dataset. However, the matching process of the backscatter model is a cumbersome and very sensible to the envelope averaging technique. Averaging the reflected signals from the soft sediments has to ensure to preserve the surficial and volume back scatter information. On the other hand, at rough surfaces, the late arrivals are likely to be irregular reflections or noise that has to be averaged to avoid ambiguous results. The initial results of sub layers reflection models were consistent with the data description. However, due to the high resolution of the sub bottom profile, the computation procedure can easily fail by missing sub layers. In order to reduce the probability of missing layers, an overlapping window concept was implemented, where the reflection coefficients are estimated at shorter intervals. The methods investigated here leaves room for further optimization through model adjustment such as signal interference, backscatters and error propagation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Geomatics","","","",""

The proposed solution is a tag-based recommender system, where the feedback received from visitors will allow STRP to learn more about how visitors perceive art pieces and in turn provide visitors with recommendations of other art pieces to view, at the festival. During the course of this thesis, we first explore how we can learn about the preferences of visitors using the tags they contribute, paired with a rating for the art piece. We do this by investigating a semantic mapping tool, Relco from TU Eindhoven, which enables us to map tags to concepts from a vocabulary, with the help of a lexical ontology such as WordNet. We experiment with the stemming of tags before using them in string matching algorithms. Further, we investigate how influential the vocabulary is onto which we map tags, when using Relco. Finally, we evaluate recommendation algorithms. We explore collaborative, content-based and hybrid forms of recommendations. We conclude that, in this context, content-based recommendation algorithms perform the most accurately and consistently. We also conclude that the semantic extension in a tag-based recommendation algorithm enables us to accurately profile a visitor and art piece with a finite number of concepts.","recommendation algorithms; semantic extension; free-tagging; TF-IDF tag generation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology, Web Information Systems","","Information Architecture","",""

Particularly the SemanticWeb allows creating links between datasets, which increase the value of the dataset that is being linked. Finding links between datasets, as well as capturing the data inside another dataset that is of interest is a process for which tools have yet to be perfected. Often the process of enriching data involves understanding how to access the data, and finding clues how to use auxiliary data to add value to the original dataset. This Thesis document proposes a framework for visually specifying the enrichment of RDF data. The framework is called RDF Gears, and allows incremental enrichment of RDF datasets. The platform provides functionality for composing enrichment flows from individual enrichment steps. The enrichment flow describes the order in which RDF data will be gathered from remote RDF datasources. After specifying the flow, the enrichments can be applied to the RDF dataset. RDF Gears also provides functionality for creating and reusing enrichment steps and (nested) flows. The approach discussed in this document shows the potential of specifying RDF enrichments incrementally. Also the possibility for abstracting Semantic Web technologies using the visual programming paradigm is shown. The main deliverable of this Master Thesis is the RDF Gears framework.","Semantic Enrichment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Techology, Web Information Systems","","Information Architecture","",""

(mentor); Langeveld, L.H. (mentor)","2011","The Sport Café in Delft is a well known and most used area by lots of different user groups. The years of use have worn-out the current interior and the interior is in need of a new appearance. The goal of this project is to design the new experience of the Sport Café keeping in mind the different wants and needs of all the different target groups of the Sport Café; the primary target group, the students, the secondary target group, the staff and employees of the TU Delft and the tertiary target group, the daily visitors for lunch and dinner. The project starts with an analysis of the company. Aspects as the image, the identity and the goal of the company are described. A SWOT-analysis shows the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the Sport Café. The external analysis focuses on the surrounding area of the Sport Café. The market position is compared with competitors and important trends in demographic and society are invested. An additional small research is added that investigates in sitting positions of different personal relations. An observational research is conducted next to find out more about the life inside the Sport Café. The results of this research are captured in different floor plans of the area with specific information. To complement the conclusions of this research a more elaborate user research is added. With this more specific research I was able to get to know the users of the Sport Café better. All the knowledge about the Sport Café and its users let to the set up of the design specifications for the new experience inside the Sport Café. The design of the new experience is divided into two different phases. The first phase focuses on the design of the shell of the Sport Café, the interior. The second phase focuses on the small scale design, the furniture. The synthesis phase comes together when the interior designs are combined with the furniture design in the fusion. Three chosen interiors are arranged with different furniture designs with an appropriate mapping of the area. The choice of the new interior of the Sport Café is based on all the before set requirements from the analysis phase and the user researches. This results in the new experience inside the Sport Café. Three furniture concepts have been chosen for further elaborations. The chair concept has been chosen, based on important aspects as the furniture design for the remaining part of the project. The biggest and last challenge with this chair is to make it stackable. This last requirement was added last and required a few changes of the design. The design is finished with a small ergonomic research that resulted in the dimensions of the chair. The materials of the chair have been chosen is such a way that the chair is able to withstand the dirt and moisture from the people using the chair after exercising at the Sport Centre and it can be used outdoor during the summer. The chair has also been tested on different loads on the seat and is analyzed with the use of a simulation. The sales price of the chair is determined to be  200,00. This price is based on a costs analysis of the materials, the labor costs, the supplies and the development costs. As a final a real life scale prototype has been made to analyze the aesthetics and dimensions of the chair. The design of the new experience inside the Sport Café as well as the chair design have been concluded with a criteria check and recommendation.","interior; experience; furniture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Multi-bit data storage, defined here as storage of multiple bits in a single device cell, can potentially make higher density ferroelectric memory at a lower price. The idea is based on ferroelectric response with regard to ferroelectric film thickness. Two kinds of memory cells were fabricated to test the functionality and performance of the proposed concept. After optimizing the thermal nano-imprinting process to replicate periodicity micro-structure to a ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) film, we first fabricated the ferroelectric capacitor cells with the imprinted polymer film. The fabricated cells, with sizes down to 0.0589 mm^2, showed a promising multi-bit functionality and retention property. Four different imprinting patterns were also compared, the repeating grating structure as line: 20 um / space: 10 um represented the best multi-bit performance in terms of identification of the operation voltage for different bits. A prediction of the imprinting pattern and the ferroelectric capacitor performance were given according to the results. With the same imprinting condition, we also fabricated ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs). The FeFETs with periodicity pattern of line: 20 um / space: 10 um was investigated. It is observed that, the smallest imprinted cell with a gate length of 5 um and width of 5 mm only has several nano-ampere of leakage current, which is 10^5 times smaller than the ON current. Using a drain voltage of 50 mV, states can be read out easily. It is evident that the four states of the system retain distinguishable after the 10^4 second retention test.","nano-imprinting lithography; ferroelectric memory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-03-02","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","DIMES","","","",""

(mentor); Bakker-Wu, S. (mentor)","2011","The project QBTEC is a company which designs, manufactures and sells deep-fry installations to companies with a focus on deep-frying. Deep-fry installations are the entire stainless steel wall, known from cafeteria for example. The company felt the urge to innovate, to maintain their leading market position. They had not been able to introduce innovations other than incremental innovations over the past years. They had ideas about the direction of automation, to enable control of the deep-fry process at customer’s location. They wanted to know if there was a market need for automation. However, it is decided to focus on the problem of innovation for QBTEC and the problem of controlling the deep-fry process for customers. Controlling the deep-fry process is defined as diminishing the influences during the process to control the result. Becoming pro-active Currently, QBTEC offers custom-fit products. The sales representatives of the company translate customer’s wishes to the design department, who build a custom-fit solution. A new customer request or frequent complaints lead to product improvements. This re-active approach to customer’s situation leads to incremental innovations. For QBTEC to become more innovative, a pro-active approach is needed. This approach enables to take away the causes, instead of fighting the symptoms. Expand with new products in current market To generate corporate growth in the future, it is recommended to apply a product development strategy. Developing new products, instead of deep-fry installations and components, for the current market entails a relatively small risk and provides opportunities to innovate. It enables the company to quickly adapt to customer’s changes. Project as first step and example This project can be seen as an example and first step of these recommendations towards corporate growth in the future. First of all, a research on controlling the deep-fry process goes beyond the current product and is therefore a suited direction for new product development. Secondly, research is conducted within the current market segment ‘recreation’. Preliminary research within different market segments has founded this choice. And finally, a pro-active research method is applied, to be able to understand the system of behaviour and to come to a more innovative solution. Research recreation market Eight snack locations within the recreation market are observed to find the influencing factors that cause an uncontrolled process and the relation between these factors. Observations are the appropriate method to research workflows. Observing the deep-fry process enables discovering the entire situation, real actions and unarticulated needs. The handlings of the employees at the snack location are observed from the moment an order is taken until the order is finished. Conclusions are drawn upon the observed problems, their causes and their consequences for the result. The pro-active approach provided this insight in the system structure of employee’s behaviour. It is concluded that a cognitive overload of the employees has its influence on the rest of the causes of occurring problems. To be able to control the deep-fry process, the risk or problems need to be decreased. Idea generation An internal and external creative session and individual brainstorms are conducted in the idea generation phase. These sessions have sharpened the system structure of the research and resulted in solutions to reduce the cognitive workload. The solution Ultimately, the Clock is chosen as a first step of future developments of QBTEC. The Clock is a system which displays the process on screens. It provides employees overview of the handlings yet to come. It shows when to do what and enables to anticipate on these moments to execute secondary handlings. This external representation of internal thoughts reduce the cognitive workload and therefore the risk of mistakes during the deep-fry process. The reduction of mistakes enables QBTEC’s customer to control their deep-fry process and reduce unwanted results. QBTEC as a specialist The product development of the Clock will be the first step towards the future vision of QBTEC. There are large opportunities for innovation within the current market. With a pro-active approach, the company is able to understand the customer’s entire situation. When acting upon this knowledge, the company is able to provide their customer a total solution for their business. QBTEC becomes a specialist in the deep-fry situation.","innovation; deep-frying; cognitive workload","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-02-09","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Gorte, B.G.H. (mentor)","2011","Pavescan is a low cost mobile system for road modelling survey. Because of the absence of navigation sensors it has several practical drawbacks compared to most of the other mobile mapping systems, but those sensors are very expensive and do not fulfil most of the accuracy requirements. Pavescan will be more attractive if some of the practical drawbacks are reduced. Pavescan measures road profiles across the road by laser scanning at a series of positions. The separate scans are linked via control points, which have to be measured in an additional survey. The accuracy in height of the scans is most important (e.g. for volume calculations) and has to be in the range of millimetres. It is evaluated if integrating close range photogrammetry can achieve millimeter accuracy of the scan and reduce the number of control points. A test survey was conducted with a downward looking camera, which was mounted close to the scanner at a height of around 3.6 metres above the road's surface. The position and orientation of the camera at each exposure is retrieved by bundle adjustment. The accuracy of the bundle adjustment depended strongly on the configuration of the control points. Due to the narrow shape of a strip of images, this configuration will always be weak. For a sequence of 28 images ( 43 metres), around five control points are needed to achieve sub-centimetre accuracy of the object points. If more than 36 images or fewer than four control points were used, the bundle adjustment diverged (i.e. no solution could be obtained). A reduction of control points is therefore not possible. The practical feasibility for integrating close range photogrammetry into Pavescan is low, since too many control points are needed that should spatially be well distributed and measured with tachymetry (or with similar accuracy). Therefore it is not recommended to integrate photogrammetry in Pavescan.","photogrammetry; laser scanning; Pavescan; control points","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-12-18","Aerospace Engineering","Department of Optical and Laser Remote Sensing","","","",""

(mentor); Christiaans, H.H.C.M. (mentor)","2011","SinGaz is a Dutch start up company that is going to design and retail electric scooters and bicycles on the European market, starting with Barcelona early 2012. The European e-scooter and e-bicycle industry is still in its infancy, and although this market is expected to be subjected to strong growth in the near future, its retailing situation has hardly developed to the same extent that many other industries have developed and most e-scooters and e-bicycles are sold through traditional, small scale multi-brand shops. This poses a great opportunity for SinGaz. In order to gain a strong position in the market, they want to build up a strong brand and sell their products through a branded retail formula that will be rolled out in large cities in Europe. In this report, a branded retail store is developed for electric bicycles and electric scooters for new start up company SinGaz. The challenge is to develop a brand that connects with the needs, desires and the daily lives of potential e-scoter and e-bicycle users, and to then translate that brand into a shopping experience. The first phase in this report explores how human behavior is influenced by the environment they are in. This is of importance because as a retail designer, one of your major responsibilities is to stimulate sales within the store. Research on how shop design influences behavior shows that some major sociological and psychological factors need to be taken into account when designing a shop. Personal control, respect and interaction are but a few key aspects of importance for people’s valuation of the shopping experience. A branded physical retail environment (as opposed to virtual retail environments) has the potential to express a brand to the maximum, because it contains all the touch points available to the brand, and all senses can be involved in the retail experience. Analysis of the market shows that the SinGaz brand, and subsequently the shopping experience should on the first hand be an expression of expertise of urban lifestyle, and in particular of urban travelling. The SinGaz shop should express that SinGaz offers more than just products, and that they have developed a complete transportation solution, where products and services complement each other. A second layer of the brand expression is ideological; research shows that communicating ideology in a shop is a powerful tool in engaging customers to a brand. SinGaz’s ideology is about sustainability, transparency and fair trade. Six emotional assets were found through interviews with people who live in Amsterdam, all of which cycled one hour every day or more. These emotional assets were visualized and used as guidelines and assessment tools for making and choosing between two mood boards, which in turn served as guidelines for design of the SInGaz shop. In this way I attempt to make sure that the design style will fit with what the brand expression. The result is a shop where service, information and inspiration are prominent features that supplement sales and thereby clearly expresses the benefits that SinGaz offers.","retail; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Bakker, K.J. (mentor); Metrikine, A.V. (mentor); Huijsmans, R.H.M. (mentor); De Groot, D. (mentor)","2011","Immersion of tunnels is an often used technique in rivers and canals. The transport of tunnel elements can be done under offshore conditions, but immersing the elements under these conditions is not common practise. The tunnel elements of the Busan-Geoje Fixed Link in South Korea were immersed in such a situation. During this process, several loads act on the element and the equipment, such as current and wave loads. Wave loads consist of relatively long waves (swell waves) and short waves (wind waves). The wave induced motions of the tunnel element are restricted during immersion due to serviceability limit state conditions. In this study, the influence of swell and wind waves on the immersion configuration is analysed. In order to solve this problem, equations of motion are composed and solved to analyse the dynamic behaviour. In the first step, the natural frequencies of the configuration are determined, and in the next step the total response is analysed. The latter is given in response amplitude operators, that represent the ratio between motion of the tunnel element and height of the wave per frequency. Using this methodology, locating the resonance peaks in the graphs is straightforward. Rough estimations of added mass and damping values cause some uncertainty in the results. One of the findings is that some natural frequencies of the configuration are close to the frequency of swell waves. Especially the frequency of the rotation of the tunnel element is close to the frequency of swell waves. The influence of wind waves on the forces in the immersion cables is negligible. Large motions of the element and high forces in the cables may be expected during resonance. This should be avoided by adjusting the immersion configuration, for example by decreasing the cross section of the floaters. This will result in larger natural periods. The main conclusion is that the influence of swell waves on the forces in the cables is significantly larger than the influence of wind waves.","immersed tunnel; dynamics; swell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-02-09","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","At the end of the nineties the electric bicycle was successfully introduced at the Dutch market for the first time. An electric bicycle assists the biker with an electric motor. In the early years this bike was popular among elderly people or among people who are physically disabled. In recent years also other groups of people use the electric bicycle, like commuters. The Dutch sales figures have strongly been growing over the last five years. In 2009 more than 150.000 new electric bicycles have been sold in the Netherlands. The regional authority “Stadsgewest Haaglanden” wants to find out the influence of the electric bicycle on the total bicycle use in the Haaglanden region. The research goal is formulated as: Getting insight in the influence of the development of the ownership and use of an electric bicycle on the transport demand and the travel mode choice. There is little scientific research on the ownership and the use of electric bikes. The scarce data that are available only allow conclusions on the major user groups. These are:  Elderly (60 years and over) using the bike for recreation  Commuters using the bike for commuting  Disabled people who cannot use a normal bike, but can use an electric one. There is a lack of knowledge about the factors determining why someone owns and uses an electric bicycle. By using interviews it was investigated which factors play a role in the ownership of the electrical bike. Subsequently a regression model was made to give quantitative insight, displaying a statistical relationship between these factors and the ownership of an electric bicycle. A dataset was used from 2007 that was compiled from a market research on electric bikes. Not all factors could be related to the data and consequently not all factors were quantified. This research has provided a large qualitative insight into the factors that determine who owns and uses an electrical bike. The research offers many leads for policy and further research. The available quantitative information is not sufficient to have a quantitative picture of the ownership and use of the E-bike. Therefore, not all research questions could be answered quantitatively. Nevertheless, the regression models that are made in this research can be used as a basis for further research on the ownership and use of electric bicycles. To further stimulate the use of (electric) bicycles, several recommendations are made. The use of bikes by commuters in Haaglanden can be influenced positively by organizing projects to stimulate the use of bikes at companies. This was already successful in other regions, but it needs to be directed to the correct user groups to be effective. Furthermore it’s advisable to carefully watch the market for electrical ways for transportation. Many new developments are expected in a short time. It is recommended to collect quantitative information about the ownership and use of electric bikes. Very few data are available, which makes it difficult to model the factors that describe the ownership and use in a reliable way.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

To improve the exergetic efficiency of a distillation column, it can be designed as a heat integrated distillation column (HIDiC). In a HIDiC the vapour leaving the stripping section is compressed to the desired level and the rectification section is operated at a higher pressure and temperature. When the stripping section and rectification section are placed inside or besides each other, heat exchange is possible, causing condensation in the rectification section and evaporation in the stripping section. In an ideal HIDiC no condenser and reboiler are needed.

(mentor); Van Beek, V.M. (mentor); Van Paassen, L.A. (mentor); Heimovaara, T.J. (mentor)","2011","Suffusion is the process whereby seepage water removes fine grains from a soil, which can result in failure of the soil body. This poses a risk for structures founded on soils that are subjected to large hydraulic gradients, such as encountered near hydraulic dams or river levees. Currently, most experimental work on this topic is geared towards quantifying, both the hydraulic gradient at which suffusion initiates, and the flux of eroded material. The reported values vary widely among experiments. The variation in the results can be explained by taking into account the effect of different experimental conditions. The flux of eroded material is the result of the interplay between particle erosion and filtration within the soil. Visualisation experiments allow for the direct observation of this. The effect of experimental conditions on the individual mechanisms of filtration and erosion, as well as the interaction between these, can be studied. Thereby, visualisation experiments complement methods targeted at quantifying the mass flux leaving the sample. In this work, the movement of fine grains and the resulting change in the structure of the sample are studied. Common laboratory equipment is used to design a visualisation experiment. The acquired images are analysed using three different quantitative image analysis techniques, with the objective of gaining further insight into the mechanism of suffusion. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is an Eulerian method that is applied to determine velocity fields in fluid mechanics and granular flows. During suffusion, the velocity field is discontinuous; fine grains move whilst the coarse grains form a relatively fixed skeleton. This makes PIV less useful for the study of suffusion. To determine the displacement of individual particles, a Lagrangian method of particle tracking is considered. In the experimental setup used, fine grains are only tracked for a short length of time. This is due to both the large particle displacement between successive images, and the fact that other grains obscure the tracked particles from the camera. These difficulties can be remediated by improvement of the experimental procedure; the former by a higher acquisition rate, and the latter by use of a transparent granular medium where only the tracer particles are visible. With the apparatus used in this work, the temporal resolution is such that particle displacement cannot be studied unambiguously. Instead, a method of image subtraction (IS) is used that is geared towards quantifying the amount of material that moves. This yields data that can be interpreted to study both how much movement occurs, and where the movement occurs. Furthermore, IS is used to quantify the total change in the structure of the soil sample. Tests indicate that the load history plays an important role during suffusion. Erosion and filtration cause the soil structure to change, which has a direct effect on further particle transport in the sample. Therefore, the relation between three parameters: the number of moving particles, the location where they move, and the progression of the experiment, is key to understanding the process of suffusion. This is studied by plotting the movement in a 1D section of the sample over time. It can be concluded that visualisation experiments complement existing outflow experiments to study suffusion. The results of IS can be related to conceptual models that are currently used to describe erosion and filtration processes; these concepts are applicable also to the process of suffusion. Improvement of the experimental setup is required to establish whether the observations reported in this work have a general validity.","image analysis; suffusion; visualisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-02-03","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Geo-Engineering","","","",""
